Danny Aiello,"I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em
I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do

I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em
I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do

I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
Nobody but you
And make believe it came from you",I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter
Danny Aiello,"Be sure it's true when you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken

I love you, yes I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true
When you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie

When you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie",It's a Sin to Tell a Lie
Danny Aiello,"Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven
Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune's fallin', baby, all over the town
Be sure, be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you've got to have showers
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me",Pennies from Heaven
Danny Aiello,"You made me love you
I didn't wanna do it
I didn't wanna do it
You made me want you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes
You made me glad
But there were times
You made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for
I didn't wanna tell you
I didn't wanna tell you
I want some love
That's true, yes I do
'deed I do, you know I do
Gimmy, gimmy what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses
That I die for
You know you made me love you
Give me, give me what I cry for
You know you've got the brand of kisses
That I die for
You know you made me love you
",You Made Me Love You
Danny Aiello,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To
Danny Aiello,"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you 
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
 
A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
(You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer)

If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
You'll never know if you don't know now",You'll Never Know
Danny Avila,"If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
don't walk in circles or swim against the tide
sometimes things spin out of control

But love has a way of breaking your fall

praying is useless when you're out of control
nobody's asking to shadow your soul
give all you've got unconditionally

'Cause love has a way of breaking your fall",Breaking Your Fall [Sick Individuals Dub]
Danny Barker,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless (I'm in Love with You)
Danny Barker,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary
Danny Barker,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling
Danny Barrett,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love
Danny Barrett,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,
For the one I love,
Must come back to me.",I Cover the Waterfront
Danny Brown,"Sent ya bitch a dick pic and now she need glasses
Turn your bitch Slick Rick right now if I flashed it
Ate a couple pills took the bud out the plastic
Flicking bogey ashes bitch I stay blasted
Microphone Cassius, Magic with the sick shit
'posed to been dead but bitch I’m still up in this bitch
Verbal herbal poison, words I contortion
Fucked a pregnant bitch, she saved money on her abortion
I feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ
Covering Too Short, smoking a Newport
Hurt hope the drugs will help the pain to go away
But all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray
Step inside a mind that revolves around the rhyme
And every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines
Dying in the arms of a blond blue eyed 20 something
Don’t know her name but the paramedics chest pumping
30 something black male, OD'ed off of pills
That he wasn’t prescribed but they took his life
Left behind a daughter that doesn’t really even know him
Cause her momma thought he wouldn’t make a living off of poems
But it was a long journey on a rocky road
Had a hoody on and a jacket in the snow
Walking in the cold on the way to the studio
Nigga, that was just a couple years ago
Dropped a couple mixtapes on the net
And niggas tried to front like it wasn’t all that
But guess what bitch I’m coming back
Guess what bitch I’m coming back
Signed to Fool's Gold and everything’s all gnarly
Now these bitches want my number to get up in party
Came a long way from extension cords in the window
Borrowing neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo
Where the ovens never closed and stoves never off
Every winter so cold niggas sleeping wearing scarves
But I always tell myself that it's gonna get better
You know who you is, you the greatest rapper ever
So now the pressures on him to prove that voice right
Some people never know they goals, knew mine my whole life
So now his turn's up fixing up to bat
Pitching singles to the label when I use to pitch crack
I never learned to rap, always knew how
Ever since a nigga 8, knew what I would do now
When I turned 28 they like what you gonna do now
And now a nigga 30 So I don’t think ya'll heard me
That the last ten years I been so fucking stressed
Tears in my eyes let me get this off my chest
The thought of no success got a nigga chasing death
Doing all these drugs in hopes of OD’ing next, Triple X",30
Danny Brown,"Eating on an Adderall, wash it down with alcohol
Writing holy mackarel, actual all factual
Out for the capital, matador ya capsules
Hassle the bitch in a castle with the ill grapples
Tackled her asshole, my dick was like a lasso
Fucked her in her mouth she washed it down with Tabasco

You softer than Flanders' son
Don't make me put hands on son
Jump niggas like ""Fuck one on one.""
Used to be locked up watching One on One
Young Kyla Pratt was looking thick, nigga wanted some
But soon as I got out white bitches by the tons

I fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw
While you niggas got blue balls like a Avatar
Eating caviar in El Salvador
She running from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador
She a pregnant labrador
Said my metaphors are the highest caliber

I spit hard, you hallmark card poets
So many lines, you can bar code it
She like to lick it on the head then slow stroke it
Ocean in her panties and I'm 'bout to float through it
Rewind this and just smoke to it",Adderol Admiral
Danny Brown,"Kush got a nigga feeling awesome
Ate that bitch pussy 'til she squirted like a dolphin
Told her bend over, hit that shit doggy
Called her a cab then I told that bitch to call me
Danny Brown bitch, tell me what you need
I got some Adderall and fire ass weed
And they try to tell me I get too high
That's a lie if so bitch I woulda been died
But the flow OD, don't get cochesed, capiche?
Fuck with me, fuck around and be deceased
Rest in peace wack niggas with your oversized clothes
Complain about my jeans cause I'm taking all they hoes
Hold up, wait a minute
Your pussy ain't shit 'til you had some Danny in it
I'm gone off a Zanny nodding off watching menace
Rolling on some purple that my nigga call Grimmace
Bitch I ain't finish
These bars was test tubed in the lab with foreign chemist
Rolling testers on it but statistics got slumped
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

'Til my brain feels ten pounds heavier
You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica
Bitch give me brain for the hell of it
But to her it's heaven if she even gets a smell of it
That's why these bitches fuck with me
Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC
You get it? How about me and your girlfriend, you with it?
Money over everything the only thing that matter
And since I been getting it my been blunts getting fatter
Take a couple puffs off it now a nigga woozy
The white hoes I fuck with consider them whooties
We 'bout to make a movie, starring me and a cast full of groupies
And I do my own stunts, I'm smoking blunt after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt",Blunt After Blunt
Danny Brown,"Bruiser! That's my crew
Bruiser! But don't forget the brew
MGDs and Colt 45
But don't forget the Molson Ice

Bruiser! Thats my crew
Bruiser! But don't forget the brew
Coronas and Bud Ice
But don't forget the Miller High Life

But don't forget the Molson Ice

Bruiser Brigade bitch!
If you ain't pullin a nigga dick out and slapping yourself with it
Throwing this bitch in your mouth sucking dick with bubbles
Fucking all night and drinking protein shakes in the morning
Get the fuck outta here!

I don't give a fuck 'bout none of these ho ass niggas
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of these ho ass niggas
I'm drunk as fuck might fire on one of these niggas
We drunk as fuck we bout jump these niggas
Bruiser! That's my crew

Now we hurling in the bathroom, I need some help

Don't make me have to shoot a nigga
Bitch, it's Bruiser brigade
Bitch, it's Bruiser brigade

I need some brain, I think I lost mine
I'm higher than Swizz Beatz hairline
You always cake up then bake up, say what?
You rappers cuff and you fake as lace fronts
Dopehead hustle harder, niggas can't knock it
Super skinnies, loosies breaking in my back pocket
I slam a rapper head first like The Undertaker
Head butt your whole skull in, nigga fuck a hater
You soft as Elvin off the Cosby's
My niggas down to do a homi'
Bruiser Brigade and don't forget the brew
Styling on rappers since Northwestern High School
Calling me ahead of my time is an insult
I don't need a pencil this shit is all mental
You rappers are wack, mad as hell and you bored as fuck
I hit the stage grab the mic and do my Jordan shrug",Bruiser Brigade
Danny Brown,"The way these bitches on my cock
You'd swear it was 1985 and Teen Wolf just dropped
And my name was Michael J. Fox
But no bitch my name is Danny Brown I got some weed up in my sock
So bitch get high with ya nigga
The sack I got is looking some green caterpillars
But it smell like a skunk that's oh so defensive
These bitches suck my dick like it was moral incentive
Off the chain like broke nunchucks
Where little niggas try to shoot you over new chucks
A little dark like wet nubuck
Describes my state of mind is inside the tomb of King Tut
Murder all the time all we see
Detroit 187 on you niggas TV
I can first degree this beat, kill a nigga, no charges
Fuck a female MC and a Pop Artist
Ohh baby I like it raw

And My dick so big left stretch marks on her jaw
I'm so institutionalized
I wake up 6 AM because I think its chow time
Borderline porcupine
A step from drinking turpentine
Just to wash down a plate of wack rappers rhymes
I got a mind in the cosmos
And if these niggas cold then I guess I'm osmosis
That be blowing on some potent
That these white boys be growing
While you niggas smoking something smelling like tanning lotion
My concoctions could make world ending potions
These other rap niggas got lines I got encroachments
I got endorsements so muthafucka a cosign
Punch punchlines I'll punch rappers til your broke spine
Remember back in 09
I told em it was showtime
Now they pull they cam phones out when I go for mine
Light camera action
Hybrid be snapping
Cause the days of no tissue had to whip with wet napkins
Smear up the classifieds know it sound trife
But to be honest a metaphor for my life

Buzzin' off the barbiturates and amphetamines
Chase it with a 40 oz of Redi Clean
I swear I never ever smoke the better weed
Yo bitch said I'm the swaggiest nigga she ever seen
Run up in yo crib, Two K's, One Mag
Yo girl get snatched like Cool J in I'm Bad
Cost to live, you ain't made enough
Guarantee bullet holes with a laser touch
European garments drape my body if I ain't hipstered up
If she smile with eye contact then the bitch will fuck
Homie gone make me send them killers after him
Them niggas swing swords like World Fence Champions
You was poppin' pills and drinking liquor
Now you thinkin' you a gangsta killer
I leave you stankin' nigga
Laid down, face down like you taking a plankin picture
But I can keep the shots in the weapon
Put the bat to back of your leg
Grab your chin and the back of your head
And twist them shits in opposite directions",Detroit 187
Danny Brown,"Brown bless the mic like gesundheit
Bud 'bout the size of a bonsai, kick it like Muay Thai
Flow like sci-fi in high def
I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored
And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch is my target when I shoot my load
Bulls-eye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died from
Smoke something with your main bitch
Like Wyclef used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffing adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Tripping off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much it's a miracle I'm living

And I'mma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'mma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar

Bitch I wanna party like Chris Farley
Shot of Hennessy spike that with some molly
Tell mommy I'm sorry God bless my soul
But life is so sublime going out like Brad Nowell
I got that Kurt Cobain type of mind-frame
Feeling like Keith Moon shrooms in my dressing room
Basquiat freestyle
Feeling like Jimi Hendrix and Anna-Nicole mouth
River Phoenix '93 VIP
With some drugged up porn hoes all around me
Like Teri Diver, Linda Wong
All in hell having orgies where the horns grow long
Cause bitch I'm Frankie Lymon, Heath Ledger
Hyped up in a jacuzzi doing that John Belushi
With Brittany Murphy, we blowing hershey
I'mma die like a rockstar",Die Like a Rockstar
Danny Brown,"It's in my DNA cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my DNA cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way

Waking up, drooling on Versace pillowcases
And I'm smoking an eighth a day, I might end up a mental patient
Terry cloth bathrobes, blunts and ashtrays
White wine in flute glass, early morning Saturdays
Food plates and grape Ape, crepes and OJ
Bitches swimming topless in Chlorine off morphine
Emails on iPads don't answer when phone rings
Text message full coming down on four beans
Everynight like a bachelor party in Sin City
Bitches sniffing coke off each other titties with rolled 50s
Life I live like Charlie Sheen and Rick James
Goin hard until it ain't a dollar to my name
This that Triple X shit nigga, how ya feel?
Groupies like glam rock, poison logo pills
Sniffing a molly off amps blond haired tramps
When I'm on my way to the stage every night I rage

It's in my DNA cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my DNA cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way

Warhols all on the wall of the villa
Adderall popping got me jumping to ceiling
Perceived as a villian no sentiment in my sentence
For instance in instants they'll be calling forensics
If incidents occur remember these ain't just words
Go from talking shit to organs preserved
You soft serve rappers just hide behind your reverb
And even without effects you'll end up dessert
I research and homework, make you dig ya own dirt
On beats buried alive, ratting wiseguys
I'm with a latin bitch, fat ass, well porportioned thighs
And love to see it cumming so I squirt it in her eyes
I'm hopping out that new shit like narcs on Tuesday
The grill on it shiny like LL Cool J's
What's on my waist could make a nigga meet ya doomsday
To describe ya mixtape that shit was like a toothache

It's in my DNA cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my DNA cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
DNA, DNA cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way",DNA
Danny Brown,"I was born one day before Saint Pat
I guess a nigga miss luck just like that
Henry Ford, not even one mile from Motown
Explains all the soul that you hear in my sound
A ten minute ride to Linwood, I begun
My mama first son, look what I become
A weedhead with words that poking what I'm smoking
This ain't no Reggie cause the flame rise from Oakland
I used to play with pistols and crackhouses
Skiping school just to fuck bitches on dirty couches, abandoned houses
Find one with the lights on it
Landlord came pulled the hook and locks on it
Money I'm plotting on it I put the block on it
I'm gonna get it, fold deep, no shocks on it
We sit low, rep the D cause it's all I know
And my name rings bells in any hood you go

You're from the East Side
You're from the West Side
You're from the North End
Are you from South West

Around first grade, we move to the East Side
Was like throwing rocks at a beehive
A lot of niggas gone over something unimportant
That it ain't worth mentioning cause it's unfortunate
Like stick a fork in it, where's the enforcement?
Walking off the grass just to sit on niggas porches
Passing round 40's, brown paper bags
Rolling up a swisher while this rat freak a black
It ain't about nothing, but let me hold something
Ate a lunchable for dinner, nigga I'm ain't fronting
Caught the bus to East land, just to walk around it
Ain't buy nothing nigga, just walked around it
Looked at some hoes, I ain't even holler
Cause I'm broke as fuck and niggas all about a dollar
I'm living in the city where the weak get swallowed
Belly of the beast, we don't care about tommorow
I'm living in the city where the weak get swallowed
Belly of the beast, we don't care about tommorow

You're from the West Side
You're from the North End
Are you from South West",Ewnesw
Danny Brown,"When money talk only broke people listen
Ain't gotta pot to piss in can't afford to pay attention
These unfamiliar niggas be expecting recognition
Respect the intellect let me continue on the mission
I used to walk through alleys, paths in the field
You know that one house where Kenneth use to live
Now its just another shortcut to the store
The TV in the window drew the line of what was rich and poor
Mommy gave me food stamps told me buy wonder bread
On the way these niggas jumped me, left me wit knots on my head
Went to school yesterday and to had leave early
Cause niggas said they was gon' jump me at 3:30
All because I lived in the hood who they had beef with
And I ain't tell em, dog, I kept that shit a secret
But I can't really trip, niggas looked out for me
Them same niggas played me ain’t around to tell the story
I'm just young nigga on the D.O.T
With my headphones on and sack full of weed
Rhymes in my head thought nobody wanted to hear em
So I had the fiends hitting rocks like the Pilgrims

And where I live its house, field, field
Field field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

And where I live its house, field, field
Field field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

That nigga much sicker
Thats why he pop them pills, sip lean, smoke swishers
Yea I'm doing drugs thought I never ever try
That had my eyes so dry, dog I wish I could cry
I'm fucking bad foreign bitches while you in the hood
Smoking on some dirt weed smelling like some fire wood
Sitting on porches of abandoned houses
Or sitting in the field on bed bug ridden couches
It's like they all forgot man nobody care about us
That why we all ways end up in prison instead of college
Living in the system working kitchen for chump change
Lost in the streets niggas playing that gun game
Where nobody wins just a bunch of mommas losing
Dead body in the field, nobody heard the shooting
We living in the streets where the options is limited
Cause its burnt building instead of jobs and businesses

And where I live its house, field, field
Field field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

And where I live its house, field, field
Field field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field",Fields

Toes curling up while you grabbing on the sheets
While I'm spitting on that pussy real sloppy when I eat
Slobbing on that pussy after that I don't cuddle
I put that dick up on her make her sleep in the puddle
Bitch I ain't afraid, I eat it up in public
Feet on the windshield broad day fuck it

That give you niggas bronchitis, what you write is all vagina
What I write is Wall of China
Nigga that's great like eighths of Grape Ape
Getting stuffed in my suitcase
Ready to hit the studio and shit all on your mixtape
Nah, literally, shit all on your mixtape
Wipe with the credits, leave stains on the Jewel case
In just two takes, dog, the booth'll get souffléd
You're hiding something like a toupee
Truthfully, my friend, touché
You gon' get exposed like an up-and-coming model
And to me your label seems like one of them pageant mommas
So guess who's the little bitch? That's you
You must suck a lot of dick, that's true
I misuse with issues and pistols
Mind racing like Bristol heart of igloos
My nigga, you ain't been what I been through
And if so, you'd take a pencil through your temple
Cause I done served fiends on they menstrual
Ain't even have pads, stuffed they panties with tissue
Hit the ave cause they mouth ain't bleeding
And your style's like fried chicken without the seasoning
Nigga, that's bland fuck you up and ya mans
I smack you like a bitch, nigga, that's open-hand
Fuck you and your tough talk
When I monopolize I throw your ass off the boardwark
Fag, you ain't play sports but always at the ball park?
Type of nigga rocking Crocs at the fucking Walmart?
Drunk like Stallworth, riding in the fiend car
Get flicked, guess what? I'm running from this fiend car
I know a nigga dirty and got the hammer
But this kush got me high like Pac bandanna

I'm a smart nigga that do dumb shit
In your baby momma crib, not flushing after I piss
I'm Ferris Bueller with Frank Muellers, you blank shooters
On stank hooters, I'm in Aruba sipping wine cooler
Mind ruler, sort of like hypnotism
That's why these white bitches wanna get with him
I smack it, flip it, like Mike Bivins
But to me your flow's like Ronny DeVoe's
My hoes got toes in expensive high heels
Your hoes' toes is fucked--beauty supply sandals?
Handle any situation
I smoke blunts to the face to stay motivated
Irritated when I'm not sedated
Fuck her face like I was obligated
And still fucking with them freak hoes

Danny Brown,"Business cards from her attorney
Got probation cause the parents paid the money
Six months rehab, but she's back at it
Reflection stare at it, but she can't look at it!
She wiped out the debit card, owing on the credit
For student loans, they call her phone, but she don't sweat it!
Cocaine on counter tops, separate in lines
Every time she do it, she says this her last time
Chasing that high from the very first time
Back in her dorm room in 2009
Never thought this relationship would come this far
Rolled singles in her nose, I'm blade sniffing hard!
In night club stalls her and her friends sniff it all
Never sleep in random dude's apartments, missed calls
Unreplied texts from her boyfriend
Feeling like any second the world can end
And when it freeze her, it make her pussy wet
Face rushing, going numb, nipple hard on them breasts
Sniffing 'til it drip, back of the class, blood running down her lips!",Nosebleeds

I took me a capsule with no hassle
Now it's like I dip feathers of ink in a castle
A prodigy like bullets that hit your left clavicle
Melt sweat suits and paint the avenue
You have no clue like toy stores without board games
But when I paint pictures, I'm dipping brushes in war paint

I'm a mothafuckin' mothafucka
Fucking on your mother with two rubbers, I do fuck her
No cover just her booty on a pillow
Your bitch said my dick tastes like tropical fruit Skittles
I'm bumping Bill Withers, Swishers on Schwarzenegger
Matter fact, nah nigga, they on Boa Constrictors, they'll choke a nigga
These niggas ain't rappers, they mothafuckin' characters
Caught your baby momma horny then I stuck a carrot in her
Then you made a salad with her, ate isht for dinner
I don't want that skinny bitch look like that ho from Thinner
Swore she played soccer, she was real good with headers
Had me yelling ""Goal!"" while I was sitting on the dresser
Give the bitch a hat trick, smoking on the cat piss
I keep the bitch wet, around you she's a cactus

I got them Penis Psalms for your Vagina Monologues
Love a feminist bitch, oh, it get my dick hard
So no apologies for all the misogyny
I just want your company to come and watch some porn with me
My oral orchestration causes manipulation
The way these hoes be chasing though I had the tongue of Satan
But I just gave 'em dick to get more for conversation
Why you niggas tricking, giving your obligation
You safe havens, I'm Wes Craven with X cravings
Fuck a bitch mouth until her fucking face cave in
Hidden cams in her house, I caught her masturbating
Extorted her for the cash, now your ass paying
You Captin Save-Them-Ass, nigga

Made a sculpture of me but my dick was too thin
Painting pictures of me but they never get my chin
One writing scriptures bringing tears to the princess
Every time I indent, you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent, hanging on the every sentence
Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide
I'm the town hero cause my words give them pride
And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for 'em
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for
Leave them all astonished, ride with the birds
Make a grown man cry with shrimp on the words

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Had Virgin Mary doing lines in the pick-up
Make Sarah Palin deep-throat 'til she hiccup
Had T.D. Jakes round this bitch doing stick-ups
Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs

What's in the portfolio? Sicker than polio
Shit so personal, my mom can't listen to
Oh so original, nigga's extra-crispy
Bars so Bukowski, Soda Popinski
Little Macs could never be number one, your time's done
Bomb filling smelling like napalm, your day's gone
Langston Hughes with a blew fuse and a screw loose
Maya Angelou abused child with her notebook
Spitting like Kipling with a tooth missing
Tongue bring torture to men, women and children
Memoir's sacred, hid in the basement
Await my next piece at a formal engagement
Crowds walk for miles just to hear that sound
Start to get more power than the ones that wear crowns

Danny Brown,"Always wanna go
Always tell her yes, never tell her no
Know you think you know everything but don't
Wanna do the right thing but probably won't
So you chase the nightlife, blinded by the lights
Bottom of a empty glass, where you find life
Always left behind, because she think she right
Thinking that she grown she don't need your advice
And always in situation that she needs your help
But wouldn't help another only care her about herself
In your VIP asking where the drink at
Calling her a groupie you'd think she'd really think that
She just wanna hear that that ass look right
What you doing after this fuck tomorrow night
Wanna snort some blow, pop a lotta pills
Fucking when the sun come up she don't feel

She wanna party all the time, party all the time

Skip semester, class is a past
Say she going back but she ain't going back
Cause time ain't waiting for a future on hold
At glass tables on her knees sniffing coke
Tell her get a hold, grip on life
Rather fill her cup up liquor with no ice
Twice had an abortion, young, dumb misfortune
Rate that going she might be whoring
Signs she ignoring but doesn't recognize
Blind to what's occuring what's going on in your mind
Seven days a week, same shit every morning
Calling her a cab from different niggas apartment
Wanting her to change but she won't, dog
Just another number in her fucking call log
Lost in the fog, head in the smoke
Laughing at the world cause her life is a joke

Risks I take you'd swear I had the balls the size of bean bags

Bitches wanna scoop us, get pussy like loofahs
Y'all niggas losers cop clothes from the boosters
Hoes wanna choose up, of course they gon' choose us
So though you need a stylist also you need a tutor
These stupid-ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas, that's what they made you
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fails
Cause they don't care about music, just first week sales

So they say you need a hit, a chart toppin' single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash crowd banger, play it all night long
You never get on, without a radio song
So this my radio song, this my radio song

She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thang on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'mma make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk
Until it skeet skeet, on the walls and her shirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, cause bitch I ain't tricking
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch I ain't Puffy
Ice cream paint job, semi with the hemi
Heavy duty Chevy, not a Beamer, Benz or Bentley
There's no originality, carbon copy singles
He made Black and Yellow, I'mma make it black and emo

Piled up in a van wit a couple flashlights
This metal crowbars gonna get us through the door
We come to take everything fuck the landlord
So now we at the place skullys on bareface
Bout to leave this bitch bare and strip the whole place
My unc took outside he ripping down the gutters
So we inside tearing up this motherfucker
Bust open the walls just to get the wiring
Took the hot water tank and left over appliances
Aluminum siding and had to come back
Cause the furnace so big it wouldn't fit in the back

Now its copper by the pound
Wire by the inch

Fuck it, split it up ay I get more than that
These niggas always slick on that bullshit
Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit
Now we back in the hood plot the next lick
Got a school closed down and I think we should hit it
Just waiting on my unc to get back from the clinic
And we gone go over there and see whats up wit it
Now we up in it taking old computers
Until we fucking heard ""Don't move or I shoot ya.""

I'm in ya bitch mouth but she just fantasizing
Staring at my skinnys said it's so tantalizing
Dog I'm strategizing, plotting on throne
The masta of the ace sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger so I couldn't get tired
Imagining the equalizer goin from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
Sorta like Neo with the Matrix code
I try to escape it hoping drugs a numb a soul
Say I'm getting old and times running out
Repeating instrumentals tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house ain't slept in three days
Popping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze
Weaving kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks
Keepin' it original something that's overlooked
The way a nigga going might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up calling home for money on my books
Cause if this shit don't work, nigga I failed at life
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life
And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal
But too scared to do it so these pills will be the rifle
Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn
But can't go back now so now let that blunt burn
Cause now its my turn if I fuck it all up
Took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs

Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up

Rushing at a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga's sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, it's me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch

In the marijuana sky, but it started raining molly
It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself
Cause I don't know this bitch name but I'm feeling on her breast
I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care
A whole week done went past, I don't go nowhere
Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus
Daughter sending me messages saying ""Daddy, I miss you""
But in this condition I don't think she need to see me
Ain't slept in four days, and I'm smelling like seaweed
Problems in my past haunt my future and the present
Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings
Sent a couple G's but that make it no better
And now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled

It's time for me to clean it up
I came too far to fuck it up like

So rightfully that meant I had to be the man of things
And by 28, mom was damn near homeless
And now I'm 31 she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit
Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares
Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair
Cases had me locked up, mama always wrote me
Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me
That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags
Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week
For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care
I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there
I sent my mom some G's, but that makes it no better

Like Lieutenant Dan, I'm rolling, back to back, I keep on smoking
Eyes keep shaking and I can't stay focused
I'm fucked if you niggas ain't noticed
I'm sweating but I'm cold, mouth all dry but I got a runny nose
I just bought me a water bottle
Chug that down but I think I need me some more
And I keep feeling like I'm gon' faint, but fuck that nigga, pass me that drank
I done drunk too much, I might throw up in a hotel bathroom sink
Bitch, I'm wilding, I'm zooted, can't believe that I'm even moving
Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party, and I don't know what I'm doing

Now all these rappers talking 'bout that molly
Bet a million dollars these niggas ain't dipping
Pure MDMA, put it in a shot we talking 'bout crystals
Been dancing hard up all day, rest in peace to Mac Dre
Throw up the T, scratch on my face, do the Thizzle dance up in the place
I'm grinding on your bitch while I'm grinding on my teeth
Don't give a flying fuck, so right now you don't want beef

She licked it off my index, before that she been wet
Now she licking on her best friend while they suck me watching sunset
That's right bitch we ain't done yet, lifting up her sundress
It kicked in she licking, before I blink she undressed
Molly making her feel good, it's a feeling she can't explain
But obvious we got some problems, so bitch, let's kill that pain

Danny Brown,"Trail of blood on that baggie
I done scraped myself with that razor
Gettin' head in that trick house and I snuck out without payin' her
Locked up in that precinct used my Timberland for a pillow
Break the dank in that swizzle ridin' round in a dope fiend rental
Pulling up on ya baby mama like bitch what you tryna get into
If you ain't about that suckin', then ho you can keep on trucking
I'm gettin' mine straight up no middle man nigga I don't like you
Fool's Gold the clique and musically we don't fuck with you
Went from holdin' crack in my ass crack
To racks on racks on ASCAP
Coulda rhymed ASCAP with ass capped
Jadakiss already said that
Do it for the days when for dinner
All a nigga had to eat was a couple of coneys
Broke as fuck and no bitch to fuck
In my basement jackin' off lonely
Used to fall off fuckin' with the work
But guess what? I'm back on ho
No more ? on that couch
Now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth
And I gag her till she cry
On her stomach fluid come up
I be fuckin' her face on the daily
You be kissin' that bitch in the mouth

Like open wide ho!
Open wide ho!
Open wide ho!
Open wide ho!

If I tell a bitch to do a flip in the air
Then land on my dick from the back
Look I ain't trippin', no, I ain't kiddin'
Have her lickin' my head like a cat
Now shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose
Come and let a young real nigga cut
But nah bitch this dick ain't free
So she copped my dick and then cuffed
Now come here chick and let me feed you nuts
Cum on her ass and have her lyin' in it
How her mouth can be wide as her legs
My dick is long as the Brooklyn bridge
Hit it raw cause I'm with the shit
Gave her the pipe said she need a fix
Gave you life, can't believe the sight
Take the wood like a termite
Made a crash up at the turnpike
But it's a rental I'll get another
Wonder if you got the gift from your mother
I used to play hoops with your brother
Even played a lil' house with your sister
She always call me daddy or mister mister
Why the ? shirts can do more than fist her
Bitch gettin' head, I ain't never kissed her
B I G never missed a beat
I was ? so I skeet skeet
Ho can make an orgasm last a week
I'mma get her deep, she a masterpiece
Hell no I don't love that bitch
Hell yeah I'm gon' enjoy that bitch
But I hope my daughter don't be like this
But I know her mama know that shit exist

Like open wide ho!
Open wide ho!",Dope Fiend Rental
Danny Brown,"I was thinkin' 'bout somethin'
But I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Remember when I was strugglin'
Fucked up on my knuckles
Tryin' to sell some dirt weed
Taxin' off a ten speed
Money wasn't comin'
For sure nigga I kept frontin'

I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, gettin' paper any way

And I kept lickin' on that clit
Till she gave me that shit
I've been fucked up for so long
Swear to God I gotta get it
I put my back into it
Servin' bags to them students
Tell 'em I got that fire
On that porch right there by the Buick
I'm just tryin' to get my mind
Go worry nigga 'bout yours
Rollin' up that swisher
Pourin' up a four
Servin' in them hallways
The courtrooms all day
Hoods kicked the door down
Now we in the Coney

I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, gettin' paper any way

It's the same old shit
Everybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up
It's killin' me
Niggas wanna get rid of me
Cause I lyrically bust on the riddim
Fill the room with humidity
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm bangin' out
Doubling my money gettin' my hustle in Canning Town
Listen up Danny Brown
I been doing this thing
Skipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em (WOO!)
I had my dubs on the step
I never stopped cause I sit in the booth
Flipping the truth, while you're running and chatting
Thinking you're realer than Scru
You ain't so why you act, dummy
You think you bad, well that's funny
I'm try'na get Maybach money
I'm a Mac Miller, spittin' ASAP, rookie

I had them dubs on the step",Dubstep
Danny Brown,"Backwood of that good to the pain for the brain
A cup of lean for me to sleep, see I be going through thangs
Music business got me stressed Xanax to maintain
Waking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain
Vicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle
Remember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers
And now I, got the whole world listening
Give your ear for a second a life changing decision
Every other minute thoughts run through my mind
'bout how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time
So I'm trapped in the beat, stuck on every line
Nothing else matters, except my next rhyme
You can never understand all the pressure I'm against
Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit

Might have a mental breakdown
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on

I float on
Let's go, hop up in the Chevy four-door, let's roll

Remember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread
And niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head
It's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim
And to beat your enemy, you gotta think like them
So I was up late breaking day with the gremlins
Music in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen
Hood outta bye-bye cause rap shit was sci-fi
So I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes
Can't get a wink 'less I'm leaning off of syrup
Dreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up
Staring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away
Until the verse is done wrote all day but them shit's throwaway
So I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing
And not for the money for the life after dying
Pray I get old just to hear I been the future
Just to see my influence in this genre of music

And might make it to see somehow
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on, nigga I float on

I float on
Let's go, hop up in the Chevy four-door, let's roll",Float On
Danny Brown,"I know some lil' niggas that thirst cream
That pop a bitch on camera and we ain't talkin' bout twerk team
Shootin' up cribs turnin' porches to smokescreens
Mama smoking nightmares chasin' her pipe dream
Hard to give advice behind the mind of the call
So his limits have ceilings cause his pop behind walls
School become a free meal
Streets become a cheap thrill
Same prices pa paid he gon' pay a cheap deal
Hourglasss empty but he lookin' for a refill
Revolver breakdancin, yeah he make that bitch windmill
Guess he's just a psycho in the city in the Chrysler
Everybody livin' spiteful nigga lookin' just to ice you
So we livin' hostile just to cop some Aeropostale
Trenchcoat Mafia, for a lil' Hollister
Gotta get his dollas up
So we hit the dice game
Lost all his re-up, now he rob the dice game
Probation violation call his ass the son of Satan
Got these old niggas scared like it's crystal lake and Jason
Cause they been through cases they ain't tryna go back
Fresh meat up on the street he give a fuck about that
Snatchin' Carti's downtown wear 'em same damn week
Tryna get the same bitches on the same damn street
Rob a ho ass nigga at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
Cause they gremlins

He just wanna smoke some kush
And fuck with some hoes at the mall
For that shit, he wished it all
Baby face and all, my lil' nigga gotta ball, lil' nigga gotta ball
Run up on you where that money at
Fuck nigga after that
Lean in that double cup
Lil nigga screwed up
Pop a pill nigga
And he don' feel nigga
You do it in the song, he do it for real nigga
And all his OGs is either dead or in prison
Scared to talk to him like, fuck it they won't listen
Unnecessary shit, thinkin' that he has to
A pair of True Religions dog, my lil' nigga blast you
Listenin' to 2 Chainz, ain't thinkin' bout college
I wonder if he knew that 2 Chainz went to college
I wonder if he knew that, would that change his mind?
Guess that's somethin' we'll find in due time",Gremlins
Danny Brown,"Check!
I will eat on them pajamas
Bite all on it like piranha
When it comes to that vagina
Baby girl you could be my diner
Just lean back, and get it
Won't stop licking til you tell me quit
Let me suck on that clit while you follow my head
Baby girl I know you're with it, ball with me
Fall back on that outfit or something
And I love your thighs I can't deny
Work it like Twerk team and I think my dick want to be the sound
Rolling balls til' my dick hard, didn't say heard like a missed call
I don't really look like I'm trying to fuck and I probably won't care about her tomorrow
Dammit ho, what you trying to do ""pour a deuce lets get chopped and screwed""
Fools gold, and you know, and Balmain mark down the shit
Smoking on that freeze, nigga
Got a nigga, amnesia nigga
Comatose and I need a dose
Wanna get behind that ass you got
Dipping to that Diplo
Throw it right when they play tonight
Looking right, thinking of dimes and I think I am gon' fuck her tonight
She lookin' ready to go, and fosho ain’t gon stop
With her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall

Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand
(Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga)
Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand
(Shake that ass for a hipster nigga)

Hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall
When her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall

Let me see what you're working with
Don't stop girl keep twerkin' it
I'm watching you and I'm wondering if you could do that with my dick in it
She throw it back like a fire ball
Hit it up, order like a house call
Want to eat the cat, be from the back, then give that ho a mouthful
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't care when they rolling
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't feel when we rolling
Pop the pussy on hand stand, record that on my Handycam
That uncut, ludicrous
Feel that monkey I go Orangutan
You ain't met a nigga like this before
Eat it from the back, suck on ya toes
The way I put my mouth on in, that pussy was under a mistletoe
Throw it back to that A-Trak, one hour to that Baauer
Now she got my dick hard, and I want to fuck her in the shower
Looking ready to go, oh fo' sho' i ain't go soft
Got her hands on floor, and her feet on the wall

Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand
(Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga)
Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand

Danny Brown,"Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down
In an elevator at 90 miles an hour
And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
My forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't goin' make it
Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm trippin', I'm slippin', feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
And I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smellin' like rose petals
Zoning out, two-three like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma and my brain going on vacation

Get fly, my niggas, dope looks
So many numbers in my phone book
I could start a motherfucking phone book
Know all the fly bitches gonna look
Like I'm on something, tell 'em roll something
I'm that one nigga, bumping two pots
Be like three hoes, that's a foursome
Fuck niggas always want to hold something
Young hot nigga done froze on 'em
Went cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em
And clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?
Only fear God, never sold on Him
Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him
Life's a bitch, but she chose on him
Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em
In big shades, fuck the hypocrites, die
Time let the tats, for the tick, tock
Clocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch
Pause, let it stop, hope we get by
Bye when I zoom, let it vroom
'Bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it [?]
A hundred miles an hour on the booth, better let it loose
A hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms
That's real rap, I'm stating facts
Contradictions, can't take it back
Mommy's stripping, make it clap
In a kush coma, finna take a nap
I'm out

Knowing goddamn well when the high go away
Same shit gon' be still in my way
I'm a slave to the sticky icky
So nigga roll somethin wit me
Been smoking blunts since high school
Now look at all the bullshit I been through
Wanna pass out, but we stayin up
Nigga gotta keep one eye open
Cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn
Nigga roll up, then we starting smoking
I'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos
Sippin' on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo
Dipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley
Tell your baby mama sorry, that was one night and please don't call me

Hipster by heart but I can tell you how the streets feel
Everybody thirsty and they looking for a refill
If the gang eatin, guns barking at your doggie bag
Get took out for your take out now you carry out
Murder by delivery, married at the paramount
I just coughed up a fair amount
Of niggas might air it out
Judge a book by cover so we never educated
It ain't about racists poor and rich segregated
Just to get the bacon dawg, you gotta go HAM
Use to be lost til I found who I am
But it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands
Locked tryna get real creative with the spam
Locked in a jam cause a nigga serve butter
Just to get a little bread had to keep tomato smothered
All I really wanted was to overdub my vocals
But no one ever thought that I would take it past local
High a'top a totem man somebody shoulda' told 'em
That if money grow on trees being rich is dime a dozen

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self
I don't need your help homie
Cause don't nobody really know me
Said nobody really know me

See that's going on a limb
And I used to sell trees, and I used to rock Timbs
Radiohead shit, fiends with The Bends
Back when Granny used to tell me ""Stay Out of In""
Blaming cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts
Gone for three days and nobody ever heard about
How I got these Jordan's, but that ain't too important
When I got a bitch pregnant and I'm stacking for abortion
And all I really wanted was to give myself a portion
Lit up off the Henney got a nigga self absorbing
Smoking on a bogie, no bud style, who can I trust now?
Lady snitch and got the whole block down
Now we gon' eat now, no rebound, when your boxed out
Belly of the beast now
Now you got me feeling trapped and I can't look back
When the roller head is out and the Pabst is made of ash
And I'm going through the trash tryna' find a little treasure
Living for the better tryna get myself together

So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self
I don't need your help homie

I said nobody really know me",Lonely

I write all night til the sun comes up
Dodging texts from yo sista tryna lick on my nuts
Cobra clutch the game, put that bitch into submission
Yo bitch want the stick shift, no transmission
Dawg, I'm on a mission, you're playing exhibition
On an expedition, poppin' X but never trippin'
Chillin' with a vixen, tryna stick my dick in
Red head ho, like a young Kathy Griffin
Smoked too many blunts, I can hear my lungs whistlin'
Still rollin' up, ho smellin' like chicken
Rap Martin Lawrence, all you other rappers boring
Bruiser make 2 Live Crew look like some mormons
Nigga my essay is hard like a life-doin' ese
Gang banging on the yard with a home made machete
The nicest cassette tapes, stay smokin' heavy
Popped a couple pills, eye's glowing like Belly
Used to stash the cracks in the seams of my Pelle
Detroit nigga, but I'm smokin' on LA

And is anybody nervous?
I'm red to go
I said I'm red to go

Tired of where I came from but know where I'm goin'
Tears in my eyes cause I'm smokin' on an onion
Aroma on that 'etra scary and McNairy
Off of moon rocks in Barcelona poppin' cherries
Blowjobs from model twins
Doin' drugs with acronyms
So many lines thought this shit was bush garden
Party startin' monster with the hair like Blanka
Hotel room like a hair metal concert
This blonde made the dick do the spring on ?
You disrespect I hit you with the slap of Tatanka
Remember nigga used to eat shit that didn't match
Like cornbeef hash and some fuckin' Apple Jacks
Used to bag up the packs at ? every night
Bologna all night, with no peanut butter, couldn't waste it on the mic
So I waste every night, everything came with rice
And I knew I wouldn't write
So I got my ass up, fuck dependin' on luck
Greyhound to NY bout 300 bucks
Kept my hopes up but my confidence was low
Now my self esteem is astral
Lookin' at this cash flow

Did it my way, I ain't nobody ho
I'm bout to pimp the rap game
Bitch I'm red to go

Done rose out them ashes, drinking Fiji water
Wanna pull me in that fire when I'm tryna feed my daughter
Wanna snatch my mommas plate, and tell her she can't eat
And we gone have us some discrepancies right here in this skreet
Because the weak don't speak, get left in silence
And when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence
And duct tape the grandmama, strip a man of all his honor
Out here tryna be a G, now you wish you a goner
I walk with the Gods with the tongues of the devil
Tryna keep a nigga thirsty so for rain I pray mercy

The return of the gangsta 'cause niggas don't believe
I roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street
The return of the gangster cause niggas got bills
This rap shit don't work then its back to selling krills
Return of the gangster cause niggas want that real
Want that old Danny Brown but nigga I'm like chill
Return of the gangster fucked that hipster squeeze the trigger
You got me fucked up I'm a hood ass nigga

Eastside niggas keep roaches in the ashtray
Twenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day
Drop it in the pot, if it ain't lockin' that's some bad yay
Tryna save my soul I wish the lord would meet me half way
Devil on my shoulder as I'm whipping up this yola
And that motor hit the rotor ship this blow to Minnesota
Only option is a shoot out if the police pull me over
This shit get real as shit thats on your Playstation controller
Call of Duty ass nigga, dick in the booty ass nigga
Don't po' up roll no dough up and I don't get no cash witcha

Homie mommy's 50, smokin' and still tricking'
Still talkin' shit with this Lucy I’m ass lickin'
See my breath when I talk, but nigga, I ain't trippin'
Landlord is, the nigga tryna put us out
Sellin' all the samples, can't afford to give 'em out
Just copped a half track, see my nigga tryna get it
Standin' on the baseline, Scottie Pippen pivot
Needles in they arms just to keep the lights on
Shit, fuck around, be on hardcore pawn
Tryna get this shit off, the winter, we snuck in
Won't live for anything, but might die for nothin'

They want that old Danny Brown
To bag up and sell a whole pound
Might have to go and get my braids back
Matter of fact, go and bring them AKs back

Young boys'll shoot your face for them Cartiers
Came a long way takin' $3 for a nick'
Cop an 8 ball, tryna stack for the zip
Now I'm in the rap game, verse worth a brick
Fiends linin' up for a hit of this shit

Danny Brown,"31 years old so I done been through all that dizz-irt
Came up off the porch straight serving off the cizzurb
Long time ago, I don't do that shit no mo'
This the last time I'mma tell you, wanna hear it?
(Here it goes!)
It was me and Baby James
With an ounce to our name
Rollin' up to all the dimes, same clothes from yesterday
Had a smoke around a custo, paid his ass a stone
When the narcs came and raided hid on the roof and smoked bong
Fuck with rap bitches
Head from 'em hunnids'
Lost a sack but I got back cause the dice game was hittin'
It was me and Carbo breakin' day in the lobby
Nigga puffin' old dope sellin' rocks as a hobby
Bankroll in my pocket so everybody know me
Went home and gave my mama three hundred for some groceries
We hit the mall and ball
Hit the club and spend it all
Now I'm back to Square A
With them squares to get off

Dope Song (My last)

Crackhead Lisa
She used to be thick
Had sex with a trick, and now she sick
She offer you some head if you give her some drugs
Just make sure you when you hit it you better wear a glove
I'm sick of all these niggas with their ten year old story
You ain't doin' that mo', nigga lyin' to the shorty
So take this as a diss song, cause this is my last song
Not my last dope song, but my last dope song

A-Trak, what up?

Drop a deuce in that soda
Tell your ho to come over
Coming straight out that Motor
Sipping oil never sober
Bring backwoods of that OG, we smoking them back-to-back
Molly looking like sugar, so you know that I'm dipping it
See my jeans by the stack, and my shoes cost 'bout half of that
Let's not talk 'bout the shirt
She can't even pronounce that
Ghetto nigga on high end
My theory is low end
My tribe on a quest, put that money in motion
So bitch, we smoking and drink

My ho got tats on her face
Sell me them cookies from Oakland
But not the kind that you eat, stuff it in Swisher Sweets
And we smoke blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt

Gotta get away, get away, I think I need to pray
Please oh Lord, oh Lord, I need your help again
Took too many pills, and I think I hear my heart beating
Taking over those chances, honey backwoods stuffed with that grammy
My ho blowing that powder, mixing liquor with them xannies
Stress party, get away, hope that these problems just go away
Right there in my face, I ignore it every day

Danny Brown,"Remember one time, dawg, this fiend owed the boss
Put Peanut Butter on her pussy, let his pits lick it off
Back when I was living on Flanders
Seen another dope fiend beat another with a hammer
Remember at the park, seen a nigga at a payphone
Got rocked in his dome, momma picked me up and ran home
Was like fucking seven years old
When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove
Damn near burned his top lip off, so my mind ticked off
Desensitized to a lotta things, mind would drift off
Wish it was what I seen on tv, I snapped outta that
Unc' beating on my auntie
Gunshots outside was sorta like fireworks
We know they ain't fireworks, its December 21'st
Cold winter with a kerosene heater on the couch so cold
Can't take off your sneakers

And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen
Nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen
Nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen

I feel like a prisoner of war
Reacting sporadically to what the mind absorb
Probably need a shrink, can't get a wink
So I smoke a lot of kush and pop a Xanax to sleep
Close my eyes, look up, fiend said 1 for 8
Can tell that I scared him by the look on my face
Reached in my pocket served him nervous as a surgeon
Can't believe where I'm at 'pose be writin' verses
Heard a knock at the do', 'Nother fiend wanted fo'
Gave him what he came for, told him go to the sto'
Lemme get a box a box of Swishers, Faygo Cola
Gave his ass another stone now guess what it's over
He ain't come back, before I could look back
I heard the wood on the door crack, and they yelling police
With this work up in my jeans man this a bad dream

And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen
Nigga, it's torture

All the shit that I've seen

Danny Brown,"On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread

Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
Said go get some bread and a pop and come back
Walk out the door first thing I see
A dope fiend standing there looking at me
Standing right there in front of the porch
With a pipe in his hand and the other a torch
I kept on moving ain't worried bout that
But a block later heard ""rat-tat-tat-tat""
Next, some niggas from over there shootin'
Dog I ain't blinked just kept it a-movin'
Block later up: What do I find?
A junkie ho, I laughed at her cryin'
Flaggin' up cars, gettin' her bread
Guess what I seen on the way to get bread

On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread

To go get some bread and a pop and come back
Get to the store, first thing I see
An Arab dude just starin' at me
Lookin' at me like I'm bout to steal
But really though dog, you need to go chill
Grabbed what I needed, left out the do'
Two little boys in front of the sto'
Fiends runnin' up, runnin' through alleys
I kept on movin' nobody looked at me
Course some niggas stomped on my head
All because they wanted the bread

Think I’m hearing voices
Paranoid and think I’m seeing ghost-es, oh shit
Phone keep ringing but I cut that shit off
Only time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off
Had a threesome last night, ain’t matter what it cost
Couldn’t it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft
Had to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed
Been grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw
Nothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring

Thinking irrational, I have no emotions

Freezing on the snow, brain feel a bit frostbit

Now I'm on a tour bus
Going places I ain't never been
Wrote my rhymes down on a paper bag
That was way back
Having dreams of a Cadillac
Dog, I had to bounce back

Now I'm on the Jack in the county
Asking mommy for some money
Swear to God she'd do anything for me
Now we out the hood and the nightmare is us going back

What it takes if you want anything
Got me missing sleep 'cause my mind on the beat
So while I'm counting bars y'all be counting sheep
No cheat sheet, get it out the mud
Get it how you live, why I'm out here in the field
My nigga wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes
It's a cold, cold world but even hotter when you die
So no try to do, what about you?
Work off, well met, do the same thing too
A lot locked up wishing they was like you
Got a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June
Been down for a minute and every since sentence
Things ain't been the same so I'm missing my nigga
Staring at the ceiling thinking how far I came
Was trapped in the storm but I made it out the rain

When I look
I cannot see
Reflection in the mirror
Broke bread with the Judas
And I think I see it clearer
These niggas want what’s mine
But I be damn if I’m a give up
Stuck up in the hood
Praying rap would get me out
Momma ‘bout to lose her house
Gotta figure this shit out
Use to catch the bus to 12th
Just to hustle for some Prada
In the kitchen with my uncle
Beat the pot like a piñata
Baraka wit the product
Use to hide it in my closet
Type of shit
That have a fiend
Crawling on his carpet
Walking over carcasses
Of artists in my garden
Nice with the bars
Even the beat begs my pardon
Got me mistaken
Muslim salami bacon
Always on the defense
So it’s no offense taken
I’m smoking on them raisins
From the bay they taste amazing
Cajun kicking flavor
All the time
Not on occasion
Would be amazed
All the time I heard I wouldn’t make it
I was writing shit that was so damn amazing
When half these little niggas was still watching
That’s so raven
I was out there hustling
Scraping up and saving
Just to catch a 12 hour bus to NY
Sleeping on the floor in studios
Asking God why
But never got deterred
From the voice I heard inside
Tell myself everyday
The greatest that’s alive

And I'm a give em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
Unless death come first
My nigga
I’m a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell

Cause we living in that
Actavis double cups was addicted to that
Had them demons on my back
Was escaping through that
Blamed everybody but myself
Apologies for that
So they hold a nigga back
For the way that I act
People scared of doing business
Thinking I smoke crack
I react immature
To anyone talking smack
Cause where I'm from respect
The only thing that you have
Grew up virtually poor
Realities unmasked
So my task
Is inspire your future with my past
I lived through that shit
So you don’t have to go through it
Stepping stones in my life
Hot coals
Walk with me
Listen when I speak
Every time talk with me
Couple screws loose
You don't wanna start
With me
Got it from Motown
Feel David Ruffin pain
Wanna cry right now            
So I’m wishing that it rain
Cause I’m knowing I’m the best
They compare skills to sales
Tell myself everyday
Know this shit ain’t real
Radio don’t make you ill
They get a hit a they feel they self
Respect for lyricism
In this game ain’t none left
Have a bitch like Iggy
Think she sicker than me
And that’s so fucked up
That’s just how this shit be
I just wanna make music
Fuck being a celebrity
Cause these songs that I write
Leave behind my legacy

And I'm a give em hell for it
Until it's heaven on earth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
Unless death come first
My nigga
I'm a give em hell for it
For whatever it’s worth

Danny Brown,"I’m like Kubrick
With 2 bricks
And hoes on the strip
Off a 2 piece
A toothpick I flick
And I preach
Bout how I’m a get this money out here up in the streets
In the Caddy Ron Isley on between in the sheets
And a way a nigga work make a grip in a week
I’m a chill with this freak
Sniff a gram and a half
Plus her pussy juicier than Shalamar curl bag
While she draw me a bath
Roll a blunt then passed
Giggled and jiggled her booty
Couldn’t do nothing but laugh
Credit cards separating
White lines on a mirror
Roll a 100 dollar bill
Now my sinus all clearer
Flat screen porn on
Watching Asa Akira
Nothing on but my pinky ring
Sniff when I get up
On the balcony drunk
Like the world is mine
Staggering inside with my robe untied

So fuck waiting round
Nigga I’m about to get it
Dog I’m tryna eat
So I’m staying in the kitchen
Hunched over the stove
Gotta water water whip it
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring
Packing up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping
Lost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping
Lost on the sauce but a nigga ain’t flipping
Cutting up the hard like the yard ain’t filling

I'm like Spielberg
With ill words and hoes on that curb
Gotta screw loose
I'm cuckoo
Mentally disturbed
But still smart enough
To hit this bitch wit a rubber
And with ya wrinkle pussy
Hoe can’t be ya lover
But I still get the head
If you swallow with bubbles
I'm a Linwood nigga I done traveled the world
Made a name for myself use to serve on the curb
Now my words worth a bird
I could front you a zip
Made a million in a year and I still ain’t trip
Bout to put my niggas on make a million for them
Show you that you can make it without acting like them
Do you lil nigga go out there and just get it
Gotta have a hardback
Because these niggas gon’ whip it
Do you lil nigga get up out there get it

Cannot tell me nothin'
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it while we cha-cha, but on 24's
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her on my schedule
Rolling up them vegetables
Rapping with that special flow
Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll a 4
Now a nigga livin' good

Still wicked as Aleister Crowley, niggas know me well
For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch
To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want
The Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)
Givenchy bikers with the Raf rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good

Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life can end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The Revenant, the all day madness
Got it off to wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then tipped all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Aye, look what I ain't doin'
Aye, ridin' in foreigns
Aye, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh

So I could pop in the clutch

And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect and gettin' checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never passed my mama no blunt, it kept my head straight
Less than deadweight, never been a problem to dump
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as the spliffs my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sit, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts

Feeling like I got money
Know I'm just nigga rich
Even if she fuck me
I still know life a bitch
Bought a nightmare, sold a dream
Happiness went upstream
Blame myself, I had no control
Now I'm living with no soul
I'm on a road that never ends
Don't know opposite of sin
Some people say I think too much
I don't think they think enough
Time rough but it got rougher
Weight heavier up on my shoulders
Living crooked 'til it's over
Can't be straight, can't be sober
Thought process so immature
Can't make it up, up out the sewer
Feeling like there's no hope
Blaze dope, my mind float
I love her, she love me
Love ain't enough with no bucks
Fucked up, that's the way it is
I don't know who I should trust
Riding around with the windows up
Smoking like it's ten of us

With the driver bumping them Isleys
I'm walking on this long road
Will I come back?

Living lies but can't hide
Deep inside, the truth dies
Bought hope, can't get change
Lost my brain, going insane
Self-medicate is how I cope
Leave my body, soul go afloat
On a roll that never ends
Don't know where I should begin
Feeling trapped, no looking back
Head first in that deep end
Living like a rolling stone
When I die, I leave alone
Getting high, I feel low
But we all know life goes on

Taking turns catching sales things copacetic
Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'

A rainy night in Georgia

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

Danny Davis,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Some of these days you're gonna want me only,
You'll miss my love and miss my kiss,
You're gonna miss your little daddy when he goes away!

Oh, when I'm leaving, there's no doubt your heart'll be grieving;
You're gonna miss your daddy, mama, some of these days.

Danny Elfman,"Ooohhhh...

Life's been so good to me,
Has it been good to you?
Has it been everything
That you expected it to be?
Was it as good for you
As it was good for me?
And was it everything
That it was all set up to be?

Now is that gratitude?
Ooohhh...

Now is that gratitude?
Or is it really love?
Some kind of reality 
That fits just like a glove?
Now is that gratitude 
For everything I've done?
Or is it something else 
That's got me on the run...?

In the middle of a big tornado,
On the tip of everyone's tongue...
In the belly of a giant whale,
All the girls just want to have fun.
In the look of a frightened neighbor,
In a big warm bed at night,
In a broken elevator,
In the teeth of a dog that bites.
In the middle of a revolution,
In the look of a child's face,
In the silence of the dinner table,
In the stillness of disgrace.

Now is that gratitude?  (...gratitude...)
Now is that gratitude?  (...gratitude...)
Now is that gratitude?  (...gratitude...)
Now is that gratitude?  (...gratitude...)

But when I think of you,
And what you've done to me,
You took away my hope...
You took away my fantasy...
I once had lots of pride,
The world was in my hands.
I lived way at the top,
Of castles made of sand.

Oooohhhh... 
I dream of you sometimes. 
Oooohhhh... 
I dream of you sometimes.

Danny Elfman,"Every time I see you now it makes me feel so bad
Reminds me of the memories I wish I never had
Standing in a crowded room too dark for me to see
Someone's pushing from behind, just leave me room to
breathe

And go away from me, just go away
To another time, another place
To another world, another dream
Go away from me

Walking down the sidewalk in a crowd that doesn't care
Bumping into shoulders every eye is on the street
There's a man with tattered clothes who's cursing at
the air
Everyone is slowing down to catch a little peak

And go away from me, just go away
To another time, another place
To another world, another dream
Go away from me

Every time I wake up and I see myself again
Staring in the mirror like a burnt out piece of wood
Searching every feature for a single trace of life
Couldn't find the answer 'cause the mirror never lies

And go away from me, just go away
To another time, another place
To another world, another dream
Go away from me",Go Away

Danny Elfman,"There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm a master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears",Jack's Lament
Danny Elfman,"[CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN]

Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There are so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

Something's here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hmm...

I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on

Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it

You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Hee,hee,hee
Eureka! I've got it",Jack's Obsession
Danny Elfman,"Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws
I wanna do it
Let's draw straws
Jack said, ""We should work together""
Three of a kind
Birds of a feather
Now and forever
Wheeee
(La, la, la
La, la, la)

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

First, we're goin' to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

Wait, I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'II be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare, wheee

I say that we take a cannon, aim it at his door
And then knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

Yes you're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then, see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
Is the meanest guy around
If I were on his boogie list
I'd get out of town

He'II be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew

We're his little henchmen and
We take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
I'm not the dumb one
You're no fun
Shut up
Make me
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see

We'II send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until' his curiosity
Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what
Makes him tick

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie
Is sure to get his kicks

Kidnap the sandy claws
See what we will see
Lock him in a cage
And then throw away the key",Kidnap the Sandy Claws

It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen

I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream

But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist

Let's try it at once

[JACK]
Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want

And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
And sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
Though they don't understand

What have I done?
How could I be so blind?
All is lost, where was I?

Find a deep cave to hide in
In a million years they'll find me
Only dust and a plaque

But I never intended all this madness, never
And nobody really understood, how could they?
That all I ever wanted was to bring them something great
Why does nothing ever turn out like it should?

Well, what the heck, I went and did my best
And, by God, I really tasted something swell
And for a moment, why, I even touched the sky
And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did

And for the first time since I don't remember when
I felt just like my aold bony self again

Danny Elfman,"Hey! Give me a listen you corpses of cheer
At least those of you who still got an ear
I'll tell you a story that'll make a skeleton cry
Of our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (that's right)
Yeah yeah yeah

Well our girl is a beauty known for miles around
When a mysterious stranger came into town
He's plenty good-looking, but down on his cash
And our poor little baby, she fell hard and fast
When her daddy said no, she just couldn't cope
So our lovers came up with a plan to elope

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day

Yeah. Like it.
Okay, Chancy, take it.
Yeah. Yeah! That's nice
Yeah!

So they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
They told not a soul, kept the whole thing tight
Now, her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
You don't need much when you're really in love
Except for a few things, or some told
Like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
Then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
On a dark foggy night at a quarter to three
She was ready to go, but where was he?

And then?

She waited

And then?

There in the shadows, was it her man?

And then?

Her little heart beat so loud

And then?

And then baby, everything went black

Now when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
Her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
So she made a vow lying under that tree
That she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
Always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
When out of the blue comes this groovy young man
Who vows forever to be by her side
And that's the story of our own corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day",Remains Of The Day

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love
Danny Gatton,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Danny Gatton,"'Tention folks, speak of jokes
This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing

Danny Gatton,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe

'Cause he thought somebody might like him better
So he built it up, built it up till it all fell down

Now everybody wants to be somebody

When they shoot somebody
For the clothes they wear
And they'll advertise it like it's ordinary
They got territories so they stand their ground
What they really know is what comes around
It comes right back around

What they really wanted
Is to be accepted
And find out in the end
That the streets are self-correcting

Everybody wants to be somebody
Yes, it's true
No tellin' what some people will do, oh
Nobody wants to be a nobody

Danny Gottlieb,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

You`re my silver lining,

Shining star and inspiration
Worthy of a mighty nation,

Danny Infantino,"Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters, and a streetlamp gutters,
And soon it will be morning.

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me!
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day
Has begun",Memory [From Cats]

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Danny Kaye,"I am a little, tiny, bird. My name is Tweety Pie
I live inside my bird cage, a-hanging way up high

But there's a tat that's after me and won't let me alone

I taut I taw a puddy tat a creepin' up on me
I did! I taw a puddy tat as plain as he could be!

I am that great big bad old cat, Sylvester is my name
I only have one aim in life and that is very plain
I want to catch that little bird and eat him right away
But just as I get close to him, this is what he'll say

I taut I taw a puddy tat a creepin' up on me
You bet he taw a puddy tat, that puddy tat is me!

That puddy tat is very bad, he sneaks up from behind
I don't think I would like it if I knew what's on his mind
I have a strong suspicion that his plans for me aren't good
I am inclined to think that he would eat me if he could

I'd like to eat that sweetie pie when he leaves his cage
But I can never catch him, It throws me in a rage
You bet I'd eat that little bird if I could just get near
But every time that I approach, this is all I hear

I taut I taw a puddy tat a creepin' up on me
I did! I taw a puddy tat as plain as he could be!

And when I sing that little song, my mistress knows he's back
She grabs her broom and brings it down upon Sylvester's back
So listen you bad puddy tat, let's both be friends and see
My mistress will not chase you if you sing this song with me

They both were solid citizens, they both had been around,
And as they spoke you clearly saw their feet were on the ground!

Ten years went quickly by for both these subste-antial men,

That they had both developed in ten years there was no doubt,
And so of course they had an awful lot to talk about!

Before they met again, some twenty years they had to wait;
This time it happened up above, inside Saint Peter's gate!

A harp each one was carrying, and both were wearing wings,
and this is what they said as they were strumming on the strings;

Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun.

In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

How I love to sit and gaze in

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Danny Kaye,"In Tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire to take their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultry-violet 
rays

The natives grieve when the White Men leave their huts
Because they're obviously, definitely, nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one
But Englishmen detest a siesta

In the Philippines they have lovely screens to protect you from the 
glare
In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers 
won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a 
tree

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The toughest Burmese bandit can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down and lie down

In a jungle town where the Sun beats down to the rage of man and beast
The English garb of the English Sahib merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The smallest Malay rabbit deplores this foolish habit
In Hong Kong they strike a gong and fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate, who's in late

In the mangrove swamps where the python romps there is peace from 
twelve till two
Even caribous lie around and snooze for there's nothing else to do
In Bengal to move at all is seldom if ever done

Out in the midday

Little white duck doing what he oughta 
He took a bite of a lily pad

We got moonlight on the sea
We got mangos and bananas
You can pick right off the tree
We got volleyball and ping-pong
And a lot of dandy games
What ain't we got?
We ain't got dames

We get packages from home
We get movies we get shows
We get speeches from our skipper
And advice from Tokyo Rose 
We get letters doused with perfume
We get dizzy from the smell
What don't we get?
You know darn well

We got nothing to put on a clean white suit for,
What we need is what there ain't no substitute for

There is nothing like a dame, nothing in the world
There is nothing you can name that is anything like a dame

We feel restless we feel blue
We feel lonely and in grief
We feel every kind of feeling
But the feeling of relief
We feel hungry as the wolf felt 
When he met red riding hood
What don't we feel? we don't feel good

There is one particular thing that is nothing whatsoever in any shape or form

There is nothing like a dame, nothing in the world
There is nothing you can name that is anything like a dame

Nothing else is built the same,
Nothing in the world
Has the soft and wavy frame
Like the silhouette of a dame
 
There's absolutely nothing 
Like the frame of a dame

So suppose a dame ain't bright
Or completely free from flaws
Or as faithful as a bird dog
Or as kind as santa clause
It's a waste of time to worry
Over things that they have not
Be thankful for the things they've got

There is nothing you can name
That is anything like a dame
There are no books like a dame
And nothing looks like a dame
There are no drinks like a dame
And nothing thinks like a dame
Nothing acts like a dame
Or attracts like a dame

Flit away with a smile and a tear.
So you never can tell who is kissing her how.
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.

Wonder who's teaching her how?

Oh, that's the Woody Woodpecker song
Ho-ho-ho ho ho! Ho-ho-ho ho ho!
Yeah, he's a-peckin' it all day long

He pecks a few holes in a tree to see
If a redwood's really red
And it's nothing to him, on the tiniest whim
To peck a few holes in your head

Ho-ho-ho ho ho! Ho-ho-ho ho ho!
Oh, that's the Woody Woodpecker's tune
Ho-ho-ho ho ho! Ho-ho-ho ho ho!
Makes the other woodpeckers swoon

Though it doesn't make sense to the dull and the dense
And the lady woodpeckers long for
Ho-ho-ho ho ho! Ho-ho-ho ho ho!
That's the Woody Woodpecker song

Ho-ho-ho ho ho! Ho-ho-ho ho ho!
Woody Woodpecker's serenade
Ho-ho-ho ho ho! Ho-ho-ho ho ho!
On the woodpecker hit parade

Though he can't sing a note, there's a frog in his throat
All his top notes come out blurred
He's the ladies' first choice, with a laugh in his voice
He gives all his rivals the bird

Ho-ho-ho ho ho! Ho-ho-ho ho ho!
He'll be settlin' down some day
Ho-ho-ho ho ho! Ho-ho-ho ho ho!
He'll be hearin' the preacher say

For the rest of your life you'll be Woody and wife
And the choir will sing along with
Ho-ho-ho ho ho! Ho-ho-ho ho ho!

Danny Kaye,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on. 

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!
While God is marching on.",Battle Hymn of the Republic

Danny Kaye,"Goodnight, time to call it a day 
Sleep tight, dream your troubles away 
Goodnight, in spite of any sorrow 
There's a brand new day on it's way tomorrow 
Someday, all your dreams will come true 
Someway, for me and you 
So close your eyes and dream of it my darling 
Till then goodnight, goodnight, sleep tight 

Won't you play the music so the cradle can rock 
To a lullaby in ragtime 
Sleepy hands are creeping to the end of the clock 
Play a lullaby in ragtime 
You can tell the sandman is on his way 
By the way that they play 
As still as the trill of a thrush 
In a twilight hush 
So you can hear 
The rhythm of the river on the side of the boat 
As you sail away to dreamland 
High above the moon you hear a silvery note 
As the sand man takes your hand 
So rock-a-bye my baby 
Don't you cry my baby 
Sleepy time is nigh 
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby 

Now comes the hard part, baby. 
Do you suppose you can sing ""Five Pennies"" while 
Pops and I sing something else? 
Sure, I can sing as good as he can. 
And who can't? 

This little penny is to wish on 
And make your wishes come true 
This little penny is to dream on 
Dream of all you can do 
This little is a dancing penny 
See how it glitters and it glows 
Bright as a whistle 
Light as a thistle 
Quick, quick as a wink 
Up on it's twinkling toes 
This little penny is to laugh on 
To see that tears never fall 
This this little penny 
Is the last little penny 
Most important of all 
For this penny is to love on 
And where love is, heaven is there 
So with just five pennies, if they're these five pennies 
You'll be a millionaire 
For this penny is to love on 
And where love is, heaven is there

Danny Kaye,"We got sunlight on the sand
We got moonlight on the sea
We got mangos and bananas
You can pick right off the tree
We got volleyball and ping-pong
And a lot of dandy games
What ain't we got?
We ain't got dames

We get packages from home
We get movies we get shows
We get speeches from our skipper
And advice from Tokyo Rose
We get letters doused with perfume
We get dizzy from the smell
What don't we get?
You know darn well

We got nothing to put on a clean white suit for,
What we need is what there ain't no substitute for

There is nothing like a dame, nothing in the world
There is nothing you can name that is anything like a dame

We feel restless we feel blue
We feel lonely and in grief
We feel every kind of feeling
But the feeling of relief
We feel hungry as the wolf felt 
when he met red riding hood
What don't we feel? we don't feel good

Lots of things in life are beautiful but brother,
There is one particular thing that is nothing whatsoever in any shape or form
like any other

There is nothing like a dame, nothing in the world
There is nothing you can name that is anything like a dame

Nothing else is built the same,
Nothing in the world
Has the soft and wavy frame
Like the silhouette of a dame
 
There's absolutely nothing 
like the frame of a dame

So suppose a dame ain't bright
Or completely free from flaws
Or as faithful as a bird dog
Or as kind as santa clause
It's a waste of time to worry
Over things that they have not
Be thankful for the things they've got

There is nothing you can name
That is anything like a dame
There are no books like a dame
And nothing looks like a dame
There are no drinks like a dame
And nothing thinks like a dame
Nothing acts like a dame
Or attracts like a dame
There ain't a thing that's wrong with any man here
That can't be cured by putting him near
a girly, womanly, female, feminine dame",There Is Nothing Like a Dame

I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?

Danny Krivit,"Get away, let's leave today, let's get away! 
So you say you've tried but just can't find the measure
People around you are giving you pressure
Try to resist, all the bad things all around you
If you taste them, they will haunt you
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah, get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
What ya, what ya, what ya, what ya know?
Watch all the stars, they lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can. I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah. Get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
Let's leave today, let's get away

Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings

And I always have to say no

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now

And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core

If I had faith to walk on water

Cause baby when you walk into sight 

You turned an ordinary man 
like me into a king 
I would do anything to wind your love

Lying in her darkness like a child awaiting birth
Angel comes and takes me for everything I'm worth

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Take me in your arms, I know you're dying to
Fly away forever, fly away forever, fly away forever
Angel spread your wings

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Spread your wings and take me
Spread your wings and make me
I know, I know, I know, I know you're dying to
Fly away forever, fly away forever, fly away forever
Angel spread your wings

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Angel spread your wings, angel spread your wings

Danny O'Keefe,"Everybody's gone away
I believe this time they're gone to stay
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town

Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Find the sunshine leave the rain
They said, ""This town will waste your time""
I guess they're right, it's wasting mine

Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time, Charlie's got the blues

You know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at thirty-three
You play around, you'll lose your wife
You play too long, you'll lose your life

I got my pills to ease the pain
Can't find a thing to ease the rain
I'd love to try and settle down
But everybody's leaving town

Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time, Charlie's got the blues

",Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues [*]
Danny O'Keefe,"Highways and dance halls
A good song takes you far
Your write about the moon
And you dream about the stars
Blues in old motel rooms
Girls in daddy's car
You sing about the nights
And you laugh about the scars
Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons
You talk about the weather
And you grin about the rooms
Phone calls long distance
To tell how you've been
Forget about the losses, you exaggerate the wins

And when you stop to let em know
You've got it down
Its just another town along the road

The ladies come to see you
If your name still rings a bell
They give you damn near nothin
And they'll say they knew you well
So you tell em you'll remember
But they know its just a game
And along the way their faces
All begin to look the same
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the road

Well it isn't for the money
And its only for a while
You stalk about the rooms
And you roll away the miles
Gamblers in the neon, clinging to guitars
You're right about the moon
But you're wrong about the stars
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the way",The Road [*]
Danny O'Keefe,"What do we call it now
It isn't marriage anymore
Call it new and different
It's not the way it was before

Out of all the words to choose from
There's only one that fits
Call it what you want to
I just call it quits

We've come down to the place
Where love barely fits
Call it what you want to
I call it quits

Turn and walk away
Across the desert of our hearts
Loves kinda said that we've run out of time
And though we once had something
No words could tear apart
Now you be your's and I'll be mine

We've come down to the place
Where love barely fits
Call it what you want to
I call it quits

Call our friends
And tell them,
Oh tell them that we just don't care
Tell them dreams of flowers
But our garden's bare

Call it separation, independence

Call it what you want to

Danny O'Keefe,"Well I've got a long black six passenger limousine
A palace in Dallas a club in New Orleans
Diamonds on my fingers silk imported clothes
And I can tell a fast train by the way she blows

Don't give me no plastic saddle
Just let me feel that leather when I ride
Don't give me no paint and powder woman
This boy likes to feel the hide

False eyelashes and a false foundation
May build your pride
But don't give me no plastic saddle gal
Let me feel that leather when I ride

I'm the cream of societies I'm a man about town
Never looked long for nothin' that I ain't found
I ain't always right but I ain't never wrong

Danny Rivera,"I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin'
Someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face,
I see it's true
So tell me all about it
Tell me about the plans you're makin'
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am supposed to live without you
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin 'for is gone

I didn't come here for cryin'
Didn't come here to breakdown
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you
When I build my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much
More than friends
And I don't wanna know the price I'm
Gonna pay for dreaming
When even now it's more than I can take",Como He de Vivir Sin Tu Cari単o (How Am I Supposed to Live Without You)

Oh, in heaven I roam. Oh, in heaven I roam. (x2)

Well storms of tears and sunshine laughter
And flowers bloom, then fall to seed
Well I'm just sitting here watching all the trees grow

A million answers, I just stopped asking why

Danny Schmidt,"I woke up this morning and I realized
That I owned everything -- I owned everything
I owned all the air in the world
And all the house too
And all the TVs and Landrovers
And all of Jupiter's moons
Well that's a lot to be owning

So I shared it all -- I shared it with everyone
I'm a good sharer you know -- I guess I learned that young
Shared some land over here, and some food over there
I divvied it all away, tried my best to be fair
Inevitably though, there were inequities though
I mean that certain folks got to use more of my stuff
lots more of my stuff...
Mostly rich people

Yeah I woke up this morning and I realized
That I owned everything -- everything
Ain't it funny how sometimes you just wake
Up in the morning and find that everything's changed

Like going to sleep after a really big fight
And wakin' up in the morning scared to open your eyes
But you look over there -- there she is over there
And oh my god, what the hell, something you dreamed 
must've been kinda funny to her cause she's grinning
She's just grinning at you

Or like when Kafka woke up -- woke up in the morning
And all of a sudden, without any warning
He looked in the mirror, saw his worst morning fears
Yeah Kafka -- he was a cockroach... a giant one...
a giant Czechoslovakian allegorical yucky-ass sorta
cockroach.. that must have really sucked for him

Kinda makes you scared to wake up
Wake up in the morning
When things have been going OK
And you've gotten no warning
But it all goes to show
That there's just one thing you know
You just never know

But when you wake up in the morning
And she grinning at you
And you're not a giant cockroach even
And you own everything
Don't it make you feel
Yeah don't it make you feel
Kinda lucky.",Lucky
Danny Schmidt,"Things change fast
But this too shall pass
Better carve it on your forehead
Or tattoo it on your ass

'Cause who can tell
When the clock strikes twelve
If today's become tomorrow
Or if it's all just gone to hell

My friend makes rings
She swirls and sings
She's a mystic in the sense
That she's still mystified by things

But scared to ask
How can nothing last
'Cause like a cancer in your body
It all just goes too fast

We think too big
We think our self is one whole thing
And we claim that this collection
Has a name and is a being

But deep inside
When every cell divides
It sets upon the rule that states
Self-interest is divine

Cancer, too
Lives by this golden rule
That you must do unto the others
As the others unto you

All for the best
'Cause that's all the life accepts
And so we kill it like a buffalo
With awe and with respect

Don't ask God
Just ask the sky
She'll tell it to you plainly
In the clouds that whisper by

And praise the shapes
And then praise the way they change
And they'll teach you not to pray to light
Without you pray to rain

So I pray to hands
And I pray to needs
And I pray to blades of grass
To find forgiveness in the weeds

But as for health
I just never did believe
And so I never prayed myself
Except to those that prayed for me

The story goes
Or the way that I was told
There was a king that always felt too high
And then he fell too low

And so he called
All the wise men to the hall
And begged them for a gift
To end the rises and the falls

And here's the thing
They came back with a ring
It was simple and was plainly
Unbefitting of a king

Engraved in black
It had no front or back
But there were words around the band that said
Just know: This Too Shall Pass",This Too Shall Pass

Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that

I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to culture a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear, be the holy wizard

Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
the triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevant to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man want to live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

Cryin' deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin

I got the potion to turn your flesh to fuckin acid

Is the counting of friends

I might see the steps leading me here

I can't help what goes on
I am fueled and I am fired
And I'm weak and I'm worn
There's a box of stars
Hidden under my bed
That I only take out when I'm desperate

I don't know why
Why I wait so long
I can't seem to speak
But I can hide inside a song

Oh I have fallen down
I need to be lifted
Give me one word
One single sound
And I will be lifted
Lifted up out of this place
Lifted into your grace

Seems the more that I learn
The less that I know
I give blood up on stage
Don't give a damn at home

And I'm running in circles
And I'm standing in place
Begging for a glimmer
Dying for a taste

I don't know
Why it's gone away

Oh I have fallen down
I need to be lifted
I search for your face
Up over the crowd
I need to be lifted
Into your arms I'll ascend
To where I can start again

Oh I, oh I
Need to be lifted
Oh I, oh I
I need
Oh I have fallen down
I need to be lifted
I pray for one word
One single sound
And I will be lifted

Need to be lifted
Give me one word
One single sound
I need to be lifted
Oh I, oh I

Well, she never let me down
You won't see her hold my hand
And beg me not to go

That I don't already know

No time for misplaced virtue
We ain't got time for any jealousy

Or a man who acts too weak

With a promise that he can keep

Now if you want a hand to hold
Babe, ya know I got it
And if you want a love that won't grow old, I got it

Well, I could love you till the day I die

Oh, you know that we don't say much
You say the feelin' has gone away
And you guess that we just lost touch

I remember summer nights on an open road
And the wind blowin' through your hair
Both of us runnin' on overload
We were young and we did not care

Every tear that you cry brings a little more pain

But I'll be waiting just the same
Because the less I see you, the more I need you here

I don't want your sympathy
Leave me to my misery
Baby, set me fee

Morning comes too soon
And my head feels all undone
And in the light I saw the truth
And I had nowhere to run

Danny Wilde,"Long ago on a Monday morning
She's already up and gone
Miles away without a warning
Never knowing for how long

I don't think that I will forget her
For her words were hard and cruel
She once called me a pretender
Even though my love was true

And if I still had the number
Would I hesitate to call?
Would she make me feel like cryin'?
Would she make me feel so small?

There's been too many years gone by
There's been too many years gone by

How could I forget that winter
It was 10 long years ago
Blinded by the love between us
Blinded by the fallin' snow

She was everything that I needed
She was everything to me
Then the summer came and it freed her
And brought me down upon my knees

And if I still had the number
And if I had the nerve to call
Would we laugh about that winter
Would we laugh about it all?

There's been too many years gone by
There's been too many years gone by

There's been too many years gone by and too many years tell lies
A heart is a lonely place, when a heart has its own mine
In mine there's an empty space, from a love that was left behind

There's been too many years gone by
There's been too many years gone by

And too many years tell lies
There's been too many years gone by
And too many years tell lies
There's been too many years gone by

The way you drag me around, girl
It's a game where the players never bargain to lose
Who do you think that you're foolin'?

Are you tryin' to protect me
From the wrong that you've been doin'? Oh yeah

It won't be the first time
Your eyes will tell on you
You know it wouldn't be the first time

 But they don't listen to me
 I talk to the stars
 But they never hear me
 The breeze hasn't time
 To stop and hear what I say
 I talk to them all in vain
 
 [Chorus:]
 But suddenly my words
 Reach someone else's ears
 Touch someone else's heartstrings, too
 I tell you my dreams
 And while you're listening to me
 I suddenly see them come true
 
 I can see us on an April night
 Sipping brandy underneath the stars
 Reading poems in the candlelight
 To the strumming of guitars
 
 I will tell you all the books I've read
 And the way I met the King of France
 Then I'll send the servants off to bed
 And I'll ask you for a dance
 
 [Chorus:]",I Talk to the Trees
Danny Williams,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm, I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring 

I keep wishing I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing 

I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be spring
It might as well be spring. 

",It Might as Well Be Spring
Danny Williams,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Until my baby comes home

Danny Williams,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

Danny Wright,"If the hands of time
Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

Danny Wright,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Danny Wright,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'll trade the world
For the good thing he's found
If she's bad he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comfort
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be

Well, this man loves a woman
I gave you everything I had
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can't ever see

When a man loves a woman
He can do no wrong
He can never own some other girl
Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman",When a Man Loves a Woman
Danny Wright,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were

Danny!,"It's crazy yo, it's like...
First my life is like a roller-coaster
Now it's like a carousel, y'know, going in circles
When will it stop

[Chorus]
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
My life is spinnin' 'round and 'round
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
I think I need to slow it down
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
My life is spinnin' 'round and 'round
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
I think I need to slow it down, down, DOWN

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo me, G' and Khary
Three the hard way
J. Nix, MK-6: take yo' pick man
Matter fact take six man, take a breather
I'll make it easy for you
This merry-go-round ain't merry at all
Danny wanna hop off this carousel
But scared he could fall
Figured I'd make a few beans with my daily routine
But if the monotony's making you scream
Then what's the ride worth?
Yo, what is my purpose?
If I could fly from this earth, I would
And gain perspective like a third eye could, but ummm
Everyday is like a rat race
Try to escape, fall flat on your face
'Cause in between the shows and the interviews
Dough and the scent of new
Hoes, centerfolds waitin' backstage in the nude
I sorta lost control
My star status got me feelin' mad exhausted yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Was interrupted in my thoughts by this shorty I used to rap to
Back when I had two at a time... I was that smooth
I ran into her at the State Fair
She told me '""we should do lunch""
I said ""fuck it"", and we just ate there
We was a great pair; we talked candidly
About the romance that we had in the past
She's gassed 'cause I'm rapping and I'm big time now
I asked how she was doing and she gave me a half-smile
Now that's wild
We made our way to the ride with the unicorns
And the moon ornaments - how appropriate
she told me it had been four years, still got no associate's
Degree, and now she's trying to cope with the debris
Of a marriage gone wrong, baby carriages on the lawn
Said she got a seed, six years old and can't read
I'm like, ""whoa, slow up your speed""
She agreed and nodded her head
Bugged me out when she said

Danny!,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
Like home",Home...?
Danny!,"I put my all in it
Calling it quits was a schtick
Just a ruse that I'd use
If I started to get sick of the conflict wearing away
At what we set and so I'd threaten to leave, hopin' you'd beg me to stay
And you did but this time, there ain't no coming back
Despite the fact that I don't wanna see you with somebody wack
So I guess we should just put this thing here to rest
Yes, I hate to but it's for the best
We were compatible
First date was magical
Hurts to take a sudden sabbatical
I gave you collateral
With no money down, you said my heart would suffice
Back on track three, see, you wasn't treatin' me right
A cause for concern, maximum effort but
All I got was minimal results in return
Burn ya abacus, cause this doesn't add up
Sad but, I have to know: what happened to us?

[Verse 2]
How do I move on?
And still get my groove on?
Who's gonna captivate my soul with a new song?
Who's gonna saturate my life with a new long-
Term relationship and how much longer can I wait for it?
When I know the only woman that I loved was you
Am I still in love with you?
Nah, who am I kiddin'? Give it up, we're through
They say if you care for something then set it free
If it don't come back, it wasn't meant to be
I think about the coulda-beens
And how it ended, I'm dependent on your sugar
Friends would probably want us to work it out
If word of mouth continued
They don't know the half of what we've been through
They mean well, this is my farewell
I'mma cherish the good times
If there was a good time to leave it would be now
We're just kiddin' ourselves so let's stop
If y'all ain't know I'm talkin' 'bout my one and only true love
And that's hip-hop, let's go",After the Love Has Gone

Dante Thomas,"She's a rich girl from the top of the food chain
Love and material things, kinda lonely
Til I met her at the Grammys, 10mil on a diamond ring
She invites me to spend a day on the jet skies
At first it didn't mean a thing
Then she told me I'm the one that she searched for
It was hard to believe.

[Chorus]
She's miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.
House down by the water, sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.

In a couple a days she had me a bracelet
Made, from Harry Winstons place
Went horseback up to the mountain top
Shown me the land she's got,
Well its alright but something else is on your mind,
Looking past all that shines now the tears are running through
All those things are nice but it's not why I'm here
I will wipe away your tears simply by just loving you.

There's no fun like New York City

but not the way she acts towards me 
but if I leave her will she stop me? 
or will she let me go? 
she says that she loves me 
but not the way she acts towards me 
but if I leave her will she stop me? 
or will she let me go? 

never was a time so perfect in my eyes 
that makes it easy to believe that we'll never change 
cause what does she feel if she doesn't feel love for me? 
is this a game, and am I just a playing piece? 
if anything, just let me think 
cause she loves her man 
that's what she says 

she says that she loves me

For July to come around
I hear the Summer
Whispering the things to come

We have been waiting
For the sun to show it's face
Thank you sweet winter
But now we're desperate to move on

Leave beyond the worst we've known
And build ourselves a brand new home
Maybe then we'll find the time we've lost

Set us free

Save me from the worst I've known
And let me relive the days I've blown away

It's a shame we have lost so many things that we will never find again
But it doesn't matter anymore anyways

Summer sings a song to us that I can't ignore
And I'm desperate for
I try too hard to keep my calm
But I just can't hide it anymore anyways

Leave behind the worst we've known
Build ourselves a brand new home
Maybe then we'll find the time we lost

But the summer will be a sweet revenge

",What We Have Been Waiting For
Daphne Loves Derby,"We flew over the cascades
We were forced to behave while we sat in rows like children
I crossed some standard state lines
I finally found myself so far away from home

And even though New England intrigued us, thrilled us
Our bones were cold as stick and stones
We flew over the cascades
Just to find ourselves in storms we've never known

The winds were like a beast with wings and yes
Everything was blown so far away
And I fell down, I failed to cut its neck

Even after hours of waiting
There was no telling when the storm would find its way
The lands we tried to memorize
Were no longer wrapped in tepid shades of red

And through the night the storm held me down
And bit my neck and said it'd be okay
I stared into the fury
And the beauty of its overwhelming strength

The winds were like a beast with wings and yes
Everything was blown so far away
And I fell down, I failed to cut its neck

I saw a dim light in the mouth of the beast
So I followed it in, it was too late to retreat
It swallowed me whole and my flesh became meat
And I can't look back now 'cause the beast has come clean

We flew over the cascades
We're forced to behave

And she said, all she had was the cross around her neck
To keep her warm, ooh

I still remember how you tried to hold these walls through perfect storms
Oh, you've lost so many homes
You said, ""Hold on, everything will be okay""
I've been confused, why can't we just run away?

Was it hope that kept you alive through the years
And should I even call it living?

I've been dreaming that I found you staying in the sea
Then you told me that's where you've been
You said the water's cold but still warmer than your skin

I tried to help you but the closer I got, the further you are to me, away

Was it hope that kept you alive through the years
And should I even call it living?

Heating the living room in no one direction
But sprawling out all over the floor

And as the smoke forms a line up to the sun
It carves a fold in everyone
And the notable promise that I can recall
Is that I could have been there with you

We'd be dancing in the fire

A tackle with a familiar response
Was my call to burn inside and alone.
Smoke rises up to the sun
And carves a fold in everyone dancing in the fire

Everyone dancing in the fire

That you're not a fire so I will not dance in you

",Fire Fire Fire
Dappled Cities,"I can't know what I should say
To soothe your headaches and make your day reasonable
The constant change of folks don't stay the same
They fly by night and crawl by day

I could try the holy chord
The seeds of hay, the hay of the march
They're all the same in different ways
Like poultry games and the baptist monks
Who raised these chickens as their own personal slaves

The hee, the caw, the chain
The battery thinking chain of songs and games
Who could say what we can go changing

What cool solvent rubs away the steam stuck
To our eyes and stuck in our closets?
The same great messages that are wrapped up
In the same vain messages that always stay the same

What does it mean to take off all our clothes
And look into your eyes and say I mean it?

",Holy Chord
Dappled Cities,"To say you've heard the vision bell
Means that everything you say is what I'm looking for
The sounds you see the sights you smell
The shapes your words are forming form a necessary world
We'll keep the sun for the morning but don't tell your heart

The patterns of our words collide
To make a common sense when they are woven in our minds
Blanket thoughts so kept untold
And keeping it that way will keep us singing through our eyes
We'll keep the sun for the morning but don't tell your heart

All the same, what we're looking for is all the same
But somehow I'm still looking, oh, still listening all the same

So now you've heard the vision bell
Everything you say is what I'm looking for
The sounds you see the sights you smell
The shapes your words are forming form a necessary world
We'll keep the sun for the morning but don't tell your heart
Don't tell your heart

",Vision Bell
Dappled Cities,"Time is on our side, sleep is slow
And underfoot is only the world
That chimes cued by man-time but we have a soul
So we don't need a face, we just need a home

No eyes to see the smile above the chin
And no nose to smell the breath within
And no ears beneath the receding hairline

Climb with all your ropes tied in a bow
And curdled down to the white bone
Which fray and whip till they sing and slip in the line
We don't need a face, we just need a home

",Within Hours

Dappy,"So now you wanna know,
But where was you when I was broke?
Now I see love you’ve never shown,
So why you think I’m bading?
I almost swear I made it.

So fuck them, they don’t go as hard as me,
Who’s be coming at the ill?
Fuck them, I’m a disease.
I put my money where my mouth is,
They be lying through their teeth,
Our window be mistaken, I still ache like a pagan.

So fuck them, they don’t go as hard as me,
I don’t raise the bar so high, no satellite can find me,
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out the sleeve
Gets pissed that they faded, my name they been cremated.

Lies. You’ve been guessing out them hoes, which are bullshit,
‘cause you’ve been kissing on your balls with your small dick.
Look, I got my willy up.
And the camera’s on, but now you call me wrong on life, that’s why Harry’s on.

I ain’t shutting off my time, I’m just letting my shit hang on light

That’s just D A to P P Y, I’m doing me G
Them ring tone rappers ain’t got no credit, if one rings around, that brings one later.
Peace cake, soft and sweet, I’ll piss on them, they all tie their seats
I shit on them, mighty freaks, they’ll never catch me on the sun bath.
‘cause no one cares about what the fuck was made in Chelsea,
The only way is the streets, don’t care what no one tells me,
Skied off, once in, two shots, none left. Ten men, one pet. Ten times there?
Pussy roll on my carpet, ‘cause the king of the jungle just tore that piece out the market,
They talking shit on the record, then why exhaust?
Doing us the dirty thing, is time to flush, ‘cause the fucking thing’s on it.
You solve it, you finish all, you dickheads be quiet,
I’m starving my face and I’m taking pussy, you on a diet.
You the type to go to Gucci? They caught up high just to try it,
They got picture, post it on Twitter and don’t even buy
You don’t hustle, you just listen to nipsy,
The only strap you only see is on the top of your kick
I go jump once before and you can even nor stinchy,
I got them on my shit back, and it wasn’t my fish,
You see my chains link to my pride if you take what comes to my life
We get our sign, not even my toilet will let shit slide
Now let that book in mine and bring that pair around with that dick
If you only see the shape of that clip, suck it, I’m your prick.

Am I wrong to think the worlds got it in for me
And am I right to say I'm longing for some sympathy
See I feel a sound, but I can't hear it
That's my heart strings getting played like a symphony
Yo, you know you turned me insane
Why you staring at window when I'm the one with the pain
You know you set me off the rails
And you'll be to blame
If you're ever hear

Dar Williams,"Yea, there was a time I didn't like the love, I liked the climbers,
I was no sister then, I was running out of time and one liners,
And I was afraid, like you are when you're too young to know the time, and
So I watched the way you take your fear and hoard the horizon,
You point, you have a word for every woman you can lay your eyes on,
Like you own them just because you bought the time,
And you turn to me, you say you hope Im not threatened,

Oh, I'm not that petty, as cool as I am, I thought you'd know this already,
I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.

So now were at a club, you watch the woman dancing, she is drunk,
She is smiling and shes falling in a slow, descending funk,
And the whole bar is loud and proud and everybody's trying, yeah.
You play the artist, saying, ""Is it how she moves, or how she looks?""
I say, its loneliness suspended to our own like grappling hooks,
And as long as shes got noise, shes fine.
But I could teach her how I learned to dance when the musics ended,

Oh, and thats not petty, as cool as I am, I thought you'd know this already,
I will not be afraid of women, I will not be afraid of women.

You tried to make me doubt, to make me guess, tried to make me feel like a little less,
Oh, I liked you when your soul was bared, I thought you knew how to be scared,
And now its amazing what you did to make me stay,
But truth is just like time, it catches up and it just keeps going,

And so Im leaving, you can find out how much better things can get,
And if it helps, Id say I feel a little worse than I did when we met,
So when you find someone else, you can try again, it might work next time,
You look out of the kitchen window and you shake your head and say low,
""If I could believe that stuff, Id say that woman has a halo,""
And I look out and say, ""Yeah, shes really blond,""
And then I go outside to join the others, I am the others,

Oh, and that's not easy, I don't know what you saw, I want somebody who sees me,

Dar Williams,"If you're gonna get your heart broke, you better do it just right, 
It's gotta be raining, and you gotta move your stuff that night, 
And the only friend you can reach isn't a good friend at all, 
And you know when he says ""Now who dumped who?"" that you never should have made that call. 

I had the blessings, there's nobody there, there's nobody home, 
Yeah, the blessings, at the moment I was most alone 
And aimless as a fulltime fool, the joke was on me, 
I got all those birds flying off of that tree, and that's a blessing. 

And the blessings were like poets that we never find time to know, 
But when time stopped I found the place where the poets go. 
And they said, ""Here have some coffee, it's straight, black and very old,"" 
And they gave me sticks and rocks and stars and all that I could hold, 

I had the blessings, a moment of peace even when the night ends, 
Yeah, the blessings, can we meet? Can we meet again, 
At the crossroads of disaster and the imperfect smile, 
With the angel in the streetlamp that blinks on as I walk on a mile, the blessings. 

And the best ones were the ones I got to keep as I grew strong, 
And the days that opened up until my whole life could belong, 
And now I'm getting the answers, when I don't need them anymore, 
I'm finding the pictures, and I finally know what I kept them for, 
I remember, I can see them, see them smiling, see them stuck, 
See them try, I wish them luck and all the blessings. 

I was fast asleep at three in the morning when I got the payphone call, 
And she said, ""Did I wake you up,"" I said, ""Hey, no, not at all."" 
And she said, ""I got this suitcase and I don't know what to pack,"" 
And I said, ""You can take anything you want, just wait and see, 
It's not a release, not a reward, it's the blessings, 
Its the gift of what you notice more,"" 
And I walked out and I watched her kick the big pile of the night, 
And we sat down and we waited for that strange and empty light. 
Yeah the blessings

See them smiling, see them stuck, 
See them try, I wish them luck and all the blessings.",The Blessings
Dar Williams,"Amber called her uncle, said ""We're up here for the holiday, 
Jane and I were having Solstice, now we need a place to stay."" 
And her Christ-loving uncle watched his wife hang Mary on a tree, 
He watched his son hang candy canes all made with Red Dye No. 3. 
He told his niece, ""Its Christmas Eve, I know our life is not your style,"" 
She said, ""Christmas is like Solstice, and we miss you and its been awhile."" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
And just before the meal was served, hands were held and prayers were said, 
Sending hope for peace on earth to all their gods and goddesses. 

The food was great, the tree plugged in, the meal had gone without a hitch, 
Till Timmy turned to Amber and said, ""Is it true that you're a wtich?"" 
His mom jumped up and said, ""The pies are burning,"" and she hit the kitchen, 
And it was Jane who spoke, she said, ""It's true, your cousin's not a Christian,"" 
""But we love trees, we love the snow, the friends we have, the world we share, 
And you find magic from your God, and we find magic everywhere,"" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
And where does magic come from? I think magic's in the learning, 
'Cause now when Christians sit with Pagans only pumpkin pies are burning. 

When Amber tried to do the dishes, her aunt said, ""Really, no, don't bother."" 
Amber's uncle saw how Amber looked like Tim and like her father. 
He thought about his brother, how they hadn't spoken in a year, 
He thought he'd call him up and say, ""It's Christmas, and your daughter's here."" 
He thought of fathers, sons and brothers, saw his own son tug his sleeve, saying, 
""Can I be a Pagan?"" Dad said, ""We'll discuss it when they leave."" 

So the Christians and the Pagans sat together at the table, 
Finding faith and common ground the best that they were able, 
Lighting trees in darkness, learning new ways from the old, and 
Making sense of history and drawing warmth out of the cold.",The Christians and the Pagans

It was fine, but it just fell apart.

Let your love cover me, 
Like a pair of angel wings, 
You are my family,

Where we left him to always remain.

Dar Williams,"I threw your keys in the water, I looked back, 
They'd frozen halfway down in the ice. 
They froze up so quickly, the keys and their owners, 
Even after the anger, it all turned silent, and 
The everyday turned solitary, 
So we came to February. 

First we forgot where we'd planted those bulbs last year, 
Then we forgot that we'd planted at all, 
Then we forgot what plants are altogether, 
and I blamed you for my freezing and forgetting and 
The nights were long and cold and scary, 
Can we live through February? 

You know I think Christmas was a long red glare, 
Shot up like a warning; we gave presents without cards, 
And then the snow, 
And then the snow came, we were always out shoveling, 
And we'd drop to sleep exhausted, 
Then we'd wake up, and its snowing. 

And February was so long that it lasted into March 
And found us walking a path alone together. 
You stopped and pointed and you said, ""That's a crocus,"" 
And I said, ""What's a crocus?"" and you said, ""It's a flower,"" 
I tried to remember, but I said, ""What's a flower?"" 
You said, ""I still love you."" 

The leaves were turning as we drove to the hardware store, 
My new lover made me keys to the house, 
And when we got home, we just started chopping wood, 
Because you never know how next year will be, 
And we'll gather all our arms can carry, 
I have lost to February.",February
Dar Williams,"I've never had a way with women, 
But the hills of Iowa make me wish that I could 
And I've never found a way to say I love you, 
But if the chance came by, oh I, I would 
But way back where I come from, 
We never mean to bother, 
We don't like to make our passions other people's concern, 
And we walk in the world of safe people, 
And at night we walk into our houses and burn. 

Iowa

How I long to fall just a little bit, 
To dance out of the lines and stray from the light, 
But I fear that to fall in love with you 
Is to fall from a great and gruesome height. 
So I asked a friend about it, on a bad day, 
Her husband had just left her, 
She sat down on the chair he left behind, she said, 
""What is love, where did it get me? 
Whoever thought of love is no friend of mine.""

Iowa
Once I had everything, 
I gave it up for the shoulder of your driveway 
And the words I've never felt. 
And so for you, I came this far across the tracks, 
Ten miles above the limit, and with no seatbelt, and I'd do it again, 
For tonight I went running through the screen doors of discretion, 
For I woke up from a nightmare that I could not stand to see, 
You were a-wandering out on the hills of Iowa, 
And you were not thinking of me.

Dar Williams,"She never should have rented this apartment in the Mortal City 
The cold comes though every crack she puts her hand up to 
The radiator's broken, so she has to use electric heat. 

And tonight was the first date with the brother of the guy she worked next to 
He lived a couple streets away 
He listened, he had things to say 
She asked him up for dinner sometime 
Sometime was tonight 

The radio gave updates on the ice storm while she made the dinner 
They said, from all the talk, you shouldn't drive or even walk 
And this just in, we're asking everyone to turn off their power 
They need it at the hospital. 

She ran around pulling plugs, then she called him up 
Maybe now they shouldn't meet, he said that he would brave the streets 
She met him at the door with a blanket and a candle
Saying, I heard it on the radio, I had to turn my power off. 

He said you're not the only one, the streets were dark tonight, 
It was like another century
With dim lamps and candles lighting up the icy trees and the clouds and a covered moon. 

She said what kind of people make a city 
Where you can't see the sky and you can't feel the ground? 

I tell you something, I have this feeling that this city's dying 
He said, it's not dying it's the people who are dying 
She said, yes, yes I think the people are dying and nobody cares. 

We had all this technology our dreams were bold and vague 
And then one city got bad planners, one city got the plague. 

He asked why did you move here? She said, for the job 
For the job and I've been so lonely here, so lonely 
There's no one I can talk to, you know I don't even know your brother. 

He smiled and said, sometimes at night I walk out by the river 
The city's one big town, the water turns it upside down 
People found this city because they love other people 
They want their secretaries, they want their power lunches. 

And think about tonight, I heard the same newscast you did 
I unplugged everything, I looked out the window 
And I think the city heard, I watched as one by one the lights went off 
So they could give their power to the hospital 

They ate in silence while she thought this over, 
They sat together in a dark room in the Mortal City 
Shifting in their blankets so they wouldn't get spaghetti on them. 

Then came the awkward moment after dinner, what to do, 
The ice was still falling, the streets were still dangerous 
The cabs were not running and this neighborhood was not the greatest. 

They both looked at the space where a couch would've been 
She felt her stomach sink, she felt like she could hardly think 

She said, I never should have rented this apartment in the Mortal City 
The cold comes through eve crack I put my hand up to 
The radiator doesn't work, I have to use electric heat. 

That settled it, they would both sleep in her bed 
It was a matter of survival. 

She brought out t-shirts, sweatshirts, sweatpants, socks, hats 
If there was ever any thought of what would happen in that bed tonight 
There was no question now 
They could barely move 
They were wrapped up like ornaments waiting for another season. 

They lay in bed, they listened to the pelting ice 
He said my brother's not a bad guy, he's just quiet 
I wished you liked this city 
She said, maybe I do. 

I think I have a special kind of hearing tonight 
I hear the neighbors upstairs 
I hear my heart beating 
I hear one thousand hearts beating at the hospital 
And one thousand hearts by their bedsides waiting 
Saying that's my love in the white gown, 

We are not lost in the Mortal City 
We are not lost in the Mortal City",Mortal City
Dar Williams,"When I went to your town on the wide open shore
Oh I must confess, I was drawn, I was drawn to the ocean
I thought it spoke to me, it said, ""Look at us,
We're not churches, not schools, not skating ponds, swimming pools
And we have lost people, haven't we though?""
Oh, that's what the ocean can know of a body
And that's when I came back to town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

I went back to the ocean today
With my books and my papers I went to the rocks by the ocean
But the weather changed quickly, oh the ocean said
""What are you trying to find, I don't care, I'm not kind
I've bludgeoned your sailors, I've spat out their keepsakes
Oh it's ashes to ashes, but always the ocean,""
But the ocean can't come to this town, this town is a song about you
You don't know how lucky you are, you don't know how much I adore you
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

And the ones that can know you so well are the ones that can swallow you whole.
I have a good and I have an evil, I thought the ocean, the ocean thought nothing
You are the welcoming back from the ocean.

I didn't go back today
I wanted to show you that I was more land than water
I went to pick flowers I brought them to you
Look at me, look at them, with their salt up the stem
But you frowned when I smiled and I tried to arrange them
You said, ""Let me tell you the song of this town""
You said, ""Everything closes at five. After that, well, you just got the bars
You don't know how precious you are, walking around with your little shoes dangling
I am the one who lives with the ocean.

It's where we came from, you know, and sometimes I just want to go back
After a day, we drink til we're drowning, walk to the ocean, wade in with our work boots
Wade in our work boots, try to finish the job.
You don't know how precious you are, I am the one who lives with the ocean
You don't know how I am the one. You don't know how I am the one.""",The Ocean
Dar Williams,"I'm not a leader, 
I'm not a left-wing rhetoric mobilizing force of one, 
But there was a time way back, 
Many years ago in college, don't laugh, 
But I thought I was a radical, 
I ran the Hemp Liberation Group with my boyfriend, 
It was true love, with a common cause, 
And besides that, he was a Sagittarius. 

We used to say that our love was like hemp rope, 
Three times as strong as the rope that you buy domestically, 
And we would bond in the face of oppression from big business and the deans, 
But I knew there was a problem, 
Every time the group would meet everyone would light up, 
That made it difficult to discuss glaucoma and human rights, 
Not to mention chemotherapy. 

Well sometimes, life gives us lessons sent in ridiculous packaging, 
And so I found him in the arms of a Student Against the Treacherous use of Fur, 
And he gave no apology, he just turned to me, stoned out to the edge of oblivion, 
He didn't pull up the sheets and I think he even smiled as he said to me, 
""Well, I guess our dreams went up in smoke."" 

And I said, No, our dreams went up in dreams, you stupid pothead, 
And another thing, what kind of a name is 
Students Against the Treacherous Use of Fur? 
Fur is already dead, and besides, 
A name like that doesn't make a good acronym. 

I am older now, I know the rise 
And gradual fall of a daily victory. 
And I still write to my senators, 
Saying they should legalize cannabis, 
And I should know, cause I am a horticulturist, 
I have a husband and two children out in Lexington, Mass. 
And my ex-boyfriend can't tell me I've sold out, 
Because he's in a cult. 
And he's not allowed to talk to me.","The Pointless, Yet Poignant, Crisis of a Co-Ed"
Dar Williams,"There's a part of the country could drop off tomorrow in an earthquake, 
Yeah, it's out there on the cutting edge, the people move, the sidewalks shake. 
And there's another part of the country with a land that gently creaks and thuds, 
Where the heavy snows make faucets leak in bathrooms with free-standing tubs. 
They're in houses that are haunted, the with kids who lie awake and think about 
All the generations past who used to use that dripping sink. 

And sometimes one place wants to slip into the other just to see 
What it's like to trade its demons for the restless ghost of Mrs. Ogilvey, 
She used to pick the mint from her front yard to dress the Sunday pork, 
Sometimes southern California wants to be western New York. 

It wants to have a family business in sheet metal or power tools, 
It wants to have a diner where the coffee tastes like diesel fuel, 
And it wants to find the glory of a town they say has hit the skids, 
And it wants to have a snow day that will turn its parents into kids, 
And it's embarrassed, but it's lusting after a SUNY student with mousy brown hair who is 
Taking out the compost, making coffee in long underwear. 

And southern California says to save a place, I'll meet you there, 
And it tried to pack up its Miata, all it could fit was a prayer, 
Sometimes the stakes are bogus, sometimes the fast lane hits a fork, 
Sometimes southern California wants to be western New York. 

Tempe, Arizona thinks the Everglades are greener and wetter, 
And Washington, D.C. thinks that Atlanta integrated better, 
But I think that southern California has more pain that we can say, 
'Cause it wants to travel back in time, but it just can't leave L.A. 

But now I hear they've got a theme park planned, designed to make you gasp and say, 
Oh, I bet that crumbling mill town was a booming mill town in its day, 
And the old investors scoff at this, but the young ones hope they'll take a chance, 
And they promise it will make more dough than Mickey Mouse in northern France, 
And the planners planned an opening day, a town historian will host, 
And the waitresses look like waitresses who want to leave for the west coast. 

And they'll have puttering on rainy weekends, autumn days that make you feel sad, 
They'll have hundred year old plumbing and the family you never had, 
And a Hudson River clean-up concert and a bundle-bearing stork, 
And I hear they've got a menu planned, it's trés western New York.",Southern California Wants to Be Western New York
Dar Williams,"I am thinking about the woman in a century of peace
On a bright mosaic she is washing on her knees
And she looks up at the black sky beyond the mountain tall
She says, ""Oh good, the rain is finally going to fall today.""
This was Pompeii.

And everyone has memories of the night that melted stone
The neighbor's nightgown, the screaming on the phone
And the tired man at the station says, ""We can't tell who's alive
All we ever know is that the tourists survive.""
""Tra la, tra la,"" they say, they say
""Let's Go Pompeii.""

I think about Pompeii when I feel an end is near, 
Just before the rain and every time you disappear. 
And I think about a teacup, suspended and half-served. 
And all the scholars know is that it's perfectly preserved. 
That's all they say. 
This was Pompeii. 

And as for my own kingdom, not a table leg was charred

You were out there and you found me
I was out here listening all the time

Last night we drank in parking lots
And why do we drink? I guess we do it cause
And when I turned your station on 
You sounded more familiar than that party was

They were out on the porch, they were inside playing quarters
And he said, ""Don't you know the game Kazaam? It's a better game,
You point your elbow at someone and say somebody else's name 
And it alternates whose turn it is and if you lose you drink.""

Round about one or two it started winding down
And he knew what they needed they needed donuts
So they walked out to Krispy Kruller's All night Sugar Palace
It was there in the doorway he said, ""Oh, well maybe not.""
Inside there were six women talking
They were the most justified angry ex-girlfriends
And they swivelled around slowly like they saw something bad
Through the eyes in the back of their heads
Like he always knew they had

And he looked up at the photo that he bought at a junk shop
It was only fifty cents but he framed it and everything
It was the kind of party that you hope never ends

And they were all in pointed hats 
Caught in a rebel birthday shout
And he was at the candles with his mom there to help him out

They try to act familiar, but they're floating just above the land 
And we are all floating 
You're my road buddy, but I'm lonely all the time 

I thought we'd show that friendship could be stronger than the crossroads double back 
I thought I heard the Tori sing, I'll take that thing I 
This is not a romance with the road 

In those cliffs are the same as in the magazines I have at home 
And the tall grass reminds me of the same dreams I had at home
I thought life was a road and I wanted to begin it 
I said, my friend and I going on a trip so I could only stop a minute 
We go to the venting machines
I want to watch these kids with their mother

Sipping on their juice boxes and smiling at each other
And maybe that's their Dad on the phone
Saying, hey Mom, you couldn't wait, go ahead, have dinner
'Cause we're running just a little late 
But we're on our way 

Road buddy, road buddy, I heard about the boxcars and the family of travelers 
But there's real estate sides in the cornfields 
I know there's love, I bet there's trouble 
But you just can't spend a lifetime on the road 

And there's something I finally faced 
I finally think I come from some place

Dar Williams,"When I grew up, well it felt great 
I watched how others took their fate 
Some felt afraid and undefended, so they got mean 
And they pretended what they knew made them belong more than you.

But that's not your fault, that's just your turn, yeah, yeah 

Teenagers, kick our butts, tell us what the future will bring 
Teenagers look at us, we have not solved everything 

We drink and smoke to numb our pain 
We read junk novels on the plane 
We use authority for show so we can be a little smarter 
We still can grow, and many do 
It's when we stop we can't reach you 
We feel the loss, you feel the blame 
We're scared to lose, don't be the same, hey hey

Teenagers, look at us, we have not solved everything 

The hometown brought its hero in 
To speak at the high school gym 
He took a breath, he took a chance 
He strode up in his leather pants 
And said, ""Gee, thanks... but 
I'm here today because I fought for what I felt and what I thought 
They put me down they, were just wrong 
And now it's they who don't belong, oh, oh 

Teenagers, kick our butts, tell us what the future will bring 
Teenagers look at us, we have not solved everything 

And when the media tries to act your age 
Don't be seduced, they're full of rage 
Find your voice, do what it takes 
Make sure you make lots of mistakes 
And find the future that redeems

Dar Williams,"I don't go to therapy to find out if I'm a freak
I go and I find the one and only answer every week
And it's just me and all the memories to follow 
Down any course that fits within a fifty minute hour
And we fathom all the mysteries, explicit and inherent
When I hit a rut, she says to try the other parent
And she's so kind, I think she wants to tell me something, 
But she knows that its much better if I get it for myself
And she says

What do you hear in these sounds? 
What do you hear in these sounds?

I say I hear a doubt, with the voice of true believing
And the promises to stay, and the footsteps that are leaving
And she says ""Oh,"" I say, ""What?"" she says, ""Exactly,""
I say, ""What, you think I'm angry
Does that mean you think I'm angry?""
She says ""Look, you come here every week
With jigsaw pieces of your past
Its all on little soundbites and voices out of photographs
And that's all yours, that's the guide, that's the map
So tell me, where does the arrow point to? 
Who invented roses?""
And

What do you hear in these sounds? 
What do you hear in these sounds?

And when I talk about therapy, I know what people think
That it only makes you selfish and in love with your shrink
But oh how I loved everybody else
When I finally got to talk so much about myself

And I wake up and I ask myself what state I'm in
And I say well I'm lucky, 'cause I am like East Berlin
I had this wall and what I knew of the free world
Was that I could see their fireworks
And I could hear their radio
And I thought that if we met, I would only start confessing
And they'd know that I was scared
They'd would know that I was guessing
But the wall came down and there they stood before me
With their stumbling and their mumbling
And their calling out just like me, and

The stories that nobody hears, and
I collect these sounds in my ears, and
That's what I hear in these sounds, and
That's what I hear in these,
That's what I hear in these sounds.",What Do You Hear in These Sounds
Dar Williams,"Go ahead push your luck
Find out how much love the world can hold
Once upon a time I had control and reined my soul in tight
Well the whole truth
Is like the story of a wave unfurled
But I held the evil of the world
So I stopped the tide
Froze it up from inside
And it felt like

A winter machine that you go through and then
You catch your breath and winter starts again
And everyone else is spring bound
But when I chose to live

There was no joy it's just a line I crossed
It wasn't worth the pain my death would cost
So I was not lost or found
And if I was to sleep

I knew my family had more truth to tell
And so I traveled down a whispering well
To know myself through them
Growing up my mom had a room full of books
And hid away in there

Her father raging down a spiral stair
Till he found someone most days his son
And sometimes I think my father, too, is a refugee
I know they tried to keep their pain from me
They could not see what it was for
But now I'm sleeping fine

Sometimes the truth is like a second chance
I am the daughter of a great romance
And they are the children of the war
Well the sun rose

With so many colors it nearly broke my heart
It worked me over like a work of art
And I was apart of all that
So go ahead push your luck

Say what it is you gotta say to me
We will push on into that mystery
And it will push right back
And there are worse things than that
'cause for every price and every penance that I could think of

It's better to have fallen in love
Than never to have fallen at all
'cause when you live in a world
Well it gets in to who you thought you'd be
And now I laugh at how the world changed me
I think life chose me
After all",After All

It shines like endless holy days

And the reason ended 
His life was lifted just above the law 
And now we have to live with what we did
With what we saw

Well, you mend your clothes and patch your roof
And slivers of God's shattered truth
Grow tender as the grass in clean-swept yards 
But a savior came and told us how
The truth was all around us now
Abandon house and field and gather up the shards

Well, a God descended 
And the reason ended

And now we have to live with what we did

Well, you build your faith with strength and duty
Build your love but there's a beauty
Well you know the scriptures tell
There are a few shards left in hell
And if we want a god we had to follow, follow him down

Pictures torn out of their frames
And orgies where we lost our names
All were gone with time's real desire 
Well, you ask how God can curse you thus
That's not a question asked by us

We fear we've lost the fire

If she thought of other men and
If she doubted John Lennon

Challenging the warring nations
With her paper installations
Did she guard her Yoko human heart

Yeah, they could talk about me
Throw me to the velvet dogs of pop star history
But I won't be your Yoko Ono

Others trade their gold for passion

Still, I hope you take me seriously

Deep as the sea of Yoko
You don't know a person like me
I could sell your songs to Nike

I could save your soul 
As only true love can change your mind
Make you leave your screaming fans behind

When John called the wind an opera
Making love with every chakra
When he said her voice would carry
And when he whispered old Chuck Berry
Only then would Yoko set him free

When I'm leaving a late night with some friends
And I hear somebody tell me it's not safe,
Someone should help me
I need to find a nice man to walk me home.

And I don't know how I survived,

I said ""No way, it's the last time I'm not breaking any law.""

'Cause she's leaving me

You're the best one that we ever had
You sit on your hair, and you're tall as my dad
And I'll make you a picture for college next year

Dar Williams,"I wonder if Yoko Ono
Ever thought of staying solo
If she thought of other men and
If she doubted John Lennon
Worrying that he'd distract her art 

Sitting in the Apple sessions
Giving John her music lessons
Challenging the warring nations
With her paper installations
Did she guard her Yoko human heart 

Well, they could talk about me
Yeah, they could talk about me
Throw me to the velvet dogs of pop star history
But I won't be your Yoko Ono
If you're not good enough for me 

Some will give their love for fashion
Others trade their gold for passion
I don't have the goods to start with
Never had the reins to part with
Still, I hope you take me seriously 

'Cause I think I could go
Deep as the sea of Yoko
You don't know a person like me
I could sell your songs to Nike
And for all you know
I could save your soul 
As only true love can change your mind
Make you leave your screaming fans behind

When John called the wind an opera
Making love with every chakra
When he said her voice would carry
And when he whispered old Chuck Berry
Only then would Yoko set him free 

Fame will come and vanish later
Transcendental love is greater
I think if we had this somehow
We'd be feeling famous right now
We'd be saying love is all you need 

And they could rag about me
Yeah, they could rag about me
Throw me to the velvet dogs of pop star history
But I won't be your Yoko Ono
If you're not good enough for me

Oh, no, and I won't be your Yoko Ono

Dar Williams,"The summer ends and we wonder where we are 
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
And you both look so young 
And last night was hard, you said 
You packed up every room 
And then you cried and went to bed 
But today you closed the door and said 
""We have to get a move on. 
It's just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead, 
We push ourselves ahead."" 

And it was cloudy in the morning 
And it rained as you drove away 
And the same things looked different 
It's the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer, 
When you move to another place 

And I feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same 
She walked alone all spring, 
She had a boyfriend when the summer came 
And he gave her flowers in a lightning storm 
They disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn 
And sometime in July she just forgot that he was leaving 
So when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves 
She held on to his sleeves 

And she doesn't want to let go 
'Cause she won't know what she's up against 
The classrooms and the smart girls 
It's the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer 
When you hang your flowers up to dry 

And I had a dream it blows the autumn through my head 
It felt like the first day of school 
But I was going to the moon instead 
And I walked down the hall 
With the notebooks they got for me 
My dad led me through the house 
My mom drank instant coffee 
And I knew that I would crash 
But I didn't want to tell them 
There are just some moments when your family makes sense 
They just make sense 

So I raised up my arms and my mother put the sweater on 
We walked out on the dark and frozen grass 
The end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer 
When you send your children to the moon 

The summer ends and we wonder who we are 
And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car 
And today I passed the high school, the river, the maple tree 
I passed the farms that made it 
Through the last days of the century 
And I knew that I was going to learn again 
Again, in this less hazy light 
I saw the fields beyond the fields 
The fields beyond the fields 

And the colors are much brighter now 
It's like they really want to tell the truth 
We give our testimony to the end of the summer 
It's the end of the summer, 
You can spin the light to gold.",Iowa
Dar Williams,"When you know the day is ending all too soon 
You're just two umbrellas one late afternoon 
You never know what you will say 
This is your favorite kind of day 
It has no walls, the beauty of the rain 
Is how it falls, how it falls, how it falls 

And there's nothing wrong but there is something more 
And sometimes you wonder what you love her for 
She says you've known her deepest fears 
'Cause she showed you a box of stained-glass tears 
It can't be all, the truth about the rain 
Is how it falls, how it falls, how it falls 

But when she gave you more to find 
You let her think she'd lost her mind 
And that's all on you 
Feeling helpless if she asked for help 
Or scared you'd have to change yourself 

And you can't deny this room will keep you warm. 
You can look out of your window at the storm 
But you watch the phone and hope it rings 
You'll take her any way she sings 
Or how she calls, the beauty of the rain 
Is how it falls, how it falls, how it falls 
How it falls, how it falls, how it falls",The Beauty of the Rain

What can you do with a day? 
What will you wake up and see?

And your truck is doing fine today, and everything is fine. 

And your truck will climb up slowly, and we'll see how far we've gone, 
And the hills will stretch before us 
They are rolling on and on, they are rolling on and on.

Because we will live forever, and our days are slow and dear,

Then I saw a bird fly away, and I could not ask again.

The thing she got from playing a nun she got from sleeping around.

And I've been running uphill, panting, punching at the air,
Fighting what's been pushing me down, like I can see it there

Dar Williams,"Oh my fair North Star, 
I have held to you dearly,
I had asked you to steer me, 
Till one cloud-scattered night, 
I got lost and in my travels I met Leo the lion, 
Met a king and met a giant, with their errant light, 

There's the wind and the rain, and the mercy of the fallen, 
Who say they have no claim to know what's right. 
There's the weak and the strong and the beds that have no answer, 
And that's where I may rest my head tonight. 

I saw all the bright people, 
In imposing flocks they landed, 
And they got what they demanded, 
And they scratched at the ground. 

Then they flew, and the field grew as sweetly for the flightless, 
Who had longing yet despite this, 
They could hear every sound. 

There's the wind and the rain, 
And the mercy of the fallen, 
Who say they have no claim to know what's right. 
There's the weak and the strong and the beds that have no answer, 
And that's where I may rest my head tonight. 

If your sister or your brother were stumbling on their last mile, 
In a self-inflicted exile, 
You'd hope they'd meet a humble friend. 

And I hope someday that the best of Falstaff's planners 
Give me seven half-built manors, 
Where half-dreams may dream without end. 

There's the wind and the rain, and the mercy of the fallen,

Plant a sentimental story,
Till they worship the sun,

So now you're gone and now we'll both find our ways
So close to our hearts
By the forge that leaves a stamp on each day
So close to our hearts
And we'll long to make great things in our lives
So close to our hearts
And we'll wonder if what we make survives
Oh to the beat of the heart
It's the work of the heart
But you were close to my heart",So Close to My Heart
Dar Williams,"The sun burns down
Leaving God's bright stamp
On Peach Branch Horse and Bible Camp
Where we're splashing in the water
Joined in song
Swimming with the Spirit the whole day long
I'm a teen for God

God is watching, teen for God
God is watching, teen for God

The girls have looks and the girls have rules
They came here from their Bible schools
They can make you pay attention
To the way you dress and eat
Make you trip over your own two feet and they
Kneel down on their towels at night
Their nightgowns glow with a Holy light
And we pray for the sinners
And their drunken car wrecks
And vow that I'll never get high
And have sex
I'm a teen for God

God is watching, teen for God
God is watching, teen for God

And God made every leaf on every tree
Each grain of sand
God has a plan
For what we're meant to be
I gotta wait for God

Dear Lord
I plan each day
The things I will not do or say
But I'm driven by a passion
Is it only there to tame?
It fills my heart and it calls my name and
This world that you made for us
I know, I know, is dangerous
So I ride a lot of horses
And I never even swear
Sorta like praying I'm just not there

Oh God

God is watching, oh God
God is watching

But God made love
God made the rivers run
And cowboy boots and bathing suits
And the boy's skin dries in the sun
You gotta help me, God

Help me know, four years from now
I won't believe in you anyhow
And I'll mope around the campus
And I'll feel betrayed
All those guilty summers I stayed
But then I'll laugh
That I fell for the lure
Of the pain of desire to feel so pure
And I'll bear all the burdens
Of my little daily crimes
Wish I had a God for such cynical times
Far from today

But for now I'm a sacred vessel
Rip me open, I spread your word
Like a milkweed pod
I'm a radio station,
Your Holy transmission
Even more, like a lightning rod

I'm a lightning rod, a teen for God

God is watching, teen for God
God is watching... a teen for God",Teen for God

Great big river rushin' through

I know the tides of the river
Know how fast and how deep

Flaunting our love like a dance step mastered, turning from left to right
But after all the colored lights are gone
Time will leave the ashes and the dawn
You rise and meet the day

I'm watching you go, it's like spying on hope ever onward with more to burn
Giving your hands and your heart to the weave of the world, though it fights each turn
But you do not give up so easily
That's how I know you won't surrender me
You rise and meet the day
It's all I need, it's all I need to know, it's all I need to know

And I love you all the time
I had always feared that some gloomy ingratitude would seize me
But you have held the dream like every morning finds
A way to hang the sun up in the sky
And now I think I have it too
The greatest part I learned from you
You rise and meet the day

And I can see kids, maybe yours, maybe not, oh oh oh, 
I can hear what they'll say
Laughing at pictures with the old-fashioned hats 
And the clothes that we're wearing today
And they will know the true and humble power
Of love that made it through the darkest hour

I was out here listening all the time

You were out there and you found me
I was out here listening all the time

Last night we drank in parking lots
And why do we drink? I guess we do it cause
And when I turned your station on
You sounded more familiar than that party was
You more familiar than that party
It's the first time I stayed up all night
It's getting light I hear the birds
I'm driving home on empty streets
I think I put my shirt on backwards

I know every tv set that has them lit
They preach that I should save the world
They pray that I won't do a better job of it
Pray that I won't do a better job

Instead another voice said I was just too late

I thought he was my first love

Between me and the one before

Like a house of cards
Said if he didn't come back
He'd find her flattened on the floor
And though I went and lived in my own hell
Thought that I could die as well
I let him go where he thought he had to go

Heavy words for granted
And I never took
Undeserved advantage
No I never took

So why don't you take it a little easy on me now?

Out on the road
I had so many questions
I thought I would explode
Just for some attention
Like an acolyte
I saw the flames of towering tapers
Almost proselytized by those gleaming piles of paper
Yeah I watched the power huddles
And the coats draped over puddles
And trust me baby, I'm the one you need

[Chorus]

Cause we all want to be the ones
Who lie, cheat, and slander
So we hold each other up to a higher standard
But I'll tell you what
I never try to make it hurt
Because when your heart
Just to be whole
The only thing that's hard is you

So here's what I took
I kept the wine and laughter
Until every pack
It just grew up and ever after
Through the peaks and twisty canyons
I made many great companions
Best of all is the one who loves me like you do

Dar Williams,"I've never had a way with women, but the hills of iowa make me wish that I could,
And I've never found a way to say I love you, but if the chance came by, oh I, I would,
But way back where I come from, we never mean to bother,
We don't like to make our passions other peoples concern,
And we walk in the world of safe people, and at night we walk into our houses and burn.

Iowa oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
How I long to fall just a little bit, to dance out of the lines and stray from the light,
But I fear that to fall in love with you is to fall from a great and gruesome height.
So I asked a friend about it, on a bad day, her husband had just left her,
She sat down on the chair he left behind, she said,
""what is love, where did it get me? whoever thought of love is no friend of mine.""

Ioway oh ooo oh, iowa oh ooooh ooo oh I-iowa
Once I had everything, I gave it up for the shoulder of your driveway and the words I've never felt.
And so for you, I came this far across the tracks, ten miles above the limit, and with no seatbelt, and id do it again,
For tonight I went running through the screen doors of discretion,
For I woke up from a nightmare that I could not stand to see,
You were a-wandering out on the hills of iowa and you were not thinking of me.

If I play a part
Can I be redeemed?

The leather volume shelves
But they only leave us wondering
Can we find ourselves
In the book of love, oh,
In the book of love

Looking for the one
Waiting on a day
Countless dinner parties
And all the games we play

Often sung processional
Solemn wedding vow

It's the woods! What do you see?
In all the spooky shadows, in the forest of green
Is there a windy path, angry ass woman who will eat you?
Sad-eyed lumberjack, savior who will greet you?
It's a different story for you and for me
Go to the woods and see

Out in the storybook land are many leagues of the wild
Wise and uncontainable as a windy-haired child
There are the youth truth movements and they're springing from the ground
Freak flag wavers and you cannot chop them down
Hey, it's the home of the brave, you'll get the threat of the free
Go to the woods and see

Are you afraid of the woods?
Are you afraid of the woods?

And if I was your memory, what would you do?
'Cause you know if you go back in time there's something waiting for you
You've got your forest path, reading, math, dappling of shade
You can just admit it, there's a promise that you made
And you can't have the past back, but you can hold me
Go to the woods and see

I am afraid of the woods

I am afraid of the woods
But what I fear more, what I fear most
More than the man, the beast, or the ghost
Is that the woods are disappearing

You know they just won't be there

It's a sign of life, its gentle victory
Well, today as I set to go
I saw a nest in a tree hollow

Oh Emily, you're a brave girl
With your husband gone to the other world
Sing a hymn while I light the fire
We'll be joined by a heavenly choir

Here's the tansy and the chamomile tea for you to drink
As the pain increases, well you only have to think
About a baby. We'll save the baby

I placed a holly sprig by the doctor's door
He has done this well and many times before
He'll be careful which way he goes
But he's been kind to us farm widows

And this I heard just the other day
That they came to buy, and you chose to stay
Soon a child will help you reap and sow
May he cast a long shadow

But you say the trials are coming, you have felt the gathering forces
And the galloping you hear is of one too many horses
But rest your head my darling girl, there won't be any danger
Any Christian ever loved an infant in a manger
Saves the baby. They'll save the baby

Now the pastor comes, shakes the farmer's hand
Says, ""The earth will bear like the promised land""

Morning light on polished swords and burnished pride
Ancient smiles encased in whalebone
Spines of steel from head to tailbone
Cannons poised to blast the turning of the tide

It's a sad and a strange thing
But it's time and I am changing
Into something good or bad, well that's your guess

As the fog was finally lifting
We had come to the shores of Summerday
Gently landing, we jumped out on the sand and found our way

We started digging a garden
And soon we found the woods that we'd call
The forest of Arden for to play

When we came to Summerday
On the shores of Summerday
We will live in Summerday

And we climbed a stony mountain
We were boisterous then quiet
As we thought about what instruments to make
Soon we started to build the uillean pipes and fine guitars
Then we scouted out the hollows for solitude and silence
And we found the places we could meet by the blue and glassy river
Under stars where the paper lanterns sway

In the streets of Summerday
Trust the night and trust the day
Sun and moon of Summerday

We are pilgrims in the land between religions
We are following our children
And we paint in different colors every day
And if we're true to our hearts they will grow up and want to stay
We will work beside them as they build modest houses
And on a misty April morning we'll rest the shovels on the fence
And die and become a summer day

Oh, the fields of Summerday
And the flowers of Summerday
They will live in Summerday

One is not heard and the other not seen
Too many bottles but each had a message inside

Lucky we are when the stars leave us singing a hymn
Or a dirge of the ocean is gone

Dar Williams,"The summer child is running, the summer child is running again.
The summer child is running, the summer child is running again
When you hear the feet and the sound of laughter,
Better step aside for the mayhem after
Here she comes, yeah the summer child is running again.

It's the stormy season, lighting flashes through the air
And the water bugs are busy spinning backwards in the rain.

The summer child is running, summer child is running again
The summer child is running, summer child is running again
And they're spinning out like old tin tops
One of them is down and all time stops,
Now she's up yeah the summer child is running again.

Come my freezing daughter, brave the icy water
Enter slowly under cherry blossoms,
Racing as you see the gates of summer.

There is time and time to come, underneath the golden sun,
And forever will melt slowly in a glass of lemonade.

And oh she's coming running, and oh she's coming running again,
The summer child is running, the summer child is running again.
Better have a seat, 'cause you won't run past her.
Try to take it in, every year she's faster.
Here she comes, yeah the summer child is running again.
The sun is shining and the summer child is running again.",Summer Child
Dara MacLean,"Hurting heart and broken wings
Cannot stop Your love from always finding me
No more days wasting away
I finally realize the gift inside of me

My strength alone will never be enough
But Your arms keep lifting me up

You tell me I've been made free
You give me everything I need to walk in my dreams
You whisper words that free my soul
You're the reason I have hope
You're everything I need and more
You made me
You made me free

I was caged in, then You opened
Every door that held me bound and You gave me the key
No more pressure I can just breathe
The girl I tried so hard to be, has always been me

You tell me I've been made free
You give me everything I need to walk in my dreams

Ten years back on the street
So many pages yet to turn

So many dreams still to burn
Oh but I don't cry for the wasted years
Or the twisted roads that got me here
I have been to the end of the earth

And I know what standing still is worth
In a perfect moment when the stars aligned

And every day of my life had led me to
That perfect moment with you

Well the wheel of fortune is going round and round

Tied around my hopes unraveling

Against my body

How far and why
I could throw the little charm up at the sky, curse your name a thousand times
In the end it would do no good

To the dangerzone beyond the light
And suddenly we are falling

But there ain't no stopping us now
I don't know if I'll be back tonight

It's just a machine inside of my head
And now all the wheels are turning
I'll think of the words we never said
And deep in my heart it's burning

But there is no stopping it now

You wait tonight
And we're waiting for the light

Into the fire we will run

Of my broken dream

There's a fire across the water
By the lake of the burning trees
And I called to you but you turn away
From your hands flies a small white dove

Take me to your promised land
Take the fire from my hand
Lead me to your rising sun
When my life is done

And no time which will go man
And I called to you but you turn away
In my hands lay your hands in star

Take me to the promised land

Darek Oleszkiewicz,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Darin,"Girl, I can't help myself
I'm stuck on the view
I like the way you do
The tricks that you do

You're flirting with the music
Like it's your boo
Got me lost in my fantasy
Picturing you and me

It's been a while and I still wonder
If I'll take your hand, take over
Control your body just for the night

Let me bless your hips just like you want to
Every step I share is with you
Let me do it right, do it right

You give me reason to party
I'll probably spend all my money
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Got your spell on everybody
Girl, you're an artist in naughty
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

And I don't see why I should stop
'Cause all we gotta do tonight is
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance

I feel the ice is melting
Because of you
This drink could never ever
Compete with you

The way you make me feel
It's hard to be true
I'm so drunk on the energy you
Putting inside of me

It's been a while and I still wonder
If I'll take your hand, take over
Control your body just for the night

Let me bless your hips just like you want to
Every step I share is with you
Let me do it right, do it right

You give me reason to party

'Cause all we gotta do tonight is

Ey Mr. DJ, please do me a favor
Turn it up a little bit
I wanna do this number

See, I got this little shorty
Acting like she really want it
And for sure she gonna get it
And she give me, give me, give me

You give me reason to party
I'll probably spend all my money
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Got your spell on everybody
Girl, you're an artist in naughty
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

And I don't see why I should stop

Darin,"I was walking past this woman
Just the other day
From her neck
I felt the very same aroma
She was dipped in that cologne
That you used to spray
I just frozed and realized
That you are gone now

Can't believe
That you and I are separated
Not living together
Remember when you said that night
That you and I would be forever
Reminiscing as the tissue
Wipe the tears away
Wonder if I'm gonna wake up
From this coma

That's when it hit me
Like a flashback
On how it used to be
When you and I were still in love
It hit me like a flashback
Something that reminded me
I can't believe that you are gone 
I can't believe that you are gone

I was driving past your
Neighborhood the other day
Couldn't help from
Staring at your open window
The I heard your favorite song
That you used to play
My whole world just crashed
Like a cymbal

Can't believe
That you and I are separated
Not living together
Remember when you said that night
That you and I would be forever
What I wouldn't do to have you
Coming back my way
Now I'm standing brokenhearted
Lost and single

That's when it hit me
Like a flashback
On how it used to be
When you and I were still in love
It hit me like a flashback
Something that reminded me
I can't believe that you are gone 
I can't believe that you are gone

Just like a time machine
Taking me back to yesterday
A million thoughts
Are running through my head
I think I'll go insane miss you so much
I'm going crazy crazy crazy
Feels like I stumble in a storm
And I can't find my way back
'Cause I just realized I lost
The most precious thing that I had
I'm going crazy crazy crazy

That's when it hit me
Like a flashback
On how it used to be
When you and I were still in love
It hit me like a flashback
Something that reminded me
I can't believe that you are gone
I can't believe that you are gone",Flashback

Only I came clean and

Can you please explain
Why you flip the coin around

But I never been in bed
With another lady trust me it's true
And the proof that you claim that you got
Is nothing but a
Way for you to come up
With an excuse
To smooth and slowly get away
Too afraid to tell it
Straight to my face
Six years I stayed with you
Laid with you
Is this how you gonna play
It's OK it's alright
Go ahead and scram
By the night that you wake up

The road just seems longer
Like in a box I'm not getting out
Wanna feel stronger
But the room is getting smaller
Cause all I think about is her

Watching the seasons fly
Going around in circles
Why,Why you left me all alone
Thinking why you can't come home
The nights are killing me 
Without you baby I can't sleep
You took my heart out , kept it well
Now you're gone",Seasons Fly

Together as one
You brighten my days
Just like the sun
When everything round
It starts turning weather
We always survive
'Cause we're in this together
Whoever said that we can never hold on
And don't know how I found my star (Baby you are my star)
Now I'm happy I stood up for so long
And baby this is where our story starts
I can't stop can't stop this love
No matter what they say I love you

And we were strong enough to fight for this life

Now I can't lead away
'Cause I've opened my arms
You're here to stay
Deep in my heart
You say that we couldn't
But we did make it work
And nothing can stop not even 2 different worlds

Darin,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Catholic choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world, oh

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in.

Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Catholic choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
(Oh, oh, oh)

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

And how you make me feel when I'm with you.
You never getting what you say.
You do your things your own way.
The way your life's such a mess.
Colors they don't match when you dress.
The way you laugh at yourself.
That could never be no one else.

You're perfect.
Don't change a thing.
You're perfect.
You're everything I need.
I like the way you're not.
Typical, usual, superficial visual.
Just the way you are.
You're perfect.

The funny little style you dance.
The silly way you pose to photographs.
It doesn't matter what they say.
Cause you like all the attention anyway.
Out by the pool, the party's getting hot.
You are the first to take your clothes off.
The way you play, you rock my whole world.
For me there's only really one girl.

You're perfect.
Don't change a thing.
You're perfect.
You're everything I need.
I like the way you're not.

So what's the point of lying
Now can't u see I want ya I want ya girl

Now I can be committed
I'll work that body like a nine to five
I might as well admit it
And as I grab your hips
I watch u lick your lips

U know I'm about to kiss u
Can't wait to taste the honey from the hive
To think I almost missed u
And now I'm standing here about to
Cash my chips

Darin Leong,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",Goodnight
Darina,"Lo sabemos que es tiempo quien decidirá si seguiremos tu y yo
Los momentos que fueron nuestros los voy a guardar en el corazón
Es que me hace tanto daño imaginarme sin ti
Tengo tanto miedo de que ya no vuelvas a mí

Nunca me olvides por favor
Recuerda todo lo que fuimos tu y yo
Nunca te alejes de mi amor
Guárdame en tu corazón

Cada instante, cada beso, me hicieron sentir que ya eras parte de mí
Y té extraño cuando pienso que podrías estar tan solo a un paso de aquí
Es que me hace tanto daño imaginarme sin ti
Tengo tanto miedo de que ya no vuelvas a mí

Nunca me olvides por favor
Recuerda todo lo que fuimos tu y yo
Nunca te alejes de mi amor
Guárdame en tu corazón

",Nunca Me Olvides
Dario,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye",Lately

Searching for that missing key
Unlock a new

Climb the highest mountain range
Then we took the longest train
Looking for our
Perfect refrain

I hear voices in the sky
(In the sky)
In the sky
(In the sky)

Hidden rhythms in the rivers run
Blinding beats in the desert sun
Hear them today
Play all as one

Distant voices in a far off sky
Led us to the elusive prize
To the new sound
We testify

And forsake me

And you break me

A la fête des sambas.

Et les fanfares dans ce joyeux tinta marre

Darius,"I thought I knew you
Better than I knew myself girl,
I thought I found you
Hiding in the strength that's in your eyes,
But now I see you
Burning all the bridges in your world,
Now I feel you 
Sinking in the quicksand of your lies 

Can't you see that you're slipping away?
Can't you hear what I'm trying to say?
(You're better than that?)

[Chorus:]
Better than that
Stronger than that
(You're worth much more)
You're better than that
And you can turn back
(What's tried is torn)
Better than that
Stronger than that
(You're worth much more)
I'm telling you its killing you 
It's drowning you, it's spilling you over
(What's tried is torn)

I thought you knew how
To chase away the demons of blind trust,
I thought you knew now
It's all about temptation 
Changed by choice,
But girl you're crazy 
You're hanging onto reasons 
Turned to rust,
You're eyes are hazy, 
You've gone and lost the velvet 
In your voice 

Can't you see that you're slipping away?
Can't you hear what I'm trying to say?
(You're better than that?)

[Chorus]

I told you once, I told you twice
I told you baby
Now there's nothing more to say 
I'm missing the girl I knew,
While kissing the broken you,
But it's not up to me...

So don't back, face up to the facts
And you can turn back 
You're better than that.

Better than that, stronger than that, 
Wiser than that, bigger than that
You're better than the devil in you
Tellin' you how, pulling you down,
Spilling you ?????- but it's up to you",Better Than That
Darius,"Feelin' blue
While I'm trying to forget the feeling that I miss you
Feelin' green
When the jealousy swells and it won't go away in dreams

Feelin' yellow
I'm confused inside
A little hazy but mellow
When I feel your eyes on me

Feelin' fine, sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes, I'm color blind
You make me color blind

Feelin' red
When you spend all your time with your friends and not me instead
Feelin' black
When I think about all the things that I feel I lack

Feelin' jaded
When it's not gone right
All the colors have faded
Then I feel your eyes on me

Feelin' fine, sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light
When I close my eyes I'm color blind
You make me color blind

Blinded by the light you shine
The colors fade completely
Blinded by you every time
I feel your smile defeat me

I'm color blind
I just can't deny this feeling

Nobody told me you'd feel so good
Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile

Darius,"So, what's it all about?
I can't work you out
There's a chemistry between us, getting hard to disguise
Still you're holding back
Some kind of panic attack
Treading water when you really should be turning the tide

Don't spend a lifetime waiting
Don't tell me no, just let go

If you want it, then you've got it
Don't let this moment pass you by
Take a long shot, and give it all you got
You'll never know unless you try
You can only sink or swim
Baby, just dive in

So what's the worst thing
That could be happening?
You test the water, and you find that it's a little too hot
But I'm imagining
The taste of salt on your skin
Make your move, you've gotta choose, are you ready or not?

Don't waste a lifetime waiting
You know it's now, so turn around

If you want it, then you've got it
Don't let this moment pass you by
Take a long shot, and give it all you got
You'll never know unless you try
You can only sink or swim

Just dive in, just dive in, let's dive in
Into the blue, into the deep, into the mood tonight, dive in

If you want it, then you've got it

Darius,"How can I sleep tonight?
Tell me how Mars survived
Fallen with stars, she opened her arms
Venus was in my sky

How could it pass me by?
You silently served my time
Even through chains, rust and the rain
You pulled away the tide

Girl in the moon, I'm half way there
Girl in the moon, I see you everywhere
Help me find a way of falling, closer to you
Girl in the moon, girl in the moon

How could I weep tonight?
Touch and our tears collide
Gravity spins me into your wings
And covers me with your light

Girl in the moon, I'm half way there
Girl in the moon, I see you everywhere
Help me find a way of falling, closer to you
Girl in the moon, girl in the moon

You're the silent silver lining my cloud
You're the secret flame that never burns out
Pull away this veil and rise into view
Girl in the moon
I need you, I need you

Help me find a way of falling, closer to you

But I've just got this sinking feeling

So who's gonna drown now the dam's about to break?
Tell me if it's me, I've gotta know
I'm strong enough to tell you that it's more than I can take
I'm just hanging by a thread
Got a feeling I'm in over my head
Can't wait until tomorrow, I've gotta know tonight

I feel naked in your eyes
I'm so out of control, it feels like I'm free-wheeling
Are we running out of time?
I've gotta find a way to stop this feeling

Couldn't care less about what I said or done 
I didn't mean it its not what I meant to say

About what you think about me 
Maybe too much, I've been puttin' on a front

Darius,"Eleven days, a dozen nights
A thousand tears and you are my shoulder
From summer's haze, on morning light
The sun is rising just like I told you

If you fall, I'll never let your spirit break
If you call, I'll always soothe the cries you make
If it's all I can do, I'll slowly kiss your dreams awake
You're not alone for heavens sake, Mercury rising

From winter skies a cold embrace
The shadows meet and they drag you under
The moonlight's mine and yours to chase
Your star is rising beyond your wonder

If you fall, I'll never let your spirit break
If you call, I'll always soothe the cries you make
If it's all I can do, I'll slowly kiss your dreams awake
You're not alone for heavens sake, Mercury's rising
You're not alone for heaven sake

Your tears run so freely, your fears run so deeply down
The pressure is breaking, quicksilver awaking now
Can you feel it rise? Can you see it rise?
Droplets of dreams that you touched, disappear
There's change in the weather and wind in your hair
And Mercury's rising, Mercury's rising
Rising, rising, Mercury's rising

Eleven days, a dozen nights
A thousand tears and you are my shoulder
From summer's haze, on morning light
The sun is rising just like I told you
",Mercury Rising
Darius,"He tells you when,
He tells you why, 
He tells you wherefore -
What to do and how it's done,
And how to be for him -
It's all about control,
It's all about control.
You're his life,
You're his strength,
But he's you're weakness,
He knows you care,
Knows you give,
But he couldn't care less -
He fits you to his mould,
Chipping at you soul...

CHORUS
It tears me up
To see the way that he treats you,
To see the way that he brings you 
down and down -
He's turning you inside out,
It breaks me up
To see the way that you take it,
To see the way that he spins you 
round and round
Turning you upside down...
Mockingbird,
Mockingbird...

Afraid to leave,
Afraid to lose, 
Afraid of living -
You turn to him,
You turn to me,
But it lies in you -
It's waiting to be found,
It's waiting to be found,
So feel your heart,
Feel your pain,
Feel your anger,
If you fight the fear,
find the words -
You'll find the answer...
Like a cat held upside down,
You'll land feet on the ground...

You never know
What life will bring -
Trust your spirit
Find your wings,
Find your voice
And let it sing
Let it sing...

Darius,"She's got a blind smile and a soft touch
A cute little dimple when she laughs too much
They say you fall hard when you meet her
Such is her allure

She's got a quick wit and a fast tongue
But she doesn't seem to know that she's the one
They say she cheats charm when she whispers
She's devilishly pure

You'd see if you knew her
She doesn't know
But its time I told her so

When I see your blushes
From a compliment of mine it touches
Something inside I'm getting rushes
The adrenaline rushes
And I'm fascinated
That you really don't know how to take it
When I look at you that way you feel naked
And I'm so into you
I'm getting rushes

She's about five nine
Got a sexy stride
With long tanned legs that she shouldn't hide
With a fine air of innocence
Nonchalance in every move
She's a sweet sensation tease temptation

She looks good enough to eat
She's a fallen angel with a devilish streak
And so they say
Like with like will finally meet

You'd see if you knew her
She doesn't know
But its time I told her so

[Chorus]

And I like it and I want more
And I like it and I want more
And I like it and I want more
Never felt it like this before

It's more than adrenaline rushes
It's the touch and the smell of skin rushes

I call it ""butterflies""

How I hung on every move
How I treasured every touch
How I can't believe you felt the same
How I can't believe we're out of time

So if you're thinking about grabbing your keys
Then I think you better let me know

'Cause baby I've been reading your kiss
And there ain't no fire without smoke
When I see the way you throw those hips
Then I know I gotta take you home, I gotta love you babe

'Cause I love to love to love
To love to love to love

You really shook me babe
Got me cooked and hooked like a junkie
You're hot like a rock star
I've been cocked and shot but I wannabe

You kiss like a butterfly, sting like a honey bee
You got the seven wonders
And I'm going under
'Cause you throw me off my feet

Gotta have your number on my phone
Can't have you going home alone
I'll never lock you down or fence you round
'Cause I feel you loud

And I love to love to love
To love to love to love

You know I'd really hate to see you leave
But I'd really love to watch you go
So if you're thinking about grabbing your keys
Then I think you better let me know

'Cause baby I've been reading your kiss
And there ain't no fire without smoke
When I see the way you throw those hips
Then I know I gotta take you home, I gotta love you babe

'Cause I love to love to love
To love to love to love

Thinking 'bout a greener kinda grass
Take a trip to my side of the tracks
I'll never lock you down or fence you round
'Cause I feel you loud

And I love to love to love
To love to love to love

You know I'd really hate to see you leave
But I'd really love to watch you go
So if you're thinking about grabbing your keys
Then I think you better let me know

'Cause baby I've been reading your kiss
And there ain't no fire without smoke
When I see the way you throw those hips
Then I know I gotta take you home, I gotta love you babe

'Cause I love to love to love

Darius,"Sunrise will never feel the same
Mesmerized and I can't escape
And I just can't breathe when you're not with me
I wish you could see the things I've seen
But I can't control the way it goes
And I pray one day you'll know

Only you can see me when I cry
Only you can hold me like a child
Only you can make me miss brown eyes
Only you can love me like you do

Sunset will never feel the same
Regret is pouring like the rain
If I could hit the road and find you
Could you forget the things you know?
How can I breathe when I can't hold you?
How can I ever let you go?

Only you can see me when I cry
Only you can hold me like a child
Only you can make me miss brown eyes, your eyes
Only you can leave my heart so bruised
Only you can change the life I choose
Only you can love me like you do

And I need you now to save me
Teach me, forgive me now
'Cause only you can reach me, heal me
I'm holding out for you, I'm lost without you

Only you can see me when I cry
Only you can hold me like a child
Only you can make me miss brown eyes, your eyes, yeah
Only you can leave my heart so bruised
Only you can change the life I choose
Only you can love me like you do

So help me, so save me, reach me, feel me
So hold me like a child
Only you can make me miss brown eyes
Only you can love me like you do

Darius,"You see I wear myself just as I please
I don't have my nerves sewn on my sleeves
As I walk this path the street is unknown
But I'm afraid to ask can I do this alone

I can't do what I want
That's what I choose
I can't see what I want
I've got nothing to lose

I believe in a life
Where nobody rules
Yeah, I can't do what I want
But I can't do without you

Some might say that I find it hard to let go
And I fool myself, God only knows
There's a lot to be said, a lot to be said
For spending the time without you in my head
But you're there in my mind

I can't do what I want
That's what I choose
I can't say what I want
With nothing to lose

I believe in a life
Where nobody rules
Yet I can't do what I want
But I can't do without you

I believed so blindly
The brown grass was green
I was a fool

How can it be
When I'm turning back I see you
I'm really seeing me

You see I wear myself just as I please
I don't have my nerves sewn on my sleeves

I can't do what I want
That's what I choose
I can't say what I want
With nothing to lose

I believe in a life
In a life where nobody rules
Yet I can't do what I want
But I can't do without you

I can't do without you
I can't do without you
I can't do without you
Without you

I can't do without you
And I can't do without you
Don't want to feel without you
And I can't do without you
Don't want to feel without you

Darius,"Is there in any love in your heart?
Is there any blood in your veins?
If there any feeling in you
To give away?
The ground beneath my feet on wheels
I wander if you know how
That feels
Baby where are my nerves of steel
When I need them?

Save me from this madness baby
Save me from the shame
Save me from this feeling baby
Wipe these damn tears away

I got my bones beneath my skin
That easily break
I got feelings that I just can't escape
I got dreams that mostly
Keep me awake

Save me from this madness baby
Save me from the shame
Save me from this feeling baby
Wipe these damn tears away

You got my soul in your solar system
But you keep my heart out of hand
As if I'm only human
As if I never missed you
As if I never should

Save me from this madness baby
Save me from the shame
Save me from this feeling baby
Wipe these damn tears away

Darius Brooks,"Verse #1: I wish I could tell you just what I want,
And you give it to me just like that
The truth of the matter
What I want just might hurt me
And you won't let me go out like that
You know my end before my beginning
Calculated blessings down to the penny
So I'll cry 'til you tell me, 'Let it go, let it be'
Oh, Lord Your will is what's best for me.
Verse #2: No rubies, no diamonds, no silver or no pearls
YOUR WILL

There are some lessons that I had to learn
That I would not trade in for the world
You told me that my trials Only come to make me strong
And with this you promised, Never to leave me alone.

So I'll cry til you tell me, 'Let it go, let it be'
Oh,oh, oh Lord Your will is what's best for me. 

Your word is true, and it will last You will guide the future as you have the past.

At times I cannot see, but I know that it's so You love me more than I'll ever know

So I'll cry til you tell me, 'Let it go let it be

Darius de Haas,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Darius Rucker,"I'd like to ask you from the start
If you could pull me out of the dark.
Or if our love could fall apart like cookies crumble.
See, I'm a demon on the loose.

Darius Rucker,"We met on the shore of a lemonade lake
Weeping willows looked down where we lay
Orange blossoms I smell in your hair
Butterfly, flutter by, butterfly by

Waterfalls send your ripples to us
Here on the shore of the lemonade lake
Pond lilies play hide and seek with the fish
Rabbit run, run rabbit, rabbit run by

Roaring mountain is standing close by
Covered with snowdrops and glistening with dew
I hear the sound of a small hummingbird
I took your hand and I waltzed off with you

Come to the top of the mountain with me
Jump on a cloud and we'll float to and fro
Seeing the countryside covered with grass
And the top of the mountain with candy-floss and snow

Butterfly lazily drinking the sun
Lavishly sprinkled and painted with gold
Here in the land of the mist and the lake
Me and my true love will never grow old",Butterfly

Things I thought would be my joy, turn to pain

Darius Rucker,"I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I wasn't coming back, said I'd had enough
Saw you in the rear view standing, fading from my life
But I wasn't turnin' 'round
No not this time

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been, should've been all worked out
I know what I felt, and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

When we make choices, we gotta live with them
Heard you found a real good man and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today
If I never drove that car away?

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been, should've been all worked out

Darius Rucker,"Last thing I remember
I met the boys down at the jamma
We had a few beers, and a few shots

I woke up the next day
with cotton mouth and a headache
trying to connect all the dots

staring up at the ceiling
I got that funny feeling
Looked over and I, I saw my ex-girlfriend

I felt like a fool, and that's when I knew
I'd been drinking and dialing again

[Chorus]
so the next time you think I've had to much to drink
and you tell me i shouldn't drive home
when you take my keys, oh i'm begging you please
Go on take my cell phone

Cause i have been known
after tying one on to call up a couple old friends
tell em that i love em, or maybe don?t cuss em
when i'm drinking and dialing again

[Chorus]

if you've ever heard, me slurring my words
on your voice mail around 4 a.m.
you'll have to forgive me, and blame it on my whiskey
I was drinking and dialing again

I've been drinking and dialing again",Drinkin' and Dialin'
Darius Rucker,"I heard every word you said
And trying hard to understand
Exactly what it is, you need, from me

There's no telling where we'll go
But as far as I can see, it'll be you and me
Just the way it's supposed to be

Our time, let's take our time
I just want to look in your eyes

Darius Rucker,"I'm eight years old
Daddy's cuttin' my hair
Aqua Velva on his hands.
Momma's in the kitchen
Got fried green tomatoes
Poppin' in the pan.
I see a home run, a goal line,
Holding my friend gettin' baptized.
I see her beautiful face under that veil
As she's walking down the aisle.

[Chorus]
I can hear the sirens comin'
Smell the gasoline and smoke.
I'm pinned against this steering wheel
Pretty sure my arm is broke.
I can see the flames and my life
Flashing right before my eyes.
I hope they get to me in time.

I could see the headlights swerve
So I cut the wheel to the right.
Last thing I saw was that bottle turned up
As he crossed that center line.
I see tiny hands, brown eyes
Fallin' to sleep to that lullaby.
And you slide over next to me
As I turn out the lights.

[Chorus]

Please Lord, I'm beggin' you
Don't let me go like this.
There's so much left that I want to do
So much I don't want to miss.

Flashing right before my eyes.
I hope they get to me in time.
Just get to me in time.
Please get to me in, in time.",I Hope They Get to Me in Time
Darius Rucker,"[Verse 1]
Why do we hate? Why do we suffer? 
Why do we make our mistakes, and constantly blame one another? 
Why is there war, and why is there killing? 
Have we forgotten some secret we knew back when we were just children?

[Chorus]
If I had wings, I'd fly up to heaven. 
I'd look down from the clouds, on every thing
then I could find all the things we've been missin'. 
I would have all the answers, if I had wings.

[Verse 2]
Like why I am here, and where did I come from
and where would I go when my time here on this earth is done,
and what would I leave that would go on forever?
Oh no, and what can I do while I'm here to make someone's life better?

[Chorus: Repeats]",If I Had Wings
Darius Rucker,"He didn't have to wake up
He'd been up all night
Laying there in bed listening
To his new born baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee
He splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says
It gonna be OK

It wont be like this for long
One day soon we'll look back laughin'
At the week we brought her home
This phase is gonna fly by
So baby just hold on
It wont be like this for long

Four years later bout four thirty
She's crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at preschool
She's clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him
He says what can I do
She says now don't you worry
This will only last a week or two

It wont be like this for long
One day soon we'll look back laughin'
At the week we brought her home
This phase is gonna fly by
So baby just hold on
It wont be like this for long

One day soon she'll be a teenager
And at times you'll think she hates him
Then he'll walk her down the isle
And he'll raise her veil
But right now she up and crying
And the truth is that he don't mind
As he kisses her good night
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
Cause he already knows
It wont be like this for long
One day soon that little girl is gonna be
All grown up and gone
Yeah this phase is gonna fly by
He's trying to hold on
It won't be like this for long
It won't be like this for long",It Won't Be Like This for Long
Darius Rucker,"Grandpa Campbell would sit upon his front porch
And I'd be right there just sittin' on his knee
He'd tell stories about love and feast and famine
And I'd hang onto every word that he would breathe
He'd say boy as you walk through this life
Here's a little wisdom that'll help you get by

You gotta live to learn
You gotta crash and burn
You gotta make some stances
And take some chances
You gotta live and love
And take all life has to give

So you can learn to live

Well I left home and I went to carolina
I didn't sail off just to see what I could see
I did some things that I wasn't really proud of
Sometimes life just got the best of me
But I'd always think back to those days
And I know what grandmpa campbell would say
He'd say

I found me a woman who loves me just for me
All those mistakes I thought that I was making

Darius Rucker,"I woke up again this morning
And wouldn't you know it, pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain

'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

I know I've said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm saying I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leaving
And I'm the backside of a mule

And I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong

In this king size empty bed

Darius Rucker,"Way back when
She did a hundred and ten
In her dad's old Chevrolet
And she once climbed
Way up high
To paint her name on a water tank

She's got that little red rose
On her big toe
Tattooed in Myrtle Beach
Went to Mardis Gras
With her mother-in-law
Got a suitcase full of beads

She's walked on fire
And jumped out of planes for fun
But loving me's the craziest thing
That she's ever done

[Chorus]
She's living on faith
I'm chasing my dreams
I fly and fall
'Til I unravel at the seams
She'd never played it safe
Never walked when she could run
But loving me's the craziest thing
That's she's ever done

Left the bright lights drove down 95
To a sleepy southern town
Gave up a sweet gig to have a couple kids
Chasing her around
All her friends roll their eyes and grin
When she says that I'm the one
They say loving me is the craziest thing
That she's ever done

[Chorus]

She likes walking on a tightrope
Dancing on a ledge
But she's knows I'll catch her
If she falls off the edge

That she's ever done",The Craziest Thing

To early to drink beer?

I don't know, what beach this is,
I don't know, what day this is,
I don't know, if I packed enough clothes to wear,
And I don't care.

Hey man do you think those are real or you think there fake?
You mean those? Right there,

Do you want the blond or the brunette?
Or the one with the long red hair,

I don't know, where she learned to kiss,
I don't know, if that's her boyfriend over there,

Says we've been up all night

Is this really goodbye?
Maybe I should say something
Maybe you'd change your mind
Maybe, maybe
Buy a little more time

But I got nothing
No magic words
To stop your leaving
To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm starring into a space
Prayin' please, please let me think of something

I watch you pack your things
You look down at your ring
Slowly slip it off and then
You lay it on our bed

Maybe I should pick it up
And get down on my knees
Tell you what you wanna hear
And give you what you need

But I got nothing
No magic words

To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm starring into a space

And those girls out in California,
They don't understand.
They don't like it when I hold the door,
When I say yes ma'am.
They act like I've done something wrong,
And they give me the evil eye.
I say ""honey, I'm sorry,
I'm in a southern state of mind.""

Where they drink sweet tea
And they raise you to be polite.

And the cars passin' by.

And say that boy just ain't right.

You can hear it when I talk.

And her momma laughing in my arms
There's a sound of rain on the rooftop
And the game's about to start
I don't really know how I got here
But I'm so glad that I did
And it's crazy to think that one little thing
Could have changed all of this

Maybe it didn't turn out like I planned
Maybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky man

For every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
'Cause it led me here to this

Like the girl that I loved in high school
Who said she could do better
Or the college I wanted to go to
Till I got that letter
All the fights and the tears and the heartache
I thought I'd never get through
And the moment I almost gave up
All led me here to you
I didn't understand it way back when
But sittin' here right now
It all makes perfect sense

Every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
'Cause it led me here to this

Oh I cried when my momma passed away
And now I got an angel
Looking out for me today
So nothing's a mistake

Every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
Everything I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
'Cause it led me here to this

It led me here to this",This
Darius Rucker,"What makes a man work until it's kids too old to kiss and hug
He won't climb another imaginary mountain when he is in love enough
What makes a man build a kingdom all that he'll lose his woman
How high is too high, how big is too big
How far will we go just to slip of the edge?

Yeah, we all fall down
Live takes us out
The sky starts spinning
When our heads get above the clouds
The higher we fly the harder it feels when we hit the ground

[Chorus]
Yeah, we all fall down
Yeah, we all fall down

How does a man kick himself up when he smack himself down
Tell me where does he find the courage to turn its world back on well?
Where he breaks down and cries like someone just died
What can you say about the men he used to be?
When he can even speak and he is dying to scream

That, we all fall down
When we find out
That the sky's not spinning when our heads get above the clouds
The higher we fly the harder it feels when we hit the ground

[Chorus]

If he's the only one to blame
And the only one to loose
How low he must go
To win back his sole

[Chorus]",We All Fall Down
Darius Rucker,"Always there, 
When my world starts closing in, 
Something to hold, 
No matter how long it's been. 

Gets me high, 
Then knocks me to the ground. 
Soothes my mind, 
And then begins to break me down. 

Whiskey and you, 
Ain't nothing I can do, 
But come crawling back to, 
Whiskey and you. 

I never asked you to love me, 
I never begged you to stay. 
But I never want you to leave me, 
I wouldn't have it any other way. 

Whiskey and you, 
Ain't nothing I can do, 
But come crawling back to, 
Whiskey and you. 

As darkness finds the candle, 
And the flame stops flickering, 
Girl I know and I hope, 
It won't be too long, 
'Till we light it up again. 

Whiskey and you, 
Ain't nothing I can do, 
But come crawling back to, 
Whiskey and you. 

Whiskey and you, 
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing I can do, 
But I keep crawling, I keep coming back to. 
Whiskey and you.",Whiskey and You
Darius Rucker,"Church bells ringing on our wedding day
Climbed in that limo and rode away
Guess you'll always hear some people say
They're never gonna make it.

We settled in and we settled down
In this quiet little seaside town
You were the rock I built my world around
And life won't ever break it

We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
We are two, True Believers

It wasn't easy getting here today
Sometimes you stumbled or I lost my way
But every roadblock was a chance to say;
Take my hand I'm here beside you.

We worked and made it through the toughest parts
Now every days another chance to start,
To look around and see that where we are
Is where we were trying to get to

We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
We are two, True Believers

We are one before our God in Heaven
We are one road when the going gets rough
We are one now and forever
We are one name, one life, one flame

We are one heartbeat in the darkness
We are one lasting answered prayer
We are one unbroken promise
And We are two, True Believers

We are two, True Believers",True Believers

'Cause I've had more than a little time
So it's on your mark, get ready, set

So I guess I've learned to live without you
I just don't know how to love without you

She don't have to look just like you
No her eyes don't have to be that blue
It's hard to give someone a chance
When you can't get past that second dance

I can walk into a room without you
And I don't get drunk and talk about you
So I guess I've learned to live without you

And I can't believe how far I've come

I can walk into a room without you

How can we go on tonight and not even touch one another?
How can we say we're still in love and not be lovers?
How did we get here, where you can be right there
And I can be with you and miss you?

I remember the time, when every time you saw me you had to kiss me
But lying here tonight

Darius Rucker,"Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my Momma off where she needed to go

It had four bald tires
With the ceiling falling and the windows stuck
But the only thing I cared about was the radio

We turned it on, turned it up to 10
And everybody would jump on in

Ridin’ down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I’ll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio

A real, real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio

Grabbed my girl
We looked for somewhere to watch the stars
A perfect place to put it park and take it slow

She sang along
To even the ones that she barely knew
Still sounded good, a little louder too
But we didn’t care

I looked at her, she looked at me
I’ll never forget that melody

Ridin’ down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I’ll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio

A real, real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio

Hey ya’ll be quiet, that’s my favorite song
Hey man, turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on

Ridin’ down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I’ll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio

A real, real good song
We'll know it when it comes on

Darius Rucker,"November of '43
On a boat comin' 'cross the sea
He left a boy, came back a man
She started running' when she saw his face
It'd been 655 days
Since she held his hand
He got down on one knee
and pulled out that ring
That he bought in Aberdeen
And when it hit that New York sky

It shined just like a spotlight
A star up in the night sky
The kind of thing that takes your breath away
Her eyes sparkled like that diamond
With love beaming from 'em
The kind of light that's never gonna fade
It's gonna shine

For the next 55 years
Through the laughter and the tears
My grandma always fore that band
through atom bombs and a baby boom
Dr. King and a man on the moon
No it never left her hand
On the day she passed away
Mama put it on a chain
Now and then on special days
Mom would wear it around her neck

And it would shine just like a spotlight
A star up in the night sky
The kind of thing that takes your breath away
Her eyes sparkled like that diamond
With love beaming from 'em
The kind of light that's never gonna fade
It's gonna shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

Mama said one of these days
I'd know why she gave me that ring
Sittin' here I know she was right
Oh, it's not the biggest stone you've ever seen
But girl I can promise you one thing
The rest of your life

It's gonna shine just like a spotlight
A star up in the night sky
The kind of thing that takes your breath away
your eyes sparkled like that diamond
With love beaming from 'em
The kind of light that's never, never, never gonna fade

It's gonna shine

I wanna hear a southern drawl and every word that lingers
I need a Sunday morning song by a just got baptized singer

I need a glass of sweet sun tea brewed out in the backyard
I wanna see a kudzu vine sneaking up on a junk car
I need to sit on my old back porch 'til the world lets go of my arm
I been away too long, oh somebody take me home

Lord have mercy on a poor boy's soul
Crank it up and make these big wheels roll
Can you get me there by the morning light
And make everything alright
'Cause I been away too long
Oh somebody take me home

I love this job, I do
But my soul is wearing thin
Oh I gotta get lost in where I'm from
And find myself again
Oh I been away too long

I wanna waste a day with my little man throwing me that old football
Soend sometime with Daddy's girls catching up on what's going on
Then remind the woman I love just how much I miss her when I'm gone

I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey, momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey, momma rock me

I'm running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey, momma rock me
Hey, rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey, momma rock me

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
Caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

Darius Rucker,"You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote
""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super ""naus""
You're a crooked dirty jockey
And you drive a crooked horse, Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut
And toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce!","You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"
Darius Rucker,"Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you’re the kinda girl that’s got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain’t nothing
They ain’t never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain’t nothing hotter

Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
I did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying ""Son it’s on""
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song

Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
I did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

Baby, baby, baby
You’re driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
I’m a long way away from where I’m from
But baby you feel like home

Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
I did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone

You’re so money, money, money

Darius Rucker,"Heaven knows that I'm usually wrong
And you're the first one to point it out
Don't even try to act like you don't know
What it is I'm talking 'bout
You know that I'm no know-it-all
But when I first saw you I thought

This could be
The start of something beautiful
This could be
The start of something magical
The kind of thing you look for all of your life
This could be
The start of something so unreal
This could be
Finally the real deal
I guess now and then
Baby, I'm right

Don't wanna really put you right on the spot
But I love the look you're giving me
I'm no genius but I know what we've got
That special kind of chemistry
Go on and roll those hazel brown eyes
Let's see where we're going tonight

This could be
The start of something beautiful

Darius Rucker,"I ain't ever been accused of recusing myself from a Friday night
Don't need no excuse to go out and cut loose beneath the neon light
Ain't got to twist my arm to get me off the farm
Just say the word, I bet I beat you to the bar

I'm up for just about anything as long as it's almost legal
I can fit in with any old crowd, long as there's a party, they're my kind of people
So if you're down with painting the town, I'll be around all night
You know I'm always good for a good time

I'm a pretty good guy in my nine to five, always walking the line
I'll lend a hand to a stranger or a friend if they need mine
You can count on me buddy, I'm free
If you've got a bead on a party in need

I'm up for just about anything as long as it's almost legal
I can fit in with any old crowd, long as there's a party, they're my kind of people

Darius Rucker,"That bucket of bolts in the driveway
It's old but it's still fast
And the weeds out in the front yard
When they're green, they look like grass
And this house we got
Well, it sure could use a couple shingles and a can of paint
But looking on the bright side
We're dry every time it rains

Yeah, I'm kicked back on the front porch
Drinking up this sunset
We ain't got a whole lot
But we got what we need
Yeah, I'm smiling 'cause I've been blessed
Sipping on the good stuff
This ain't a glass half empty thing
It's a half full Dixie cup

Kids chasing around that old dog
Being loud and dragging out toys
But you're missing out on a sweet sound
If all you hear is noise
And their mama sitting here beside me
Laughs and says, ain't it funny
Some people I know, well, they're flat broke
'Cause all they got is money

Yeah, I'm kicked back on the front porch
Drinking up this sunset
We ain't got a whole lot
But we got what we need
Yeah, I'm smiling 'cause I've been blessed
Sipping on the good stuff
This ain't a glass half empty thing

Some days I fall by the wayside
And let the devil have his way
He puts a hole in my cup
But this ain't one of those days, no

Well, I'm kicked back on the front porch

Hey, we ain't got a whole lot

Darius Rucker,"It's been five days since I shaved, I swear
My hair's gettin' long but I don't care
Lawn chair sitting, ain't going nowhere
A big old smile on my face
Pointin' out pictures in a cloudy sky
Craving me a piece of that pecan pie
Might lay in the grass and kill some time
Looking like I'm in a daze
But it ain't no purple haze

I ain't stoned on what you think
Just an afternoon sun that's starting to sink
I ain't drunk on nothing you can buy
Just a kiss from a woman and a look in her eye
What I'm on you don't need much
It's a little goes a long way kinda stuff
Yeah, I'm breathing, yeah, I'm feeling alright
I'm high on life

Gettin' buzzed by this bumble bee flying around
My day in the sun is my night on the town
Just me waking up is me getting down
Spinning like a tilt-a-whirl
Sitting on top of the world

I ain't stoned on what you think
Just an afternoon sun that's starting to sink
I ain't drunk on nothing you can buy
Just a kiss from a woman and a look in her eye
What I'm on you don't need much
It's a little goes a long way kinda stuff
Yeah, I'm breathing, yeah, I'm feeling alright
I'm high on life
I ain't saying that stuff is bad
But it's so low compared to the highs I have
Counting my blessings, kicking back
Sipping on sweet tea in a glass
And watching my baby laugh
Don't get much better than that

I ain't stoned on what you think
Just an afternoon sun that's starting to sink
I ain't drunk on nothing you can buy

Darius Rucker,"I remember that long line
Camping out there all night
Just for a chance to see that hair band

Got tickets for my first show
Didn't care about the back row
The day finally came
It was all worth the wait

Never heard nothing so loud
As the roar of the crowd
When the lights went down
And we all pulled 'em all out

Lighter up
Feel the love
Everybody swaying
Ridin' that wave
So alive
With the fire
We raised them high
And burned the night
Lighter up
Lighter up

Hit the stage with that first song
Never felt a groove so strong
Lights were so bright
We were coming alive

The words we didn't know-oh-oh
We all just sang whoa-oh-oh
Then she grabbed my hand
We started to dance

Never seen nothing like the roar of the flames
She gave me a kiss before she gave me her name

Lighter up
Feel the love
Everybody swaying
Ridin' that wave
So alive
You and I
We raised them high
And burned the night
Lighter up
Lighter up, oh

And just like the show-oh-oh
We didn't take it slow-oh-oh

Even watched the sun rise

Darius Rucker,"Baby, all these city lights
Are losing their shine
I need a little bit a get outta here
A little slow unwind
A little salt air and a sand bar
A lawn chair and a guitar
Singing sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
All night long
All night

I wanna get high
On some low country
Where the sun meets the water
And the nights get hotter
Sounds right on the money
Let's let that tide take us for a ride
Girl, wherever it wants to
I wanna get high
On some low country with you

Down there where the warm wind blows
Through the cypress trees
You take your worries like the pennies in your pocket
And you, you throw 'em in the sea
Get a sweet buzz from your long kiss
Better than any rum hitting my lips

A bad part of town needs a good cop
Kinda like a romantic night needs a sunset
Candlelight and a silhouette need the door
But I need you more
Kinda like a cup of coffee needs the a.m.
Hard times need a good friend
Kinda like a sinner's prayer when hope's gone
From a midnight drunk kneeling on a jailhouse floor

I need you more
Every touch, every kiss, every time
Your lips need mine
I need you more
Every look my way
Every second of the day that goes by
Even holding you tight in the middle of the night

You don't know how beautiful you are
You're never ready and you need more time
You say your jeans never fit you right

I hear you singin' to the radio
Sometimes you miss a couple high notes

Darius Rucker,"I never was the biggest or the fastest guy
I never hit a homerun when the game was tied
I knew from an early age I wasn't going to be
A doctor or the CEO of anything

So I sang, She Believes In Me
And I played, Fire On The Mountain
'Til I made my fingers bleed
I tried to stand out from the crowd
But most times I just struck out at the plate
So I sang

I wasn't cool enough to be a ladies man
It took me forever just to hold her hand
First time we kissed, she whispered, I love you
But I wasn't brave enough to say, I loved her too

So I sang, You Are So Beautiful To Me
And I played every note to Faithfully
I loved her with everything
But I couldn't think of anything to say
So I sang

No one believed in me as much as Mom
See, she worked overtime to buy my first guitar
When the angels called her home
My sister asked if I would speak
But there were no words to say how much she meant to me

So I sang, It Is Well With My Soul
And I played, I'm So Tired Of Being Alone
'Cause those were Mama's favorite songs
And what I felt would take too long to say
So I sang
Yes, I sang
So I sang",So I Sang

You can have Charleston
I'll pack up and leave
Maybe find a spot on the West Coast
Give you lots of room to breathe
With your new life and your new love
I won't get in your way
I'll just wish you well and I'll try like hell
To smile and walk away, from

My home, my heart
Where I was born and raised
Where one day they're gonna take my body
And lay it in a grave

But it's got to be this way
It's gonna break my heart to say, goodbye
But it'll kill me if I stay

Plus I could never rest
There're too many ghosts on this old coast
Too many memories

Where one day they're gonna take my body
And lay it in a grave

I might be passing through

That's all I'll do

You can have Charleston
I'll take these broken dreams
Load 'em in up in a suitcase

The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
'Cause everybody has already tried

Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually

If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?

What if I told you I don't plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family is gonna want you to stay
You know what I don't blame 'em

So I'll say
What I don't want to
And I'll just pray
You want what I do

Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you

And if these wounds fail to show the truth

To render a massive injustice
Striking the hebrews a mighty deathblow

Guaranteeing his fate in the abyss

Dark at Dawn,"On the edge of dawn
Light ends the dark of day
Mourning star at dusk
Brightens with our decay
Forward, just one step
Millions of miles away
Floating back in time
Titans without delay

Wellspring of youth

Drinking your sweet water
Falling like stones - so bitter our tears
Of the one and only truth
Well, you're my fountain
For some you're deep as graves
For others high as mountains

Neverending youth

Aching like Narcissus
Echo sings her song
Whispering words like ""Come with us""
Never to return
Hope, in all tears she's bathed
Bleeding hearts of pain
Nigh tend to be portrait

Dark at Dawn,"His silver sun is shining bright at night
To enlighten his way from dusk 'til dawn
The Goddes of all stars
Dressed in her cold black dress
Her rays of light - alike a rose's thorn

Melting her eyes with fire and heat

Ere daylight's disguise her beauty conceals
Goddes of the dark, please shine on me
Let my eyes touch and let them see
What the night can reveal

Still I adore you a lot, from above

Mistress of darkness divine
Whispers ""carpe noctem"" with a heavenly shine
To see her in a way she is not
...is to love

Under painful clay
Deep in the desert
Where no mortal's ever set foot
There she is lain
With a rose in her mouth and her hand
Into the voidness
Her sandy hair without colour, for good?

I've been praying, Lord,

Since she's left me
So all alone in the darkness
Guardian made of stone,
Won't you answer
My prayers for her coming home
My dear, please speak to me
Beloved, answer me
Give me a sign to rely on
I know you still hear me
Even you cannot see me
On my knees, don't deny me

Lifeless womb

Her grave, a pyramidal tomb
Crying and praying
That her leaving the light was no end
Then it awoke
After hours and days
And then spoke the rose made of stone
""Who loves shall be never alone.""

I've been praying, Lord,

Since she's left me
So all alone in the darkness
Guardian made of stone
Gave me answers to
My prayers for her coming home

Gave me a sign to rely on

For this rose-water's accompany

Flesh and thunder and blood and lightning
By the eyes of the Gods the night is seized

Taming the horses, impossible to steer

Flaming -the passion- rides into his bane
For all who can see soon it will peer
Doomsday will be, showing the sun's wane

Like suns, even brighter if I don't draw the rein
In fervour I shall sear to swallow all the pain

Vacant as I've found that exceptions too run away

Of times we never spent? 
What good is ink 
When the written cannot be said? 
And what good is life 
When you wish that you were dead? 

Dead

That night, if only 

Five days without sunlight 
Without sunshine 
The walls tend to come alive 
Taunt you and your graying flesh 
Water will not take the stench away 

Shut your mouth now, and say nothing
As your breath dooms the doves to fall limp from the sky 
Shut your eyes now, quiet child
As your bar codes are being exposed 
To see this breath, this steam 
In the December air 
To see this look of endless compassion 
To lie to you 
Cry to you 
Die in your arms and I swear this time",If Only

Honour the fallen heroes
See their last resting place
Perished in the battle of nations
Where they found eternal peace
Do you know the use of their decorations?
Awarded for patriotism
They left their life in fire
But don't know even why

Remember the fallen
Remember the fallen

To the command of despotic dictators
They marched to fight in a senseless war
Most of them were just puppets and children
The battle was lost before it began

Brotherly in heart and hand
Know that they never come back
With combined effort
And the believe in god
Their duty only as cannon fodder
Kamikaze as living bombs
Driven into the open knife
Deceitful and malicious

Remember the fallen
Remember the fallen

Their tormented souls will never rest
To pay us back for their innocent death
No quarter shed our proud blood
Retaliation on the warpath

I jump in the mosh pit, but I'm alone
Between four trees I get it on
My brain is hemorrhaging, it's them or me
It ain't easy knocking over a tree (i pass out)
I wake up the room is padded
It would appear I've had it
But hold up
Close rip, wrap them around my neck
And choke myself to death, no breath
Now I'm out, I'm strapped down
Wait, I can still move my head around
I got about four inches between the back of my head
And the metal gurney bed
Boom!
Slamming it, retractions
Boom!
I feel the back of my skull is cracking
Boom!
A broken bone is piercing my brain
And oh, I just hammered it in

Ahhhhh
Ahh I hurt myself
God I hurt myself
Stop me
Pain, pain
Stop me

I'm sitting in the dark, talking to myself
Why does everybody tell me that I need help?
I'm in love with pain
I take a needle or a knife
And drive that mother fucker through my windpipe
Just might
Take a razor blade
Dip it in some gas
See if I can take a little skin of the calf
Grotesque I'm a walking body bag
And when it all heals I'll pick the scabs

Alone in the casket, buried in the earth
Self-inflicted wounds, blood stains on my t-shirt
Kick out the door till my legs fall off
Try to use my head my skulls to soft
The pain overwhelms shooting through my kidneys
Blood rushes out when I stick a shank in me
Keep stabbing and sticking
And pulling all the blood spitting
And I cut off the oxygen
And take my own life again

[Chorus]
Why, tell me why
Do you hurt yourself, when you know I love you
Ah stop me!
Why, tell me why
Do you hurt yourself, when you know I love you
Ah stop me!

Do you wanna die? do you need my help?
Is it self mutilation that you're bringing on yourself
Went through the same situation 1 year ago
I guess that explains all the scars on my throat
Why you still breathing, are you still alive?
Escaping from the demons that you had locked inside
You death suicidal than come an play my game
One gun, one bullet if you're it no pain

A layer up skin ohhh, I pull it back
And smooth it back down with some simple smack (ouch)
Wednesday nights I got kicked off my bowling league
Just cause I show up bite a bowling ball and leave
Yea go ahead curse me you faggots
So I throw my legs onto moving cars, you got your habits
I don't consider it hurting myself, it brings me joy
Now shut the fuck up here
Batter up uhhhhahhh!!

Cut and slice away with a steak knife
Hit myself in the ankle with a pvc pipe
Exacto blade underneath the fingernail
Bleed and make another cut, fucking might as well
Tablespoon of Morton's salt pour it on the wound
If it don't burn you don't know what you doing
If you fail just return to start
Self defecation is a beautiful art

Let the Reaper do his job, man
He's doing just fine

Death don't want me, life is all that I got
Keep me living even if I'm just a head in a box
Take me outdoors, feed me
Put tits in my face
There's enough reason for me to live in any case
Send me to prison, I'll start pimpin' faggots in there
Cripple my ass, I'm floating spinners on my power chair
I'm Violent J, I could never die anyway
Even when I'm gone all you gotta do is hit play
I'm Juggalotus

Death don't want you but the Lotus do
So bring the wicked shit, we gonna bring it too
We like 'Hey'
Lotus Song
We comin' your way
Lotus Song
Death don't want you when the rain is gone
But with your Lotus high, you know we all belong
We like 'Hey'
Lotus Song
We comin' your way
Lotus Song

I wouldn't change a thing, I'm cool with that
Death doesn't want me, so I'm here to relax
There's so many more in this world that feels the same way
Known as the Juggalos, representing family
Not afraid to die, cause death is afraid of us
We're meaner then the devil
But we're someone you can trust
We're used to being shut down
And pushed out the doorway
Death doesn't want us so we're fucking here to stay

You're way to fresh for death to want you, 
with abilities and talents no one can ever come close to, 
Suppose you don't lose, 
Stay on track, 
You don't know if you don't try, 
Always remember that, 
And remember this in my eyes we’re all the same, 
You breathe, I breathe, 
We both share the name, 
Of a Juggalo respect that and cherish your pride, 
Cause we family representin' all what’s alive, 

Death don't want you but the Lotus do 
So bring the wicked shit, we gonna bring it too 
We like 'Hey' (Lotus up) 
We comin' your way  (Lotus up) 
Death don't want you when the rain is gone 
But with your Lotus high, you know we all belong 
We like 'Hey'  (Lotus up) 
We comin' your way  (Lotus up) 

Hold up now and think about this shit, 
Why the fuck death wanna pay you a visit, 
I been waitin' 30 years and nothin', 
So what makes you think you so special motha fucka, 
I been knockin' on his forehead, 
And peep this, 
All that bitch did was bring me a gang of kids, 
Maybe more people for later times, 
But for now I know he don't wanna fuck with me and mines, 

If I contemplated dying, 
Then really I would be lying, 
And trying to get to heaven is really another question, 
I'm guessing another lesson, 
And living ain't really needed, 
But since I been getting weeded, 
Defeated has been deleted, 
I seen it but don't believe it, 
My eyes just run and hide, 
And at the same time they collide with the other side, 
Bleeds pride and courage until the day that I die, 
Now put your lotus in the motha fuckin' sky

Death don't want you but the Lotus do 
So bring the wicked shit, we gonna bring it too 
We like ""Hey"" (Lotus up) 
We comin' your way  (Lotus up) 

Death don't want you when the rain is gone 
But with your Lotus high, you know we all belong 
We like 'Hey' (Lotus up) 
We comin' your way (Lotus Song) 

We got people to see 
We got places to go

Look into my mind, tell me what you see, what you find
Can somebody tell me what's happening this time?
I don't know
I break it down again, losing control
With these demons inside still pulling at my soul
Still reaching for my coat, I choke and black out
Without a lung to pump anymore oxygen out
Am I doomed on the Earth with these ??? symptoms
Cause your church won't grant the dead an exorcism

[Violent J]
Let me get two turntables and a microphone
Black rain, bloody murder means spike your dome
Why, I, don't know why
Pressure released from my head when you die
(Ali Baba)
Empty pill bottles on the shelf
Got this hunger and a sexual drive to end your health
Fucking aches (ouch)
You gotta die, I'm sorry but you gotta die

[Chorus]
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump off, damn
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again

[Madrox]
Fall in through emotion and passing through memories
Descending into dark with my hands in front of me
Waving and screaming, falling like a way through Hell
What's at the bottom? I don't know
But I'll find out when I get there
Hands grabbing at me, but I'm dodging them all
Slicing each and every wrist with my hatchet as I fall
And if I reach the bottom with my life intact
I'm a climb right to the top and go right back and do it again

[Monoxide]
If you can see what I was thinking then no one would have to die
It would be as simple as looking inside of my mind
And through time all the pressure has come to a head
And I release it on the innocent and leave 'em for dead
Could be a chemical imbalance where I blame it on this challenege
And remarks, so I waited in the dark where his car was parked
A couple whacks with the axe to his back
And he was down, and then I hit the ground
Somebody catch me

[Chorus]
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump off, damn
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again

[Shaggy]
If you listen too close you might lose your mind
If you look too close your head could explode like mind bomb (boom)
Did Blaze really get shot the fuck down? (Still bleeding)
Did Twiztid really sell they soul to the underground? (What?)
After the 6th, will ICP kill theyself? (fuck off)
Is ABK a real warrior or something else?
I don't know and I don't care
Just remember me with my fucking Lotus in the air (Lotus)

[ABK]
Keep talking mother fucker, do it again, don't push me
You fuckin with a old school cat that ain't friendly
So take it to that level, go ahead keep pulling my chain
Cause when I get upset I get strange
You have no clue
Check this out, I be fiending from mood swings
Ready to throw down and knock the shit out of soft range
Hard list, ready to live out whatever
So if you're in my path, we better best be walking together
(Mother fucker)

Dark Lotus,"We would like to invite you on a journey
A tale of an instrument of death
Watch us as we pass the axe.

I took the axe off the shelf in the tool shed
It's telling me I gotta fuckin' bloody the misled
My victim approached
Cut her head off at the throat
She was a hooker with AIDS
Spreading disease like it was dope
Cut the head off her pimp
Before he started to trash talk
Two bodies in my trunk and police on a manhunt
I'm on the noose again
They chasing me for blocks
Seen a homie on the street
So I passed the axe to Madrox

I took the axe
What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?
It's all bloody
And it looks like its been in and out of someone's back
Gristle on the handle, blood dripping down the neck
So I grabbed that bitch like back
Who want to get half fed up by the half with
Who got a gang of problems
And don't give half a shit, bitch
You can fall victim to the double headed fury
Don't be scared, be worried, man.

Pass me something sharp and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back (I'll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back.(I'll hack you)

I took the axe back to the shed where I stay
Cleaned off the blood and then sharpened up the blade
Waited ‘til dark and then ran through the hood
And chopped up drunk bums like they're blocks of wood
I can't see myself stopping, if I do then I'm dead
And the only way I'm dying is if I sever my own head
Grip on the tip, so my nub won't slip
And I'm about to fuckin' pass it to the hands of 2 Dope bitch

I took the axe and swung it through like butter
When I cut ya back you better run, duck, and cover.
You know your jugular well, it's gone
I blacked out last night, realized in the morning
Gotta dig another hole in the backyard
Run get me a shovel, it ain't that hard
Understand I got a hairpin trigger wrist
When I squeeze it off, haha, you get the gist.

Pass me something sharp and wicked (Pass it over here)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked (Pass it over here)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)

I took the axe
Perhaps I had a relapse
I seen a pretty pretty neck
And I couldn't relax
I cut through it
I throw knives with precision
But it's nothing like the feeling
Of committing the incision
Flip it over, a radio programmer
Pound his head into a bloody pizza
With a hammer
Threw it into the sky and let it stick in my back
And passed out at Monoxide's front porch like that.

I took the axe and lost my fucking mind
On this cop who pulled up behind me
I handcuffed him on the side of the street
And started smacking em with it like I was making a beat
Oh God!
Another cop pulled up
So I grabbed the same axe and planted it in his forehead
Two more dead, bloody and dismembered
Now it's back in the shed and that's all I remember.

Pass me something sharp and wicked
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)
It's raining, the rain is dark and wicked (I'll throw it right back to you)
And I'll pass it back
Don't worry I'll pass it back ('ll hack you)

The axe that split so many backs
Its back to the tool shed to relax
Peep that
So many failed with no tale to tell.
And it's only remembered by the stain that they left
On the axe",Pass the Ax

Dark Lotus,"During each cycle of life on this very planet 
You have a beginning, and you have an ending 
As each cycle occurs 
The souls living are forced to make a decision 
They must choose to live life 
Following either the stoic path of the devoutness of worship, that many believe eventually leads to an afterlife of eternal bliss. 
Or they may choose to live life following the obuliant path, of hedonism and non belief. 
Which many believe leads only to eternal damn nation. 
In this day and age, the time of choice is strongly upon us. 
A Lotus of the night. 
A simple Dark Lotus has emerged from sacred soil. 
From this unfolds the single truth. 
Those who believe in the gospel of the Dark Carnival recognize this as our last warning. 
The very next message brought before us will be the almighty 6th jokers card. 
For now, let us relish within

Across the border zone
While the wind is breaking on my eyes

The summer loses the way
In a cold embrace I lay
I've been waiting for a sign to rise

But slowly fades, but slowly fades away
Loose the grip, falling far, far from you

So mother pray for me
A soldier cannot see
Don't forget those fairy tales

Someday, when I'm back
My arms around your neck
And you cradle me under your veils

Your wings of stone
Surrounding me with your being

Resounds the silence in my heart

To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May
Dark One Lite,"In the morning
Don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door

I know your name is Rita
'Cause your perfume smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor
guitar

Won't need to much persuading
I don't mean to sound degrading
But with a face like that
You got nothing to laugh about

Red lips hair and fingernails
I hear your a mean old Jezebel
Lets go up stairs and read my tarot cards

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me

So in the morning
Please don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door

Yea I'll pay your cab fare home
You can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the morning when I wake up

Stay with me
Stay with me
'Cause tonight you better stay with me
Sit down, get up, get down

Stay with me
Stay with me
Cause tonight your going stay with me
Hey, whats your name again

Dark One Lite,"I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
But to settle down and write you a line
I've been meaning to phone you but from Minnesota
Hell it's been a very long time
You wear it well
A little old fashioned but that's all right

Well I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking
Or he wouldn't get in touch with me
Oh I ain't begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know that you wear it well
There ain't a lady in the land so fine

Remember them basement parties, your brother's karate
The all day rock and roll shows
Them homesick blues and radical views
Haven't left a mark on you, you wear it well
A little out of time but I don't mind

But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out
Tryin' to get a letter through

Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you

Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh and I wear it well
I don't object if you call collect
'Cause I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out tryin' to get back to you

After all the years I hope it's the same address
Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on",You Wear It Well
Dark One Lite,"Thinkin' bout the times you drove in my car
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinkin' bout the love that you laid on my table

I told you not to wander round in the dark
I told you bout the swans that they live in the park
And I told you 'bout a kid now he's married to Mable

Yes, I told you bout the life goes up & down
Don't you notice how the wheel goes round?
And you better pick yourself up off the ground
Before they bring the curtain down,
yes, before they bring the curtain down, whoooa

Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle",Badge
Dark One Lite,"Driving in my car, smoking my cigar,
The only time I'm happy's when I play my guitar.

Singing in my yacht, what a lot I got,
Happiness is something that just cannot be bought.

I've been in and I'm out, I've been up and down,
I don't want to go until I've been all around.

What's it all about, anyone in doubt,
I don't want to go until I've found it all out.",N.S.U.
Dark One Lite,"It's getting near dawn when lights close their tired eyes
I'll soon be with you my love, give you my dawn surprise
I'll be with you darling soon
I'll be with you when the stars start falling

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you my love, the light's shining through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love, it's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you my love, the light's shining through on you
Yes, I'm with you my love, it's the morning and just we two
I'll stay with you darling now
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up

In the sunshine of your love",Sunshine of Your Love
