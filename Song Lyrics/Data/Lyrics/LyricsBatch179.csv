Ing,"Now everything you're telling me rips me up
I swear I wish I'd make myself shut you up
I've got a list here of things we talked about
The ugliness you see's just me inside out

And what I just don't know
Is what I think about it
I don't know at all",Inside Out
Inga Rumpf,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Inga Rumpf,"(James Brown sample) ""This is a Man's World!""

Verse 1:
Lies and rumors, money and hoes
it's the World that I'm attached to, the World that I know
influential, never stable in the mental
but clever, spittin' that same shit niggas is into
I'll bleed for the craft if I have to, think rational
lovin' money and weed, pussy and fast food
tatoo a dead Man's name on my arm
I'm a thug in the street that's still afraid of his Moms
everyday I watch a player get robbed, player get popped
I try to drink the pain away and pray that it stops
in the mornin' head straight to the spot, the juice bar
niggas tried all that other shit and what's the use God?
for the paper Nature takes it too far, perfectionist
rep the bridge, where everything's foul except the kids
we get it on, and contradict livin' long
though the clock will still tic when you gone.

Chorus
(This is a Man's World!)
Now if you a Man be a Man (you need a plan)
if you fall (I'ma put you on your feet again)
when you starve (I'ma show you how to eat again)
and through it all (I'll show you how to be a friend)
now when you in charge be in charge (you need a squad)
if you bored (I'ma show you how to be involved)
I give 'em more (niggas know they can't see the God)
I can't believe it God (I gotta eat or starve)

Verse 2:
Keep the livest image, high percentage
Four in the mornin', 
niggas blitzin' on corners like the line of scrimmage
convicts turnin' confident
enter the phase of niggas and they feminine ways
love my Timberlands, cinnamon suede
bottles mo' proof
for all the problems that a nigga go through
it's forever real 
'cause some scars can never heal
I'd rather throw the cards in and pray I get a better deal
guns excite me, keep atleast a hundred Wifey's
my duns up in the pens ya'll need to write me
street cadets, alias names and re-arrests
it doesn't take much to know that wrieffer helps relieve the stress
we make moves or get caught for the loot
wild niggas on the block look for more to recruit
gettin' chips from an alternate route 
but the same breed
It's been Twenty-somethin' years now,
I'm still lookin' for the same dream.

Chorus

Verse 3:
In my World police recognize names
know us niggas by the walk or the size of their chain
you know the motto
we live for today, there's no tomorrow
we're only makin' time for the hoes that swallow
fuck a role model, I need therapy
seven nights out the week I jump out my sleep breathin' heavily
keep my head up, only the strong survive
livin' in a Man's World, still belongs to a tribe
took the family along for the ride
watch 'em eat
now I'm movin' with the same cats that'll rock me to sleep
never close your eyes, learn to roll with the wise
'cause some niggas 'll talk shit and play close to the sides
while I call the shots 
and stay supportin' the block
we livin' above the law until all of it stops
I still open doors, a thug nigga overall
and if you ain't know then black Man go for yours.

Chorus 'till fade...",Man's World
Inga Rumpf,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Inga Rumpf,"Bonnie and Clyde were pretty lookin' people
But I can tell you people They were the devil's children,
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doin'
One lazy afternoon down Savannah way,

They robbed a store, and high-tailed outa that town
Got clean away in a stolen car,
And waited till the heat died down,
Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation

And made the graduation
Into the banking business.
""Reach for the sky"" sweet-talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag,

Now one brave man-he tried to take 'em alone
They left him Iyin' in a pool of blood,
And laughed about it all the way home.
Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one

Running and hiding from ev'ry American lawman's gun.
They used to laugh about dyin',
But deep inside 'em they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lyin'

Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun
And the morning dew.
Acting upon reliable information

A federal deputation laid a deadly ambush.
When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them.
Bonnie and Clyde, they lived a lot together

And finally together they died,",Bonnie and Clyde
Inga Swearingen,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue,

Inga Swearingen,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Inga Swearingen,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Inga Swearingen,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Inger Marie Gundersen,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Inger Marie Gundersen,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow
Inger Marie Gundersen,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Inglas,"Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which 
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Und vergessen was Gestern war ich denke nicht an Morgen
Werfe Scheine durch die Luft

Trage Goldene Ketten
Gold in der Fresse
Präsentiere meine Drogenexzesse stolz in der Presse
Papparazzi machen Bilder von meinem Privaten Leben
Egal wo ich mich bewege stehe oder grade gehe
Deswegen loch ich ich mir morgens teure Drogen in den Schädel
Mit Alkohol in den Venen
Such ich Trost bei den Mädels

Paar Bitches zu meiner Linken
Chillen in der Milton Inglebird pimpin'
Ich will
Den Echo für mein Lebenswerk
Denn was ich mach ist legendär
Ziele sind erstrebenswert

Sogar während meines Jobs
Hab ich keinen Bock

Zehn Uhr Abends ins Bett
Morgens früh raus um Sechs
Dann abgebaut auf die Arbeit und immer Stress mit dem Chef
Sone Probleme können mir einen Lutschen
Die Futzen
Ich komm nicht in die Puschen
Weil ich bin faul wie Sau und stark betrunken
Auf der Sonnenseite und du Depp bist am verzweifeln
Fast am weinen wie ein Weichei
Während ich high
Nach den Scheinen greife
Das Leben kann so einfach sein
Wenn du Scheine machst
Feinde hast du sowieso in dieser Stadt
Zeig den Ficker
Lass die Sorgen hinter mir
Ausgesorgt for life

Denk an dich und deine Verkäufe denn anders wird es keiner lernen

Ingmar Nordström,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

Almost all the time
Maybe her hair, it smells like cigarettes

But this just feels so right

She's almost perfect
She is so close to being everything
She's almost perfect
But she's not, she's not mine

Maybe she knows she drives me crazy
Just bats her eyes like she's my baby
Maybe she's quick to let her tongue fly at me
She's not the most proper lady
I'm the one to blame I know I caused this crash
So now I wander in this mess
Int this lake of sour mashed

Ingram Hill,"She takes another morning drive
She wonders if she's right this time
She dreams about a life in other scenes

And it's all I need
To save myself
And leave

And she knows everything, everything I'll say
Tell her it's a shame
'Cause I believe, my Love, you'll never be the same

Completely numb when she hears my voice

To me there's nothing there but cold

When everything is changed
Can it be the same

I'm sorry but this just feels right
Something happened just last night
There's nothing anymore
I finally think I've found myself
Love has fallen somewhere else
I know it myst be true

I pace across the bedroom floor
Numbness comes with a rage of fire
I blanky look up at a heart of stone
These two months nothing but a lie

I wanna show so they can see
That any pain can be healed in time, be healed in time

Call it your way
Then I'll hold you, hold my love

I find now I can resist
I know it's hard to not love you

Ingram Hill,"Friday night and I just got back
I had my eyes shut, was dreamin' 'bout the past
I thought about you while the radio played
I should've got a-movin', some reason I stayed

I started driftin' to a different place
I realized was fallin' off the face of the your world
There was nothin' left to bring me back

I'm a million miles away, a million miles away
I'm a million miles away
There was nothin' left to bring me back today, today

I took a ride, I went downtown
The streets are empty, there's no one around
And all the faces that we used to know
Gone from the places we used to go

I'm at the wrong end of a lookin' glass
I'm tryin' to hold on to the hands of the past and you
And there was nothin' left to bring me back

I'm a million miles away, a million miles away
I'm just a million miles away
And there's nothin' left to bring me back today

She wants to be alone and there's no way around

Falling apart to the sound of nothing

Always the one that tried so hard, but she couldn't win

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love

Ingrid Lucia,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Ingrid Michaelson,"1, 2, 3, 4

Though the days are long
Twilight sings a song
Of a happiness that used to be

Soon my eyes will close
(Soon my eyes will close)
Soon I'll find repose
And in dreams, you're always near to me

I'll see you in my dreams
Hold you in my dreams
Someone took you out of my arms
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light our way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

In the dreary gray
Of another day
You are far away and I am blue

Still I hope and pray
(Still I hope and pray)
Through each weary day
For it brings the night and dreams of you

I'll see you in my dreams
Hold you in my dreams
Someone took you out of my arms
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light our way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams
They will light our way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

Ingrid Michaelson,"The colored lights, they brightly shine
Unlike your eyes avoiding mine
The snow is folding sheet upon sheet
Our hands not holding as we cross the street

You have had your fill, your fill of me
You have had your fill, your fill of me

I wore the dress I thought you loved
But my boots are filling with snow you shoved
Off of the car we climb into
You finished first, I must catch up to you

You have had your fill, your fill of me
You have had your fill, your fill of me

How can I catch up when I still want you?

Ingrid Michaelson,"I woke up this morning with a funny taste in my head
Spackled some butter over my whole grain bread
Something tastes different, maybe it's my tongue
Something tastes different, suddenly I'm not so young

I'm just a stranger, even to myself
A re-arranger of the proverbial bookshelf
Don't be a fool girl, tell him you love him
Don't be a fool girl, you're not above him

I never thought I could love anyone but myself
Now I know I can't love anyone but you
You make me think that maybe I won't die alone
Maybe I won't die alone

Kiss the boys as they walk by, call me their baby
But little do they know, I'm just a maybe
Maybe my baby will be the one to leave sore
Maybe my baby will settle the score

I never thought I could love anyone but myself
Now I know I can't love anyone buy you
But you make me think that maybe I won't die alone
Maybe I won't die alone

What have I become?
Something soft and really quite dumb
Because I've fallen, oh, 'cause I've fall- fallen, oh 'cause I've fall-fall-fallen
So far away from the place where I started from

I never thought I could love anyone
I never thought I could love anyone

The radio waxes romantic, its lullabies fill our eyes with tears

We don't say a word
There's nothing to say that hasn't been heard
And how you've grown my little bird
I'm regretting letting you fly

Six pounds and seven ounces, a ball of bones and flesh and tears were you
Now your hands, your tiny pink hands, grew larger than my hands ever grew

Behind me.

You and I put on a show
We ran it in the ground
You said it's not enough
Don't want no broken love
You were no where to be found
Even after, something's gotta hold on

Did any of me stick at all?
Can you hear me singing through the walls?
There's a part of you that stayed with me
Someone else gets to know
Did any of me stick at all?
Did any of me ever stick at all?

I've got somebody new
He dances just like you
Makes me wonder how you are
Can't hide the memory
The memory of you and me
We were kissing in the dark
I'm always after, something that won't hold on

Can you hear me singing through the walls?

Singing up to me, I know it's a lullaby

And I'm all alone, till you come back home
Why don't you come back home?

You got me
You got me good

You got me good, good, good

And when I see the curve of the earth in your willow eyes
I'm a rocketeer, coming home after years at the speed of light
Suddenly you're there, like a pearl in the palm of the universe
Your unlikely skies filling up my eyes
You come as some surprise,

You got me
You got me good

You got me good, good, good

You were broken down

I had to come and get it straight from you

From the look upon your face,
I see it's true

Tell me about the plans you're makin'
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am supposed to live without you
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin 'for is gone

I didn't come here for cryin'
Didn't come here to breakdown
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you
When I build my world around

Gonna pay for dreaming

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walk alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

Fools said I, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said, the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence",The Sound of Silence

InMe,"3rd Jonquil... lucky, empty pill, torn-out page
This connection is the friction we awaited
Electric, broken ghost, she feels sick
Frozen feel, little slumber's heartbeat, lifeless old street

This criminals motive, subliminal notice, how was I supposed to know?
And when I go to sleep the heart monitor never beeps when I'm in your trance
I'd rather dance with you in my bed of blunt thistles

Hypnosis T-shirt, he knows it might hurt
The crumpled poems, does she know him like she used to?
For you, he fights the cruel heroes, you've seen the worst in me
Is this all I have to say, to say?

And when I go to sleep the heart monitor never beeps when I'm in your trance

And if it's all a dream and you're not quite what you seem well I'll sleep in vain

If this what you wanted, well I got what I deserved
The worthless hurt resides inside of this broken man

She was such a graceful creature ,she was such a worthy teacher
But how can one unlearn such love when love is war, is love is war my dear
I spit the blood from my mouth crying, I cannot express my ""undying"" love
For all you've given me for all you've taken
Man can change, can change, this man can change...

A bloodless kindred that never hindered
The chest has splintered, the bond has over-wintered
Heart cracked in several places...

Listen to the stream so violent, climbing up the hill so silent
Destitute inside these veins were slowly closing up, this heart weakened
Chances are you'll never get this, bled me dry it's time to forget this
No-ones ever seen me like this, should I ever fall this deep in love again?

Please forget the year I failed you, I won't hold you anymore
Pitched a tent in Sunny Lynton...
I wanted it back, I wanted it back, I wanted it back

And now I know just where those lips have been, I won't kiss you anymore
It seems these days always don't quite cut it
But you know best, yeah you know best, yeah you know best

I cannot let it rest in piece dear, I'll consume myself it was my only true fear
I hate this fucking aftertaste and I hate it even more without you here
This love was my pain, my hurt, my cancer, and all I wanted was to find an answer
You love and respect someone so deeply and then you lose them for your own, your own self odium

Begging for love and mercy
So I gave him a winkler and caring Good Morning
Everyboy thinks he's lazy And a bit insane
Sitting on the floor like a Baby
Doesn't work , he doesn't gain money

She's there hooking on the street
Begging for drugs and whisky
So I gave her my best coat and a loving good evening
Everybody thinks she's horny
And a foolish girl
She deserves to be unhappy
Doesn't cry, she has no more tears

It's not right, to be alone
In this world
It's unfair it's so sad

I'm here crying in my bed

Will he show me a greater and a hopeful good future

she was seventeen
She was young and restless

The world she lived in 
was tough and mean 
But her faith in life 
kept her safe and clean

even fighting
To find a way 
for a better day 
She choosed her fight 
And she did it right
The change will come
And The chance will last

No more shame
She won't take the blame
She will carry the flame

I will call her name
Scream all my faith

Struggling for life 
In the seventies 
She was smart and fearless
And wouldn't scream
The pain she felt in
Yeah she was fierce
She was proud and conscious
That love would win
Praying , hoping
even fighting
The sun will shine
for another day
She wouldn't give up
She always tried 
To keep her head up 
And lead her life

No more blame
She won't feel ashamed

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

This is my jam!!!
I'm on a psychedelic, motherfucking inter-gallactic void G!!!
Aw, shit!""

Well, they let the gate up so I bail
It's been six months pick me up from the county jail
With a smog mother payin' my dues
Steel toliets, worn blankets, and rubber shoes
But I ain't naggin'
Here come the fellas I can hear the muffler draggin'
Ain't been the car long
And the Faygo is almost gone
My nuts are kinda hard so I need a mate
So my homeboy's cousin set me up with a blind date
She said ""Pick me up at three""
Can't bitch, the bus don't ride your street, ho
We gonna eat at Mexican Village
Take a cab and I'll pay the tab
And when she showed, well, I'll be damned
Left my wallet at home on the TV stand
Have her pay him and for dinner too
The knot in my sock, it done bit you
She's all prettied up for nothing
I'm smelling like shit and my chin is scruffing
And I'm chewing on my food like a pitbull
Cause I won't front for the ho
Stuck my face in a bowl of soup
And just sucked it all up threw my missin' tooth
The bitch jumped up with a boom
""I have to fix my hair"" and broke to the bathroom
She's got the tab, so I go for mine
And order up some '52 vintage wine
Hey, Louie, bring a fuckin' steak with that
Motherfuckers like jail say fuck dat
She's back now and her hair ain't fixed
Probably took a long greasy-ass smelly shit
I ain't saying nothing though
I ain't saying nothing bout the funkin' ho
What's up bitch, I'm ready to break
How long can one fat bitch take?
Quite snacking and pay me saps
Cause we goin' home to meet her pops

""So Joe, what is that you do for a living?""
""Aww, come on pops, you seen me selling rocks on
Verner and Springwell. Matter fact, I think I sold
to that fat bitch in the kitchen""

Your dad's really cool sweetheart
I mean him letting me use his car
And he slipped me a fifty
Violent J is kinda nifty
If I'd a hit you'd be home through
But now your coming home with me
Dad I gotta bitch in the bedroom
Take your ass to the bar and don't come home soon
Now the juggla's known to smack hoes
But I need the shot too
So I switch to the mack mode

""Now woman, you know I love you
So why don't you just let me fuck you
Now bitch, I know you's a freak
So let me get a little kiss on your cheek
And a fuck to go with that
Come on, nympho, let me hit that
Tell ya what you let me stick it
And I gotta left over piece of chicken for ya
Ya little sewer skank
Ya nasty little pipe-smoking sac-chasing ho
And that was that
A little smooth talking she was on her back
And I'm finally sticking
Dump ya, and I'm eating my chicken
You'll never guess what

It's three o'clock in the morning and you're sleeping
Wicked clowns in the moonlight creeping
Slide through your window under your bed

Crawl in through your ear, eat your head
Bumping into bones 'cause I need light
Tip-toeing down through your windpipe
Climbing down your spine was the fun part

Looky looky and I think I see your fucking heart
Uh huh so I'm stabbing like it ain't nothing
Wicked clown cut his way out your belly button
I'm like a vulture waiting in a dark place

I'm sick but you don't know the whole deal
No one ever loved me and they never will
Bitch, I take you out on a blind date

But then they find you dead under a wooden crate
Rapped in a bag deep in the woods

Locked me in a closet, fed me dog shit

Gotta have the governor, the richer fucker, pay the price
Driving with your woman, that's sweet

Not a poor man, I need my own land
Because the rich man be stressing all the dumb stuff

I gotta sneak threw his yard
To find the fothermucker
And he's gotta pitbull dog
And it's sitting on my chin like a frog on a log
I throw a bone to try to distract
'cause I'm wanting my chinny-chin-chin back
I'll never be one to boast
But there's my tongue hanging off the lightpost
'cause my head exploded
And my brains unloaded
All over this beautiful city
Teeth and bones to the nitty gritty
There's my eyeball stuck to the wall
Right next to my splattered jaw
I don't dig this game
Chasing my brains all through the sewer drains
My head's all over the block
'cause I done went lunatick-tock tick-tock
Come on, dawg, what's wrong with my head?
It blew apart but I still ain't dead
I get no respect
I got nothing but guts hanging off my neck
But I'll still chilling
Even with my blood and guts all over the ceiling
I'm chillin', I'm illin'
With my guts all over the ceiling

(Chorus X4) I'm chillin, I'm illin

Oh, you'll never guess what's up
My mucking back blew up
If you come across a spine
Best believe it's mine
Oh, forget about my tongue
'cause vato can't breathe without no lungs
I lost both of mine
Now that's an item that I wouldn't mind to find
But forget about dat
'cause I'm roaming the streets with a splattered back
I'm trying to rap to this freak
But she can see my ribs all in the street
Then the chit-chat went dead
She noticed that I ain't got no head
Shhh, I think I hear my heart
But damn, it got hit by a Smark bus
And landed in Pontiac
So I tell my mellow to send it back
Come on, wined and my back blow up
Look for my guts, look for my guts
I gotta call from Nate the Mack
Says he might of found part of my back
Then bring it on over, ace
I got slabs all over the place
But I'm still chillin'
Even with my blood and guts all over the ceiling

Well, you know the juggla jumped in the mixer
Been down the road and I broke a few necks
And I'll break a few more, so what's up
Road by me on the corner, I'm a hold my nuts up
Its finna fuck you wit' dat
But if you a sewer skank let me hit dat
'cause I'm Violent J, ain't even one to fake it
I want to see some folded up skank bitches naked
I pass out when it gets dark
And woke up naked at the Clark Park
Gotta go, gotta get before I get the wrap
Gotta chopped off head chilling in my lap
Mr. Shrink, Mr. Shrink, I'm sick
Lunatick-tick-tock, it don't quit
It don't quit, it don't quit
Mr. Shrink, I'm sick, a lunaticky-tick
The doctor told me I'm a psycho
So I ate his face like I don't know
Knife to the neck and got some more
The night of the axe, the night of the forty fuck
Bitch, I'm a man you can talk ta
But after you leave I'm a stalk ya
If you're a little kid I'm a take ya
And if you're neck I'm a break ya
If you're an old lady I'm a mug ya
'cause bitch, you can't fuck with the juggla

""Yes, ladies and gentlemen, he is...the juggla
He'll cut your windpipe, eat your face
And slit your motherfucking heart out
You can see this freak show at the world famous Carnival of Carnage
Keep juggling, motherfucker!""

'cause ya know the juggla will throw ya up fast
And if I drop you that's your ass
I shake and twist, try to keep calm
I might go to hell 'cause I'm down with Esham
Gotta rhyme for your Uncle Willy
Then I hit him in the head with a Billy
Willy, Willy, watch your mouth
And fuck the south
Running with a gang of twenty street hoods, yo
What's up bitch, ah, what's up ho?
Sometimes you act like you ain't down
With a psychotic wicked clown
Fucking my friends ain't healthy
'cause I grab you by the face and fuck you up
And it's like that bitch that's the way it is
I'm allowed to fuck, ho, I'm in show biz
Sets in the hood want me for dead
So I paint my tag on they forehead
Stick your little 'kay by my taggin'
You can fit twenty clowns in a Volkswagon
And we coming straight to your brick house
I'm a huff, and puff, and blow your fuckin' neck loose
And then I might mug ya
'cause they're will be no fucking with the juggla

""Juggling eyeballs, juggling heads
What you've heard about, what you've read
The juggling wicked clowns will come to your
Birthday party, wedding, and barmitzva 
And cut your back off for a small fee

I'm that nerd in the back of the class
That went psycho and killed your ass
I slash and cut and hack
With a ""Kick Me"" sign on my back
In my corner is scyne therapy
They take care of me, but don't stare at me
'cause like I said I'll mug ya
Now run on home and don't fuck with the juggla

""Finally happened, the wicked clown have come to your town

I told my mother one day I'd be wealthy
Can't forget my first day at school
Got stabbed in the head with a pencil, but it's cool
Get my education
A job and a family, a good reputation
And what about grade two?
Got shot in the neck and the bullet went straight through
But I'm packing a textbook
Don't fuck with me 'cause I'm going to grade three
Thank god it's lunch in a minute
Bit into my hot dog with a razor blade in it
And it cut my tongue off
But I know how to multiply so what's up, boss
Finally had to step out
I dropped out of school when they ripped my neck out
Who knows where the road led?
Seen a man with a briefcase and no head
So I'm like fuck that
Show me a quarter and an ounce of crack
And I'm straighter than a fucking lightpost
I sold a lot of crack but I bought the most
Now I'm a basehead down on my luck
Roaming the streets and got hit by a Mack Truck
And thrown about a block
But I'm thinking nothing but gimme a rock
Holding my sign I'll work for crack
With my old-ass E.T. shirt on my back
And I'm sleeping in the gutter
Right next to Jam Town's mother
I'm eating dead rats in the street
I keep on checking for my ownheart beat
Now I'm weighing at a buck-o-five
Twitchy little neck and I'm barely alive
Got my first taste of life in hell
I ate a dead, shh, but don't tell
Excuse me, sir, can you spare some change?
I'll cut your face off and eat your brains
You know all about me
You act like you ain't seen penatentiary
Spitting and cussing and you know I'll piss
With these iron braces on my fucking wrists
And I'm heading for the slammer
Serial killer, all on the camera
First day, they broke my back
Next day, they broke my neck
Third day, they broke my leg
Fourth day, they broke my head
Swallowing kept on trucking
But there'll be no fucking
That's strictly for the soft
Seen a freak in a week and my nuts fell off
So I'm finna escape
How much shit can one clubno take?
""Stop, fool. Stop or I'll fire""
Shot me off and I fell in the razor wire
I'm all tangled up, cut cut cut slit slit cut cut
You don't love me, I really don't care
Tie my ass up in the electric chair
I got no family, I got no friends
I pray to God that my life ends
They thought that they had killed me
They took me to the morgue
I'm just a little stiff that's all, like a board
I lay there in my coffin, just chill and wait and chill
But then I jump out knife swinging all about
And motherfucking-mother-mother-mother-motherfucking kill
I used to wonder what life's about
Until it chewed me up and spit me out
Your ghetto created a psycho nut
Not just psycho psycho nut
Now I'm living in the walls of your house
And I'll die there and lay and rot like a dead mouse
I'm packing a sickle I'm on your roof and I'm playing the fiddle
You want me in a straight jacket
'cause when I see a throat, I'm a hack it
Where I'm at?  What's my name?
Somehow, somewhere, I got hit by a train
And it ripped my legs off
Huh, nothing but a minor coft
You can't get me I swing from a tree
Shouting and cussing and shooting at me
Everybody's end make two cents
A branch broke and I fell on a picket fence
I'm stuck and they're coming to get me
Rip myself off and I took my lungs with me
I'm stuffing them back in
Fuck! They won't go back in
Now my life's gettin' dense
'cause my heart's still beating on a wooden fence
They shoot me up and down

So pops, this time its your son gets shot
Deal with your own creation
Well, I've been to the storm house and then some
Payed me dues but I'm still a street hoodlum
Dropped out of school 'cause I couldn't find my locker

Might see me sleeping on the street
Don't look for a job 'cause there's no jobs looking for me

Tail turned out to the ghetto 'cause

Cussin', rude, and scratching my testicles
With a cold two-liter in hand
Rapping to the bitch at the french fry stand
Take it to the Patent Park

Take a brick off the street
And bust you in the mouth
Find the girl's daddy's rich
And his sweet little angel's my sewer freak bitch

The Time has come for the blood to run into the streets paved with gold 
We have lived in the zoo of the ghetto for so long 
And like animals we kill each other for the hatred of others 
We must move into the suburbs and punish the rich for their ignorance 
For the horror of death  that is part of our life in our neighborhood 
And give them a taste of the same 
And when we kill the governments children 
And the streets smell of death 
Maybe then we will see our situation in a new light 
And put an end the the chaos in the ghetto and an end to the killings 

[Violent J]
Heard what's going on in the free world 
Broke out the asylum and killed a girl 
Just to warm you, just to get it on 
'Cause I'm gonna be cutting throats till the break of dawn 
Can't nobody get me 
I've always been a psycho now they coming with me 
That's straight when we team up 
'Cause I believe every throat deserves a good cut 
Look in my brain its fucking insane 
Roll around naked in the acid rain 
Rich bitch fucka took me for a sucka 
Now we killing you instead of killing each other 
Walked in the house, shot him in the mouth 
Leaned back the head, and pulled the brains out 
My list are strong its only a saw 
The government fronts like they don't know what is going on 
Fuck, I'll take the matter in my own hands 
Cut ya down cat, cut ya down 
'Cause I know the rich go jogging 
And I'm waiting in the bushes, axe to the noggin
About thirty or forty times, 
Psychodelic sick with the psycho psycho rhymes 
But ya keep the killer in one place, 
But I'm at ya door, motherfucker have a taste!

(Mister drumma looking bald headed punk bitch)
Stroll to the banquet party 
(Drank all they brew)
Then shot everybody 
They set it up wrong, 
Created the ghetto and thought it wouldn't last long

Didn't think we'd come to the suburbs, jackoff)

Motherfucker, have a taste 

[Jump Steady] 
In Detroit doing time, time being done 
Without not another solution 
Without nothing but wicked men 
How many mothafuckas I've know through the years 
Got they necks blown off or crippled in their fear 
Now I'll tell ya cause I been in many schools for this 
Cause I'm drawn by the vision and close my hand into a fist 
Raised in the crime with nothing to eat 
So my natural instincts to kill in the street 
I'm going to war and I sent you caution 
Jump steady stepping over the governments brainwashing 
(Take it, take it farther, take it far) 
Don't let them even judge ya, 'cause you know who you are 
Seems they don't even know about the inner city crime war 
Money's on the Jews in the desert but what the fuck for 
Damn the're stupid, the mines are surrounded 
Think I like to pay a lesson to a gallon 
And save a human life or two 
End this ghetto war for the homies that I once knew 
Ya peeping out the barn with ya closed eyes 
(Ya peeping out the barn with ya closed eyes ho) 
I got a mind killing rage waiting on my change 
On the holes on my jacket I craddle my gage 
What ya gonna do if I show up at your place 
Try to ignore it this time, motherfucker have a taste 

[Capitol E & Esham]
Ya need a spoonful, another wants a little taste 
So let me feed you the city like in a steady pace 
Ya wake up to gunfire thining it was a dream 
Till ya hear ya neighbors holla and ya young child scream 
Everyday thang, thank it to ya 
Just wait till you see that cracka at ya front door naked 
Begging for money, acting like he know ya 
Ya slam the door in fear, but some day he'll show ya 
Catch ya at point blank range ya getting jacked 
(Come up with it bitch) 
Now ya don't know how to act 
But that's the life and the experience of a mother 
Happens everyday, one another the other 
But the suburb living is high class 
With a high class leather city trade with ya ass 
And show ya the rough times 
Hungry homeless people committing crime after crime 
And bitches working the pike for dough 
Then they run to the rock sella to buy some rocks slow 
And I hear ya making fun of that... 
ICP (What's up E) Gets ya bats 
It's time for you to crack some necks 
And if they don't know now, show them what to expect

And looking for the governor to kill him and I think I can

With an axe in my mothafuckin' palm
And I jumped out the front, straight swinging
Necks and backs went flinging,
Head to toe
I went psychopathic
Choping throats with a hatchet
'Cause they try to get me
So I took a head with me
Ran down the hall butt-naked
If you got a life I'ma take it
'Cause I got it going on
And I broke to the female john
Motherfuckers think I'm sick
You ever seen a bitch take a shit?
Fuck dat, let her dookey-ass be
'Cause female shittin' is news to me
Climbed up the fire escape
How many lives can one motherfucker take?
One life, two life, three life, four
Throw me a Mack-10 I'm bound to take more
Fifty lives coming on eighty
Fuck this, I'm fidna whoop this lady
Tied the bitch up to the light post
Slapped her in her face 'cause I'm psycho
Beat her down and beat her up
Fucking slut
So bitches make me wonder
Kicked her gut and left my number
""Call me, fucking nympho.""
Then I threw her through a window
Broke and I climbed up a tree, guy

""Like it? Have another.""

Then I threw em' in the Pinto
Now I'm on Vernor bumpin' the funk

Just don't look in the trunk
""We got a wild one here, he's naked.""
Just don't look in the trunk

""Be advised, the car is registered to a Wilson family.""
Just don't look in the trunk
""Oh, the trunk you say, huh? Okay, waddya say we just have a look-see here? Oh shit!""
I'm gone and I ditched the ride
And left the dead Wilsons inside
Jetting and I'm hopping fences
Fidna do like my man in Culeen, Texas
'Cause I'm psycholistic
You look once and you missed it
Look twice and it caught your eye
Me, beating the shit out of some guy
With a bag of bricks
Impressing them dirty-ass sewer chicks
A klepto you can't trust
Should've known when I jacked the bus
Fourteen passengers riding it
One naked psycho driving it
And we goin' crippin'
And there'll be no slipping
'Cause I'm thinking the worst
Shit like woman and children die first
Make you shiver
When I drove that bitch in the river
Everybody dies
Only me survives
Innocent fucks is what I want

The boys in blue
The whole caroo
I do what they never think
So I'm heading for the 18th precenct
'Cause when they finally call it quits
I'll be there to cut their necks
And that's what I did
I hate a fucking pig
I get a job at the donut shop
Just to poison a cop
Kleptopathic
And I'll fuck you up in a straight jacket
'Cause they finally got me
Broke my legs and shot me
But I'm still laughing

For just one bet  venture through this wonderful exhibit 
See yourself in all the weird shapes and sizes 
You  young man  would you like to go into the house of mirrors 
Well  okay 
Have a good time  son 
And good luck finding your way out 
Wait a minute  I don't like it in here 
Hey  wait a minute  let me out of here 
Let there's dead bodies in here 
There's dead bodies in here 
I don't like it in here!!!"" 

Step inside, come my way 
This here is your fatal day 
You have lied, they have cried 
Now your life has been denied 
Look into the big mirror 
Your reflection is so clear 
Devil's head, rotting flesh 
With the snakes inside your chest 
In the mirror you can't hide 
You've been granted Jacob's lide 
Whipping fear, spinning pain 
All you crying is in vain 
You're the beast you never knew 
This reflects the things you do 
Others starving down the block 
Richie's heart is like a rock 
How can I make a law? 
I'm just here to break your jaw 
House of Glass, down and up 
You might get your ass cut 
Mirror of Life, Mirror of Pain 
Death, I wave my magic cain 
Your last words are those of fear 
But they go unheard in the House of Mirrors 

[Chorus x2] 
Mirror mirror on the wall 
Who's the wickedest of all 
Three blind mice, deepest fear 
Welcome to the House of Mirrors 
 
Magic wand, magic mirror 
Timeless clock says death is near 
Death is here, death is on 
My king bishop takes your pawn 
You can't break House of Mirrors 
That's bad luck for seven years 
Only in my wicked realm 
Of thee untold, now unfold 
Thinking back, what you do 
Buy a richie home or two 
Even though some down and out 
You keep what you could live without 
You're the beast you never knew 
This reflects the things you do 
Others starving down the block 
Richie's heart is like a rock 
First I grab, then I stab 
Cut you up into a slab 
Grind and twist, flick my wrist 
Toss you in the magic mist 
Look into Halls of Glass 
Every mirror shows the past 
With no love you kick the sin of face 
Now your place is in the House of Mirrors 

[Chorus x2] 

Three blind mice, your worst fear 
Look into the deadly mirror 

Welcome to the House of Mirrors, Mr. Exec 
You should explain to E why ICP should let you live 
As you look on I see this image in your reflection 
A bigot under cover, showing no affections 
To the ghettos and the hoods 
Just look at you, you think for us, you're too good 
Claiming all you got and you can die tomorrow 
And when that shit happens, there's no pinion, no sorrow 
'Cause you refuse to lift a hand 
And you know it's a blessing to help a brother man stand 
And if I were you I'd fear myself 
Knowing I was selfish and wouldn't let another near my wealth 
You just gotta let em fall 
You Violent J, ""what up"", bash that head against the wall 
And don't let him run for the door (where you goin, bitch?) 
Make him detour to the sore 
And let's wash away his bigot sins 
While we welcome in some more of his bigot ass friends 
And let them see what they really like 
Hand-high riding the Benz and I'm a clown-riding the bike 
So look closely in the mirror 
You're the beast you never knew, so be the next to volunteer 
To live in the hood with the ICP 
Yo, J, throw away the key to the House of Mirrors

Sitting in the class with my head on the desk
Teacher's trying to talk but I could give a fuck less
I'm staring at the freak that I know I'm in love with
But she don't even know my name it's always been the same
I just lay my head down and drown in my spit
Nobody even notices I'm here 'cause I ain't shit
I hear voices but I don't know what they saying
Sweat is on my forehead 'cause my brain's inside decaying
And this bitch that I love probably don't have no idea
She's talking to her friends I'm in the corner and I see her
Something's happening but it isn't very clear
Sounds like a bell, sounds like an electric chair
Next thing I know walking in the crowded hall
So many different faces that I throw up on the wall
Some are yelling ""sick"" and the others stop and stare
But I don't care, I'm in a hurry going nowhere
See, my head is spinning 'cause I'm lonely and I'm twisted
But I have a secret everybody missed it
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag

[Chorus (2x)]
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigots head off and I stuffed it in my bag

[Violent J]
I wish somebody knew me 'cause then they could say I'm wrong
But since nobody knows me I got it going on
I'm staring at the clock, I listen for the tock
I gotta couple food stamps folded in my sock
I guess I'm just a ghost 'cause everybody walks through me
If I died in class they would probably say they knew me
Or they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even move
A dead body rotting in the back of the room
For weeks and months, stinking up the class
Until somebody noticed then they throw me in the trash
I can hear the teacher man talking about Columbus
He nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass
Ran up on a beach and threw everybody off
And then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud
I don't give a fuck to learn your uncle went to hell
I'm trapped in mind and my brain is my cell
But I have a key, it's called insanity
I stick in my brain to unlock eternity
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag

[Chorus (2x)]

""Okay, today we're gonna learn about A Great Freedom. If you'll turn 
Your textbooks to Chapter Four we'll get started. America's the 
Land of the free, all racists live together in harmony, and we are all
Treated equal, we all live togerther in the same wealthy community 
And we are alternate equals. Yes?""
""Man, Mr. Johnson already taught us this. Ain't he ever coming back?""
""Uh, uh, he's, uh, very ill right now.""

[Violent J]
No, they can sit and front about it all day
But I left his fucking body in the hallway
And in the morning they opened up the door
And seen his motherfucking carcass laying on the floor
But they would never suspect me I'm just a nerd
I try to speak my word, it always goes unheard
I could chop my arms off and run around the class
I doubt they'd even notice, but I'd be dying fast
'cause they'd rather learn about redneck chicker
Who owned a couple slaves but I guess it doesn't matter
Fuck Washington, Benjamin, fuck em all ah
They can suck my nuts till they wood teeth fall out
And the class wanna know who could it be
But I'm like Dewey Boodie, you ain't never heard of me
I'm just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got his motherfucking melon chilling in my bookbag

So I break the law but I'm not to blame
You only know my place, you don't know my name

Well, I grip the fence and bent the steal
And I steal a car and I grip the wheel
And I park the car then I steal it again
'cause I really don't know what's happening

I wait for night to fall then I walk outside
And then I run back in 'cause I don't want to die
You see, the air alone, it can corrupt your brain
As smoke fills the sky enough to block the rain

And I pray to God to help me justify
Look over me 'cause my brain is fried
And I don't have a name, I don't have a home

And when I stop to think I can only laugh
Because I'm not alone, it didn't take me long

At about thirteen in the afternoon

""If I'm gonna die
I'm going out riding the wagon""

Hear it comes, the horrifying midnight wagon
Saggin, laggin, dead bodies draggin
On a piece of string, they flop around and fling
Now shut your ass up and let the juggla sing
It's the Insane Clown Posse coming threw
Looking for hickies and the prickies and your ass too
Everybody gets a ride on the ghost car
Don't matter who you are, we going straight to hell
And it ain't far, Mr. Nevers
You seem to be the kill joy
So get your ass in fat boy
You can sit up in the front with the Ringmaster
With the Ringading-dingalinga-ping-master
And get your motherfucking wind pipe chopped off
And your funky ass body gets dropped off
In the gutter, the wheels keep rollin
Throwin heads out the back, nugget bowlin from the...

[Violent J]
The exhaust pipe is tripping out a deli fire
I found an old dead corpse in the trunk next to the spare tire
And it's muffling the sounds
Throw the bitch out and now the funk pounds, yo
Some say it's just a hearse, but it's much worse
It's an old dark bucket with a clown curse
Long, dark, very spooky scary
I drink an old 40 bottle full of bloody mary, why
'cause I'm Violent J, sick in the nug-bone
I make strange sounds, clowns with frowns
Break it on down, break it up till the break of dawn
Look out your window it's the wagon in your front lawn
Ah, boom, aboockaboomba 
We do the dance of the death until you get in the car
Then I pull your tongue out slap you in the face with it
Say the joker did it in the...

Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin
Now, here's your chance

[Violent J]
We don't do drive-by's in the wagon
Instead we just get out and stab your fuckin ass
And there ain't no telling how many clowns inside
Told you seventeen but I lied
'cause I'm wicked and I'm wild, wicked wild
I caught wild deer, rode it home from Bel Isle
I play the organ like an old mental case
I can freak the cello, like Chris Conley on bass
In the wagon, I throw fingers out the window
And when you roll the window down you can smell Indo
But it ain't mine, it belongs to a stiff over there
Puffin on a Jim Square
Heavy long, rumbling, tumbling
Step into my ride and your ass goes stumbling
Out the back with your neck in a rut
Gotta get home before the sun comes up on my...

Insane Clown Posse,"Greetings
Welcome to the gypsy of fortunes
Your coin was very much appreciated
And now I shall grant you your future
It seems my cards of tarot have dealt you a very odd hand
A hand of six jokers card, this is very rare
And suggest something neusant is approaching
You should be visited by a dark circus
A circus that holds pain and anguish
This travelling mass of evil will leave you corpse to rot
While entrapping your soul to displayed at future stops
Oh yes, you should also be aware that it is your own evil doings
That have brought about this carnival's visit
All of the sins and hatred you have cast during your life
Have whipped and spun into form, the form of one
One who leads this gruesome parade of pain into your life
One sinister beast, one known only as RINGMASTER
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the museum, the wax museum
Thousands of dead souls covered in wax
All of the rare exhibits you are about to encounter
Are strange and wonderous creations of the one and the only
Leader of them all
So both dead and undead please welcome the are-are-are-ringmaster

""Purpose, question, kill""

The ICP is of the Ringmaster
And the Ringmaster's of the attutes of mankind

Every wicked thing you've ever done
Has come back now
And it's gonna whip your little ass, bitchboy

Us, we're just clowns

I step forward, wind back
And swing this battle axe
Upside your motherfucking head
Hoooo!!!

So step right up cause the are-are-are-ringmaster
Takes you on the ride of your life
Horror and fear, smiles and tears
And oh everso over do

Through the forest and down the river
Along the valley, over the hill
And down the trail and up the sidewalk
Only to surprise you and yours
At your very front door

Drank my last cup of dead body stew

Walk around town with my guts hanging out
Chewin on toes, fuckin dead hoes
Bark at the moon everytime the wind blows
Why do I do the things that I do?
Who are you? Fuck you, and fuck Jerry Lou too
Fucked your mother at the Motel 8
Fingers in her booty, strawberry shake
Daddy walks in and see the sick clown
Moving his butt-cheeks up and down

ICP in this bitch
Ya know what I'm saying
All you bitches, man
Come over to my house
And I'ma take ya upstairs
And I'ma stick you with my wang
Ya know what I'm saying?
I stuck her with my wang
She hit me in the balls
I grabbed her by her neck
And I bounced her off the walls
She said it was an accident and then apologized
But I still took my elbow and blackened both her eyes
I stuck her with my wang
Bitchy bitchy hoe
I'd like to stick a Faygo bottle in her neden hole
I twist ya and turn ya, just to shake it up
Pop off the lid now it's shooting out her butt
I stuck her with my wang
She grabbed by me nuts
She told me that she loved me then commenced on the sucking
I tried to hold it back, but I nutted in her ear
When it dried up, the bitch couldn't hear

(Chorus)
I stuck her with my wang (He stuck her with his wang, yo)
I stuck her with my wang (He stuck her with his wang, then he hit the door)

I stuck her with my wang
I'm ringing dingaling
After I hit it, my boys will do the same
Bitches come in flocks when the carnivals in town
Suckin on my nuts, trying to be down
I stuck her with my wang
The freaky little slut
She wanted me to stick my finger in and out her butt
I asked the bitch why, she gave no reply
I went psycholistic and I stuck it in her eye
I stuck her with my wang
I hit it slow motion
I had the Ringmaster brew me up a love potion
I put it on her neden, I know this sounds insane
Her coochie started whistling and singing out my name
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy, stick me with your wang!

(Chorus X2)

I stuck her with my wang
I hit it chicken style
I hit up in Meijer's in the home improvement aisle
She called me Bob Vila when I stuck it in the place
I tied her legs behind her head and kicked her in the face
I stuck her with my wang
I took some Elmer's glue
I slapped it on her titties and I stuck her to the roof
And when I came back, I opened up the door
Her titties were so long they was draggin on the floor
I stuck her with my wang
A little two on one
I told her call a friend over, we can have some fun
I heard her knock knock, I'm finna get some stank
I opened up the door
Hi, I'm Frank
I kicked him in his ass (He kicked him in his ass, yo)
I kicked him in his ass (He kicked him in his ass then we fucked him up)

But I can't see em in my mirror, uh

They're trying to figure out a way to cut off my head
Hiding under covers, they're trying get me
But I can tell one of them is under there with me

Can't do a thing, just let it ring

Aw, shit here it comes creeping through the cracks
The nooks the crannys it hit me smack!
It's filling up my head I gotta get it out
I got me a plan to get the shit out
Pulled out a ice-pick and picked the bitch up
Smackin' it pushin' it in my ear fuck!
Lord oh please what's happening to me?
It's the poisonous air from the smokestacks G
Seeping in my head, fucking up my brain
Driving me crazy, nuts, insane
Sewer, sludgy, greasy slime I'm always bucking with all the time
'cause he's my motherfucking enemy number one
Trying to puncture on my life by filling up my lungs
The shit you call air, but I call it death
'Cause it makes me choke and lose my breath
My toes begin to curl, my fingers start to fold
Got drool on my lips and my body's getting cold
Don't know what to do so now I start to panic
But it's too late, I'm dead the smog got me fucked!

It's another cloudy day, it's raining, but not water
It's raining oil out the sky I think I oughta
Make a run but I slipped on an oil-slick
I can't move, I think I broke my fucking neck
It's no surprise, I'm laying there paralyzed
Looking up into the sky helped me realize about us
The clouds form a Devil's face, it must be a mirror image of the human race
And oh shit, here it comes-the deadly smog
I can tell by the howl of the stray dog
The air is calm, the streets are so still
When the smog creeps out the pipes for a kill
Broken neck, I'm chillin' 'cause I'm a gonner
I can see the smog creepin' around the corner
I lay still and hope it doesn't notice me
Oh shit, shit, fuck, fuck, shit G!
Looking up just to see his deadly jaws
I think, I think, I think I shit my draws
But its okay, the smog left me alone
So I lay and watch the clouds turn into stone
And come crashing down over Del Ray
One even landed on your homeboy Violent J
And I'm dead, crushed me in a split second
So if I'm dead then what the fuck I'm doin' on this record?

Thoughts in my head
Of a dead body laying in his house for 3 weeks
Until his neighbors complain about the smell
Didn't he have anybody to know he was dead?
Thoughts in my head
Of a serial killer in Iowa decided to kill himself
Before he actually killed someone else
Was that good?
Thoughts in my head
Of an ocean of blood
That when the bombs drop and causes tidal waves
Tidal waves that paint the town red
Everybody's dead
Thoughts in my head
Of mothers and fathers who look at me
And I can feel the hatred in their in eyes
And it's cold
And children are nothing but them in the future 
Accept it
Thoughts in my head
Of a woman sitting on her porch, bald-headed
Because of a disease she caught from the air
The air that we breathe
The air we breathe is fucked up--Its fucked up!
Thoughts in my head 
Of people want to kill me
But you can't kill me
'cause if you kill me, I'll be back to kill you
Done it before, do it again
Thoughts in my head 
Of a sixteen year old little fucking punk
Sitting in his classroom
Drawing a gang sign on a folder
In his Birmingham Hills
Well fuck what you know about love
Thoughts in my head 
Of people despise me and hate me and don't know me
I hate you too
So it's all good, it's all good
Thoughts in my head
Of a society that is so fucked up and so evil
That if somebody prays, they get made fun of and laughed at
But it's not gonna be funny
They'll be laughing
When the bombs drop and the town is red

Insane Clown Posse,"Well, I'm headed down the southern trail, I'm goin' chicken huntin'

""Wake...
Revenge is mine
12 people will die tonight""

Now I look and then reborn
Though I have just until dawn
I remember every face
Spirits show me every place
First one sleeps inside his bed
Place my fingers on his head
To each temple push and smother
Till my fingers touch each other

Next one makes love to his wife
Only wish to take his life
For his family's done no wrong
Place his children on the lawn
Tell the misses, leave the room
Less she wish to witness doom
Grab the squirming filthy goat
And shove the dresser down his throat

I must quickly use my gift
Next two work the midnight shift
Drinking coffee in the back
I will listen to them chat
Hear them speaking of my death
Hear the laughter in their breath
But the laughter quickly died
When their heads collide

Die!
You're gonna die...

Now my anger's growing worse
Next one's working as a nurse
Have to make a doctor's call
Drag my body down the hall
Grab a scalple and a blade
Time to play the nurse's aide
Operate and strap her down
Carve her face into a clown

Killed another then three more
Now we're down to only four
This man drives a taxi cab
Another wicked life to grab
Screaming that he'd thought I'd died
Let's go for a taxi ride
In the wreck of twisted steel
The stearing wheel becomes his meal

This man watches his TV
Scanning channels endlessly
Stops at station forty-four
It's the Wicked Clown Show
Watch me juggle, watch me dance
In 3-D watch me enhance
Watch me crawl out from the screen
And squeeze your neck until you're green

Die!
You're gonna die...

Time...

Even though, there's just one left
I feel my bones becoming stiff
And now I wonder endlessly
The spirits have abandoned me
My limbs are falling piece by piece
My ears and fingers in the street
But still yet see no morning sun
And here's my victim's early run

Quickly grab him from behind
Round his neck with fishing twine
Keep him still and pull the string
Watch his head go bobbaling
Listen to my riddle song
Even though my crime was wrong
Murder me just for your law
And I'll be back for all y'all

Die!
You're gonna die...

Just because now and then I like to let it stretch
Up a couple feet to get a better sight
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright
No, so, now how ya gonna act?
So what if I got another arm growing out of my back
I guess I'm just another freak show thing
And now they got me in the three ri-ii-ii-ing

Oh shit, I knew I had to fuck up my circuits
'cause when I was two my momma left me at the circus
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows
Like bad boys, hermaphrodites and old man crow
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone

[Violent J]
She was lovely, long hair, short, nice figure though
So at the funeral, it made me cry, watch her die
I cannot lie, I couldn't sleep without a wink
I only think about my lady, I want my baby
I need her by my side, to hold me, to squeeze me
           
I still have pictures, but all they do is tease me
I see my therapist, he only tells me I'm in trouble
I want my baby back, so now I pack a shovel
And while I'm digging, it's awfully dark and kinda funny
Don't dig too fast or to see things could get bloody
I watch my baby, I hit the top of baby's coffin
I thinking, she's better off inside if she died
Yeah, she needs me, I can tell my baby wants me
'cause every night at 2:15, my baby haunts me
I prey it open, the odor hits me, there she is
I lean down to give her a kiss because I need a...

[Chorus (1x)]
Girl that make me happy, a girl that make me cry
A girl that passed away back in 1985
A girl I plan to marry, a girl I plan to wed
A girl I chew on 'cause my baby is already dead

(2x)
Cemetery lady, my cemetery girl
Cemetery baby, I want you in my world
Cemetery woman, we can still be down
You're more than just a corpse to a psychopathic clown

""Fuck yeah, motherfucker
I don't want no stuck up
Little sassy rassy bitch
Ya know what I'm saying
I want me a cold stanky bitch
So bring it on, dead momma""

[Violent J]
She's as lovely as always, my baby hasn't changed
Except for the hole that's in her forehead, you can see her brains
Nevertheless, our love is still forever true
Her eyes have withered, her skin has now a tint of blue
My baby's dusty and dirty, and wrinkled clothes
And now I notice, the maggots chewed off all her toes
The earth has been rather cruel to my darling sugar
Is that a bug upon her face? oh, it's just a booger
I lean her head back to kiss her cracking lips
And then her neck crack, also does her hips
I must be gentle, my baby girl's a little rusty
A little dusty, but most of all, a little musty
I notice that, when we lay together on the lawn
We lay till dawn, I notice her left eye is gone
We said goodbye and everything turned out alright
I'll see you again tomorrow night, because I need a...

[Chorus (1x)]

Check it out, bitch!
You aren't getting stank, skank
Get your asses shoveling
Then you'll want a lil somthin somthin
Them cramey graveyard bitches
They DOWN WITH THE CLOWN!!!

Insane Clown Posse,"""This is a Channel 7 news brief because the news is happening now! 
Good evening  Mort Perkins reporting. Our top story tonight: Police and 
investigators are still trying to figure out how and why somebody stole four dead bodies from the 
Wayne County morgue late Monday night. Police say the apparent body thief entered 
through the basement window  but how they eluded the security and alarm system is still a 
mystery. But what we at Channel 7 are wondering: What kinda sick FUCK would steal four 
dead bodies anyway? Details at 11."" 

Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street. 
55-65, bodies at least. 
I hang with the stiffs till the break of dawn. 
I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn. 
Drag 'em in the house, throw 'em in the oven. 
Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin'. 
Tastes like chicken, finger lickin' deep fried. 
I ate a dead body, but don't tell. I lied. 
I just ate my first dead body last week, 
Still got the fingernail caught in my teeth. 
Before ya start yellin' and cursin' my name, 
Remember somethings wrong with my brain, insane. 
Second I was born, doctor threw me against the wall. 
Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall. 
I'm sliding and I'm boucin' off shit like a hockey puck. 
And my mother's like, ""What the fuck?!"" 
He said I was born of an alien race. 
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face. 
But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand. 
I'm just a dead body man. 

""We've got bodies! Dead bodies! We got fat ones, skinny ones, males, females, 
hermaphrodites! We got somebodies! We got nobodies! Bodies, bodies, bodies! 
WOO!"" 

Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van. 
All the little kiddies love the dead body man. 
I drive through my neighborhood ringin' my bell. 
Some people run cause they don't like the smell. 
Others line up just as quick as they can. 
To try to catch a glimpse of the dead body man. 
It's all good, if you can stand the funk. but uh..... 
Just don't look in the trunk. 
I drive down central kickin' the bass. 
Chillin' with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face. 
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head. 
Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead. 
I'm a hoe you can't trust, always diggin' a nut. 
A dead body bitch learned to keep her mouth shut. 
Riding in the back is my dead body crew. 
Only they can never think of nothin' to do. 
If you think I'm sick, take a look at yourself. 
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf. 
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand. 
I'm just the dead body man. 

""We also collect dead bodies! So if you know any dead people, 
or you yourself are planning on dying soon, 
we'll be happy to come to your house and pay cash for it!
We appreciate good, healthy, stiffs for our dinner! WAHOO!""

It's Friday night, dark, scary
Lonely, walking through the park, cemetery
And its foggy, cold and smoggy
Hear a dog, a howling doggy
I'm scared, should of brung the shotgun
Should of, would of, but I ain't got one
So I watch my back, and what's that
The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback
Better run, hide, quick, fast
He's coming for my ass with a shovel
No where to run, nore to hide but the grave bit
So I dove in, I did the dumb shit
Took a fall, deeper than six foot
Down the stairs, hit a floor and through a door
Into a whole new world of stiffs
Bodies, heads, and sexy little dead chicks
Club lights, sounds, bass
DJs spinnin with maggots on they face
And what I saw next then really took me
Uh, they did the headless boogie

[Chorus (2x)]
Hey yo, I heard that you died
Fuck that, it's time to get live
Dead bodies let's all take a ride
Lean to the left and slide (the headless boogie)

""Oh yeah, we dug up the finest 
Bitches in the graveyard
So come on down
And if you ain't come to get your funk out
Then get the fuck out, bitch""

[Violent J]
They all stand straight and swing to the side
No heads, but they feet still glide
Take a step back, twist and dive
I even seen Kurt Cobain get live (blam!)
No heads, but they all funky
And drunk, drinking old Spunky
Don't be shy, everyone's able
Hit the floor, leave your nugget on the table
And kick-step, and when you do kicks off
If you're dead, your legs might fall off
The whole time I can't believe
I can't conceive, I don't want to leave
I'm kicking into a freak with no head
No face, but the rest is straight
She's with it, I hit it like a G
Her back fell off, eww, excuse me
Zombies, mummies, and Frankenstein
Drinkin 'cisco disco dead wine
Dead stiffs coming through the door
Head, speakers, and limbs on the floor
I'm getting drunk, I want to be down, what's up
I want to be the headless clown
They pulled out the jigsaw and got raw
And that ended it all, I did the headless boogie 

[Chorus (2x)]

""Hey yo, fuck that voodoo moshing, bitch
You come and freak it with the real dead juggalos
So come on by and we'll cut your nugget off
So you get grave dancing!!!""

Insane Clown Posse,"I'm Coming Home

I live my life in the gutter
And this gutter is who I am
Take me back home to my gutter
And I swear I won't ever leave again!

[Violent J]
Hey, I'm coming home 
Home to the criminals and crooks
Home to the gangbangers shooting dirty looks
Home to the killer cops beating on my ass
Home to my '72 Velarick, praying it will last
Pass by the rich bitches trying to play me out
Dawging on my neighborhood, don't know what it's about
So now I'm clockin dunkets, never hang out with the rich
I'd rather hang out with the crooked at the party store, bitch
Give me codey, dawg, with a little smog
'cause it tastes better than the poisonous fog
Seeping from the sewers in my slummy neighborhood
But the ghetto got love and the love is all good
So I don't give a fuck about your mansion by the lake
You can suck my dingaling until your neck breaks
'cause all I want to do is hang with the zombie
In the zone, break out with the Faygo, I'm coming home

[Chorus (1x)]
Home to the creatures, home to the crooks
Home to the fools readin witchcraft books
Home to the monsters roaming the land
I want to come home but ya don't understand

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Bitch, I'm coming home and I'm not alone
Jokers and freaks, and their dead body bones
Every single thing that you never want to see
Add it all together and you got me
I know nobody gives a fuck about your punk ass rules
Keystone coppers and your hypocrite schools
I'd much rather lay around the streets of the gutter
And make dirty phone calls to your rich mother
Caught her passed midnight and I'm waking up the dead
Then we playin kickball with somebody's head
We got skinny dipping in the barrels of toxic waste
After that I pour myself a little taste
So tell your daughter that she's nothing but a fat bitch
And all my homies don't care if the hoes rich
Somebody out here, please, let me know where there's a phone
I need to call my mother and tell her I'm coming home

[Chorus (1x)]

[Violent J]
And I'm coming home, chicken chicken bones
Sugar prom bushes, and ice cream cones
All these fake people sayin hi to one another
Then they sit around and talk shit about each other
Watering they grass, digging in they ass
Trying to make sure they didn't lose any cash
Working hard, all your life, and now you're finally rich
But look at you, you're just another whack bitch

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Crawl in the slum that's where I'm from
Murderers and slaughterers, so that's what I've become
Spare a little change 'cause I just ran out of gas
Reach for your quarter and I'll stick your fuckin ass

[Violent J] Nobody wants to be around the ghetto breed
But the ghetto got each other and that's all we really need
[Shaggy 2 Dope] So what the fuck am I doing down here, I gotta land of my own

[Violent J]
Laying in my bed, I think of many horror tales
Yet I barely move, my bed is made of nails
I try to roll, my skin slowly tears away
My flesh is stuck to my bed as I begin my day
Walking out the house, this morning, the sky is red
The streets are crowded with the bodies of the living dead
They're trying to die, they're leaping off of roof tops
Uh, they only scream in pain as their body flops
I'd rather stay inside my home and only pray to die
But my house is been on fire since like '85
I can only stand a night of the fatal smoke
But see you never die, you only burn and choke
So I leave out the house and walk the land
Wild pigs run and feed off the dying man
And look around you, there's bodies hanging from the trees
But they're not dying, they're only crying ""please""
I hear the thunder in the sky, so I run in hide
The deadly rain may soon come down, you got to get inside
The lunatics see the lightning, they're screaming, yes
It's raining blood, the streets are a bloody mess
About once or twice a week though it thunder storms
That's when giant heavy red and black clouds form
It's raining blood, livers, and kidneys from the sky
Prepare 'cause when you die, you're coming to the killing fields

""What shall that be? What shall that be? When that fine moment
comes. When the curtains are drawn, the windows are shut, the
doors close, and you've written what you've written, you said
it, that's it. What will you look to be? What about it, mister,
when you've had your last beer. You laughed at family and 
laughed at your little wife. She begged you not to go out to
that bar.""

[Violent J]
As I feed off a dead pig, I'm thinking back
To when I had a heart beat, and how I would act
I would steal from the poor, I'd laugh at the sick
But in the killing fields, you get your fucking neck ripped
So as I walk along, I meet a lot of strange folks
Some people with no eyes, and gashed open throats
And if they notice your eyeballs are working well
They try to dig em out your skull, and go for self
Now in the summertime, it's like a whole 'nother realm
Water victims, fire, and oceans overwhelm
To walk outside, the heat will surely cook your brains
Try to run across the street your hair will burst in flames
Victims in a panic run from the heated light
Underneath the city, into the sewer pipes
Into the fire storm this becomes your new land
But there's no food, so you feed off the other men
And now it's been seven months, I'm barely fed
I chase a Billy Billy goat with a human's head
He's steady screaming ""Let me be! Let me be!""
But while I chase him there's another demon chasing me
All of time moves backwards, I'm growing old
And the clouds are burning fire, and so I'm told
That there's a lot of living souls such as the rich
That choose to live like a bitch, I'll see you in the Killing Fields

""You've had your big time of lust and sin and filth. What is
the end going to be when you realize that time is up? You've
crossed the finish line going in the wrong direction. What 
shall it be? What about it, ya man? When you spent your life
in a few years time? You're burned out shell at 25 years of
age. What shall it be? What about it?

You could go to hell (what shall it be?)

I walked her all the way home when it got dark. 
She took me inside and when the door shut, 
Next thing you know, I had my nuts in her butt, uh. 
I wanna bitch that's down to fuck right away. 
And even does my homies if its ok. 
A little bitch that's down with a quicky, I love checky checky. 
I ain't being picky though. So you might be a little bit fat. 
You might even stink a bit, I don't mind that. 
Even if you don't fuck on the first date. 
Just put my nuts in your mouth and I'm straight 
I need a girl that just don't give a fuck. 
So I'm caught stroking her mom. I mean, so what? 
A little a skins here and there ain't nothin'. 
I just need a bitch who's down with a Lil' Somethin' Somethin'.

My name's Violent J, so I can't fuck around. 
Who's the dirtiest bitch in the whole town? 
There she go, she workin' at Dairy Queen. 
Bitch couldn't be a day over fifteen. 
So I threw her in the butt like that. 
I hit it so quick, I made her butt cheeks clap. HaHa 
Why wait around 'til she gets married. 
Cause I'm ready as long as her neden's hairy. 
Tootsie, Tootsie, Pumpkin Pie. Oops, looks like you nut in your eye. 
My fault I didn't notice you were still there. 
Now go in and wash that shit out your hair, bitch. 
I want a girl not afraid to bone, 
Even if her mommas and pops is still home. 
And if her daddy suddenly walks in, 
He just might see my nuts on his daughter's chin. 
Everybody in the hood says that your easy. 
You look a little cracked out, a little sleezy. 
Your a basehead, baby, it ain't shit. I'm still down if you down, 
For a Lil' Somethin' Somethin'. Somethin' Somethin' 

[Chorus]

Bitch let me hit, I won't be long As soon as I nut I'm gone. 
(Guess ya don't know.) 
Bitch let me hit, I won't be long As soon as I nut I'm gone. 
(But ya dog did.) 
Bitch let me hit, I won't be long As soon as I nut I'm gone. 
(It's the Southwest.)

""I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For 
his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye. Yes  it was this. One of his eyes 
resembled that of a vulture. A pale  blue eye with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me  my 
blood ran cold. And so  by degrees  very gradually  I made up my mind to take the life of 
the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever."" 

So I'm headed door to door 
With my grandmother's cookie jar. 
I'm sellin' cookies, 12 for a dollar. 
I ring the doorbell, nobody wants any. 
I resort to goin' cheaper - 2 for a penny. 
Anybody, everybody, they hate me. 
I can tell when they spit and degrade me. 
There's only one house left, the last on the block. 
Old Man Willie on the hilltop. 
I ring the doorbell, the door creeps open. 
And there it was starin' and scopin'. 
The man's left eye, red, big, and drippin' 
I was trippin'. ""Ahh, seeya!"" 
I ran home. I couldn't stop thinking 
About his eyeball winking and blinking. 
And it looked not a damn thing like the other. Ugh! 
Shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker. 
It hypnotized me, mesmerized me. 
Traumatized, paralyzed, terrorized me. 
Creepers, where'd you get that ball? 
And tell me how it even fits in your skull. 

I want a big long knife to stick it in. 
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in. 
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard. 
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye! 

[Chorus]
Evil eye... 
Oh-Oh-Eye (The bitch gon' die! Die-die-die-die-die-die-die) 
Evil eye... 
Oh Oh 

""Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you 
should've seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded with caution with 
what 
foresight, with what patience I went to work. I was never kinder to the old man 
than 
during the whole week before I killed him."" 

A day gone pass since I heard about J.O. 
Met up in this sleigh, 'cause I don't fuckin' play. 
Anyway, I gotta do him in. Got a rusty revolver 
Put the silver bullets in. 
I'm plannin' on playin' one right to his nugget. 
Down my drawers with the bucket. 
It's time to go, fuck it. 
I stuck it up... to his neck when he came to the door. 
I really didn't know what I was in for. 
First the cold man stared, no a gaze, no a stare. 
Kinda like there was no one there. 
How weird, my body froze with the blink of his eye. 
Evil eye, sendin' chills up my spine. 
What to do? What to do? I gotta try to break. 
I gotta try to make.. my way to the gate. 
Wait. I can't move, I'm stuck to the ground. 
W-What the fuck was that? I think I heard a sound, 
Turned around, there it was, starin' at my face. 
This little old man's eye's a make me a mental case. 
That's when I felt the pain deep inside, 
Deep inside, now his eye's open wide. 

I want a big long knife to stick it in. 
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in. 
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard. 
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye! 

[Chorus]

""That night it ceased. The old man was dead. I placed my hands on the heart and 
there for many minutes there was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye will 
trouble me 
no longer. His eye will trouble me no longer.""

Looking out, I seen strange men, cursing and filthy
There were clowns setting up the dreary tent""

Rather just chill in the yard in my casket
Call up the hoes, have em swing by the tomb
And get a little sticky stank up in this bitch 
Killer clowns kicked out the circus
Used to get live, let the midget lady work this
I was a freak show, they called me the Pogo
I could make my ball sac bob like a yo-yo 
Give it up, give it up, southwest looney tune
Killed another redneck, found his head in looney doon
Gooney boon, booney goon, I can hear the loons

But these clowns were different
There was nothing funny about these clowns but then
They smiled, they juggled, they laughed
But yet something was terribly, terribly wrong

I knew what they were really like
I knew that this carnival that had come to my village
Was an evil, evil thing""

Totally unaware of the evilness within the clowns

I had no excuse from the strong men, 
The freak show, and the Ringmaster""

[Violent J]
I was like six, I used to get dissed by the chicks
And everyone would chase me and hit me with bricks
And rocks and sticks and calling me names
And filled my lunchbox with frogbrains (eeww!)
When I left school, it was much iller
My daddy was a serial killer 
And how about that, he'd always make me sit in the back
With all his dead bodies on my lap (move!)
When I got home, enough of the static
Hammer and tools, went up to the attic
Never knew any other girls or boys
Only my toys, toys, toys
Bang! Clang! Hammer and twist
Nobody knows I exist, and I'm pissed
But I won't be mentally scarred
Instead I make toys, toys of the graveyard
Monday, ringing the bell
It's all about show and tell, might as well
Show all these bastards just what I got
Yo, check out my toy box!

""Nothing feels better than a good harty-harr, right boys and girls""

We got dead bodies everywhere you look
All the nerds sitting up front got cooked
Others start screaming and making a dash
So I start handing out toys fast at last
You like slinkies, we got slinkies
Only mine like to wrap around your face
And stretch, twist, kazoom
And whip your body all over the fuckin room
So come, one at a time
Open your gift and what you will find
Is a toy, my friend, that you'll never forget
It's not everyday that you get your skull split
You like soldiers, we got soldiers
Made with rubber and steel, they look real
But I wouldn't just toss em under your bed
That's how you get an axe to the forehead (oww)
And don't let em sit around all day
Come home and find you mom, dead in the hallway
'cause they can be nifty
All the toys are shifty, haha, in my toy box

""Woooowee, that sure sounds like fun!""

That's not a toy, hey, wait a minute
Don't fuck around, homie, you can lose an eye with it
That's my double blade razor whip chop jimmy
And it's mine, motherfucker, so gimme gimme
You want toys, you come to the right place
Try my little toy, Mutilating Mental Case
Wind him up, let him go among all of ya
Then BANG! serial slaughterer
Your turn, reach in and get lucky
Oh look, he pulled out a rubber ducky
It make a funny sound and then BANG! 
Blew the fingers off his fuckin hand
Don't stop, class ain't done yet
I remember you calling me poindexter
Bookworm brainy, my aggrevation
Went into these little creations
Reach in, you might find something wicked
Wicked, scary, chop bang pickadery
Off with your head, a robot with a sword

I'm taking too long gettin dressed, tryin to look my best 
Because today is not your ordinary every morning 
My high school prom is coming and I heave my daddy's warnings 
I'm going to find myself a girl to take to the prom 
I shouldn't have too much trouble because I'm 
I'm very nice, my mother says I'm very handsome 
When I wear my good vest, and mother knows best 
I got to school, I straggle through the hallways 
I stop and gaze at all the girls just like always 
But this time, I must now approach them (or) 
Or my daddy might get mad and break my wrist again (ow) 
And so I chose her, her hair, it matches with her face 
She is so lovely, my heart pulse begin to race 
I make my way between her friends and to her presence

I'd rather die, I'd rather die, I'd rather die... (repeat over)

There was a time when I could except a no 
That was before, Christine is gonna have to go 
My parents will be proud of me when I bring her home 
So now I sit and watch her practice in the gym dome 
Christine is famous, she has so many different friends 
Will they miss her when she's dead or will they just pretend 
Nobody talks to me, I only talk to I 
And I been telling myself all day, she's gotta die

like to congradulate our Senior class and wish them at tonight's 
Prom dance."" 

Won't you be my prom queen? (I can be your prom baby) 
Won't you be my prom queen?

It was really fuckin easy, I'm a human hater 
I took a towel from the locker room to suffocate her 
I had to throw away her gym bag and all her folders 
And when it got dark, I caried her home on my shoulders 
My daddy was asleep, when I snuck her in the back 
I thought about my situation and it's kind of whack 
It sounds cheap, but we're having prom in my cellar 
But she's dead, I guess I'll never have to tell her 
I took the bottles of Tamiace, four dollars worth 
I took the seventeen dollars that was in her purse 
I bought balloons and streaming and stuff to munch 
I had a dollar left, I bought a Faygo Punch 
I hung the streamers and balloons on my basement wall 
I banged my head a couple times, I'm just too fuckin tall 
I would have took her to the school like a normal man 
But I had to kill her first they'd never understand 
I put a record on and then I picked her up to dance 
I bet she cannot feel the woody growing in my pants 
I know my daddy would be proud of all that I've done 
Instead of burning me, he'd probably come and hug his son 
I think about it as I dance slowly to the beat 
The more I think about it tears are rolling down my cheek 
I hope I showed Christine a night like no other 
After all, that's how my daddy did my mother

all their great work. Prom night is your very own special night,

Through the hideous darkness, it lurches, driven by death itself
Only the satisfaction of slaughter will cause it to return to

Boys and girls, it's nighty night time
Happy J the Clown has a nursery rhyme
It's about, The Boogie Woogie Man
Keep your light on as long as you can
Cause when it cuts off, so does your head
Boogie Woogie Woogie waits under your bed
With a shank, splah!, up through the bottom
Little Jimmy Jimmy, uh, got em

""It's the one and only Boogie Man
He creeps, he hides, he sneaks, he slides
If you little feetsies are hanging off the edge of the bed
You're running on stumps motherfucker!!!""

Well, moonlight fills the room that you sleep in
Things go bump in the night, me creeping
Ouch! Fuck! I stubbed my toe
If you'd just quit leaving your shit all over the fucking floor
Fuck it, you're dead anyway
And I'm gonna leave your head smack dab in the hallway
In the morning, when your daddy walks out
AAAAHHH!!! His foots in your mouth, thanks to the Boogie Man

""Does the Boogie Man really exist?""
Well, is your mother a bald-headed freak bitch? yes
You fall asleep and you wake up dead
With a broken broom sticking out your forehead
I sing lullabies till you dose off
Tie you down and chew your fuckin toes off
And then spit em out back in your face
Splat! Fuck, wash your feet bitch!

""The world's famous Boogie Woogie Wu will come to you
Slumber parties, sleepovers, intimate nights
What the occasion for the midnight hour
He will gladly come and fuck that shit up""

I don't beat woman, fuck that, I'm above it (no no)
But I'll cut her fucking neck and think nothing of it
""I bet you didn't know the Boogie Man was a clown
But when you see the juggla, your holding your jugular""
With a swing, chop, stab, swing, chop
You're holding your neck together, but your nuts drop
And the cops do the best they can
They pull the axe out your face and say
""Was it the Boogie Man?""

Cause the Boogie Man will creep
Through my window in my room
Stab me with a broken broom
Please don't let me fall sleep
Cause the Boogie Man will creep
Through my window in my room

""It's the incredible, undeadable Boogie Man
Go ahead, pull the covers over your head
Hide under them, he don't give a fuck
It'll just make it that much more easier
For him to suffocate your face!""

There's three ways to stop me from doing what I do
What? you think I'm a tell you
""Mom, can you leave the door open a bit?""
Thanks, an easy way in, you fucking idiot

I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick
And then to get your attention in the crowded place
I'd simply walk up and stick my nuts in your face

Yeah, freak with your nuts, yo, that'll get her
Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better
Look, fuck you, I got a strong rap
Shit, you don't want contestant number two
He's mad-whack

I walk into a bar and there he was
Standing up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it
It was a big fucking smelly, ass farm llama

I got shot, ah!, the murder was heinous 
The bullet went in my eyeball and out my anus 
And I was hit, that was it, on the spot 
Flash, I woke up in a parking lot 
And I'm sittin in a '64 Reinkeys 
With Shaggy Dope written on the car keys 
I look around I can't believe that it's possible 
I'm dead, and I made it to the carnival 
I walk in, it's everything I dreamed of 
Everybody and they momma got clown luv 
Japanese, Lebanese, and Chinese, 
Portuguese, and southwest ghetto g's. (woowoo) 
Hangin' out with redneck truck drivers 
Instead of always givin' each other piledrivers 
I see my old homey, he died in a drag
Chillin with two bitches, ""What up, Shaggs?"" 
And he passed me a blunt like a tree trunk 
I tried to hit it, but couldn't even fuck with it
And to think, I always been afraid to die 
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why. 

[Chorus (2x)]
We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry
Even though most never try
I'm not gonna let this pass me bye, no

[Violent J]
I was born, first, they threw me in a shit pile 
I dealt with it, and lived there for a while 
I got dissed on, pissed on, and beat down
Mutilated, and tossed out a dead clown 
Next thing ya know, I'm chillin' at the big top 
Free money, and mad bitches non-stop 
No water, it's Faygo on tap 
I wash my hair, and my face, and my butt-crack with it
'cause I can, 'cause I'm phat paid 
I got a five story funhouse with a maid 
And she walks around with her titties hanging out 
And when I cough, she come and dust my balls off (woowoo) 
I'm headed up to the show, I'm gonna see 
Jimi Hendrix, Selena, and Eazy E 
Elvis tried to open up but got dissed off 
We got pissed off, because he sounded like butt 
There's no fights, it's a perfect match 
Hillbillies in the crowd tryin' to cabbage patch 
And to think, I've always been afraid to die 
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why. 

[Chorus (2x)]

[Violent J]
Did ya ever burn your finger on somethin? hey 
Well picture this, your nuts burnin that way
And a roman candle stickin' in your butthole 
That's where the greedy skank motherfuckers go 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
This is all hell now, we livin' in it 
But this bullshit'll be over in a minute 
Then it's off to the Faygos and neden hoes 
New clothes, and patent leather for your toes (woo-woo) 

[Violent J]
And while you sit around cryin' for your dead friend 
He's chillin' up there, paid, getting mad ends 
He's probably there tryin to figure out why you're sad
He's on the beach gettin' fat, you got it bad 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And for those who ain't down for the next man 
Who rob from the poor, and snatch all ya can 
And any chicken talkin' shit, lemme tell ya something 
Hold a lighter to your balls, and you'll see what's coming

Insane Clown Posse,"""Come and get it! Woo! 
We got some fresh fills for your fat chicken-ass to snack on, bitch! 
So here, start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie, motherfucker!""

The first little piggy, his house is made of wood 
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine 
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine 
I rode into town with my axe in my holster 
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster 
A farmer at the border, he tried to take me out 
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his chicken feathers out 
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place 
He opened up his door, and popped me in the face 
And blew me off the porch, and cracked my head in half 
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh (he he) 
Forty in hand, I rose from the dead 
And threw with all my might, I made a ping noise off his head 
Since we out west, I had a little fun
And pulled his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium

[Chorus]
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie 
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die 
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes) 
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick 
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick 
He sits on his bench and gets all the respect 
But if I get a chance, I'm goin' straight for the neck 
He walked in the room, and everybody rose 
Lopped off bucket chillin' underneath my clothes
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit 
But what this piggy don't know is he's about to get his neck wet 
Now I see the bailiff, I'm thinkin' what the fuck?
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up 
Old-ass man, I let him get away 
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow anyway 
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case 
His eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin' face 
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me to die 
So I ragged on the bucket, made it fuckin' rain pork rinds

[Chorus: x2]

The last little piggy, his house is made of gold 
He lives in a mansion on his own private road
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait 
I bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate
Cause this little piggy, must definitely fry 
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky 
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil 
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel 
People in my city, they fightin' for they meals 
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills 
How rich he is the devil, he never will admit it 
So I'm a take his money stack and stuff his face with it 
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed 
I grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head 
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late 
And took away his dough and watched the devil suffocate
Cause I need

Voodoo, runnin' from my magic

Brain insane, ??????
Southwest voodoo's in the haugh!
Wicked voodoo, dope dark killer
Magic, dark magic

Met this kid named Louie Lou
He thought he could fuck with this voodoo
So I turned his head into a lima bean
And then flicked it off his shoulders

From Mookan House to Shangra La
Egyptian Pharaoh, coompata
Follow me, and join us as we pray
To the seventeen moons of Coonga Del Ray

Walked in the lunchroom chantin' spells
With bamboo bitches and voodoo bells
Got my own food, who wants some?
I got possum nipples and raccoon tongue

A non-believer once started to laugh
So I launched a fireball up his punk-ass
Then everybody heard him squeal
""This voodoo shit's for real!""
It just takes...

A handful of neden, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo

Hey! J! What's in the bag?

A shrunken head, and shriveled scrotum sac
Why? Ya think voodoo's fake?
Come to the graveyard, I'll make the dead wake

Sleep no longer, raise, quick
Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba,

I was just a child but you seemed like so much more
The way you would avenge me and drift across the floor
I'd see you in the hall, and you'd kiss me with a smile
I never understood it, was I even worth your while?
The others kids at school, they would hate me and they'd spit
'cause I was just a no one, to them I wasn't shit
But you would always help me and stand there by my side
We were only seventeen, we'd be together till we died
But then it all happened on the ever dreadful day
Somebody tried to rape you and now I'll make him pay
You pointed him out to me, my thoughts began to race
I took my daddy's forty-five and shot him in the fucking face!!!
I did it all for you, and though I'm facing years
I would do the time just to equal all your tears
The last thing that you told me when I left the courtroom
Is that we'd always be together, 'cause we're both under the moon

I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed
We'll always be together 'cause we're both under the moon

I justified your pain, but now I sit alone
I write another letter, I write one every day
I never got a letter back, I write em anyway
I try to call collect, your number has been changed
I'm staring at the lightbulb and I start to feel the rage
You never came to visit me, I sit facing the glass
No one's on the other side, now it's in the past
My head is always spinning, I'm pounding at the wall
I feel like I'm forgotten, no sign of you at all
You're probably getting married, you're probably getting fucked
I'll break out of this cage and try to cut that motherfucker up
I curl up in the corner, my body will corrode
My teeth are turning into dust, skin is growing mold
I'm staring at the window of my eternal doom
I know that you are out there, somewhere underneath the moon

Does she still remember? God, he only know
I know become a savage, they chain me to a wall

The world it doesn't want me, my dignity is tossed
And to the girl for whom I feel this doom

Rip out the be	-be	-be	-be	-brains and put a candle in it

(1st Verse- Violent J)
Fat Sweaty Betty, the bitch ain't nothing new
Her moms used to babysat me back when we was two
We'd go to the playground and to the skating rink
And we'd go under the bleachers and she'd let me hit the stank, well uh
She moved across town and never came back
Until the other day, I seen her at the Chicken Shack
She said her name was Betty, I can't believe this shit
The sexy little girl is now a fat sweaty beeitch
She said, ""Hey, J, tell me how you've been?""
She had a piece of chicken gizzard stuck to her chin
I told her, ""Hold still,"" and flicked it off her face and said,
""Betty, oh, Betty, what you say we leave this place?""
I took her back to the crib and hit it all night
I let my fingers run across the rip of cellulite
EWW! It was nasty, but I don't let it bother me
She rolled over, fucking knocked the wind out of me
I couldn't breathe, she wouldn't stop, I'm almost dead
I took the lamp, and bust it on her fucking head
We got dressed, I gave her a little kiss goodbye
Fat Sweaty Betty, My fat sweaty pumpkin pie

Tell me when you're ready (x2)


(2nd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
Big fat slop of shit people call Betty
Flabs of fat on her back, her neck...sweaty
Boogers running down her nose all over her lips
Can't tell the difference from her titties to her hips
But fuck all that, 'cause I want to see the neden
I had to see the cat, the cheesey cheena cheden
Rode my bike to her house, ""Hey yo, Betty lemme in
I'm packing some snack cakes, bitch lemme in.""
I can hear her coming down the stairs
She opened up the door in her motherfucking underwears
UUGGHH!! Shit, fuck that I'm turning back
But no, the door shut, and she's going for the cake snacks
I said, ""Relax, hoe, I'm here, I'm bu-si-ness
you can have the candy, first you gotta wait a bit
I need a favor, come on, Betty, drop them drawls.""
AHH!! I knew it, Betty had balls
Oh, no, here comes that ass

I wish I never came, oh boy do I wish
See Fat Sweaty Betty, the sweaty fat bitch

Right then the corpse came jumpin out a tree
Way out a tree
And fallin on top of me
Back on my feet
As I began my face
Put my hands around his neck and tried to put it in a brace
But a nope, that's not how the shit goes
His head popped off and started nibblin on my toes
I got dead bodies to the right
I got dead bodies to the left
I thought the cary one, but what about the rest?
Tie me up with some veins dragen me into the tomb
I knew I had to be doomed
'cause I can hear the loons in my head
It was dead, echoin through my brain
Tellin me somthin's wrong then I felt the pain

(Chorus)
Fuck! Damnit! Another Halloween
People on Military know what this means
Houses on fire, they're blowin up cars
Creatures in the streets, and razor blades and candy bars

I went to trick-or-treat the first house on my block
Spit in my face and gave my a rock
I tried to give it back and said ""I'll take nothing instead""
Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head

Walked to the next house directly next door
There I saw an old lady dead on the floor
I said ""Excuse me miss, but do you have a treat?""
She lifted her leg and scrapped flakes off her dead feet

I ran to the next house happy and giddy
And there I seen a fat woman holding up her titty
I said, ""Trick-or-treat."" she sad ""Treat-or-trick.""
And squeezed on her titty until it.....fuck it, that's too sick

Next house up was sittin back in the woods
I was a lil frightened but fuck I want the goods
I knocked on the door I heard a knock back
And then I heard ""COME ON IN"" and yo I'm like FUCK DAT

This house belongs to Mrs. Cherry Spoon
She said, Drop your drawers and your treat is coming soon
I quickly grew a stiffy, but kept my eyes shut
A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts

I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst
And chillin in the drive was a long black hurst
I rang the door bell and said Is anybody home
Of course little biy have a sugar coated kidney stone

I walked throught the field, and to the next crib
Her friendliness could only be in her cooking bib
I said ""How bout some candy."" she said How bout instead,
A nice hot fresh home made loaf of yeast infection bread

My bag's gettin heavy so I rest on the curb
And riding on his bike her comes little Larry Shurb
I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat
I punched him in the neck, and power bombed him in the street

Now my bag of candy has doubled in size
Up to the next house for my scary prize
I'm like trick-or-treat, trick treat tricky dick
He opened up his door slapped my lips and didn't give me shit

Rock through his window and ran across the street
To the Dayton Mansion I'm in for a treat
I dinged on the dong, and here comes the butler
A big gumpy tall ass lurch lookin motherfucker

I said Hello Mr. is there somethin for my sack
He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back
It's taking him an hour, my bag is open ready
But then he finally dropped it in my sack, a fucking penny

The next house is abandonded so forget it
But wait a minute, I think somebody's livin in it
I ran up to the door ""Trick-or-treat, you can't hide""
It was a crackhead, he crawled in my bag and died

The next house is mine the last on the block
My mother's sitting on the porch shining up her glock
I climbed on the roof with my brother Jump Steady
And we yelled ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE!"" to the whole city

Pull his plugs out and start chokin'
Eww, his necks already broken

He swung, hit me wit' a bed pan
I was just makin sure you ain't dead man
Fuck this, I grabbed a scalpel
And stick it down in his scalp, uuh

Calm down, he's dead now, fuck
Here comes somebody, better duck
Gotta hide dead Jimmy quickly

And sometime she do an acrobatic flip on my nuts
And it feels so good
So tell your boys that they all a bunch of jump suckers
I walk around your neighborhood chokin motherfuckers

Shit changed when I started hanging out with Zeus
And if you take me out you know I'm commin back again
With my homeboys Jack and the Cannon ManHe come flyin
out the barrel doin Mock 9
With his fist commin straight for your spine
Never fuck with the Shaggs 'cause it's always ticken

I notice that the house is vacant, I'm starin at no one
I must of fell asleep, I woke up on the floor
Underneath the carpet, underneath the boards
I'm gaged with a dead rat, I lay for many weeks
The rat comes back to life, and is chewing on my cheeks

My brain is gone, my brain is gone
say no more my brain is gone (4x)

Coming is my helper, tangling my brain
Somethings wery wrong I can't describe this pain
I'm calling for my mother, I'm crawling up the stairs
My mothers laughing at me, and she's been dead for years
I'm falling down the stair case, tumble to the floor
I land up in the attic, next to the cellar door
I'm play with the pigons, they tell me many lies
They tell me I'll have wings if I let them peck my eyes

I hear a womans voice calling from the dirt
I plat my little seed, and slowly she will spurt
And now she is a tree, I hear the heart pound
I take her in my arems, and we make love to the sound
The wind is my ebony blowing evil thoughts
Carrying the demons soring with the hearts
I put it in my body, the wind will bring the rain
Only lay it's demon egg, deep inside my brain
They're calling me a killer, I can't say that I'm not
My daddy's tried to kill me ever since I was a tot
By poisoning my bottle, I feed it to my friend
'cause if he dies my buddy our friendship will never end
I'm sitting with the darkness, talking to the dark
It's singing lullabies, and stringing on the harp
I notice that the floor is warm and rather sick
It's 'cause I'm sitting in my stomach

I was stabbed in the head
Look what ya done dead
All the blood bleed, one juggalo dead
It was a cold, dark, scary Halloween
So my neighbors and my people,
they didn't really like me right?
So they came and burn down my world
Just because I like to murder their boys and girls
It was the Halloween I never ment to harm no one
I thought you were supposed to murder it was all in fun
I see the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer to
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?

I come for the people that took away my life
Trick or treat bitch, my dead body speaks
You tricked me now it's only right

Milky bar with the delicious razor blade filling
I got fudge freshly packed from the worlds rarest fudge packer

But not before I take these bitches on a murder ride
Murder go round the dead body clown
Put the treats in your mouth, and swish it around
Excuse me little boy, but is your daddy home?
Thank you sonny here's a little treat now run along
Hey buddy, you thought I was dead, man
You probably stuffed the fuckin' shank in my head

But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?

Your buddies and your neighbors can come along for the ride
Weak bitches, you thought that you had me beat
But this aolloween I'm commin back with my Rotten Treats

Insane Clown Posse,"Once upon a time there were three little pigs
Who went out into the big world
To build their homes and seek their fortunes.

The first little piggy, his house is made of wood
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister and drink his moonshine
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine!
I rode into town with my axe in my holster
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy boaster
The sherrif at the border, he tried to take me out
I drew my axe with the quickness-and cut his adam's apple out!
Walked in the village and to the piggy's place
He opened up his door and shot me in the face
And blew me off the porch-and blew my head in half
But I'm a Juggalo so it only made me laugh (ha ha!)
Axe in hand, I rose like the dead
And swung with all my might- made a thump noise in his head
Since we out west, I grabbed a shotgun
And blew his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium!!

[Chorus:]
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like a sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (NO!)
I might choose an axe (YES!)
The carnival's in town- come and get your piggy snacks

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick
And this little piggy is a mother fuckin dick
He lays down his rules and reads you your rights
In that funny lookin car with the little blinkin lights
I drive a Volkswagen Bug seventeen deep
Packed fulla Juggalos, lights out and we creep
To the piggy station and lay on the horn
First piggy out- we blow his lungs out his uniform
Now they in pursuit like Starsky and Hutch
But there's only two of them-the rest are out to lunch
They call up Dunkin Donuts to gather up the rest

Hey yo Violent J, what's up?

It's Christmas, time for a slaughter
Maybe your wife, maybe your daughter
It's midnight, I land my sleigh
Make way for jolly St. J
Climb down the chimny, for the murder
Dressed as the fat man everyones heard of
Shimy down, shimy down, what the fuck?
Somebody help me, I'm stuck
Now what to do? I feel whack
I got stuck in a chimny stack
But I hack, and shimmer on down
Santa Claus Clown
Can't fuck around, now
Livingroom, shhh, I creep
Tippy toes 'cause they asleep
I pulled out the axe and slid down the hall
I got a gift for all of ya'll
what's that? I better hide quick
Oh fuck, it's the real St. Nick
And he musta been taken a shit
But regardless, I better move quick, now
So I jumped him, Santa's no joke
Fucked around got my damn neck broke
He strap, he shot, he didn't miss
(Gunshots and ho ho ho)
I had a red christmas

""I'm dreaming of a dead Christmas,
The kind you'll never have again
'cause if you have a dead Christmas,
That means your dead and that's the end""

Merry, merry Christmas you fuckin chump,
Seasons greetings loser, yo 2 Dope kick it!
Jack Frost nibbles, he but fuck that
I ain't got a home so he nibbles on my nutsack
And my buttcrack, toes, and elbows
My nutz is froze, fuck you hoes
So I made a friend like me, a snow man
He was down with the clown like a blow man
Had a hat and eyes outta charcoal
And a pipe, we fill it with indow
Me and him sang songs in the snowflakes
He ate snowballs, I ate cornflakes
And we both would freeze are ballz off
I was there every time his head fallz off
I put it back on for him with a smile
He was my boy, made from a snow pile
Then the storm came, a blizzard
Snow, wind, ice, a blizzard
We pulled through we hid in an alley
The next day it was like sunny valley
He was meltin I was just fine
He got pissed and pulled out a nine

""If I'm gonna die you should come with me
'cause we boyz"" (gunshot) It hit me
Damn I'm dying, I'm dead he got his wish
And all I got was another red christmas

""Sighlent night, violent fight
Now I'm dead, one to the head
Christmas this year seemed so whack""

I don't know, what about my mental state
They might find a bitch dead, there's nothin else that I hate less

I sit alone in the back of the art class
And draw necks with a big red dash

I quit school, but I never left the hall
I grab kids and drag 'em in between a wall
Hear 'em scream, echo through the gym class
You hear me chokin bitches up in the wind shaft
They call me, The Ghost of the Bad Lands

Insane Clown Posse,"Ahem  we are here today to mourn the loss 
Of a punk ass motherfucker who thought he was the shit. 
Turns out  he was the shit  a piece of shit. 
You see  this young hooligan wasn't afraid to die 
So he put his life on the line to gain respect in his neighborhood. 
Well the only respect he gets now 
Is from the maggots and worms that are snacking on his dead ass.

Life is over, death devour 
Time has come for witching hour 

Time for your family to dress up in black 
Time for your coffin to ride in the back 
Time for your enemies to laugh at your death 
Time for the vultures to pick at what's left 
Time for your homeboy to find a new clique 
Time for your girlfriend to suck a new dick 
Time for your brothers to fight over your car 
Time for the world to forget who the fuck you are

Close your eyes, hold your breath, release the stress 
let it out there's nothing left 'cause you're facing death 
If you see God, send my blessings if He's up there 
And tell that man how you spent your life here 
Bust around the street, diesel smoke from the heat 
And you're feeling weak, 'cause the lead got you going to sleep 
It's getting deep, know your peeps? They gon' fuck your freak 
In between the sheets in they face they drop the leaky leak 
You hear the sirens, think about who was firing 
See your partner blurry from the spark of the iron 
Holding on to faith, want to survive to retaliate 
Here comes the Reaper, it's Grim Reaper at your door awaits 
Can you feel it? Pumping on your inner spirit, 
Got you screaming out for Mommy Dearest 
You want to live, keep on twitching, bluff spitting 
Time ticking it's the hour for the witching 

(Quit crying like a bitch, and die like a man, motherfucker!)

Time for you to lay dead while everybody stares 
Time for the Reverend to front like he cares 
Time for your body to rot in your tomb 
Time for your sister to finally get your room 
Time for your picture to fade on the wall 
Time for your crew to hang out at the mall 
Time for your boys to beat hoes and kick bass 
While you sit in the dark, with maggots crawling on your face 

(Put 50 more cc's in that IV and start CPR, I'm still not getting anything)

Bitches are backstabbers, or your inner friend bank grabbers 
Reaching out just to get fatter 
Thoughts of your soon-to-be wife and your phat ride 
She's in the back seat, catching it from the backside 
You wish you had some rum, feeling numb 
Where the noise at? Losing it, where my boys at? 
Hallucinate seeing caskets, your son a soon to be bastard 
'cause you slipped and got blasted 
Your ?? lies in your good times, 
Ambulance 59 minutes later, now you're on a respirator 
Get on this shit, you're losing consciousness 
Man flashing, in your phat ride crashing 
Unhappy family and it's costing black roses 
Beer on the concrete, bones in your coffin 
That's all you get, a lost soul on the trip 
Times up, clock ticked, hour to be witched 

(Looking at my Gucci, it's about that time, motherfucker)

[Chorus: x4] 

Time to sit and cry about the fact that you're gone 
Time to say fuck it, Nitro is on 
Time for your people to clean out your place 
Time for you love to go through your tin case 
Time for your father to feel a little stress 
Time for you step-dad to give a fuck less 
Time for the world to keep spinning around 
Even with you dead in the ground, motherfucker! 

Time for your family to dress up in black 
Time for your coffin to ride in the back 
Time for your enemies to laugh at your death 
Time for the vultures to pick at what's left 
Time for your homeboy to find a new clique 
Time for your girlfriend to suck a new dick 
Time for your brothers to fight over your car

I mean I hear what you're saying, I mean
You got carried away in the moment
And I could forgive you
I could do that
I could do anything, if I want to

I could buy you a Lexus truck with a white leather interior
I could kill off some bears and dogs and shit just to make you a fur coat
I could love you and treat you with class
And have babies falling all out your ass
But thinking about that...
I feel I'd rather kill you
['cause I got you in my car, and you ain't going nowhere bitch, you're dead]

I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch-ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homies

I could take all the face paint off and get a real job working for Dad
I would rather take a ten-pound axe and stick it in your daddy's forehead
I could let you move into my house
You'd fuck the neighbors every time I'd go out
And wipe his nut on my pillow [oh]
But I think I'd rather kill you

I could go back to school instead and try to get my diploma
I'd much rather bang your head on the wall, until you fall into a coma
'cause I can't get you out of my head
I'd cut my head off but the I would be dead
And I ain't the only motherfucker that's dying!
So let's just die togetherrrrrraaaaaagghhh!!!

(Chorus x4)
Ahhh!! Let's just die together
Ahhh, yeah!! Let's just die together
Me and you, I'll kill you but, can you explain?

And tonight we'll die together",Another Love Song

Welcome everyone to the big show

[Show respect, youse amongst the dead]
Don't like bigots and richie boy fucks
[Ain't shit changed, bitch check us]
Detroit Southwest murderous, die
[The greatest spectacle under the sky]
5 cards came and made their mark from Moon Yugon down to Platon Park
Fuck your drum kit, xylaphone and cello, I'm a wicked clown, bitch, hello!?
Everybody come jump in our ride
[Bring you and your fat-ass bich inside]
Wagon tips are slick as a breeze
[Can't nobody get with these, motherfucker, bring it on!]

Bring it, bring it

Broken necks with the flick of our wrists
[All this player hatin' getting me pissed]
Fat chicks, skinny chicks, chicky-chicks, hoes

Shoot me with silver bullets? Ok! I'll pull 'em out, pawn 'em and get paid
Here, try my licorice treats

(1st Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), [Monoxide Child], {Jamie Maddrox})
Imagine a place that exists beyond, a place that's seldom seen
[A place that even the wickedest souls that burned have never been]
{There was a soul named Damien, he was nothing heaven could save}
[Instead he was cast to the flames of Hell to serve an eternal grave]
(Even in the Afterlife, things don't always go as planned)
[As Satan's throne sees ??, it's hectic and over jammed]
{Damien burned his spot in hell right until his dying day}
So the wagons took his sorry soul and taunted him all the way
[They finally reached that resting place, an endless pit of fire]
(But Damien had escaped through the back door of Satan's lair)
[Out the back entrance of hell but with nowhere else to hide]
His hell is just a tomb, resting in the Echo Side.

(Chanting x2)
Underneath the shadows of the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
You can take me to the ghetto land move everything and back
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back


(2nd Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), [Monoxide Child], {Jamie Maddrox})
Damien ran as far as he could before his legs began decaying
[There were many dead trees, a blood red sky, and headless children playing]
(A wicked man with a long black toungue saw Damien's legs were dead)
So he laid on top of Damien, and then licked the back of his neck and said...

""Fuck the Devil, fuck that shit.
 We will leave this life legit.
 If you're hearing what we say, 
 why youu throw your soul away?"" - Save me from the darkest corner (4X)

(Chanting)
Underneath the shadows of the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
You can take me to the ghetto land move everything and back
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back

(Backwards Dialect) Save me from the darkest corner (x4)

(3rd Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), [Monoxide Child], {Jamie Maddrox})
{Damien called for many hours, in puddles of blood he lay}
Tortured by everything he saw, yet wishing along the way
[His arms decayed and fell off his body as he rolled along the floor]
{Still trying not to look back, as if something else was in store}
(The clouds above were dark and hot yet dripping with blood rain)
[The ground infested with rodents, that crawled throughout his veins]
{As Damien laid in Echo Side, Hell's screams could still be heard}
The blood red sky would flicker with the tourturing that occurred
(Thinking back, he had escaped; every scream he heard he laughed)
The headless children pointed and urinated in his wrath
[He finally saw some fortress gates, so he quickly rolled into it]
These red gates were the front doors of hell...he never knew it. heh heh

(Chanting)
Underneath the shadows of the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
You can take me to the ghetto land move everything and back
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back (repeat till end)",Echo Side

Insane Clown Posse,"It was like march or April, fuckin' libra, fuckin', um, shit

Taurus, born in 1775
I'm like 300 and something, but I'm still alive
I used to hang with the original billy the kid
You prob'ly think I'm only playing but, I did
My daddies were a two headed freak show
Momma, a fortune teller, esmarelda zella
Anyway they had sex on a ouiji board
And I was born the next day, violent j
When I was 14, I tripped on the train track
And I was crushed right there on the steel rack
I'm out cold, they thought it had fucked me up
I got up and itched my butt, I'm like, ""what?""
Everybody tripped and called me the clown devil boy
Child of the witch heffer, whatever
Tied me up, burned me and threw stones
Had a few scrapes and cuts, smokey nuts
After that they started bowing and shit
Praying at me, you know how them primitives get
I said, ""get off my dick, I ain't a savior,
I'm what you call a juggalo and all I want is my flavor
Four simple things in this bitch, before I die

I want a rusty axe
I wanna know voodoo
A fat bitch named bridgett
And a little sip of faygo, too
'till I get my shit, in this motherfucker I won't never die!

So anyway
50 years pass, all my homies are old ass fucks
I ain't even got hair on my nuts
I left the village in search of my ends
I wrestled alligators, battled terminators
Nothing ever killed me, nothing could harm me
I fought in the civil war, yankees army
I walked across enemy lines with a mack-10

Man, they didn't even have that shit back then

How you just gonna come in my shit and fuck it up?

Well at least make this shit sound real, man, damn!

I walked across enemy lines with a, lantern
Steady taking cannon balls, to the balls
The war ended, I traveled the country horseback
Until this fool tried to horsejack
He put his gat to my head and blew my face up
(Pow) it didn't even smear the make-up
I took his gun and put a tivet in his neck
Sheriff didn't like it, I got indicted
87 long years in the state pen
Until they finally forgot why they put me in
They had to let me go they can't hold me on nothing
On the way out they're like, ""yo, ain't you like 100 and something?""
I said, ""that's right, and I ain't gonna die
'till I get my shit, motherfucker!""

I want a rusty axe
I wanna know voodoo
A fat bitch named bridgett
And just a little sip or two, 
'Till I get my shit, in this motherfucker I won't never die!

I slept under bridges, lived in the valleys
Climbed the mountains, searched the alleys
More years passed, and I still ain't died
Now I'm in detroit on the southwest side
My homie has an impala, blue '67
Last night we hit the road pushing 111
I stuck my head out the window, told him floor up the most
And let my nugget ping off a light post
Ha ha ha! hell yeah 'cause
Hurts a little bit, but then you get a straight buzz
The world hates me 'cause of shit like this
They always try to kill me but miss
I know it's odd that my face is forever painted
When I was born, the bitch-ass doctor fainted
My toungue's a little long, I choke people with it
Looks kinda nasty, but chicks dig it
And I told ya my neck can stretch for miles
I look like something from 'the x-files'
People wanna see me die more than a little bit
But I'm a juggalo, and as a juggalo I want my shit!
And I ain't gonna die, till I get it!

I want a rusty axe
I wanna know voodoo
A fat bitch named bridgett
I said faygo, fuck mountain dew
'till I get my shit, in this motherfucker I won't never die!

What you know 'bout terrible?
[YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S TERRIBLE] (x2)

Yeah she's so terrible you gotta beat her you BITCH-ASS WACK MOTHERFUCKER!

(2nd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
LOOOORRDY-lord have we got a protest, man
Some rock-and-roll ninja bit the head off a bat
Was watching his concert, and channeled to hell
'cause he's so fucking TEERRRIBLE
Meanwhile his records sell double and triple
'cause of you crying about him rubbing his nipple
Religious? Shit, you helped them bang
Instead of helping them poor people eating out of them garbage cans
When you're done with them bitch, come protest me
Shit, motherfucker I could use some money
The whole world was crying when Kurt's gun went BANG!
When Eazy-E died though, it wasn't no thang
Rapper dies of A.I.D.S. but you hardly mention
Rocker blows his face off and becomes a legend
Everyone grab a shotgun, a hero is made
Maybe I should do that shit so J can get paid

(Chorus)

Are your kids so terrible you gotta beat on them too 
YOU DRUNK MOTHERFUCKER!!

[Rebel Flag] In your parks
[Rebel Flag] In your courtrooms
[Rebel Flag] In your hearts
[Rebel Flag] Stood for slavery
[Rebel Flag] Stood for war
[Rebel Flag] Stood for hatred 
             but just go ahead and hang your flag up some more!
[Don't worry about my goddamn flag boy 
 what's terrible is you damn rappers cursin']

(3rd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
The country we live in was biult by slaves
Beat down and murdered and stuffed in their graves
You put a slave owner on the one dollar bill
And you want to know why I KILLLL PEOPLE!
(Violent J)
Bombs are blowing up, cops are corrupt
And all you care about is who the president fucked?
You don't know terrible...you will
as soon as our wagons come over the hill!!

Remember me bitch 8th grade
Ball park skinny ass well-fare aid
Ulster and Bruce brothers we was the shit
Dungeons Dragons, and Bruce Lee flicks
Quit school nobody missed us, 
Nobody hugged and kissed us only dissed us
Now look at these beautiful model type high class women
Takin' my dick in em
You don't remember my kind in class
The whipped out freak starin' at your ass
Never had the courage to even say hi
Only smell your perfume vapors as you walk by
I'm the scrub that never crossed your mind
Now your flashing your titties at me waitin' in line
And that's fine while you're working your charm
Look beneath the paint bitch its the scrubs who won

You used to say ""Ahhh Hah!""
Look at him the same pair of pants and that shirt again
An outcast I knew I had to do something
Figure out a way to make something out of nothin'
Open up shop got what you need
Speakers clothes CD's or bags of weed
But that shit got me nowhere except jail
Me and all my homies to broke to make the bail
So now we're right back at the place we started
Chuckles and laugh the second we turn our backs
Assed out but we was like ""fuck y'all""
We got each other and the drop of the homie call
Look at us now bitch holdin' platinum
All up on my dick but I'm the same as back then
Forget the money and fame because 
Beneath the paint life's just as it always was

Look at me!
Analyze! What you see?
Look at me!
Analyze! What you see?

Another girl I don't dare to confide in
Playing that role it hurts inside
Here I am thinking she wants me
She only wants that killer on her CD
Just when I couldn't feel any worse
Bitch asked me if I could paint my face first
The day I finally get to leave this land
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man

What up dogg?
What you been up to?
Oh yeah well that's cool, check it out
Me and you we been down for while, right?
We been here and there we been pretty tight
Something happened last night that you might get upset about
But hear me out
I didn't mean nothing by it, I'ma make this quick
I gave your mama this dick

I don't know how it happened
I just know my nuts and her itch were slapping
I was over there mowing the grass
And I could feel her eyes all up on my ass
And then, I went inside to make a phone call
And there she was with her titty hanging out her bra
One thing just led to another
Next thing you know, I'm butt-fucking your mother

Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, I never said I loved the ho.
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, you never should've trust in a Juggalo.

Don't hang up, I still got more
Your momma gives head like a heroin whore
I wasn't thinking about how you was my bud
When she spread my butt cheeks and went for the Milk Dud
We broke out with your with grandpa's gin
Got drunk, I fucked her with a bowling pin
She's freaky
Her nipples look like peanuts
Your mama's one of my favorite sluts
She likes licking from the back of my balls 
to the tip of my dick with one big lick
She calls me her big teddy bear
Roooaaaaarrrrr!!!!!
I chase her around on my underwear
I'll admit I like spanking her butt
I used your sock though to catch my nut
Don't worry
I put it back, I knew you better
That's probably why your toes been sticking together

Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, I never said I loved the ho.
Please don't hate me, but I been fucking your mommy lately
Please don't hate me, you never should've trust in a Juggalo.

Your mom's ass look like oat meal yo
It's bumpy and grainy, I like to feel though
And I ain't trying to diss her either
I'm only saying that I'd wish she'd trim her beaver some
Every hair is like a foot long
Bitch looks like a werewolf wearing a thong sometimes
It's all right with me though
I don't mind as long as I can locate the V-Hole
And your dad's so dumb he's knowing nothing
Here I'm stuffing her muffin not to mention the pickle puffing
And I'm hoping you and me are still cool
I'm spending the night so she can drive me to school tomorrow
And we plan on fucking again
All right I'll talk to you later

And apple dips, gingerbread homes

And NyQuil pills they make me sleep
Hershey kisses and heppy misses is something so bliss, but yet all the while

Somethin' tells me that I hate you,
Somethin' tells me I must kill you

And will remain eternaly embeded, the rest forget it

Both catchin' and firin' slugs (paper for drugs)
I see a line waiting on block cheese a mile long
All tryin to be strong (It's the same old song)
But when I look into everybodys faces (smile) 
Their soul are headed other places
And they ain't worried about payin them dues down here

Believe me when I say we comin for all of y'all
Look deep into my crystal ball
See the dead smokin on trees and drinking alcohol
Underneath the street beneath the concrete

Encased in glass for the whole world to see

Zanoff's, it works, I'm down to only 3 people a day
My victims, I give them love and care
I don't want to get blood everywhere
I don't use a chainsaw, or a butcher knife,
That's so 90's, get it right
I never mutilate or chop my loves
All I really need is a pair of gloves
Or maybe a car, I'll run 'em down with it
I know that can be messy, but the birds will get it
Don't you see that I love you idiots
I'm Mr. Happy, I'm all about fun, 
Now get in the pit and try to kill someone!

""Oh it feels so good, every time I murder I get happy!!""

My bike has a basket full of strawberries, I picked them myself,
Along with apples and cherries and lemons 
And oranges and boogers and limes,
Plus thers's a Faygo in there, but that's mine
Red flowers, like after your dead
I plant seeds and grow them out the side of your head,
I got flowers all over the backyard, 
In the form of a Jokers Card (uh-oh)
Feels good, I'm like the Choko of my neighborhood
I'm one of them midnight creeps at Denny's, 
Talking to myself and licking my pennies
I got a french fry hanging out of my beard
Don't go near that guy, he's weird.
You know I'm all good and everythings all right, 
When you hear this scream in the middle of the night, like this:
""Oh it feels so good, everytime I murder I get happy!!""

Why? Every time I stab somebody, I'm always gettin' my clothes bloody, why?

Why? Every time I bunk and I sell rock, I wind up in a cell block, why?
Why? Every time I shoot somebody in the face, pigs get to chase, why?
Why? Every time I drink a little gasoline, I shit my spleen, why?
Why? When I try to fly like a birdy
I wind up on a gurdy, dead tell me why

Insane Clown Posse,"Occasionally, the overwhelming temptation to reach

The most deplorable examples of the underground music scene 
To attempt to change their so-called artistic endeavors, in a 
Vain attempt to appeal to the public at large. 
Behold, the metamorphosis

As this marks the day that
3 of America's most notorious outlaws
Will be executed for their crimes
Together the states of Michigan and California
Will conduct the executions behind prison walls
The 3 prisoners are set to be executed by 3 separate methods
Electric chair, hanging, and firing squad
Midnight tonight will mark the first execution
Death waits in my cell I can smell him
Somebody tell him that I still breathe, leave
I'm alive I'll never see 25 
Yet still I can feel, I'm real
When it all happened I was in the lime light
News, camera, gaven killer stamina
Another year I'm here but forgotten
Skin is rotting feeling old, cold
Motherfucker in a robe gonna sentence me to die in a metal chair
Fizzle my nut hair
Bad enough I'll be dead
Yet I'm tryin to figure out a way
To keep my eyes from poppin out my head
Oh they'll remember my ass
Twitchin, with my eyes drippin down the glass
Shaggy I think they're tryin to start a riot
And then it's Ice T but he don't seem fazed by it
I know the devil's waitin on me
But does God like him playin his role in killin me though
Lock me up until I die maybe
But you can never tell

Cause all the power they got surged into one spot
J's chair hear him screamin, fully loaded
It was funny at first till his head exploded
It's something else for me 
Another kill just as wicked 
But cheaper on the light bill
It all starts with a thick rope
Make a noose and I'm gone
Stretch out my neck bone
Minutes left I think about my brother
When we was young...
Wait I don't have a brother
What the fuck?
My minds in a tangle
I wish somebody was here that I could strangle
I keep waking up on the floor
Cause I strangle myself but what the fuck for?
Haha starin at the cracks on the walls
Whistlin necks, fidgetin my balls
Kill me it'll still all be the same

What if I drop, but don't die
Tie weights to my legs 
And give it another try
Still coming think of something, I speak

But check it this time I'll be the one dissected
I can't wait to feel the heat when lead and flesh meets
Bitter sweet baby, I been waiting for this
Go straight to hell kick it with the rest of my clique
Fuck a blindfold I want to look 'em deep in they eyes
So they can see the fool's face of a dog as he dies

Savages and cold blooded canibals
I can't help but come but abouts me
try to run but they found me, surround me
Then they choke ya, and provoke ya
try to smoke ya, turn you into a joka
I tried to rub it off, but its all I know
the only thing I ever knew, so what to do

your growin mold, with a soul that's freezin cold
so I confess, but even if I'm all wrong
I'll be down with the clown till I'm dead and gone

I took it home, opened it, I shook it
she had papers, lipstick and nail polish
credit cards and about 27 dollars
I bought a 5th, drank it and laid there
it seemed like, I could see the purse everywhere
on the light post, by this mail box
I tried to run from it, I ran a couple blocks
but there it was, on the side walk, waitin for me
it tried to lure me to it, I had to fuckin' do it
I picked it up, and stuck my fuckin' hand in it
it was full of rats, and they fuckin' bit it off
father I confess, I'm a criminal
but my worlds too subliminal around me
look at them, all the wicked masses
that's why I'm down with the clown till I'm ashes

Insane Clown Posse," 

you know the irony of life is that you have like
this big dream to get where you want to be
but once you get there you start to dream about where you came from.
I guess that's the part of the circle of our lives
like the hands of a clock going round.
if only we could wind them back and return to a time where the dream began.
its all too soon that's all will be is a dream in someones mind.

Look at me I'm famous on top of the world,
I finally reached up in time (im a superstar)
stand up, step back and take a look
is this really whut I had in mind? (i don't really think so)
I guessed them goals that we set in the day,
they actually came to be. (yup yup)
but now I'm lookin at a black white paper,
and with a whole book of memories (but we never read)

seven deep in the jeep with the camel top,
everybody and they drunk as hell,
?? and awesome dre and anybody by the right would see us
(cause we always went there)
songs were long and pollution strong, and the faygo always warm and flat
(thats nasty)
but if now if this supposed to be heaven for me, then just give me my own
hell back

so take me home
(to my empty refridgerator)
c'mon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand)
so take me home
(to my old school down in delray)
c'mon and take me home
??

(cmon cmon) lets go y'all

there's another festival down town,
take some bottles back up to the store
(i found two of em)
that would get us bus money down there
to get back we have to find some more
(might as well get drunk)
hangin our flyers up everywhere,
we coulda sworn we was makin noise,
(everybody knew us)
finally we had everyone in southwest
representin with the jj boys (everybody)

I stole to eat (i stole)
I stole to live (i stole)
I stole only to survive (if yous a hoodlum)
just like j said in 'ghetto zone' I stole a car with my tape inside
all we did was try to talk to hoes,
and none of them was tryin to hear (not 1 hoe)
it woulda meant so much more back then
cause now its fake hoes everywhere

so take me home
(to my empty refridgerator)
c'mon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand) (where you at y'all?)
so take me home
(to my old school down in delray) (summer time)
c'mon and take me home (delray)

southern rock for ya

rudeboy

oh lord don't let me get my girlfriends call
if she don't get off until two (we got all night long)
I finally show up at 4:30 am
and I still have to drop my crew off (but i'll be back)
now I'm alone and ontop of it all,
looking deep in the back of my mind (looking deep in the back of my mind)
I realised the key to a happy life
was right here wit me the whole time

I jumped out of my bed thinking I'd been invaded, heard smashing, more pounding, the sound escalated 
Looked out of my window, blood dripped down thy glass, I see bodies lay twisted and mangled on grass, 
I ran into thy main room and Shaggy was dead, so was Nate the Mac, Jumpsteady and ABK 
Bolted out of thy house to see if it's a joke, I heard hundreds of car alarms, saw flames and smoke 
And thy sky above red, I see dead bodies fallin' it's raining with corpses thy blood is appalling

Horrified looks on people's faces
(Thy blood is appalling) 
I hope I never see what all them people saw
And put them in there places
(Thy blood is appalling), 
The sun was so hot, 
So hot
I was burning,
Yeah 

Dead bodies lay randomly some stack in piles, on all of there faces pour horror, no smiles 
I see children, and ciders, and ninjas my age, all lay naked and mangled, most withered for days, 
I found safety a shelter I'm under a tree; only fingers and organs come falling on me, 
I lay sleepless for days as thy raining continued, thy heat of thy sun baking corpses like food 
Then it finally stopped I walk knee deep in blood, over piles of bodies threw what was my hood

Let me see ya throat thing there buddy, I'ma chop it
See the idea is to make you die (Stop it)
I don't know why but your heart beat offends me
I need to cut you off at the windpipe desperately
(Like, how but cuttin your own neck) I did
17 times why you think I talk like this?
Before I cut myself THIS WAS MY VOICE
Now gimme your neck pipe, you don't have no fuckin choice
(I'm not ready to die) Neither was Eazy-E
What makes you so fuckin special you can escape the Wreath
(You mean Wraith) I said Wraith, now shut the fuck up
And give me you windpipe so I can cut the motherfucker
(Pick somebody else) I'm pickin anybody I can find
And you happen to be the next motherfucker in like
(Ok let's do it) Keep still, right there
And about 1, 2, 3 of those motherfuckers, I'm outta here

[Violent J]
How you gonna give me a straight jacket when I'm crooked
Took it and shook it, ripped it and unzipped it
And waited for the nurse guy to bring me my tray
Jumped him from behind and turned his head backwards my way
Took all his keys and a crate of Methadone
Masturbated on myself and leaped out the window
Then I turned around and went right back inside
Once I realized I could've grabbed a gang of Formeldahyde
Suddenly another fuckin guard shot me
I played the whole movie shits off like ""You got me""
Laid there playin dead and when he checked my pockets
I jabbed my fuckin thumb knuckle deep in his eye socket
By now there was guards everywhere
I'm steady cuttin heads off, surfin on a wheelchair
And too many bullets finally put me away
But was it the real Violent J?

Always Uninvited, (fuck off) unrespected
Sometimes he creeps, other times he expected
He hangs out in bad neighborhoods up at the park
He will strike in broad daylight but prefers the dark
3 little kids caught inside a broken home
He'll just sit there and wait for 'em (Leave 'Em Alone!)
As sure as we're today and death is inevitable
He's waitin there watchin through the eyes of a crow

Death is always at a shitty time
Don't bother trying to run and hide
Take his hand cross to the other side (Step to the other side)

(J & Shaggy)
Freeway intersections when the bars close, he loves 'em
Blew out traffic lights, he hovers above 'em
And he loves the motherfuck outta crackheads and heroin
Rehab centers and caring mothers always scaring him
Sharing them needles? He encourages and raw sex?
They got him workin and steady collectin soul checks
Then again, 9 times outta 10
I wish he take me instead of some of these poor children we see

(Chorus) 2x

(J & Shaggy)
He remains nameless but we call him the Wraith
He is the 6th Jokers Card of the Dark Carnival faith
That's it, now your clock is tickin, every second counts
And everything you do that righteous or wrong, it all amounts
And whether you going to heaven or hell, he doesn't care
He's only here to give you the death touch, and send you there
Most people fear him because they don't understand
That once he finally touches you with death eternity can begin

Some of us have profiles nobody else fits
And some ain't got time for the Monks in Tibet
Because my own kids are hungry and they're looking to me for shit

Some of us own drug paraphernalia materials
and some of us have incurable sexual venereals
And some of us have dreams of being a star

Some of us can't afford the coolest shoes
Some of us give a fuck what popularity choose
Some bitches tittie dance because their babies are crying
Others say they're dancing for college, you know that they're lying
Some of us are in love with people who ain't ours
Some of us don't give up until we're behind bars

Welcome to the show, Shangri-la or the dark carnival
Welcome to the show, bitch boy you dead
Welcome to the show, Shangri-la or the dark carnival
Welcome to the show, dead dead dead dead

Welcome to my exhibit I be the shags
Sit back and enjoy, relax ya nipples and nutbags
There's only juggalos here ya know what we about
Swingin hatchets, faygo, and a dick in ya mouth

So they call us a circus we accept the role
We've been sayin' that its comin' for like ten years or so
And everywhere we go from Alaska to Spain
I'm seein' juggalos dancin in a faygo rain

Some of those at our shows feel a carnival high
I see em jump on the stage and float off inta the sky
They ain't never comin' back the carnival is defined
And all we can do is dream about em smokin' a dime

I got love for dead people and I hope to die
I got neden waitin' on me up in Shangri-la
But if ya really want to see the fuckin' devil's exhibit
The shit is called ""twiztid"" run out and get it

[Chorus]

When its yo time, death is near, step right on up over here
Games, prizes, shows, and rides, its that carnival paradise.
When its yo time, death is near, step right on up over here
Games, prizes, shows, and rides, its that carnival paradise.

Welcome to the show, Shangri-la or the dark carnival
Welcome to the show, its that carnival paradise

Welcome to the show, its that carnival paradise

You don't like it, get the fuck up outta here

He hangs out in bad neighborhoods up at the park he will strike in broad day light but prefers the dark

As sure as we're alive today and death is inveitable he's waitin' there watching through the eyes of a crow fo' sho' I know yo

And everyhting you do that right or wrong, it all amounts 
And whether you going to heaven or hell he doesn't care 
He's only here to give you the death touch and send you there

I got your fuckin present hangin next to my nuts
Now when i'm swingin on my hatchet if it hits you it cuts
Don't make me chop your head in half and smack the side with the cheek
Because I haven't had my melorol in almost a week
Your fuckin mama brought me here to entertain ya ass
So no matter what I do I expect you to laugh
Now when I do a trick and even if it isn't funny
Give me props unless you want your little necks bloody
I could probably do a cartwheel or something if you move the couch
But that ain't what i'm fuckin about
I could sew your mouth shut and pump air in through ya nose
And fuckin pop ya head but we'd get blood on our clothes
Look i'm a wicked clown I ain't no fuckin superhero
Ain't that big and scary though I fly like little Rey Mysterio
I'm quick to beat down all you little bitches right in front of you mom
And if the bitch gets heated tell her bring it on

I've lived the life of a king.
But so much to darken my life.

So many down on their Knees

But then again who am I
I'm just some typical guy
I ain't no fuckin' hero

I've seen some children crossing the bridge
What kind of life did they get to live
What kind of choice do they get to make
What if it was a child's mistake

I never question the book
But lets say I live by the book
I'd never eat meat on Tuesdays
How much bigger would my wings look

I try to pray everyday
But sometimes get lost on the way
I've seen the holiest spirit
So much to mislead the way

I've gave the visions I got
I've been told I'm gonna rot
Inside the devils intestines
I'm still here holding my spot

We told of oddities, crawling from the dark
And a carnival which we can all belong (all belong)

I see some circus, Juggalo shit going on
People drawn together by rare and scubby music
And we even gather once a year to put it down

We're just tryin to tell you about the light, right
Now all the jokers cards have fallen with spectacular array
So when the wraith is calling,walk into the light,right

I hold a bloody axe, dress in hatchet red
We speak in languages people don't understand
I send faygos via punted clear across a staduim in fashion
Only fuckin juggalos could ever demand

Then I see the platinum on the wall, and I realize
The carnivals been right here all along, so lets bring it on

A presence can be felt by those who have followed the epic saga as told by thy
Insane Clown Posse. It is a presence that is synonymous with thy crumbling of
Time itself. Thus emerges a being so powerful that he can exist between both
The land of the living, and that of the dead. He goes by many names but is
Known to thy living only as thy Wraith. He walks upon worlds forgotten, and
Descends from Heavens; fade into gray to witness thy death of all mortal
Things, so that he may guide thy departed upon thy path that they have chosen
(Shangri-La). Here is the story of thy path to Shangri-La, thy 6th Jokers
Card. Only now will we truly understand thy meaning of thy saga, for this saga
All along, each Jokers Card, is actually none other than... they echo of our
Lives.



",Thy Intro
Insane Clown Posse,"[Verse - Violent J]
ALL NIGHT - find me, robbin' your jewels
Settin' fires, damagin' and breakin' into schools
IN THE DARKNESS - it's much easier to be heartless
Break the window out the Lincoln, and screwdriver-start this
Muggin' people, droppin' on 'em from street lights
Stab 'em with garden tools or beat 'em with pipes
So don't come out, stay inside cozy and tucked
And if I'm breakin' in, your old lady's gettin..FUCKED!

[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
ALL DAY - car jacks, get out the van
As soon as they step out I pop 'em anyway, BLAAM!
I rob liqour stores with a little 22 hold
I know it's nothing but it's something when it's bustin' at your nose
SUNNY DAYS - I hit up the beach with cleats on
And stomp bitches in they ass tryin' to tan in they thongs
ALL DAY - see me fuckin' hookers at truck stops
And then I kill em, 'cause that's where my buck stops

[Verse - Violent J]
ALL NIGHT - I'm wicked and I got the power
Blood sheds on the wall during the witching hour
IN THE DARKNESS - see me ride by in an Impala
Draggin' some fuck ass by the foot and hear him holla
IN THE NIGHT TIME - I'll take what's rightfully mine
I'll run through emergency rooms and sever life-lines
Fuck the limelight, I'm the one I need to impress
With a double dip swingin' ax chop to your chest!

[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
ALL DAY - I'm sellin' coke laced joints to little kids
I'm a clown in a milk truck handlin' biz
IN THE SUNSHINE - I been known to take shots at the po
I'm in the bushes with the camoflouge on and rifle scope
ALL DAY - I'm wicked, I keep it horrifying
Axe murdered some kid and his dad kite-flying
I knocked the fuckin' mailman out on the grass
And burned holes in his face with the magnifying glass

[Verse - Violent J]
ALL NIGHT - I fly like a vampire bat
Murder people tellin' stories where the campfire's at
BLAME IT ON THE MOONLIGHT OR BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE
I shot the motherfuckin' sheriff and his deputy rookie
WHEN IT'S DARK OUT - I hit the streets in the shadows and grab yo's
And boogie the woogie and stab hoes
Don't even gimme a pound when you see this clown
You gettin' cut the FUCK up and chopped the FUCK down!

[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
ALL DAY - catch me picknickin' with bitches in the park
Right before I icepick 'em in the heart
24-7, if it ain't us, it's somebody gettin' bloody
Wicked clowns ain't the only ones nutty buddy
CATCH ME..TONGUE KISSING - a severed head
Catch me burying another bitch dead behind the shed
It doesn't matter, night or day, all around the clock

YOU'RE GONNA DIE!",24
Insane Clown Posse,"[Verse - Violent J]
2:45 and the bell went off
Thank God, many people think I'm odd
But I talk with no one and I walk alone
And I avoid sunlight with a chalky tone
I get home and don't say hi, it ain't no one there
I don't care I walk in and go right up the stairs
To my room, get in bed and just wait for dark
Because that's when the real show start (tap tap)
""Tap tap"" on the glass go the piece of ass
So young and pretty it's too bad she past
But she comes to my room and we talk at night
She's demonic and bloody, but she holds me tight
In my bedroom, with her I'm never alone
And I kiss her cold lips until the morning come
Then she gone, I can still hear her voice loom
But she only exist in the dark of my room

[Verse - Violent J]
I try to smile a lot, but I'm always frontin'
But I do love a ghost and at least that's somethin'
She don't talk much, when she do it gets cold
Usually we just lay there and we hold each other
We're lovers, we don't need others
One of my mother's cats jumped up on the covers
And it scared my baby, guess she don't like pets
So I twisted it's fuckin' head off at the neck
Look baby, it's bloody, it's gone, it's doomed
Please...come back to the room
I'll do anything for thy, don't ignore me
This is more than a sick love story
Without you I'd bring a shotgun to school
And I will if you want me to for any reason
I hate that you leave when the lights come on
And if I had it my way the fuckin' sun would be gone

[Hook - (Violent J) & {Shaggy 2 Dope}]
Love..(I can't ignore you)
In my room..(do anything for you baby) {tap tap}

[Verse - Violent J]
Sometimes I kiss her, I start shakin'
She slips me the tongue and it tastes like bacon
Uh oh, something's wrong baby's upset
She told me she was spotted by the neighbor's kid
She can't come back now 'cause they know our secret
Unless I can make them keep it
If I do she may come to life
Now I'm in their yard with a shotgun and knife
Cut the screen, went in and found the kid
Blew a bowl of spaghetti in the side of his head
And the daddy was next runnin' down the hall
I shredded his throat and he was quick to fall
Tossed the Mossberg and gripped the knife
Started stabbin' the shit outta his wife
Went home a bloody mess with a job well done (tap tap)
Wash up and wait for my baby to come (tap tap)

Insane Clown Posse,"Fuck, Damnit Another Halloween
People on Military know what this means,
Houses on fire,They're blowin up cars,
Creatures on the street and razorblades in candybars.

I went to trick-or-treat the first house on my block
They spit in my face and gave me a rock
I tried to give it back and said I'll take nothing instead 
Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head

Walked to the next house directly next door
And there I found an old lady dead on the floor
I said 'Excuse me miss but do you have a treat?'
She lifted her leg and scraped flakes off her dead feet

I ran to the next house happy and giddy
There I seen a fat woman holding up her titty
I said trick or treat she said treat or trick
And squeezed on her titty til .. fuck it its to sick 

The next house was set back in the woods
I was a little frightened but fuck I want the goods
I knocked on the door I heard a knock back
Then I heard 'come on in' and yo I'm like fuck that

This house belongs to miss Cherry Spoon
She said drop your drawers and your treat is comin soon
I quickly grew a stiffy but kept my eyes shut
A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts

I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst
And chillin in the drive was a long black hurst
I rung the doorbell and said is anybody home
'Of course babyboy have a sugar coated kidney stone'

I walked through the feild into the next crib
Her friendliness could only be in her cooking bib 
I said how bout some candy
She said how bout in stead a nice hot fresh homemade loaf of yeast in infection bread

My bags gettin heavy so I rest on the curb 
And riding on his bike here comes little Larry Sherb
I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat
Punched him in the neck and powerbombed him in the street

Now my bag of candy has doubled in size
Up to the next house for my scary prize
I'm like trick or treat trick treat tricky dick
He opened up his door slapped my lips and didn't give me shit

Rock through his window and ran across the street
To the big mansion I'm in for a treat
I dinged on the dong
And here comes the butler 
A big gumpy tall ass Lurch lookin mother fucker
I said hello mister is there something for my sack 
He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back
Its taking him and hour my bag is open ready 
But then he finally dropped it in my sack a fuckin penny

The next house is abandoned so forget it
But wait a minute I think somebody's livin in it
I ran up to the door trick or treat you can't hide 
It was a crackhead he crawled in my bag and died

The next house was mine the last on the block
My mother's sitting on the porch shining up her clock
I climbed on the roof with my brother jump steady
And we yelled HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE TO THE CITY!

Fuck Damnit another Halloween

Housed on fire They're blowing up cars

Insane Clown Posse,"To all that are receiving this broadcast, we are now entering the
Thirteenth hour of continuing cloud coverage
This ongoing event has now been upgraded to a national emergency
It has been a sleepless night past Metro Detroit as panic and terror

Has swept the streets it seems much of Detroit as well as
The rest of the country are still unsettled by this unexplainable
Cloud that still clutches the sky from New York to Honolulu
Miami to Fairbanks the expansion of the cloud has subsided

But a wall of darkness and artificial night still grips the land
Witnesses now tell us thousands upon thousands of people
Are emerging from sewers everywhere their faces are painted
And and and they look like clowns

The people are running and screaming but eye witnesses say
They're not in pain its almost like a strange type of joy has overtaken them
At this time we do not know where or why the people are running
But there seems to be an organized plan directing there action

It's like a guiding force is giving them supernatural stamina
The immense crowd of clowns are now on the move all in unison
Moving in one direction towards an unknown destination
Almost as if they see what others cannot heeding an inaudible call
That silently pierces this calm before the storm

Big balled hoes, we dig all those

We like it like that, fuck you

Muthafucka. I can daaannncccee.

I'm on crack, Walkin alleyways downtown, people drop change so I'm checkin the ground behind a
Nightclub, I can hear the bump outside I hear em' laughin' and drinkin' and dancin' getin' live and
I'm lonely, graspin' on my 55 cent, I don't know where my meds went, they been spent and I'm bent, I
Don't remember yesterday at all, I'm barkin at the moon as I'm pissin' on the wall, people grippin'
New cars checkin' out a few bars, they see me comin' side step a few yards I'm like a bad man, holdin'
Out my crusty ass hands scouldin' an imaginary friend scary and I'm blackin' out just about to lose
All hope, I was peerin through the window of a nightclub scopin', and there she was everything I
Planned for on the spotlight on the dance floor gravitatin'

[Chorus]
She kept her rythum her feet to the floor she dipped down she did the twirl and she shook it some
More she's ruby. She made me happy I tried to refrain I walk off but then I run right back I'm at it
Again she's callin'

I ran a few blocks away and broke a bottle, carjacked a mini-van and punched full throttle right back
To the spot then I waited to get her, but when she came out, she had a bitch-boy wit' her no problem,
Hit the pipe and follow em' home and my imaginary friend gone have to leave me alone cause this really
Goin' down I feel it pullin me home knowin I'm a wicked clown I gotta throw it down, she pulled in her
And her fuck ass strolled in, I hit the pipe again and jump out the stolen, jumpin through back yards
Clumsey and trippin', it don't matter where ya go there's a throat slingin', and the way she danced
Split flames burnin me alive out here quit playin games I'm on the side of her house lookin in through
The back den and there she was with him again dancin'

[Chorus]

I walk right in through the front door unlocked, no gun cocked, cinder block, clown paint, I came
Here to dance boogy, umph ahhh, and maybe tap a little nookie, I'm creepin music bumpin in the back,
I'm down the hallway hidin' behind the coat rack, and here come the punk bout to get champaighned, I
Take the rock and pop em' with the damn thang, hit em' in the back of the head, he dropped the wine
But I caught him in time I had to take his life with a steak knife, I washed it off and put it back
I'm keepin' the place nice I'm comin bitch you want an olive or somethin' I'm fuckin' straight out the
Streets but I'm down with some frontin' I want to tango, but instead I'm still outside the club and it's
All in my head.

Insane Clown Posse,"I've lived one hell of a life
If youre to take it tonight.
I've lived the life of a king.
But so much to darken my life.
Looking 360 degrees
200,000 diseased
How can I lay back and chill
So many down on their knees

But then again who am I
I'm just some typical guy
I ain't no fuckin hero
I've just been wondering why

I've seen some children crossing the bridge
What kind of life did they get to live
What kind of choice do they get to make
What if it was a childs mistake

I never question the book
But lets say I live by the book
I'd never eat meat on tuesdays
How much bigger would my wings look

I try to pray everyday
But sometimes get lost on the way
I've seen the holiest spirit
So much to mislead the way

I've gave the visions I got
I've been told I'm gonna rot
Inside the devils intestines
I'm still here holding my spot

I've just been wondering why
I've just been wondering why

I've seen some children crossing the bridge
What kind of life did they get to live
What kind of choice do they get to make
What if it was a childs mistake

Come on and open up your door
What if it's a purgatory door?
Come on and open up your door
What if it's a purgatory door?

What kind of choice do they get to make

Insane Clown Posse,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",It Rains Diamonds /Bitch Slappaz

Until your melon hit the floor and roll away

As soon as it's gone I'm gonna kill
And that was my last refill god dammit
I drink lithium and I don't even know what it is
Only reason you diss me is because you want a sip
Every time I drink it I piss out a laser
And cut holes in the wall with my dick phaser

Then I took the bench and sentenced myself

You know Jamie Madrox rapped about something like this
I never really thought about how horrible it really is
Laying in a coffin in a pine black box
The only sound being that of my heart if I'm alive
But I've got no pulse of ever breath for days
I remember the crash and after that it's a haze
But I do recall the funeral them lowering me in
It was about that time when my soul kicked back in
I tried to move my fingers or somethin
Got nothin but dirt hitting the top from them shoveling

Fuckin lebra (fuckin, um, shit)
Torus, born in 1775
I'm like 300 and somethin, but I'm still alive
I used to hang with the original, billy the kid
You probably think I'm only playin but, I did
My daddy's were a 2 headed freak show
Mama a fortune tella, azmerella zella
Anyway they had sex on a oija board
And I was born the next day
(who?) violent j
When I was 14 I tripped on the train track
And I was crushed right there, on the steel rack
I'm out cold, they though it would fuck me up
I got up and itched my butt, and I'm like, what?
Everybody tripped and called me the clown devil boy,
Child of the witch heifer, whatever
Tied me up burned me and threw stones
Had a few scrapes and cuts, smokey nuts
After that they started bowin and shit
Prayin to me, you know how those primitives get
I said get off my dick I ain't a savior
I'm what ya call a juggalo, and all I want is my flava
4 simple things in this bitch before I die

I want a rusty ax
I want to know voodoo
A fat bitch named bridget
And a little sip of faygo too
Till I get my shit in this motha fucka
I will neva die!

(ah, hell yeah, so anyway...)
50 years passed all my homey's are old ass fucks
I ain't even got hair on my nuts
I left the village in the search of my ends,
I wrestled alligators, battled terminators
Nothin ever killed me, nothin could harm me
I fought in the civil war, yankees army
I walked across enemy lines with a mack 10
Man they didn't even have that shit back then
How you just gonna come in my shit and fuck it up?
Well at least make this shit sound real man, damn!
I walked acrossed enemy lines with a, lantern
Steddy takin cannon balls, to the balls
The war ended, I traveled the country horse back
Until this fool tried to horse jack
He put his gat to my head and blew my face up
Didn't even smear the makeup
I took his gun a put a divet in his neck
The sheriff didn't like it, I got endited
87 long years in the state pen
Till they finally forgot why they put me in
They had to let me go, can't hold me on nothin
On they way out they like,
""yo ain't you like a houndred and somethin?""
I'm said yeah that's right,
And I ain't gonna die till I get my shit motha
Fucka!!!

I want a rusty ax
I want to know voodoo
A fat bitch named bridget
Just a little sip or two
Till I get my shit in this motha fucka
I will neva die!

I slept under bridges, lived in a valley
I climbed up mountains, searched the alleys
More years passed and I still ain't died
Now I'm in Detroit on the southwest side
My homie has an impala blue '67
Last night we hit the road pushin one eleven
I stuck my head out the window,
Told 'em forward the most
And let my nugget ping off a light post
Hahahaha hell yeah 'cause,
Yeah it hurts a little bit but then ya gotta straight buzz
The world hates me 'cause of shit like this
They always try and kill me but, miss
I know it's odd 'cause my face is forever painted
When I was born the bitch ass doctor fainted
My tongues a little long I choke people with it
Looks kinda nasty, but chicks dig it
And I told ya my neck can stretch for miles
I sorta look like somethin from the x-files
People want to see me die for then a little bit
But I'm a juggalo, and as a juggalo I want my shit
And I ain't gonna die till I get it!!!!

I want a rusty ax
I want to know voodoo

Insane Clown Posse,"Piggie Pie (old school)and seek their fortunes
The first little piggy, his house is made of wood,
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood.
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine,
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine!
I rode into town with my ax in my holster,
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster.
The sheriff at the border, he tried to take me out,
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his adams apple out!
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place,
He opened up his door, and shot me in the face.
It blew me off the porch, and blew my head in half,
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh. (Hehe!)
Ax in hand, I rose like the dead,
And swung with all my might,
I made a thump noise in his head.
Since we out west, I grabbed the shot gun,
And blew his fuckin' tongue out the back of his cranium!
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie.
There's nothing like the squeal when you hear a piggy die.
I might use a gun, (No!)
I might use an ax, (yes!)
The carnivals in town, come and get your piggy snacks!
The second little piggy, his house is made of brick,
And this little piggy is a mutha fuckin' dick.
He lays down his rules and reads you your rights
In that funny lookin car with the little blinkin lights
I drive a Volkswagon bug 17 deep
Packed full of juggalo's lights out and we creep
To the piggy station and lay on the horn
First piggy out we blow his lungs out his uniform
Now they in pursuit, like Starsky and Hutch
But there's only 2 of them the rest are out to lunch
They call up Dunkin Doughnuts to gather up the rest
25 piggy's with a bullet proof vest
We lead 'em on a chase, they bustin' off rounds
but now they all fucked 'cause we at the carney grounds
And they gettin swallowed by their very own greed
Dark Carnival and Wicked Clownz 'cause we need
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothin like the squeal when you hear a piggy die
I might use a gun, (NO!)
I might use an ax, (YES!)
The carnivals in town come and get your piggy snacks (2x)
The last little piggy, his house is made of gold,
He lives in a mansion on his own private road,
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait,
I snapped his fuckin' neck in 2 and slammed his nuts in the gate!
'cause this little piggy, must definitely die,
I'm a lob his nugget off and toss it in the sky.
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil,
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel.
People in my city, they fight for their meals,
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills.
A ritchie is the devil, he never will admit it,
So I'm a cut his hand off and slap his face with it.
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed,
I grabbed a brick of gold and smacked it upside his head.
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late,
And tied his neck in a knot and watched him suffocate, 'cause I need
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothin like the squeal when you hear a piggy die
I might use a gun, (NO!)
I might use an ax, (YES!)

Which one of these hoes am I fuckin tonight?

This ain't my block and ain't my click
But I'm up in here and ain't scare of shit

Then I heard a cut.. (who the new dude?)
The dj tryna play me rude

I say ""what they call you?""
(i'm dj clay the baddeset dj alive today peep...)

I had to back up and scoop my wig off the floor
It practically blew out the door

I brushed myself off and walked back up to 'em
That's pretty good shit ya doing but (what?)

I'm thinkin I'm a little bit better (oh yeah?)
Some folks call me the neck shredder

'cause I cuts a lot too, so why don't you scoot down
(what's your name?) shaggy the clown

Dj clay woke up and asked what happened
""you just witnessed this here scratchin""

Everybody gathered around the turntables
Hatchetman hangin off our cables, he said

(you and me one more time, right now)
I said, ""sure thing but I'll tell you how

You drop the rhythm and I'll drop the beat
We'll let them feel the underground moving under the street come on!""

Insane Clown Posse,"There comes a time, every so often, 
When the Dark Carnival begins to swell with the countless souls awaiting judgement
And the thriving mob begins to tear at each other to find a place in lines that stretch out of view
And as attractions open wide to accommodate crowds frantically clawing their way inside
He will come to perform the cleansing 
As the seething masses turn to witness him growing near
Their eyes attempt to make out his face forming within the looming smoke
Suddenly, bang! Like a continuous explosion, he moves down upon them full of thunderous fury,
Enveloping the masses in darkness
Then, pow! A deep, resonating explosion of unparalleled intensity
Those still alive begin to feel a warm rain upon their charred skin, 
Which they soon realize is the blood of the shredded victims
They can only lay screaming in pure, stark terror, when boom! 
An earthshaking implosion of catastrophic proportions erupts,
Causing all to collapse inward into a finite point of brilliant, horrific energy
You may call him ""Bang! Pow! Boom!""

A tale of a man searching for that misplaced love in all the
Wrong places and how he gets his heart ripped out of his chest and
Stuck in his face so he can watch it slowly stop beating let's
Listen on and hear how my gumpy friend violent jay goes about
Getting his feelings crushed once again

After 3 years in a mental asylum
I'm finally out and I'm fine now no doubt
Rolling home I see a bitch on a payphone.
She was fat and round and had it going on.
She had a name tag on Roxy Carol
Stepped up to her like hello
We was kicking it
I said I got this dick sup on lickin' it
She said I'm down for the tactics
Then my dick stood up like a Tucson cactus
I threw her in the back of my jalopy
She was wet and sloppy
But nothing could stop me
I was like Jesus
Her neden was yellow and smelled like cheese pizza
I paid it no mind
I stuck my dick in raw and commenced to grind.

The whole car smelled like pickles
I stuck my toe in her ass
And tweaked her titty nipples
We fucked for about an hour
I dropped her off where I found her and went for the shower
I got home and I kicked back
Thought about the shower ha ha fuck that
When I woke up the very next morning
I was awake but my dick was snoring
It was whistling and shooting out smoke
The head was spinning like a Dayton hundred spoke
I started shaking and sweating
I had a fever
My dick was swelled up like a faygo 2 liter
It was greenish with purple bungions
And dripping blue skeet and flaking like onions
She gave me skiffilufigus no doubt
I'm a find that bitch and knock her the fuck out

I'm on a mission I search and roam
Cause my dick hole is spurting up pink foam
And I'm dragging my balls behind me
They're as big as a mailbox bumpy and slimy
Thank god I ain't dead yet
My dick is crispy but my drawers are wet somehow
There she is on the same payphone
Near Zug Island in the industrial waste zone
Wait a minute y'all hold up
Is that the same bitch I was with she looks toe-up
Holy fuck nothings in place that ain't a girl at all
It's a barrel of toxic waste!
Oh lord what have I done?
Roxy Carol is a toxic waste barrel
Me and my green dick headed back to the loony bin
I'm here to turn myself back in

Insane Clown Posse,"If magic is all we've ever know
Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
But I've seen miracles in every way
And I see miracles everyday
Oceans spanning beyond my sight
And a million stars way above em at night
We don't have to be high to look in the sky
And know that's a miracle opened wide
Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas
And everything chilling underwater, please
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
Long neck giraffes, and pet cats and dogs
And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
All in one room, together as equals
Pure magic is the birth of my kids
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids
The sun and the moon, and even Mars
The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
UFOs, a river flows
Plant a little seed and nature grows
Niagara falls and the pyramids
Everything you believed in as kids
Fucking rainbows after it rains
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains
I fed a fish to a pelican at (Friscal?) bay
It tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away
And music is magic, pure and clean
You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen

Music is all magic
(Are you a believer in miracles)
You can't even hold it
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)
It's just there in the air
(Are you a believer in miracles)
Pure motherfucking magic
Right?
This shit'll blow your fucking mind
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)

Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling
And it fills the room, from the floor to the ceiling
I see miracles all around me
Stop and look around, it's all astounding
Water, fire, air and dirt
Fucking magnets, how do they work?
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed
Solar eclipse, and vicious weather
Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
And I love my mom for giving me this
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
Miracles ain't nothing to lie
Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy
And my little boy looks just like daddy
Miracles each and every where you look
And nobody has to stay where they put
This world is yours for you to explore
There's nothing but miracles beyond your door
The Dark Carnival is your invitation
To witness that without explanation
Take a look at this fine creation
And enjoy it better with appreciation
Crows, ghosts, the midnight coast
The wonders of the world, mysteries the most
Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
To ignore the miracles of every day

(Are you a believer in miracles)
Magic everywhere in this bitch
(Do you notice and recognize miracles)
It's all around you, you don't even know it
(Are you a believer in miracles)

So many miracles, the magic miracles)

Insane Clown Posse,"If everything is going my way 
Then why does it suck so much to be Eric Ritter today? 
I'm like the captain of the football team 
And every girl who's someone in my school, they want to suck my dick or sleep with me 
I get big props, and high fives 
For them quarter back sneaks from the 30 yard line 
I never fuck with drugs, I only drink for the buzz 
I can handle my liquor, and my daddy is a judge 
And he looks out for me 
But what about the prom queen? 
It's been at least two weeks since she's been heard from or seen 
Susan Casada, her momma is a lawyer and her daddy is a doctor 
Her picture's in my locker 
Her body's in the lagoon, underneath the lily pads 
Glow from the moon, dark watery tomb 
Consumed the body, then pulled her below 
I wrapped her in my letterman coat and slit her throat 
Then I let go 
Loudest splash I ever heard 
And from that day forward I haven't spoken a word 

And from that day forward I haven't spoken a word

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
The marsh lagoon 
So many want to dump their dead in here 
Only the water 
Only the waters know what stories they bare 

My name's not important 
You never thought you'd see the day when you would see me again 
But now I caught you 
I've been abused, confused but uplifted 
So I choose to keep this inside but that shifted to a hate that'd keep me alive 
Until your heart stops 
Then padlock your time box and dropped it in a black marsh 
To hell and back is where my mind has been 
And once upon a time I had a friend I thought I really could confide in 
Flashbacks of the touching 
Uncomfortable feeling 
Can't sleep much at night 
I'm crawling the ceiling 
Got me feeling like I'm sick and depressed 
Cause everybody that I told, they just laid it to rest 
But now I'm twenty five 
And I'm sick of all the talking 
Now I'm stalking you, waiting by the door that you'll be walking through 
No disguise so you can recognize my face 
And all the shame and disgrace will be the reason I dismantle you 
I handle you like a candle 
Break you in half and then I laugh at you 
Soak you in gas and make you flammable 
I burned the body and I gathered the ash 
And then I sprinkle the lagoon every time I get the chance 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I got dark secrets 
Eventually I told everybody 
One day I'ma snap and leave a crime scene bloody 
But they only think I'm playing 
I'm just a Dave from Donut Hut 
They always like ""What up Dave Nut?"" when I show up 
But that doesn't really bother me I suppose 
Yet there's a darkness inside of me 
Which eagerly grows 
When I was younger I murdered off some neighborhood squirrels 
And this abandoned garage was like my own private world 
Now it's ""Honey, I had a bad dream again"" 
I'm tripping 
Demons eating me alive and burning within 
I gotta feed it 
I roll down another dark street 
I'm trying to find something alive so I can smother out it's heartbeat 
I'm thinking a hooker 
You think I'm bullshitting? 
I reach for my leathers, but I only find my wife's mittens in the glove box 
Circle some blocks 
I pick the chick up, I let her suck the dick up, before I cut her neck up 
She kicked for a minute, not putting much in it 
I never thought I'd get this mad 
I'm glad I did it, I admit it 
Feel so much better, a neck wetter, a throat shredder 
I got blood on my sweater and I better not get a head, of myself 
The first matter is disposal of the body 
I found the perfect spot out past my Uncle Marty's 
It's some hidden lagoon where it be dark all the time 
I dumped her there and got on with mine 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Only the trees 
Only the fish 
Only the bugs 
And only the water 
Truly really know 
What happened that night 
When right went wrong 
That's how they got there

This muthafucka act like he puttin' it down for the hood
Talkin' bout everybody know Blaze, big baller

Dead muthafucka don't get no special treatment from me
Look at Sarie's son little Eric
You know that muthafucka down to wear a wheelchair
I hate that muthafucka
And I don't show him no special treatment
So Blaze can kiss my ass

I put in work for my hood
So fuck a 9 to 5
You can find me on the corner

They call me Mr. Lump Lump
So when their heads hear the thunder and the bump bump
They come out runnin' like the kids to the ice cream man
Children I'm sorry it's Blaze in the loony van
Playin' Atari, and I gotta do a crime to loot and 8 ball
Semi automatic with a clip for the law
All I want to do is make money and smoke
Fuck hella bitches, and slang my dope

Some many died and some faded away

Still gonna rock till the day I die again

Walk again, talk thug shit, right
Empty mack clips, right
Keep it old school, want to see that bitch? Uh huh
When it's thugs in King's coats and Raider's caps
Killers, jerry curls, and baseball bats
Ready to die like everyday
I put it down like a muthafucka, everyday
I drink brew and smoke weed like, everyday
And we all trying to get paid but anyway
Killas don't talk, but this one do
Talk you out your wallet let the 45 blast you
Twice in the chest, once in the face
Plus the extra heater on the safe side in case
Your bitch is wack well she can catch one too
Cause if you're down with your hood
Then your hood down with you

Bitch you don't know me, don't approach me
Thinkin' that you're down with Blaze ya dead homie

Mount of thy redeeming love.

Here I raise my Ebenezer, Hither by 
Thy help I'm come
And I hope, by thy good pleasure, 
Safely to arrive at home,
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it, 
Prone to leave the God I love,
Here's my heart. O take and seal it; 
Seal it for thy courts above.

Jesus sought me when a stranger, 
Wand'ring from the fold of God,
He, to rescue me from danger, 
Interposed his precious blood,
/Prone to wander, Lord I feel it, 
Prone to leave the God I love./
O to grace how great a debtor Daily 
I'm constrained to be!
Let they goodness, like a fetter, Bind 
My wandering heart to thee

Prone to wander, Lord I feel it, 
Prone to leave the God I love.
Here's my heart. O take and seal it; 
Seal it for thy courts above.",Come Thou Fount
InsideOut,"I read a note my grandma wrote back in 1923
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me
He said, now son, you might not understand,
But a long, long time ago
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, 
But I loved your grandma so

We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together
Get married in the first town we came to and live forever
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead
I found this letter, and this is what it said

If you get there before I do, don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be, 
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see
'cause between now and then till I see you again 
I'll be loving you
Love, me

I read these words just hours before
My grandma passed away,
In the doorway of the church where me and grandpa 
Stopped to pray
I know I'd never seen him cry, in all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her,
His eyes filled up with tears

If you get there before I do, don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be, 
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see
'cause between now and then till I see you again 
I'll be loving you
Love, me

I'm falling apart, no good on my own.

Oh L'amour broke my heart now I'm aching for you
Mon amour what's a boy in love supposed to do?

Why throw it away, why walk out on me?
I just left for the day for the way it should be
There once was a time I had you here by my side,
You said I wasn't your kind, only here for the ride.

Oh L'amour broke my heart now I'm aching for you
Mon amour what's a boy in love supposed to do?

What's a boy in love supposed to do?
Oh L'amour....

No emotional ties, you don't remember my name,
I lay down and die, I'm only to blame,

While I execute the deadliest moves with fine tunin
Duel of the Iron Mic bound to spark fusion

Strictly, Streetlife, I never play a fan of the fame
Just build on my name, and master the slang

Than any MC who ship platinum or gold
And only recoup to pay back what you sold
Over budget your video, got pimped like a hoe
My niggas move slo-mo like robotic clones
I'd rather be alive and paid, than dead broke

To wake up reminicisin' and spark the blunt clip
Have you lovin' it, wonderin' if I shall return
Forget me not, enternally the flame burns

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck, (unknown singer)]
Forget me not (Baby, sweet love.)
Forget me not (Girl, feel what I feel?)
(Baby, sweet love. Girl, feel what I feel?)

[Inspectah Deck]
Last August, I met this hard chick, caught a carbon pick
'bout to visit her, man, in month six
Just comin' home from a two year trip
Now we 'bout to do two 'cause her man turned snitch
She under pressure, want me to come rescue her
but Inspectah is no haven for the rester
I feel you breakin' out but it's the path you chose
Fuckin' your foes will have sons breakin' your nose
I see her once or twice now as weeks went by
She'd slide by tryin' to hide the black eyes
Lookin' right though, I might go for her seduction
Dangerous curves, I must avoid bein' sucked in
Lustin', I caught her at the function
Slid out the side, saw the ride and jumped in
Later on, the fox unlatched the black box
Got her rocks then collapsed from the backshots

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
(Last night...) changed it all, I had a ball
First of all, I got an obscene phonecall
All I heard was heavy breathin', laugh sounds and moans
An intimate kiss followed by the dial tone
Repeatedly, this person kept callin' my home
Givin' graphic details of her sexual jones
No clue of who, must've been a total stranger
Annoyin' me, yeah, but talkin' me out my anger
State your name and stop playin' games
If you want to spark flames, it can be arranged
On your side of town, right around now
What you workin' with, let me know how it's goin' down
Then the phone clicked, then once again, it rang
with directions to the lab, where she's doin' her thang
To my surprise, when I arrived, she had her legs cocked
I got her red hot and blessed the wet spot

[Chorus to fade]

Duckin the searchlight  no sleep for like the third night 
The big life is trife  got the young kids hyped 
Cops shoot on sight  heat pipe be blowin through the night 
The land where you ain't fam  there's no pity 
Similar to Chocolate City, ten times gritty 
Hittin hard, liquor's God, niggaz plottin on the come off 
and come off, quicker than the clothes on the stripper 
and slide like she doin up and down the railing 
Bitch tailing in the Range with Golden Arms smooth sailin 
The clock's tickin, somebody's on the block snitchin 
The plot thickens, phones are tapped, cops listen 
Too hot for prison, plus too cold to hold my girl

Where most die for pies, some holdin their chrome 
A large percent die for causes not even their own 
When the Inspectah Deck be long dead and gone 
long live the I-N-S song they workin on 
Til then, I hold a section, I stand alone no co-defendant 
Showin the weapon, this saga had no story endin 
It's ghetto heaven, and at the same time hell - shots propel 
The one that missed me got Chanel 
In the future ruled by computer, I self tutor 
The music is the simulator, facin the user 
I do it for those who walk the same road 
And no regrets do I hold for the path I chose 
No sleep since the intro, patrol the windows 
I reminisce, with the chalice and my eyes half closed 
If I could do it again, I'd probably do it the same 
Thought I was through with the game, I'm goin through it again

Still Rebel to society, government be eyein me

Smooth getaway, yeah
One time on my ass (getaway)
'Bout to make this hundred yard dash...
with the cash

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm fleein the crime scene on the major decon
Power steerin, lost the handle in the Jeep spin
Deep in the seat, high pursuit by the precinct
My co-defendant turned stake and let the beast in
They rush my old Earth lab, grabbed 50 g's cash
in the stash and let the glock splash
Sun dash down the fire escape past the weed gate
the weed gate, thought it was a sting, popped the tre' 8
Jakes givin chase, now the dread's my 'space
I was creepin down the staircase, we met face to face
In the lobby, cold stares, show no fear
We out for now, but next time we might go there
'cause po's here, must've turned down the walkie talkie
I thought I heard one tell the other that he caught me
Damn, they got my man, he knows shit
Bitch nigga that I rolled with told shit
I laid low, 007 'til I get dark
He told where my wiz lives and where the whip's parked
Got my address off the license plate
That eliminates, headin to my next restin place
Uncertain, my wiz peaked from behind the curtain
It seen the high beam from the chicky lurkin
The high speed chase, got my swervin
I needed a diversion, crashed in the side of a suburban
In the mirror, I'm starin at the eyes of the lord
Couldn't jump out, fucked up the driver side door
Called China, meet me in a half with the pathfinder
No time to talk, I'll fill you in when I find ya
Stopped at a neighborhood diner, brought me some attire
And swore to hold me down under fire (echo)

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
The word on the street, they can't trace my rap sheets
Still I creap swift, tryin to slip all heat
The word on the street, this thing's way beyond deep
Promise me you'll keep ya mouth close and don't leak
The word on the street, the evidence's concrete
My cold thief mysteriously got set free
The word on the street, the photograph
let the beast splash through the projects, the last you weap

[Inspectah Deck]
You bein watched like you new on the block from roof tops
Get your moves on these hot shots, pop, music stops
Party's over, bold soldier move for his holster
Shot the lights out, struck the bouncer in his shoulder
hard times for po-9, can't control the mass' sweep
for move backstage, we sling V.I.P. passes
Jakes sprayin mace, riots takin place
When the Clan show they face, the fans show they place
Get your blunt rolled, fuck the 5-0, they want it dun' know
Bitches get tripped over, niggaz wildin the front row
Fire marshall catch a beat down, tryin to cut my sound
Radio dispatcher, back-up, bustin rounds
without intermission from a crowd's position
Bullets ricochet off the strobe-lights, strikin Christians
My nigga slipped in, 'nuff ammunition
to bust back, fuck that, them out-of-town cats gon' take the rap
It's war on the dance floor, quarter to 4
Before we peeled off, they tried to seal off the back door
Gats for the beast, high pursuit down the side streets
Shot up my getaway Jeep, crashed the front glass
Flew the head rest off the passenger seat
I grabbed the heat, catched in the wif in and escaped on feet
While the locals interrogated for names and photos
work for 5-0, swappin info for dough

We pray for a better today, glocks and berettas spray
Everyday, how did I survive yesterday?
I can't call it, cops shot the alcoholic
The fiend saw it, he got the gun, he want a dime for it
The hood life, chicks and thugs, crips and bloods
Dippin' on the judge, pushin' whips and drugs
Burnin' big buds, gettin' love, spinnin' them dubs
For the taste of it, the low lifes'll split your mug
It's the home of the brave, the zone of the slave
We all want it, but gettin' it's, a whole 'nother page
The young guns wantin' respect, flossin' the tech
Bitches want to strip, now it's all for the check
Yo, everyday, lives at stake, pies to bake
Same knife that cuts your throat divides the cake
For the hustlers, thugs, who scheme to survive
And all in between, scream ""Fuck a 9 to 5""

In the bright lights, the big city
The thieves stay crawlin' at night, with eyes shifty
In the bright lights, the big city
The fiends come sortin' the price, with nine fifty
In the bright lights, the big city
They squeeze off, lustin' for shine and die quickly
In the bright lights, the big city
The streets take a whole of your mind, it gets gritty

[Inspectah Deck]
Daydreams, bought and sold
The high price we livin' might cost your soul
Secret indictments, furrows, with roll hoes
Codefendant, I hope he don't tell what he knows
Exposed to a life of crime since I was nine
Gettin' money by design, despite the time
Hustlin' to be a man and feed my fam
My wife, my seed, my land, completes the plan
Please understand, either legal or scam
I see the thieves in the van, I can't beat the man
Still monster ballin', eatin', speakin' ebonics
Wit foreign cars, custom made clothes and chronic
Bank rolls and prophets, shine solar powered
Fine hoes that's bout it, long as you keep they nose powdered
Obey street laws, careful what you say
You can play, but you might not make it through the day

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I'm used to gettin' over
I'm deep in the middle, indeed the heat sizzle
For the littlest beef, even the seeds keep pistols
Foreigners talk funny, friends they want from me
But all I need is long money and a strong honey
I need it ""fast"", I'm ""furious"" like Vin Diesel
I'm lookin' at my plate wit food for ten people
So, do what you gotta do, do what you want to
The blocks hot like a sauna, cops try to pawn you
The fiends trick you, dude behind you want to get you
On the grind, your best friend'll talk for a figure
Walk wit a nigga, see it, don't talk about it, be it
Don't walk around, then beat it, we all bound to feel it
This ain't the town (for real), so watch your tour (that's right)
What's goin' down (what's up), its poppin' off

I represent myself and my own defense
Innocent by reason of no evidence
Plus they're tryin' pick the punishment the judge insists
My fingerprints were traced back to six gun clips
Cop witness, who try and testify on my click
He on the payroll that's why I got my prior dismissed
This is framework, somehow they got ahold of my flick
The night in question, I was restin' home with my chick
Then the spot was blown, cops rushed in, shots were blown
I jetted out the lab with socks and boxers on
Undercover chased me down for three weeks
He ceased to interrogate like I might speak
But no, I won't tell ya who I work for
And no, I won't tell ya who the work's for
You can hit me with the book, brick, hammer and all
I dig a tunnel or just scale the jailhouse wall

Cops came but I ain't pop a flame
Hear me ya honor? I ain't dropped a thing
I was cuffed, they told me that somebody dropped my name
And the time they tryin' to match me with is not the same
I was knocked from 8:00 to the time the shot went rang
When I woke up, I smoked up and watched the game
Then I laid up with my bitch and got rocked with brain
Release me from this Elymer Fudd shit, the glove don't fit
Too tall for the cop description and slugs don't fit
He was hit with a nine right? I bust slugs with a fifth
You got any of my D.N.A. or blood up in this bitch?
I'm not the guy aligned to fall, this not my crime at all
You lock me up, I'm climbin' the wall
You want me scapegoat, so stay close, alliance will call

Fuck that, you and the D.A. spit-shine our balls

Come on a plea bargain for what, your honor?
Nah yo I ain't do shit, the only thing I'm coppin' is a new whip
The night it happened I was lampin' at a deuce flick with two chicks
Kim and Chris, we guzzle Cris' on some Rush Hour 2 shit
I knew the kid, yeah we had problems, yeah I robbed him
Now it's '98 though and the handgun was a revolver
You tryin' to play me on an old case but I hold no weight
Turned myself in, I skated on them keystone jakes
Right description, right Killa, wrong case, I didn't hit him
Here's the verdict, not guilty, not tryin' to see a prison
Got my life on the line, you want to grind me through ya system
And have my family and my wiz cryin', I miss 'em
You buggin', you the same judge that framed K with the drugs

Yeah, this that brand new Rebel I.N.S., back on the set
This shit is off the dial, Shaolin Style, better hold on to something

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, S.I.N.Y. and what
Hit 'em high, hit 'em low, head or gut
Yes, us, Lexus and next trucks
Flesh plush, land plus, extras
Cess, dust, whatever get you messed up
Test us, get crushed, next up
Better luck, we takin' off with jet thrust
Under pressure, they can't take the head rush
Talk to me, go and take the walk through me
Or yours truly, will screw you like a tour groupie
War duty, after I'mma call Suzy
Tall cutie, she'll do me like a porn movie
I burn thousand degrees, nothin' match me
You think you out of my league, now how can that be?
Son, you follow my lead, playin' the back seat
Ya'll ride dicks like a taxi, it's like that
Here we go..

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
I roll fat, holdin' a stash (it's like that)
Home girl, blowin' my jack (like that)
We boys in the mist of the noise (it's like that)
We big boys whippin' them toys (like that)
We up late, runnin' from jake (like that)
And still got money to make (it's like that)
From now until we finish the game (like that)
The world gonna cherish the name (it's like that)

[Inspectah Deck]
Downtown blowin' my sound, blew out your Alpines
Feel me, I did it for dough, this ain't about rhymes
Cash on delivery, not leavin' without mines
Face tried to powder my shine, it's about time
To politic, poppin' the clip, bust off the hot shit
Holler this, monstrous hit, and stop ya gossip
I rep, what you expect, I took a set back
Crept back, nursin' my wounds, lookin' for get back
Forced to bring the pain, make 'em say my name
Rings have changed, shinin' like I'm Ving Rhames
Or King James, hustlin', I sling game
Sting lames, this money makin' things change
I bless heads, push past the full macs
Left for dead, raised by the wolf packs
Black hoods, leathers with the wool hats
Draw blood, don't even pull gats, it's like that

[Interlude: DJ Kay Slay]
Aiyo, ya'll better kick your shoes off
And come on in!

[Chorus]

[Interlude: DJ Kay Slay]
Aiyo, this is all for my Metro card, one dollar cab niggaz
Niggaz who walk here, and all the ladies who stood on line in the rain
With the bouncers who let the thugs slide, come on, come on..

[Inspectah Deck]
The streets watch, ya'll gon get ya teeth knocked
The heats hot, bustin' til the beef stop
Preach not, our goal is to reach the top
Knees drop, I light it up and clean shop
Built with better design, clever mind
Verbal tech 9, light years, ahead of my time
And I, walk with, criminals who talk shit
We talk business, the blocks is our office
Many have come, few that could walk this
Roam too far, catch static like a cordless
I'm off this, pimpin' a broad, beyond gorgeous
Gettin' lost, dippin' in twin Porsches, it's like that
(SeVeN Ltd.)",It's Like That
Inspectah Deck,"[Inspectah Deck]
Ye-yeah
Smooth like a green Caddy, ya fiend badly
Heads spin like Giovanni's on the Navi
Hammers spit, quick as the darts, niggaz part
Like the Red Sea, test me, I'm sick with the art
Been held back, it's either rap or sell smack
Black Knight like Martin Lawrence run tell that
It's the I-N-S-P-E-see-T-A-H
Livin' life on the line, I hope I see daybreak
This is ground level, rounds echo out the Special
Be easy, U.D.'s out to get you
Throw it in a mash (so fast)
Known to spaz (so as)
We like strippers makin' niggaz (throw cash)
Smoke the blue green (call it Joe Cash)
Fake thugs (hold ass)
You be the next rapper (callin' Onas)
want to measure my size? I rise above the norm
The urban icon ridin' on the eye of the storm, fool

[Chorus: Inspectah Deck]
All my people from the front to back
If you want it like that just.. MOVE!
Get ill, no time to chill
Yo, you feel what I feel then.. MOVE!
Girlfriend, you love how it sounds
Put ya drink down and.. MOVE!
COME ON! COME ON! COME ON! COME ON!

[Inspectah Deck]
What ya do now, put ya loot down
You can bet it on the new sound
Heavy like a Hummer on deuce pounds
True hounds, on the loose in ya town
Bound to the move the crowd, it's The Movement (you down?)
Scream at the top of ya lungs
Pop one for Aaliyah, Left Eye, BIG, 'Pac and Pun
Ride with my shotgun, rock with son
Heads bop to the drums, still shocked and stunned
Comin' live y'all, gangsta like white walls
On the blue Snoop Deville, watch ya eyeballs
Blade stay choppin' the track, game top of the pack
I spit flames y'all acknowledge the fact
Find out Big Rug get it poppin' like that
Throw it down like Stackhouse, cockin' it back
So ladies? Is you wit me now? Don't fake down
Everybody brace yaselves, it's a shakedown

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
I do this for dough, but it's really for love
Feel me, it's love for hot girls, willies and thugs
My groups cross seas, call us junglin' thugs
And it's sure to move ya feet like a gun in the club
I blaze like a ounce and a half, stay countin' the cash
For all lames that doubtin' my craft
He's no pretender, he won't surrender
(He's a rebel) Don't y'all remember?
A major player in the game
Play the frontline, ain't afraid to make a change
I stay way beyond range
So far from the norm my code name's Doc Strange
Now get down with the get down
Sendin' missles to all my dogs in the big house
Make 'em wig out, Spiderman still on the web
Log on like ya clickin' the mouse, yeah!

[Chorus]",The Movement
Inspectah Deck,"[Intro: Streetlife (Inspectah Deck)]
Yo, what's poppin' off out here son?
Yo, hold up, I think that's my baby mama on the phone
Damn, yo, hold on, yo hold on for a second
Yo, man, you see shorty right there (look at shorty right there)
Yo, I'mma call you back in a second, aight?

[Streetlife]
Yo, excuse me Miss Thang with your nose ring
The way your body swing, you make a nigga wanna sing
I can tell by the bling-bling, you like the finer things
And you highly motivated by what money brings
You got a dope fetish, attitude to go get it
A little athletic, no need for cosmetics
A little bowlegged, street smarts and good credit
You got the best part, that's why you actin' hard headed
It's a man's world, baby girl, don't forget it
But what's a thug without his ladybug, I must respect it
I know a woman's worth, ladies come first
I'm the Sun, you're the Earth, mother of the universe
I know what you like, you go for the street type
Who keep the g tight, and hit the G-spot right
I just might, call my wife
Tell her ""Baby, I'm not comin' home tonight""

[Chorus: Streetlife (Inspectah Deck) {both}]
Damn (yo look at shorty right there) nah, look at shorty right there
{I need you in my life, girl, girl}
(Yo look at shorty right there) nah, look at shorty right there
(Look at shorty right there) damn
{In my life, my life}

[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, checkin' baby girl with the wavy curls
Precious lady pearl in the shady world
Please to meet you, your dress fit as if see through
Niggas treat you like royalty and dream to freak you
Diva in your own right, keep your home right
Bad bitch with the switch, let's trip the strobe lights
Tight with the Power-you, I'll devour you
Everything about you, make me scout you
No doubt, boo, make me fiend for a taste
Your hot like a fireplace, shows in your face
Now, come out the closet, baby girl, it's safe
Just a taste, of sex, lies and videotape
Let's skate, but late on the way, sound clever
Drinkin' brown leather, she down for whatever
We he call tomorrow, that's the question asked
Call it love at first sight, til the next one pass like

[Chorus]

[Streetlife]
Look at shorty right there, with the six-pack
Lookin' like a fruit snack with the shoe strapped to her knee caps

[Inspectah Deck]
Look at shorty right there in the blue Range
With the two bangs, high in the eye, she's a true dame

[Streetlife]
Nah, look at shorty right there, with the mini skirt
With pink finky shirt, the way her body jerk make my jimmy hurt

[Inspectah Deck]
Nah, shorty right there, the amazon
Six foot three, with the glasses on, built for a marathon

[Streetlife]
Look at shorty right there with the big hips (where?)
With the group of chicks, aiyo, lady who ya'll rollin' wit?

[Inspectah Deck]
Shorty right there, with the white dude
In the sky blue, knowin' she fly, friend is right too...
Look at shorty right there!



",Shorty Right There
Inspectah Deck,"[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, back from the dead
It's the Rebel, I Soldier, I told ya
I shall return, yeah

[Inspectah Deck]
Ya'll done fucked up, lettin' me live, something's got to give
I'm positive, you're gonna all pay homage
Believe me, I ain't lyin' down that easy
And that thought applies for those who proud to see me
Through the distraction, I was wounded in action
An act of betrayal, but I knew the assassin
Now I pack a vengeance like Steven Seagal
I'm back from the trenches to even the odds and...

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck]
You hear the rockets red glare? The bombs burstin' in air?
Gave proof through the night, that I stood through the fight
Yeah, the Rebel's still here, what?

[Inspectah Deck]
Ya'll better rock ya'll hoodies
And hold your girl tight, before we pop that pussy
It be so real, I don't need no deal
My mass appeal make a marvel out how he so ill
Ya'll time is up, try your luck, ya'll wind up
Fucked up, before you even recognize I struck
Roll with the live dozen, got all eyes buzzin'
With strong rhymes cousin, been a long time comin'
Break your weak links, in the chain, fuck your mink, and your reign
Son is lame, plus he thinks it's a game
But, we about to apply the heat (the heat)
And snatch him up out the driver's seat
I put my life on it, post up like who want it
Blast off with the force to send ya'll in orbit
Wild like whitey's in the mosh pit, yeah we gon' start shit
Pack 'em down, then corner the market

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck]
To all my real M.C.'s, the ones without a deal M.C.'s
The ones who kick the real life music
Let's link, them niggas can't move no more units

[Inspectah Deck]
For life I'll be underground, their first thought
Was yo, ""How did he survive with no commercial support?""
Damn right, I miss the corporate politics and tricks
Where the SoundScan is rigged and contracts are fixed
I sit in the pit where the grime exist
Legendary, they still lovin' my rhymes from 9-6
Now I'm back, that's my word as I reveal this shit
By choice or by force, ya'll gonna feel this shit, ya hear?

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, this is all out war, I'm callin' on all outlaws
Son, they new to the art, ain't true to the heart
Who's down for the cause, huh?",Vendetta
Inspectah Deck,"""He who write the songs.."" - repeated throughout the intro



[Intro: Inspectah Deck]

Festos (who got it, huh, who got it?)

Underdawgz in the building, U.D.'s (who got it, huh, who got it?)
Streetlife, Size/7, what, Johnny Blaze (who got it, huh, who got it?)



Yeah, what, it's a Shaolin thing y'all, get familiar


[Inspectah Deck]

Truth scholar, you holla up the few dollars

I work it overtime, whether white or blue collar

I prove my honor, 'cause I been through the drama

Wu-Chronicles, and I continue the saga


Chart topper, rhyme tough as body armor
When I speak, I hold the globe like a Dhali Llama

The flow is aqua, pa, you swimmin' wit the known piranha

The soul father, get to know my whole persona
Like Shaquana, from Guyana, stay lace in cabana


Fiend for the block opera, your top sponsor
For papa, she shake her tata's like maracas

Got you locked in the scope of the rocket launcher


Stop your offers, cop mine, I drop it monster

Let the rhyme inside your mind like chocolate ganja, it's the worst



[Chorus: sampled singer (Inspectah Deck)]

He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)

He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)

He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)

He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs, he..


[Inspectah Deck]


I supply the fire, let your headsets be the bomb

One song, give you pipe dreams like Cheech & Chong

Got dough, cop and go, all else breeze along

Be strong, the high last four weeks long

Get your eat on, she'll hold you til the fever is gone

Got you cold sweatin', and up creepin' til dawn
Wide eyed, off the side, no sleepin' on morn'

O.D.'ing, just the side effects, so, please be warned


Son, I raise your blood pressure like tight jeans and thongs

Guaranteed like throwin' the bomb to Keyshawn

Put your peeps on, I spice it up like Dijon

We be, ease to calm, to the streets we belong

Don't be alarmed, 'cause indeed the heat is on

So hot, to touch me, you need tweezers and tongs


If I breathe on the mic, it's left weakened and torn
Til he gone, you'll be leanin' like your sneakers are worn, off the worst



[Chorus]



[Inspectah Deck]

I got the works, like a Burger deluxe, you heard it was us

Got You All in Check like Dirty and Bust'

Play dirty and rough, remain thirsty for bucks

Seein' dollar signs like today's the first of the month

Dunn, it hurts when I touch, flames burst off the verses I bust

Some wanna scuff, but ain't worthy enough


What? I burn you up rookie, just hang your jersey up
I'm on the east side, workin' at a Mercury truck

Seen me servin' up the uncut, that certainly crush

Murderous, first to bust, expert in the clutch

That's my word up, loose links, lurk in the cut

On the re-up, be sure to catch a third degree rush

Here's your beat up, I keep the cut, verbally plush

Keep a burnin' Dutch, heat tucked and burgundy chucks


Won't you turn it up, them wit the girlies, they lust

It's the dopeman, my jams run your thirty and up, it's the worst


[Chorus]



[sample to end]



",Who Got It
Inspectah Deck,"[Intro: Carlton Fisk]
Carlton Fisk, I.N.S., we got Chico
Staten's back... the monster, come on
House Gang... House Gang... now we gat y'all
Check it...

[Chorus: Chico DeBarge]
You abandoned me, y'all don't live here anymore...
Just a vacancy, y'all don't live here anymore...

[Carlton Fisk]
The scene open, see my mother at a table, focused
A belt wrapped around her arm, veins bulging
A bottle top, a little cotton, intervene this needle dirty bopping
Hands swollen, psalms untoppable
Little kid I watch the nod, know the rules
Never talk to a teacher in school
You might think that this environment's cruel
Fuck it, this what I decided to do
Started stealing anything I could move
Now I'm thirteen, with something to prove
Buddha hit me with a twenty-two
That started my career with a tool
Nothing to it, get up on 'em, tell 'em ""pass it all""
Since you short, if you move, blast it off
Like a rocket, if he falls, dig his pockets and run
And if you get caught, just rep where you from, little nigga
I know what's it like out there, you strugglin' and you grinding, let's go

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
Thug paradise, drugs, gats and knives, life sacrifice
Nickel dime grind, catch a full clip, half price
Kings tumble in time, it's like a jungle sometimes
I play it humble, gotta rumble sometimes
Big timers taking numbers with nines, with the bundles of dimes
You wind up, with a gun to your spine
And the coppers never solve the case
Them gorillas in the mist, war, and get lost they hard to trace
Man this cold world'll scar ya fate, so I stay awake
Late night with cigars, and jars of haze
Half my comrades dead or in jail, most said I would fail
I'm still alive, getting checks in the mail
Still cowards wanna force my hand, eating off my hand
Boiling water, never lost a gram
Cash Rules, I'm pulling off the scam, catch the bossman
Sure hand, on the dice, in the game of life, life

[Chorus]

[Hook: Chico DeBarge]
You don't know... what it cost to pay that ride
You don't know... what you lost til it pass you by
You don't know baby, that you could, til time is fading you by
And you don't miss, all that's in your way, til you circle or try

[Chorus to fade]",No Love
Inspection 12,"I am the stopwatch on a bomb.
I have no the strength to carry on.
My valediction waits for me.
It makes me scared to go to sleep.
My destination can't be far.
I'm In the backseat of this car.
My belt is buckled, locked and clasped.
And I'm not sure how long this ride will last.
I've seen so much. And I've had dreams
But I can't tell you what they mean
And I've been far. Too far to see.
And where I've been is part of me
And if my life goes flashing by
Like they all say I hope that I
See my entire family.
It's so much bigger than you'd ever thought it to be.
And I've heard songs and harmonies.
I've kept them here inside of me.
And I've had friends-The best indeed.
And who I've loved is part of me.
I can't tell you how much you meant to me.
Never had any opportunity
You're not here to accept apologies
Goodbye.",Elegy
Inspection 12,"In a room filled with darkness
It's another sunny day.
I lose my faith and all without you and feel the pain
Of lost love some never gain.
I never said that I would leave you
And I only want to stay

'Cause at the times that I'm feeling down
And left out in the rain
My heart is filled with you.
And I don't care- and I'm not scared
If I'm lost in time- I'm by your side
No longer wandering- I've found my home forever.",Immortal Beloved
Inspection 12,"Been stricken sick. She could be the cure
And I felt quite sure. I opened every door.
It makes me sick; the things I do for you.
The shit that I go through, but I can't make you secure.
For once make it go away.
Give me what I want and I'll be fine.
I need some attention. You can help me clean my wounds.
Gotta lot of sewing up to do.
And I know what it's like when they're twisting your arm.
And it's difficult I'm sure when you don't know who you are.
But they don't own you though they may seem to.
But isn't that what it means when you belong?
Isn't that what you wanted all along?
Hadn't you realized you might be wrong?

",Secure
Inspection 12,"Everyday I look in the mirror and I'm always changing.
Everyday I look in the mirror and I'm never quite the same.
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But words will never hurt me, I'm told.
Well, I'm not so sure I believe all that hype.
I suffer from things that I hear all the time
To tell you a little bit about me.
I'm clearly a fool full of uncertainty.
But I've no intentions of closing my eyes or my ears.
I'll work my way through overcoming my fears.
Time moves on and I do too.
Why waste my time wondering what else there's to do?
Expecting the worst is the best thing I've found.
Good intentions are paving the way.
Don't you remember back in second grade;
All of the attempts they made?
They taught us of the golden rule.
""Please take it with you after school."" They told us.
Now fourteen years later, here among my peers,
It's finally started to make sense to me.
I'm shaping the future, but gradually
Since I've now learned by heart that there are no guarantees.",Everyday
Inspection 12,"I'm someone different now, but those days still live in my dreams
And I've been wondering how we walked away from destiny.
Look in my dirty mirror and my reflection's gone.
I'm broke and livid now but one day I'll be going home..going home.

So just who am I now? I had a fire in my eyes.
I never intended to be assimilated but one day I'll be going home.
Those days were home to my heart.",Home
Inspection 12,"Here. Here I go. One day at a time.
And I know if I keep my head above the water
Then I'll have a chance at swimming back to shore.
Torn, torn in two. 
Twist the knife. 
Strip the screw.
I'll be fine. 
I'll heal in time. 
Convincing myself that,
""It's not a part of me. 
It's not important anymore.
It's just a memory 
And I have long since shut that door.""
Mine, mine for keeps. 
I still feel sick and it's been seven weeks.

I miss your face, I miss the glow.
What's the point in leaving to begin with
When you never let it go, ""It's far away from me.
A distance larger than the pain"",
I try to tell myself, but the more I try to
Scrub away the stain the more I want to be there.

Yet something whispers, ""Look where you've gotten on your own
Thus far, alone and in the dark"".
Nobody knows your name. 
Everything looks the same.
At least I can share my pain.",In the Dark
Inspection 12,"Willing. Waiting. I never knew this was inside of me.
I'm Dreaming. Facing my future now whatever it may be.
I'm on the brink and wide awake.
An open mind. An unknown fate.

I've still got time so I won't fight destiny.
At times I feel like I'm alone, but then I think about my friends.
I know that they're in the same boat and I have sympathy for them.
I know they feel the way I do, not knowing there is to come.

They know I'm feeling that way too and they know that they're not alone.
Nothing to lose.",Nothing to Lose
Inspection 12,"It knows when you are sleeping and it knows when you're awake.
Morals aren't in question. Still, be good for goodness sake.
Just cause you can't see it doesn't mean that its not there.
Fear thickens in the silence as it permeates the air.

No one can be hidden from it. No one can escape.
It watches when you have closed you eyes and gone to sleep.
Crouching in the corner it's invisible and cold.
Don't think it's forgotten you no matter what you're told.",Terrified

Hoy que te vuelvo a encontrar

He pensado en tanto tiempo
Que he perdido, que he perdido

Ya no recuerdo tus caricias
Ni tu cuerpo junto al mío
Ya no recuerdo hoy tus besos mujer

Te tengo que confesar
De lo que pude aclarar
Contigo no fui feliz

Te digo ya no quiero ver

Only get one life so you gotta live it up
(Hey!) If you in the things I'm in
Shorty we can be friends, shorty we can be friends
Right now, I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance

When I go to the dealer you know I cop that (What's that?)
Brand new 'rarri and the roof drop back (The 60)
Came through Harlem like the Rooftop back
Money in the bank man you know don't stop that (Stop that stop that stop that!)
(Oh!) Now we trying to get up in the club
(Oh!) Try to tell me no cause I'm rolling with the thugs
(We got money bitch!) Until I flash a couple of dollars (Yep!)
Tell 'em we only want tables and we buying out the bottles
(Oh!) Y'all know the order
Tell 'em ten Rose's and a few cold waters (Right!)
Only Petron and a couple of lemons (Let's go)
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
We standing on couches, a couple of women (Hey baby)
We was balling hard it was just the ninth inning (Early)
He told shorty we could be friends (Yep)
And your friends could meet with my friends (What else)
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get in the freak way
Shit! We could get in on three way (Oh)
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)
We superstars no Lupe, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stopping at the light

How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mami dancing on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
Oh! Pop champagne!
Oh! Pop champagne!
Oh! We pop champagne!
Oh! We pop champagne!

Baby I wanna see you work (Go) See you dance (Go)
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mami got a body see that damn thing move
It's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby I'll break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you she lyin' but she fake it
When she with me she like it she never fake it

The love the hate the things that separate
Forcing conscious to conscious every small attack
It takes a small man to notice but not to act up
Confrontation complication needs a foundation
I'm calm baby, I'm calm

You were like a cloud
Yes you are a flower you move I love life is all we need
Then you were a lime
Now our love is so sour you move I love life is all we need
So sour?

My achenes all of days, surrenders of a wild side

And I take my turns in stride to speed my feet, away

Come back, come back, breaker one

Makes weak I just went through so much hell
Went through so much, darling
See my deep maker, the ache inside, go away
The patience to climb all day

Eso es lo que siento yo

Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento

De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros

Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto

CreĂ­ que de mis sueĂąos eras la mujer
AprovechĂĄndote de mi querer

DesconfiĂł del amor
Siento que todas me van a hacer lo mismo
Me desquito en la mujer
Que sin culpa me entrega su corazon
Porque no puedo querer
Porque ya no he podido ser yo mismo
Siento que cualquier mujer
No se acerca a mi con buena intenciĂłn
Y he llorado tu amor maldito

Que me mata y sigo vivo
Porque ha muerto toda mi ilusiĂłn
Que habĂ­a en mi corazon
Y he llorado tu amor maldito
Que en infierno se ha convertido
Que le pido y le suplico a dios
Que me tenga algo de compasiĂłn",Amor Maldito [Multimedia Track]

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?

It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

To slip inside denied yet penetrates the eye

Not face the fear that seals more of
My heart sometimes than should

I feel sick and I cannot hide
This torment from my eyes 
And fear will never see it's here inside of me
As much as I believe 
And try to rearrange
But would it ever change
Or just remain the same

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place

Invocation of Nehek,"Is this the day I forget you face?
Or maybe tomorrow when we ride the breeze of steel pins
It's never as easy as I remember
Burn everything that bears my name
And let me drift away from you
Forget those nights of twisted obsessions and bloody tears
And these scars of serial killer lust
It's those words I wrote to you that scream in disbelief
A wayward glance and a forgotten smile
I've seen this paradise die before

Walking between our end and the crashing surf
My regrets disappear with the cherubs
Unbind my hands from razor wire guilt
This drowning man sees what burns behind your eyes
Watch me grow and wither in those dreams of yours
Sleep tight and awaken to my absence
I certainly haven't forgotten your face
And I don't think I ever will",Mona Lisa
Invocation of Nehek,"Take this phrase and bury it beneath you
No more battered faces and forgotten tongues
It seems you've renewed my faith in hate
I'm not as exacting as I once was
I've forgotten what those words meant to me
And your face looks a little dirtier now
Face down in this puddle presents breathing problems
Looks like you're not so righteous now
Just one more minute, that's all I ask
Then you will resurface and wipe away that masquera
A razorblade smile for all those tears
An ear-to-ear grin must have found it's home on you
Porcelain white skin wrapped in bloodstained carpet
Maybe this river will wash away all your demons
Maybe they will stay to hurt you until I come to meet you
Then I will have the chance to do it all over again...

The time is right to kill your fears

Bitter tears taste so sweet
I'm seeing my way
For the first time in years
When the love around
Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one
In one another
Push away those bitter tears
Bitter tears

An I though I was doing no wrong
Push away those bitter tears
That's what they call doing no wrong
That's what they call doing no wrong

Push away those bitter tears [Repeat: x3]

That's what they call doing no wrong",Bitter Tears
INXS,"In the dark of the night
Those small hours
Uncertain and anxious
I need to call you

Rooms full of strangers
Some call me friend
But I wish you were so close to me

In the dark of night
Those small hours
I drift away
When I'm with you

In the dark of night
By my side
In the dark of night
By my side, by my side, by my side
I wish you were
I wish you were

Here comes the clown
His face in a wall
No window
No air at all

In the dark of night
Those faces they haunt me
But I wish you were
So close to me

By my side
By my side
I wish you were
I wish you were
By my side

In the dark of night
Those faces they haunt me
I wish you were so close to me

Yes I wish you were
By my side",By My Side

In this world
All the people
In this world

Gotta tell you
It's alright
Look at the cover
Of a magazine
The pride of a nation
They're down on their knees
I got to tell you
Let the people speak

[Chorus:]
I got to tell you
Yeah you got to have faith
In each other
All you ever
All you ever have for each other

They give us a reason
To go on living
It's all in the choices
That you have to make
I got to tell you
You better make them good

All the people
In this world
All the people
In this whole wide world
I got to tell you

INXS,"So your time has come
Children watch the fools
Don't let anyone tell you
What you must do
Do you like what you see
Or does it make you cry
Use your imagination
And start a fire

[Chorus:]
Hear that sound
There's a voice to be found
Making changes go round
Hear that sound

And my selfish ways
Disappeared one day
With the realization
Of a new way
Images of the free
Coming into view
Our hearts full of promises
Of all we can do

[Chorus]

So your time has come
Children watch the fools
Don't let anyone tell you
What you must do
Do you like what you see
Or does it make you cry
Use your imagination
And start a fire

[Chorus]",Hear That Sound
INXS,"You're driving all over town
In your big car
Windows down
Sweet perfume trails behind
The impression is in my mind
It's crazy how much I ache
for the moments we could make
Your girlfriends they like to talk
Yeah they told me about your boy

[Chorus]
What you do and what you say
Do you know the difference any way

Could I show you what's in store
'Cause I know you'll be wanting more
You're the kind of girl who knows
What you want and where it goes

You got instinct
You got class
Why don't you leave that guy on his ass
Good intensions are not enough
We should join hands and rise above

[Chorus]

It's crazy how much I ache
For the moments we could make
Your girlfriends they like to talk
Yeah they told me about your boy

You're driving all over town
In your big car
Windows down
Sweet perfume trails behind
The impression is on my mind

[Chorus]",Know the Difference
