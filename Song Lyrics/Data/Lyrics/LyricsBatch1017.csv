McKinney's Cotton Pickers,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Mcqueen Street,"I know the teasers, I know the queens
But I need something that is right in between
I like the bitches on the south side
I like those girls cause they can rock
I've heard it time and time again
You play with fire you can never win
Don't you think that I can taste it?
Get down and kick it in

Stick it, you're so right
Don't want no rats in my cellar tonight
Stick it, you're gonna shake
Why don't you stick it, stick it tonight

I'm sick of posers, I'm sick of dweebs
They don't know nothing about what's fueling me
I hate the leeches in the dance clubs
I need a place where I can rock
I've said it time and time again
You start the fire you can always win

And don't you know I'm gonna change it
Look out, I'm coming in

Stick it, you're so right
Don't want no rats in my cellar tonight
Stick it, you're gonna shake
Why don't you stick it, stick it tonight

Sometimes I walk these streets at night
Thinking, I don't know how much more I can take
Sometimes I just want to tell somebody to piss off
I'm not some two faced punk
That gets his kicks out of playing for free
I'm just a genuine product of the working class

Stick it, you're so right
Don't want no rats in my cellar tonight
Stick it, you're gonna shake
Why don't you stick it, stick it tonight",Stick It
Mcqueen Street,"Time waits for nobody
Time waits for nobody
We all must plan our hopes together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody
We might as well be deaf and dumb and blind
I know that sounds unkind
But it seems to me we've not listened to
Or spoken about it at all
The fact that time is running out for us all
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no-one
We've got to build this world together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Because time - it waits for nobody
You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong (gone wrong gone wrong)
You know what's going on
But it seems to me we've not cared enough
Or confided in each other at all (confided in each other at all)
It seems that we've all got our backs against the wall
(Time) Time waits for nobody
(Time) waits for no-one
We've got to trust in one another
Or there'll be no more future at all
(Time)
Yeah - Time waits for nobody
No no - Time don't wait for no-one
Let's learn to be friends with one another
Or there'll be no more future at all
Time (time) time (time) waits for nobody waits for nobody
Time time time time waits for nobody at all
Time waits for nobody - yeah
Time don't wait - waits for no-one
Let us free this world for ever
And build a brand new future for us all
Time waits for nobody nobody nobody
For no-one",Time
Mcqueen Street,"Wide awake in your bed
Heart's beating music in my head
You took the bounty, I kissed the sky
Holy water's got me running wild
Seven days and forty nights
City rats, snake eyes
You know I'm out there with a losing hand
They're gonna take me to some foreign land

Such a strange place inside my head
Makes it hard to breathe when I find
Somebody's playing doctor with my mind

When I feel you dreaming
Two worlds in which we live in
Rolls me, stones me
And tears me up inside
They got me walking the wire

Mother did you call my name

I heard a voice driving me insane
I kick the walls and I never sleep
Been reaching in way to deep
You say it's high time in your pick up line
You count the numbers and you're right on time
I'm out alone with the lines in my face
My Judge and Jury was the human race

Such a strange place inside my head
Makes it hard to breathe when I find
Somebody's playing doctor with my mind

When I feel you dreaming
Two worlds in which we live in
Rolls me, stones me
And tears me up inside
They got me walking the wire
And I'm coming your way",Two Worlds
Mcqueen Street,"It's getting late and I wanna go
But there's a price to pay for going to the devil's show
And when the clock strikes three smoke fills the air
You'll see the curtains rise and baby I'm there
I'm a knock-down, drag out, son of a bitch
Just a hell raising mother with a burning itch

I think about you when I'm in the mood

And when they shout my name I wanna move
Just get out of my way, here comes the wrecking crew
I'm gonna bump and shake
I've got the rhythm and blues
So when I come to town start spreading the news

I think about you when I'm in the mood
Oh Lord, shake it down

It's getting late and I wanna go
But there's a price to pay for going to the devil's show
And when the clock strikes three smoke fills the air
You'll see the curtains rise and baby I'm there
I'm a knock-down, drag out, son of a bitch
Just a hell raising mother with a burning itch

I think about you when I'm in the mood",When I'm in the Mood
McTavish,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
MD.45,"From the dust of which I came
To dust I return again
From my mother I am torn
With my brothers off the war
We escape before the dawn
Try to outrun the sun
Take my own life in my hands
Fearing God but never man

Take my ancient hand, look me in the eye
Looking past the lines soon you'll see as I
You are young if you want you could be old if you try
I can show you how to live but you can't show me how to die

As the sun stalks the sky
I am not afraid to die
My ear upon the ground
For the ironhorse's sound
Encircle glowing rocks
One by one each chieftain talks
Tales of yore and bravest deeds
Coveting their warrior creed

My hands will bridge the distance of beginning to the end
The time for learning ceases it was all wasted and spent
From witch doctor to shaman, Kachina doll to chief
The spirit knows what ails you, you beg for its relief
All that I know, all that I say, my heart beats and my pulse drums
Out tribal rhythms pounding through the sky",The Creed
MD.45,"Maybe you might have heard
But no one spoke a word
The day the planet cried
The day the music died

Each day another dream
Killed by the music scene
All access was denied
The day the music died

We paid for everything
But back not a single thing
Our talents were all sucked dry
The day the music died

We saw it on T.V.
In all the magazines
We thought the news had lied
The day the music died

This is make believe
This is not for real
This won't last forever
This won't last at all

Eliminate the scene
It's illegal now to sing
Outlaws ask the reasons why
The day the music died

Now imprisoned for my craft
I smile and have to laugh
In my head the music's still alive
The day the music died

As all our hopes were dashed
Seems that all our throats were slashed
How could all our songs survive
The day the music died

Greedy fat bureaucrats
Care only for sales and stats
Woke up with dollar signs in their eyes
The day the music died",Day the Music Died
MD.45,"Don't want to talk about it
Don't want to read about it
Don't want to hear about it
Don't want to see about it

Something's funny about a medical physician
Me lying on my back is his favorite position
Designer behavior with paxil, and valium
Even you can stomach prozac and lithium

Remember ""Ozzie And Harriet""?
Remember ""The Stepford Wives""?
Remember ""Father Knows Best""?
Remember ""I Love Lucy""?

A product of design
Back to the drawing board
Gotta be insane to fit in

You take apart my brain
But you couldn't make the pieces fit
Then give me happy pills
There's pieces left you idiot",Designer Behavior
MD.45,"Fight, something's different
Hate, something's different
Fight, something's different
Hate, something's gotta change

I guess hate is dead or
At least that's what I read
Can't we all get along, well
We do now the newspapers says
It's great to be here today
Now that hate's gone away
We'll all be feeling great
Now that we've conquered hate
Somebody said, and I quote,
""I hear that's what they said"" Yeah

Hate's made obsolete
By man's superior intellect
Animals don't hate
They're too smart, deserve more respect
Hate's no longer cool
And it's time for a new dawn
And we've done our part
With this anti-hate song
Fine, from now on
We're no longer afflicted with hate

Hate messed with the best, and died like the rest
Hate don't walk, it crawls, hate's got no balls
Hatred is dead, it's screamed, kicked, and bled
Hate lost the war, hate's days are over
Hate burned its flag, hate's bound and gagged
Hate race is run, stick a fork in hate's done
Hate disappears, ain't heard hate in years
Hate's got no place in the U.S. of A.",Fight Hate
MD.45,"Freedom, justice, power of reason
Peace, opportunity, compassion, equal equality

These are the things we need
The same stars shine on everyone
We're blessed, we agree, we receive
We'll live in peace till our hearts bleed

Homeland, good friends, people who make amends
We spend gainful days, The profit is ours to save",Hearts Will Bleed
MD.45,"An old man cuts his face
But not because the razor's dull
It's from his hands shaking
From the lack of what he's taking
Not like an old man's memories
His wrongs are still and forever

Hoping mistakes will fade with the sun
But no surprise, they never do
Hoping mistakes will fade with the sun
They never do at Hell's Motel

Lord, please spread my wings
I want to fly away
I don't want to die on the vine
Lord, please smile on me
I don't want to live forever
But I don't want to die on the vine

Never talks about the past
How he could hold a scalpel
Mighty hippocratic oath
How he sold himself for naught
He lived when they lived
And he died when they died, too

Accepting the new sacred calf of the pagans
As we all die on the vine
Accepting the new sacred calf of the pagans
That's life in Hell's Motel

Oh Lord, please spread my wings
I want to fly away
But I don't want to die on the vine
Oh Lord, won't you smile on me
I don't want to live forever
I just don't want to die on the vine

And tonight he'll close his eyes
Hoping the sun will rise again
And all will be forgiven
And this was all just a dream
But the walls to the motel are thin
And next door someone's getting beaten

Tears for the unknown are seeds that are sown
And we're all on the run
Tears for the unknown are seeds that are sown

I'm the demon, as you can see
I'm the demon, for you are free

Just a taste is all you need
You'll feel better with help from me
Hungry for your brain to ease
If you don't take it you go crazy

You give up, and you'll be ruled

Sores on my tongue, sores on my feet

I dreamed last night No more cops
It felt alright No more cops
No need to fight No more cops

'Cause no one needs to steal
Everyone gets a meal
If it was only real
We'd need no more cops

I dreamed last night no police
An army-less world doomed to peace
And now as all my dreaming stops
I see it clear, we need no more cops

No need to fear
I'd want to cheer
And I wish you were here
Before my slumber stops

It seems to me
That if we're really free
We need no more cops

No Holy War No more God
No more rent No more deeds
No more money No more greed
No more hate No more fear

No one unhappy No one sad
No one ripped off No one mad
But I awake Here instead
I wish I had Stayed in bed

I'd stay asleep in the deep
And in my thoughts I'd keep
No more cops

When life gets mean
Share in the dream
Until you scream - no more cops
I dreamed late last night

No more cops
No more cops
No more cops

MDC,"I remember a funny man who used to make us laugh
But the proof of his truth, they cut his life in half
A caustic wit that cut a bit, opinions were too strong
He must have rubbed somebody wrong
Cause he's long time gone

I remember a crucial man, played strat' with his left hand
Tunes he chose of ""Gold and Roe"" and ""Castles Made of Sand""
Social ills, hi conscience willed a different type of song
Sang about ""lead"", click, bang! He's dead, he's long time gone

I remember an ebony prince who taught his brothers pride
Said the black man's loss, just another cross on which another prophet has died
Some people wanted them leaderless, a race of hungry pawns
Their solution to his revolution: To make him long time gone

Though some will object when you suspect
That they cause to affect the cause and effect
When you reflect on lives that were checked
Still in retrospect the truth was neglected
Though some will protect the order they pecked
For failing to suspect the cleansing effect
Till you they reject with a Haitian insect
With AIDS they infect by a bite on the neck
Like the Nazi correct, kill and dissect
""The inferior Sect"", their race to protect

I remember a gentleman who took his cause o far
Said not to be afraid but to parade and be just what you are
Defied the name of guilt and shame, he proved his skeptics wrong
Must have said something wrong, 'cause now he's long time gone",Long Time Gone
MDC,"They say the darkest hour is just before the dawn
In chess, without exception, white moves the first pawn
They called it ""Black Tuesday"" when the stock market crashed
A fix in 1919 turned the White Sox to Black
Black balled, black magic, executioner's hood
White hatted, white horsed, champion of good
Black knight of Dark Ages on the darkest night
The Pope walks in truth, head to toe in white

[Chorus]
Who started all this bullshit - were they looking for a fight?
You didn't have to be there to know that they were white
But when you're talking skin tone, let's not fuck around
Cause no one's really black or white, we're all just shades of brown

Black hearted, black beard on the briney deep
Or the family outcast you call the black sheep
Days of black plague - draw your final breath
Heading for heaven white dying of Black Death

Mankind is preoccupied to keep each other down
Some use superstition, a Bible or a crown
At best it's fear and ignorance, at worst, it's a sin
Not God and country, king or crown, it's the pigment of our skin
Used to reinforce what's wrong or right
It's really just the presence or absence of light
In the blackest hour of the blackest day
It isn't mighty white of us, but we gotta say

[Chorus]

White when your marry, black when you die
A racial hierarchy, a festering white lie
White stands for ignorance, pure and sincere
But if you're talking bigotry it should be crystal clear
The new world beckoned, the immigrants came
Homogenized their culture, anglicized their names
Then they painted Jesus, blond with eyes of blue
Not a Nazarene, more a nazi than a Jew
In the black revolution with their Black Power found
Till their leaders were all jailed or stomped into the ground
And the final step ironic to nail that coffin tight
The powder of enslavement in their glassine bags of white",Shades of Brown
MDC,"I remember when I first went to school
They said, Don't be a joker, don't be a fool
Pledge your allegiance to the red, white and blue
Don't expect your country to do nothin' for you
They said your forefathers loved you
but I only had one
And I watched him die in the heat of the sun
Suckin' up the bullets of a policeman's gun
There was nothin' I could do but stay away

In the U.S.A. you gotta take your chances
If you plan on stayin' free
They call this the land of the living 
But they're trying to make a dead man out of me

I remember when I first hit the road
I was runnin' from the lenders of the money I owed
Came to Austin, heard a knock at my door
Crossed another border and I'm runnin' some more
They say they're gonna get me but it ain't happened yet
Burnin' my fingers on my last cigarette
It's time to remember time to forget
Nothin' I could do but get away

I remember all the stories I heard
How a man's supposed to be 'bout as free as a bird
My brother's in prison, my father's dead
Me, I'm tired of living with a price on my head
I wonder if there's a place to be
In the whole wide country for a fella like me

Tenías tu razón, yo no estaba feliz
Pero es que yo extrañé momentos junto a ti
Why con sus besos yo, yo te sentia en mi

Ahora estoy aqui sin tu amor, sin control
Why solo por mi error, ya lo vez
Why no aguanto más

Of the noises behind the walls
They know the secrets behind her shame

Should've never let go

Now I see a family where there once was none, now we've just begun, 
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun. 

Even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey, 
Everything will bring a chain of love. 
In the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes, 
Tell me everything is gonna be alright

Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup, come on and drink it up, 
Love her and she'll bring you luck. 
And if you find she helps your mind, better take her home, 
Don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own.

Even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey, 
Everything will bring a chain of love.

That was written long ago
'Bout a kingdom on a mountain
And the valley-folk below

On the mountain was a treasure
Buried deep beneath the stone
And the valley-people swore
They'd have it for their very own

Go ahead and hate your neighbor
Go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven
You can justify it in the end
There won't be any trumpets blowing
Come the judgment day
On the bloody morning after
One tin soldier rides away

So the people of the valley
Sent a message up the hill
Asking for the buried treasure
Tons of gold for which they'd kill

It came an answer from the mountain
With our brothers we will share
All the secrets of our mountain
All the riches buried there

Go ahead and hate your neighbor
Go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven
You can justify it in the end
There won't be any trumpets blowing
Come the judgment day
On the bloody morning after
One tin soldier rides away

Now the valley cried with anger
""Mount your horses! Draw your sword!""
And they killed the mountain-people
So they won their just reward

Now they stood beside the treasure
On the mountain, dark and red
Turned the stone and looked beneath it
""Peace on Earth"" was all it said

Go ahead and hate your neighbor
Go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven
You can justify it in the end

Before me frozen here on the ladder of my life 

Too late to save myself from falling 
I took a chance and changed your way of life 
But you misread my meaning when I met you 
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life 
To wander free 

But losing everything 
Is like the sun going down on me 

I can't find 
The right romantic line 
But see me once 
And see the way I feel 
Don't discard me 
Just because you think I mean you harm 
But these cuts I have 
They need love to help them real

Soon turned out had a heart of glass

Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind

Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces

Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.

I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I can finally make it home
All alone
While she lays dreaming
I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says ""how was your night?""
And I come to her and say ""it was all right""
And I hold her tight

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world with my little songs
I was wrong

While she lays waiting
I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend
And there's no end
While she lays crying
I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through

Me First and the Gimme Gimmes,"Well, I woke up Sunday mornin'
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
An' I washed my face and combed my hair
Stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kickin'

And I walked across the street
An' caught the Sunday smell of someone's fried chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way

On the Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishin', Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone

And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks
And Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped behind a Sunday school
And listened to the songs that they were singin'

I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishin', Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone

And there's nothin' short of dyin'

On the sleepin' city sidewalks
And Sunday morning coming down

Remember back in the day
When everyone was black and conscious
And down for the struggle
Love brought us all together
Just sittin' back and talkin'
Cultivating a positive vibe
Blue lights in the basement
Freedom was at hand 
And you could just taste it
Everything was cool 
Diggin' on me diggin' on you
Everything was cool 
And brothers were singing
""Ain't no woman like the one I got""

I'm diggin' you
I dig you like an old soul record
Just sit back 
Relax
Listen to the 8-track
I'll dig you like an old soul record

Now brothers (be) base-in
Running from the beat-down cops that be chasin'
Running out of time
Running out of patience
In this war of the conscious mind
I need some black-on-black loveÂ 
A slow grind for these changin' times 
(the booty-slammin' part!)Â  

Beautiful brown bodies 
Pimp, switch and sway
To the soulful sounds
Gotta get up gotta get down
â??Cause you give me good feeling
You give me good feeling 
Yes you do

I'm diggin' you
I dig you like an old soul record
Just sit back
Relax

Just waiting.
Anticipating a chance to run into you.
I sit here for hours.
One day I even sat through a rain shower.
For just a glance.
A chance to talk to you.
You're probably wondering how I even know you.
For now you're just my dream.
And when I wake up I hope you talk to me.
Here I sit outside your door.
Talk to me.
I'd be content to just sit here and talk to you.

The way you eat your cereal
So cute reading Shakespeare in your birthday suit
Just a hopeless romantic.
Hopelessly in love with you

I want to hold your hand take you to a picture show.
I want to hold your hand.

In my script there's a love scene. Just picture it.
Candles and warm apple cider.
Sly Stone on the radio.
Caress your funky dreads in the candle glow.

Whisper in my ear.

Just to share in one day
Of my mother's desired happiness

Sometimes when night fell
I'd close my eyes
And I'd hide
Close your eyes
When they would yell and scream
When my father would paint her
With a dark face
Of being belittled, disrespected
And set aside
His liquor, the salve
For the unseen wounds

I learned so much from him
What did I learn?
How to hurt all of those

I was warmed amidst the gaze of your eyes, our minds wounded

But to deny yourself the pleasure of that pain is to love selfishly

Your heart lay captive in a cage fashioned by your fears not knowing what to say
You have many lovers and yet I alone love you far beyond any lily white fairy tale

Maybe Judas was the better man and Mary made a virgin just to save face
I too am so ashamed on bended knees

Brother John Paul convinced himself of his wisdom to judge to forgive to condemn
Mother Mary full of grace I'm so confused by her pale white face

Another sign would be nakedness
That people would begin to remove their clothes
And he said until it would get to the point where
People would actually walk around in the marketplaces in shorts
With their thighs fully exposed

Um, he said also that people would have sexual intercourse
In front of other people, was a sign of the end of times
Another one would be speed in travel
He said great distances would be traversed in very short times
And he said people would hop between the clouds and the earth

Meat Beat Manifesto,"This beat that the devil today...
Has nurtured and fostered...
Is inspired by the powers of hell!
And there are young people that are in these rock groups that are
pulling off their clothes in full view of thousands of young people.
There asks the question when police dare not step in with the air thick
with marijuana smoke, a hundred thousand kids! The huge speakers that
beat off the music as dope-filled entertainers and performers beat upon
the guitars and drums and the strings. Those young people that ripped
off their clothes and acted like animals...
They said it's the music
It's the music!
They said it's the music

I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car

I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love

Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do
But a girl - she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew
Baby baby, baby baby - chorus
You got the kind of legs that do more than walk

I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk
Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see
You got a lotta nerve to come on to me
You got the kind of lips that do more than drink
You got the kind of mind that does less than think

But since I'm feeling kinda lonely and my defenses are low
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action
Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point

What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet.

When it's cold I want it hot, I've always wanted what it not.
But when it comes to loving you, I'm yours no matter what you do.

Meat Loaf,"Everything is permitted, everything is allowed
And all our gods we have outwitted
We are running with the crowd
And all the clocks are showing zero
And all our parents must have fled
And we just never had no heroes
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead
Everything is permitted, there is nothing out of bounds
There are no limits or no fences
There is always some way 'round
And all the compass points are zero
And all the navigators fled
And we just never had no heroes
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead

If everything is permitted, if nothing ever is taboo
Then there is always something shattered
When there is something breaking through

Meat Loaf,"From the minute I turned and laid my eyes on you, I had no eyes of my own
I was blind to the world, you were too good to be true
But you were something to see, so very young and alone
And I still don't believe the way you turned on me
Now where's the girl that I knew?
I gave you somewhere to live and then somebody to love
You gave me nothing but trouble, man, I've been such a fool

You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you

How do you abuse me, let me count the ways
How many hours in how many days
How does it amuse you, let me count the pain
How many rules breaking how many games

[Chorus]
How do you abuse me, let me count the ways
How many hours in how many days
How does it amuse you, let me count the pain
How many rules breaking how many games

You got your ass out of gear and your soul out of whack
Go on and take all your stuff, don't even bother to pack
In every way I want you out of my life
But I'll kill you if you don't come back, I'll kill you if you don't come back

In the pit of the night you used to pull me so close
And then you'd hold me so tight
And in the wink of an eye you used to give me it all
And with a kiss in the darkness you'd deliver the light

And in the pit of the night I hear you laughing so loud
I know you're laughing at me
Oh ain't it funny and sad the way I fell for your lies
The way I fell into love and then I begged to be free

You gave me nothing at all, now let me give it to you
You taught me how to be cruel, now let me try it on you

Somebody bless all the girls in the sand on the beach
They're dreamin' of boys and staying just out of reach
Bless all the cheerleaders down on the track

They're looking for danger and they're holding their piece
Bless all the girls staying late after school
They're playing with fire and oh they're playing it cool

And bless all the shy girls who're learning to dance
They stare in the mirror and they conjure romance
Bless all the girls who are always alone
They kneel down in prayer and they wait up by the phone

Bless all the homecoming queens of the night
They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights
And bless all the girls who know what love is about
They try not to cry and then they try to put out

And bless all the homecoming queens of the night
They're looking for magic in gymnasium lights
And bless all the girls who know what love is about

But damn you and curse you after all that you've done
You're the one girl I'll never forget

Meat Loaf,"From the very first moment I saw you, I knew our love would be so strong
And the very first moment I kissed you, I knew our joy would last so long
And then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to say
I saw you making love to my best friend
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy

[Chorus:]

Won't you take some more, it's what you came for
And don't mind me, I won't throw you no curves
Have yourself a ball with my good woman
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve

When I saw you hanging round the truck stop, shining like an angel in the night
And when I saw you crying like a baby, I knew you'd have to be my wife

Then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to say
I saw you making love to my best friend
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy

Now I think I'm gonna have to leave you
Because I'm feeling much too weak to share
And the pie, oh it's cut in too many pieces
The flavor that I crave is no longer there

Then I saw you making love to two of my best friends
I didn't know whatever to say
I saw you making love to a group of my best friends
So I looked them right in their eyes and I said - listen here, group

Won't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve",More Than You Deserve
Meat Loaf,"Every day of my life they say the same old thing
Hey boy! Oh boy, you better wait for your turn
And every day of my life I get the same old line
Hey boy! Oh boy, when are you going to learn
I want to go on the red, I want to go on the green
I want to go on all colors that I see in between
I want to run all the tolls, I want to run all the signs
I want to run all the way across a double white line

But every day of my life I see the same old road
Hey girl! Oh girl, we gotta pull up our routes
And every day of my life I see the same old dream
Hey girl! Oh girl, I need a dream I can use

I want to go on the red, I want to go on the green
I want to go on all colors that I see in between
I want to run all the tolls, I want to run all the signs

My body is the car and my soul is the ignition
Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we

[Chorus:]
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! We're sick and tired of waiting in line
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! Nobody's taking our time

Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!

Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime

And every night of my life there's something holding me back
Hey girl - what is it boy - oh girl, I know it's time to cut loose
And every night of my life I dream of someone like you
Hey girl - what is it boy - oh girl, you got a dream I can use

Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind

My body is the car and my soul is the ignition
Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we -

Meat Loaf,"I still dream of you wakin' up, openin' your eyes
Like a little girl I once knew
Walkin' to the window, lookin' down on the street
You walk with me, and I walk with you

Well I thought it all over, it doesn't make any sense
Why did it fall apart, when it seemed so innocent?
You and I were like a light from a fallen star
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart

[Chorus]
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I fall all over again
And I just can't hold on to your love anymore
Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I start all over again
And it just can't be, like it was once before

Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel
You and I were like a light from a fallen star
You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart

Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel
(No, I never could turn away from you)

[Chorus]",Don't You Look at Me Like That
Meat Loaf,"I took one look and something snapped inside,
I said I love your eyes
You took my heart, you took my breath away,
I felt my temperature rise
You said you've never loved a man this way
That it was heaven you were here to stay

[Chorus]
And now you're just another fallen angel
And I hope that the fall didn't do you no harm
And now you're just another fallen angel
Falling into somebody else's arms

I took one look and I was paralyzed and was in paradise
I must admit that when I first laid eyes,
you had me hypnotized
You said I'm sorry but I don't say much
And I'm in heaven when I feel your touch

[Chorus]

Follow your own road baby, I'll be there when you need me
To love and to comfort you
And what he got ain't enough to keep you in the air
I'll be there

You said you've never loved a man this way
That it was heaven you were here to stay

Meat Loaf,"You say you're all alone,
And after all the changes you've been through today
You can use a little tenderness, right now

OK, I've been alone,
And I can understand the way you feel tonight
Maybe together we can charge it all right now

I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes
You need somebody you can hold onto

If you really want to, I'd love to hold you
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto

You say, he broke your heart,
He left you crying, but he did not set you free
And now you feel like you can never love again

OK, so let me know,
It's up to you how long you let his memory stay
And do you really want to carry on this way

I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes
You need somebody you can hold onto

If you really want to, I'd love to hold you
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto

If you really want to, if you really want to,
Then I really can't deny you

So many things you need to know, so many left to say
But you mean more than words I know,
I can help you chase the pain away

I can tell by the look in your tear-filled eyes
You need somebody you can hold onto

If you really want to, if you really want to
If you really want to, then I'd love to be the body that you hold onto

Meat Loaf,"Another New York waltz at four a.m.,
In the canyons lost at night
The city's just a jail for me, full of high rise prison walls
And I'm riding through this darkness,
'cause I know there's life within
And I'm searching through the shadows,
Just to find that light again

Keep driving (keep driving),
Let the meter run
Keep driving (keep driving),
Oh the night's not really done

Keep driving

And I'm hanging on a memory, and I feel it in the air
I'm a prisoner of these lonely streets,
But I know I'll find you there
And oh Lord, you look so pretty,
But you can see it in my eyes
And just before my tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside
It seems so real until the light turns green

Don't wake me up, don't ruin this dream, don't take me from my scene

Keep driving, keep driving,
Keep driving, keep driving,
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone

They don't tell you when the music stops,
Or how the movie ends
Is it too late once the feeling's gone,
To back it up and start it all again?

Oh Lord you look so pretty,
And you can see it in my eyes
And just before that tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside

(Keep driving) keep driving, driving

I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone

Meat Loaf,"You like ridin' around with your big brother, in your uncle's custom van
You want to bleach your hair so bad, but your mama don't understand
Hangin' around by the monument, dancin' to the radio
You got a memory even shorter than your dress
But there's nothin' that you don't know

Priscilla, Priscilla, nearly sixteen but they treat you like a kid
Priscilla, Priscilla, they're gonna kill ya for what you did

Cuttin' class with a backstage pass, and always skippin' lunch
Ya put your hand on the knees of the boys, and daddy's vodka in the punch
Learned how to jump start your grandma's car, how to French inhale your Kools
And now you know that breakin' hearts is easy as breakin' the rules

[Chorus]

You don't remember no revolution, you don't belong to no baby boom

Just you and your headphones, dreamin' in your pink bedroom

Strong girls break the records, and rich girls break their nails

Smart girls always know by heart, what some girls always fail

Bad little girls grow up to be good, and good girls finish last

But crazy girls don't care how they grow up, as long as they grow up fast

Meat Loaf,"I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California on my mind
I straddled that greyhound and rode him into Raleigh, and on across Caroline
I had motor trouble that turned into a struggle, halfway across Alabama
And that 'Hound broke down and left me all stranded in Downtown Birmingham

Right away I bought me a through train ticket, ridin' across Mississippi clean
And I was on the Midnight Flyer out of Birmingham, smokin' into New Orleans

Somebody helped me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston Town
There are people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let a poor boy down

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit, they put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land

Workin' on a T-bone steak, I had a party flyin' over to the Golden State
When the pilot told me in thirteen minutes
He would get us at the Terminal zone

Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the Terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings, and let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia, Tidewater 41009
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line

Swing low, chariot, come down easy, taxi to the Terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings, and let me make it to the telephone

And the poor boy's on the line

And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'
And their big boy's on the line",The Promised Land
Meat Loaf,"Two a.m. with the lost and the lonely
Walkin' past the kids, comin' back from the party
Smiles on their faces, you remember so well how it was
Nights in the back of that Buick that you got runnin'
Your baby by your side, told the whole world you're comin'


[Chorus]
Work so hard to do what is right
Believed in what you're doin',
But so many fights
Trusted too many, believed too much,
Workin' your life to the bone

There's a wolf at your door,
He wants your money, wants your soul
A wolf at your door, you give it all, he wants more
There's a wolf at your door,
He says he's playin' for keeps
Breathin' down your neck, boy
It's sure hard to sleep

With a wolf at your door

They'll take it away, when you're not lookin'
Look you in the eyes, tell you how good they're doin'
Smiles on their faces, are lies to keep you from knowin'
You're not guilty, you are the victim,
But you still pay for the crime
Don't look for trouble, it'll always find you in time

Work so hard to do what is right
Believed in what you're doin',
But so many fights
Trusted too many, relieved too much,
Workin' your life to the bone

There's a wolf at your door,
He says he's playin' for keeps
Breathin' down your neck, boy
It's sure hard to sleep

With a wolf at your door

It won't be broken, I'll fight 'til I drop,
Blood burnin' hot in my veins

But they won't be satisfied until they take everything

Never can be too sure about the girl

You know about the truth
You can see it in her eyes
One thing you know about love
It'll cut you down to size

You hear what they tell you
Do you do what you're told
And if they say yes 
Does it mean it's really so?

You're ready for the thrill tonight
You think you'll take it slow
But she's forgotten more, boy
Then you will ever know

She calls you up in the middle of the night
She says she's lonesome and alone
You're all revved up, finally some place to go
You knock on that door

She's like a dreamer in a dungeon, or an angel in a cave

And I'll be closer to you now than any other boy
And you know that what I'm saying is true
You're gonna break her up, and tear her down, and fade her away

I'm gonna love her for both of us

When the screws are tightenin', and the tears are falling
I can hear her crying out to be saved
And like a bolt of lightning, I go answer the call
But she's singing like a siren to me over the waves

I never wanted to take away your lover
Until I heard her crying out to be saved
I always thought of you as one of my brothers
But she's singing like a siren to me over the waves
Singing like a siren to me over the waves
There ain't no holding me down!

How you been, feelin' better?
Never lookin', but you're hearin',
Never speakin', but you're feeling

You're not healing, just concealing

Meat Loaf,"I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say
I thought I'd leave you with a letter or firey speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank

[Chorus: x2]
If I could find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight
c'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep

I've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up to a scream
We let the past slip away, and put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream

And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know why you faded and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks, and everything's blank

It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
It's there in my eyes and it's all I can say, c'mon and read 'em and weep

Read 'em and weep, for all the hours we'll be spending alone
Read 'em and weep, for the dreams we'll ignore
Running silent and deep,
And all those promises we promised to keep, they won't be kept anymore

Read 'em and weep, for the magic that our bodies had made
Read 'em and weep, for the blood that we lost
Running silent and deep, and all the secrets that we somehow betrayed
For whatever the cost

Read 'em and weep, for the memories still alive in the bed
Read 'em and weep, for the lies we believed
Running silent and deep, and all the things that can never be said

Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep
c'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep
It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
It's here in my eyes and it's all I can say

Meat Loaf,"On a hot summer night
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
Will he offer me his mouth?

Yes

Will he offer me his teeth?

Yes

Will he offer me his jaws?

Yes

Will he offer me his hunger?

Yes

Again, will he offer me his hunger?

Yes!

And will he starve without me?

Yes!

And does he love me?

Yes

Yes

On a hot summer night
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?

Yes

I bet you to say that to all the boys.

It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning
There was fog crawling over the sand
And when I listened to your heart I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars, falling through your trembling hands

While you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining
And I was dying just to ask for a taste
Oh we were lying together in a silver lining
By the light of the moon you know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste

Oh will you hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
But my soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

(Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want
Oh the night is young and ain't no-one gonna know where you
No-one gonna know where you
No-one's gonna know where you've been.
You were licking your lips and your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon,
You know there's not another moment to waste

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you

(Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

(Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing)

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
You took the words right out of my mouth oh
You took the words right out of my mouth
Whoa it must have been while you were kissing me

You took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me

And all of my dreams go under like the fallin' rain

Twisting and turning my senses like a cyclone at sea

Standin' there with bibles clutched in their hand

Meat Loaf,"The sirens are screaming, and the fires are howling
Way down in the valley tonight.
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
And a blade shining oh so bright.
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky,
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets.
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat.

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

[Chorus]
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone, gone, gone.
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done
and the sun goes down
and the moonlight's shining through.
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light.
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole,
And everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls,
And nothings ever worth the cost.

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I want to be damned with you.
If I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night with you/
Well if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned,
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night with you

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

[Chorus]

Well I can see myself tearing up the road
Faster than any other boy has ever gone.
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe,
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape.
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.

Then I'm down in the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun,
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike,
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart, still beating,
Breaking out of my body and flying away
Like a bat out of hell.

Turning it on now, he's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for
Second; the ball is bobbled out in center, and here comes the
Throw, and what a throw! He's gonna slide in head first, here he
Comes, he's out! No, wait, safe-safe at second base, this kid
Really makes things happen out there. Batter steps up to the
Plate, here's the pitch-he's going, and what a jump he's got,
He's trying for third, here's the throw, it's in the dirt-safe at
Third! Holy cow, stolen base! He's taking a pretty big lead out
There, almost daring him to try and pick him off. The pitcher
Glances over, winds up, and it's bunted, bunted down the third
Base line, the suicide squeeze is on! Here he comes, squeeze
Play, it's gonna be close, here's the throw,
Here's the play at the plate holy cow,
I think he's gonna make it!

And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time,
So I can end my time with you!!

I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here

And maybe you can cry all night
But that will never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here

I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way
I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby
In a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding
At the bottom of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie
I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able to give you something
Something that I just haven't got

There's only one girl that I have ever loved
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back, ooh I know
I remember how she left me on a stormy night
She kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her
Not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way
I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad

They say I gotta face the truth
That I'm just another case of arrested development
I'm just another wasted youth

They say I'm wild and I'm reckless
I should be acting my age
I'm an impressionable child
In a tumultuous world
And they say I'm at a difficult stage

But it seems to me to the contrary
Of all the crap they're gonna put on the page

And I gotta wonder what it means

Maybe it's just one of those bugs going round
Maybe I'm under a spell and it's magic
Maybe there's a witch doctor with an office in town

Is this a blessing? Or is it a curse?

Meat Loaf,"The sirens are screaming, and the fires are howling
Way down in the valley tonight.
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye 
And a blade shining oh so bright.
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky,
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets.
And down in the tunnels where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat.

Oh, baby you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

[Chorus]
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over, like a bat out of hell, I'll be gone, gone, gone.
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done
And the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through.
Then like a sinner before the gates of Heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver-black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot, and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light.
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole,
And everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks, and nothing really rolls,
And nothing's ever worth the cost.

Well I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I want to be damned with you.
If I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night with you/
Well if I gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned,
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I want to be damned
Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night,
Dancing through the night with you

That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light,
But I gotta get out, I gotta break out now
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know,
We'll both be so alone.

[Chorus]

Well I can see myself tearing up the road
Faster than any other boy has ever gone.
And my skin is raw, but my soul is ripe,
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape.
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.

Then I'm down in the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun,
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike,
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart, still beating,
Breaking out of my body and flying away
Like a bat out of hell.

Meat Loaf,"I was lost till you were found
But I never knew how far down
I was falling
Before I reached the bottom
I was cold and you were fire
And I never knew how the pyre 
Could be burning 
On the edge of the ice field

And the now chilly California wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand

And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you hear me crying:
""Oh Babe, don't go""
And don't you hear me screaming:
""How was I to know?""

Near the end of the line

And take me to another land where I don't have to stay

And I'm gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through

You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you

And I never knew how enslaved

In the chains of my master

And my oh my 
For that I thank you

For taking in the sun when I'm feeling so cold
For giving me a child when my body is old
And don't you know 
For that I need you

For coming to my room when you know I'm alone
For finding me a highway and driving me home
And you gotta know 
For that I serve you

For revving me up when I'm starting to stall

",Back into Hell
Meat Loaf,"The skys were pure and the fields were green
And the sun was brighter than it's ever been
When I grew up with my best friend, Kenny
We were close as any brothers that you ever knew

It was always summer and the future called
We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all
And there was so much left to dream
And so much time to make it real

But I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone
They say he crashed and burned, I swear I'll never learn
Why any boy should die so young

We were racing, we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now, and he's gaining ground

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
They are

And when the sun descended and the night arose
I heard my father cursing everyone he knows
He was dangerous and druk and defeated
And corroded by failure and envy and hate

There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze
No where to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank as he hit me again and again and again

I know I still believe he'd never let me leave, I had to run away alone
So many threats and fears, so many wasted years
Before my life became my own

And though the nightmares should be over
Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly, coarse, and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind, and then he pulls me back

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
They are

There was a beauty living on the edge of town
She always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love

The stare would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said
Caution, kids at play

Those were the rites of spring and we did everything
There was salvation every night
We got dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right

She used her body just like a bandage
She use my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared
But I can see rising up out of the back seat now
Just like an angel rising out of a tomb

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rearview mirror may appear closer than they are

She used her body just like a bandage
She used my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared

Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right
Livin' for the right to be free

As the world looked down, they raided our senses, there can be no reconcile

Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down

There was a time in our life was taken for granted, it'll never come again

Meat Loaf,"Under your protective wing I walked into the night
And a thousand angry demons up and took flight
And I went running through the fields with the fever in my veins
And the rain came crashing down and tried to clear my name
Above my head, all in red, I could see you bearing down on me
You said you're not running out, no you're leaving now
I will find you, there is no way out
I'll keep tracking you down in the still of this night
Forever, mine forever

[Chorus]
Don't leave your mark on me, I have to reply
I'm not staying, no, and I'm not just killing time
Don't leave your mark on me, I have to reply, I'm not staying, no
I'm not staying, no

Mistress of the darkness, accomplice of the night
A shadow in the doorway beckons me inside
And something led the way though I could not see its face
And a voice from deep inside me screamed to get out of this place
Above my head, all was said as the jailor turned the key on me
He said you're not running out, no you're not leaving now
There ain't no way, there is no no way

[Chorus]

This nightmare never ends, memories of absent friends
Masked illusions stare at me, point the finger silently
Stand accused as the jury scares, there's a ghost in here somewhere
There's a ghost in here somewhere

[Chorus]

I'm not staying, no
Oh this nightmare really never ends, this is memories of absent friends
(don't leave your mark on me)
Oh this nightmare really never ends, there's a ghost in here somewhere
(don't leave your mark on me)

I'm not staying, no
Oh this nightmare really never ends, this is memories of absent friends
(don't leave your mark on me)
Oh this nightmare really never ends, there's a ghost in here somewhere

Meat Loaf,"And the band began to play, without a song they'd lose their way
A song of love and custom dreams, a song of yesterday
When they danced, when they danced, her skirts were lifted high
She felt the music in his arms, the danger in his eyes
And a woman said no, and a man said ""but I love you so""
And a woman moved closer, and a man said ""Take my love into your heart
I must have you here by my side""

It happened all too fast, they came to love and they came to last
No-one remembers now who lied, true love is made of glass
And a woman said ""change"", and a man said ""as soon as I can""
And a woman said ""open up"", and a man said
""Your way's right, you're my love, I won't be holdin' you down""

In the evening of their lives, no regrets and clear blue skies
They meet again in old New York, he tells her one sweet lie

And they danced and they danced, and a man said ""I love you so""
And a woman moved closer, and a man said ""take my love into your heart
I must have you here by my side""",Man and a Woman
Meat Loaf,"It's getting cold, it's getting dark, the nights are longer every day
The air is heavy and the clouds will never burn away
And we've been waitin' here so long that we've forgotten what it's like
To turn into the fire, lookin' straight into the, straight into the light

Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line

I want to tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back
We're tearin' down the highway and we're breakin' away, breakin' away
Breakin' away, we're breakin' away from the pack
We're breakin' away from the pack

And if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll
And even if you don't have anywhere to go
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll
And your speed is all you'll ever need, all you'll ever need to know

[Chorus]
You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly and we gotta get away from the past
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast
Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly
They're only fighting for the chance to be last
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby
But we should be goin' nowhere fast

It's so much better goin' nowhere fast

You shouldn't always see your world so clearly
You shouldn't always know your place so well
And all we're doin' here is hangin' around
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here is gonna be hell
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here has gotta be hell

I'm getting lost, I'm getting found, I'm getting born again each day
We're dyin' on the vine until we finally, 'til we finally get away
The boundaries of this town are closin' in just like a noose
The future's gonna rust if we don't put it to some, put it to some use

Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line

Meat Loaf,"At sunset you hear the soft parade is coming
And the cars and the beast behind, they all start humming
And ooh you got a cool machine, so let's get it runnin'
We'll break the silence of the night and you know they're gonna hear us comin'

We always see them whisper, we know they're gonna talk
They fantasize the mysteries 'bout the night and the dark

So baby one more kiss, baby one more kiss, we never have to say goodbye
Oh one more kiss, baby one more kiss, it brings a little luck to the night

Under my foot gonna hit it down, take this stance before the crowd

Soft hands around my neck, one more kiss then it's time to connect
Leave this child, leave me all alone, this one's mine and I'm takin' it home

(Ready, ready, ready to roll)

This one's mine and I'm takin' it home

Now behind closed walls new histories start to rise
Of the soft parade and the heroes where they lie

Meat Loaf,"I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll, when it didn't cost a thing
Stacks of scratched up 45's and taught myself how to sing
What does it take to be a rock 'n' roll hero, just like the king
Livin' your life in a blaze of glory, burnin' it up in a smoke filled club
Givin' your soul to the world

Like a rock 'n' roll hero, a soldier of fortune in the night
Like a rock 'n' roll hero, when the white hot lights cut through the night
And the sound of the thunder starts roaring

And you're feeling like a rock 'n' roll hero

I owe it all to rock 'n' roll, and I wouldn't want to change a thing
Got this old guitar strapped round my neck, and my baby waitin' in the wings

Time ticks away, it drifts away leaving empty shattered moments
Who said that love could last forever?
I'm growing tired of feeling like I do
As we drift apart, little secrets come between us
As we sail away, feelin' comfort in the distance

You said that love would last forever
Neither one of us will ever surrender

Was nothing but bribes.

Or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby 
But you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

You got the kind of legs that do more than walk
I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk
Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see
You got a lotta nerve to come on to me
You got the kind of lips that do more than drink
You got the kind of mind that does less than think

But since I'm feeling kinda lonely, my defenses are low
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action

Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point

You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone

Baby baby, baby baby 

Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I we got better things to do
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
I don't know who you are or what you do
Or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of

Meat Loaf,"I was lost till you were found
But I never knew how far down
I was falling before I reached the bottom
I was cold and you were fire
And I never knew how the pyre 
Could be burning 
On the edge of the ice field

And the now chilly California wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you hear me crying
Oh babe, don't go
And don't you hear me screaming
How was I to know?

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day
And take me to another land where I don't have to stay

And I'm gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through

For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you

I was damned and you were saved
And I never knew how enslaved 
I was kneeling in the chains of my master

I could laugh but you could cry
And I never knew just how high 
I was flying

For taking in the rain when I'm feeling so dry
For giving me the answers when I'm asking you why
And my oh my 
For that I thank you

For taking in the sun when I'm feeling so cold
For giving me a child when my body is old
And don't you know 
For that I need you

For coming to my room when you know I'm alone
For finding me a highway and driving me home

And every time I do it just a little bit longer
Every time I dream, it's just a little bit stronger than

Meat Loaf,"The skies were pure and the fields were green
And the sun was brighter than it's ever been
When I grew up with my best friend Kenny
We were close as any brothers than you ever knew

It was always summer and the future called
We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all
And there was so much left to dream and so much time to make it real

But I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone
They said he crashed and burned
I know I'll never learn why any boy should die so young

We were racing, we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now and he's gaining ground

[Chorus]
But it was long ago and it was far away, oh God it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

And when the sun descended and the night arose
I heard my father cursing everyone he knows
He was dangerous and drunk and defeated
And corroded by failure and envy and hate

There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze
Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank as he hit me again and again and again

I know I still believe he'd never let me leave, I had to run away alone So
Many threats and fears, so many wasted years before my life became my own

And though the nightmares should be over
Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly coarse and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind and then he pulls me back

[Chorus]

There was a beauty living on the edge of town
And she always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love

The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like a Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said, Caution! Kids At Play!

Those were the rights of spring and we did everything
There was salvation every night
We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right

She used her body just like a bandage, she used my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared But I can see her rising up
Out of the back seat now Just like an angel rising up from a tomb

Then I saw you like a summer dream
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said

And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said

You can feel the pulse of the pavement
Racing like a runaway horse
The subways are sizzling
And the skin of the streets is gleaming with sweat
I've seen you sitting on the steps outside
And you were looking so restless and reckless and lost
I think it's time for you to come inside
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget
I think it's time for you to come inside
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget

Come on, come on and there'll be no turning back
You were only killing time and it'll kill you right back

Meat Loaf,"Wasted Youth
Wasted Youth
I remember everything!
I remember everything little thing, as if it happened yesterday
I was barely seventeen, and I once killed a boy with a Fender Guitar
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster
But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome, and a voice like a horny angel
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster
But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy

It required the perfect combination of the right power chords
And the precise angel from which to strike!

The guitar bled for about a week afterwords
And the blood was zoot, dark and rich, like wild berry's
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords
But it rung out beautifully
And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before

So I took my guitar
And I smashed it against the wall
I smashed it against the floor
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader
Smashed it against the hood of a car
Smashed it against a 1981 Harley-Davidson
The Harley howled in pain
The guitar howled in heat

And I ran up the stairs to my parents bedroom
Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight
Slowly I opened the door
Creeping in the shadows right up to the foot of their bed
I raised the guitar high above my head
And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the center of the bed
My father woke up, screaming ""Stop!""
""Wait a minute. Stop it boy. What do you think your doing?""
""That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument""
And I said, ""God Damn It daddy,""
""You know I love you, But you've got a hell of a lot to learn about Rock n' Roll""",Wasted Youth [Speech]

The hollow shell, no spark of life
Where once upon a time there beat a heart
For you and you knew it from the start, and you went and blew it all away
And you knew how, oh you knew best
The strings to pull and buttons to press
To wind me up and make me shake, you controlling every move I made
I couldn't see through it, all the pain, and you put me through it
Over and over again, just tell me over and over and over

When I woke up I caught you cheatin' in your dreams

Broken, broken, she slipped from out my hands
She lay so still and lifeless, I cried baby, baby, baby

Meat Loaf,"If a love as strong as ours, couldn't make it all the way.
Can anything make sense at all?
If a love so deep and true, couldn't stand the test of
time.
Then Mount Everest could slide and Jerusalem could fall.
Is nothing sacred anymore? Is forever just another word?
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was
worth fighting for?
If we can say goodbye, if we can say goodbye.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
If we can say goodbye.
Is nothing sacred anymore?

I can hear the final words, every sentence that was said.
Don't know what turned our lives around.
It doesn't matter who was right.
There's no justice in a dream.
Never thought a heart could break without making any sound.
Is nothing sacred anymore? Is forever just another word?
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was
worth fighting for?
If we can say goodbye, if we can say goodbye.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
If we can say goodbye.
Is nothing sacred anymore?

Our love was as certain as the dawn.
As solid and safe as any love could be.
Our love was a star to wish upon.
And you thought that I'd saved you.
Could've sworn that you saved me.
Is nothing sacred anymore? Is forever just another word?
Is a promise something people use to keep when love was
worth fighting for?
If we can say goodbye, if we can say goodbye.
Is nothing sacred anymore?

Meat Loaf,"If you listen, to the night
You can hear the darkness call
I can barely stand to wait
I can barely stand at all
C'mon closer to me now
It's like we're sharing the same skin
We gotta get out of this jail
We gotta let the future in
So many things in your life
That your bound to regret
Why didn't I do that?
Why didn't I do this?
So many chances you lost
That you'll never forget
Why didn't I make it?
Why didn't I take it right there?

If only-if only it was so
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:
It could have been me. it could have been me
The loneliest words you'll ever know
If only-if only it was so
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:
It could have been me. it could have been me
You'll have to pay for it later
If you don't get it when it's going for free
Believe me -! believe me -!

A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
It's something that's always been so
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste

And one of these nights
You're gonna show me that you already know
There's a feast waiting for you
And you've never even gotten a taste
It's later than you think and
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste!
You shouldn't tremble when we touch
There's no reason for these fears
It's a promise that was made
We've been promised this for years
I wanna show you it all
What to do and where and how!
Cause we'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never be as young as we are right now!

So many cries in the night
That you try to ignore
Why didn't I do this?
Why didn't I do that?
So many unanswered prayers
So many unopened doors
Why didn't I take it?
Why didn't I make it come true?
The loneliest words you'll ever know:
If only - if only it was so
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:
It could have been me
It could have been me
The loneliest words you'll ever- know:
If only - if only it was so
The emptiest words that there'll ever be:
It could have been me
It could have been me
You'll have to pay for it later:

Meat Loaf,"The entire city is burning
You can see the flames like the inside of a mad jukebox
Lost boys stalk the streets with those jungle markings on their chests
Barbarians prowl in shadows, their heads rocking with rodents
Motorcycles reproduce in nocturnal alleys groaning with greasy pleasure
And they've blown up the YWCA like a giant balloon
And sent it out to sea full of screaming, lovely, lonely girls",Nocturnal Pleasure

Meat Loaf,"Well, I went home with the waitress
You know the way I always do
Well how was I to know
She was with the Russians, too

I was gambling in Havana
You know I took a little risk
Send lawyers, guns and money
Daddy, won't you get me out of this

I'm an innocent bystander
Somehow I got stuck
Between a rock and a hard place
And I'm down on my luck
Oh yea, I'm down on my luck
Oh yea, I'm down on my luck
Oh baby, I'm down on my luck
I'm so far down, I don't think I'll ever get up
If it weren't for bad luck
Oh if it weren't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Now I'm stranded in Honduras
I'm a desperate man
Send lawyers, guns and money
The shit has hit the fan
Send lawyers, guns and money
Send lawyers, guns and money
Get me out of this
Send lawyers, guns and money
You know the shit has hit the fan

Meat Loaf,"I was nothing but a lonely boy
Looking for something new
And you were nothing but a lonely girl
But you were something
Something like a dream come true
I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block
When I played my guitar
I made the canyons rock, but,

Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

In the middle of a steaming night
I'm tossing in my sleep
And in the middle of a red-eyed dream
I see you coming
Coming on to give it to me

I was out on the prowl down by the edge of the track
And like a son of a jackal
I'm a leader of the pack, but,

Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

Oh, baby, I'm a hunter in the dark of the forest
I've been stalking you and tracking you down
Cruising up and down the main drag all night long
We could be standing at the top of the world
Instead of sinking further down in the mud
You and me 'round about midnight
You and me 'round about midnight
Someone's got to draw first

Draw first
Someone's got to draw first blood
Someone's got to draw first blood
Oh I got to draw first blood
Oh I got to draw first blood

I was out on the prowl down by the edge of the track,
And like a son of a jackal I'm a leader of the pack but,

Every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go
Do ya know what it's like
All revved up with no place to go

I was nothing but a lonely all-American boy
Looking out for something to do
And you were nothing but a lonely all-American girl
But you were something like a dream come true
I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block
And when I played my guitar I made the canyons rock
But every Saturday night
I felt the fever grow

Meat Loaf,"I was lost till you were found
But I never knew how far down
I was falling
Before I reached the bottom
I was cold and you were fire
And I never knew how the pyre 
Could be burning 
On the edge of the ice field

And the now chilly California wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you hear me crying:
""Oh Babe, don't go""
And don't you hear me screaming:
""How was I to know?""

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day
And take me to another land where I don't have to stay

And I'm gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through

[Chorus]
For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you

I was damned and you were saved
And I never knew how enslaved 
I was kneeling
In the chains of my master

I could laugh but you could cry
And I never knew just how high 
I was flying
Ah, with you right above me

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day
And take me to another land where I don't have to stay

And I'm gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through

[Chorus]

For taking in the rain when I'm feeling so dry
For giving me the answers when I'm asking you why
And my oh my 
For that I thank you

For taking in the sun when I'm feeling so cold
For giving me a child when my body is old
And don't you know 
For that I need you

For coming to my room when you know I'm alone
For finding me a highway and driving me home
And you gotta know 
For that I serve you

For pulling me away when I'm starting to fall
For revving me up when I'm starting to stall
And all in all 
For that I want you

For taking and for giving and for playing the game
For praying for my future in the days that remain
Oh Lord 
For that I hold you

Ah but most of all
For cryin' out loud
For that I love you

Ah but most of all
For cryin' out loud

There just ain't no doubt, there's just one thing you're never too sure about

Meat Loaf,"I'm so afraid to draw you close
Hold me
Before my hands fall away
I'll suffocate
If I can't breathe you in
And hold you there
Forever

I left a message at the hotel
They said you checked out
They said you ain't coming back
I tried to call you
But you turned off your cell
And it said at the tone
Just leave me alone

And I fall apart at the seams
It seems that I always, always fall apart
But as strong as I am
Why can't I break your heart?

I remember how it used to be
Making love to you all night long
I used to take you in my arms
And hold you there until all my strength was gone
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel

I built this prison that I thought was a home
And we both lived here
Guess you were living alone
I'd tear it down if you would only have asked
And I would build you a bridge
So you could come back

And I fall apart at the seams
It seems that I always, always fall apart
But as strong as I am
Why can't I break your heart?

I remember how it used to be
Making love to you all night long
I used to take you in my arms
And hold you there until all your fears were gone
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel
I used to be a man of steel
Hey, now tell me why can't you just break my heart?
I used to be an man of steel
And I used to take you in my arms
I loved you from the start
Now you can't tear my world apart

I used to be a man of steel
Now every bit of faith is gone
You used to be so strong
Now you can't even break my heart
I used to be a man of steel
I used to take you in my arms
What's it going to take for us to break down?

Apart at the seams
It seems that I always fall apart

As strong as I am...
Why can't you break my heart?",Man of Steel
Meat Loaf,"Baby we can talk all night
But that ain't gettin us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you, I need you
But-there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coup de Ville hiding at the bottom
Of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able to give you something
Something that I just haven't got
There's only one girl I'll ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back
Oh I know

I remember how she left me on a stormy night
She kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you, I need you

But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
I want you, I need you

Flying free as a bird caught inside every word you say

This is larger than life
See the sparks fly
When you're standing by my side
Every step, every move, everything I do
Life is beautiful because of you

Every breath that you give
You're my sweet oxygen my friend
You made me follow it fast so my dreams could get past the end

Meat Loaf,"And you said nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else

Little lady, I think there's something on your mind
I've known you long enough to know
The words are not that hard to find

And the harder you try and the longer you go
Well there's nothing but love in those eyes any more
You know what to say but you never know how
You can keep your mouth shut because it doesn't really matter right now

I will guide you all the way
Because I know exactly what you're trying to say

You have the right to remain silent
I'll get the lights, you get that smile

And you say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else

I see the angels, they're standing right outside your door
They're watching over me, they're watching over us all
You can send them home tonight, because you won't need them anymore
In your arms I think I've found the safest place to fall
When I step in the door and I stare at your face
There are so many things that I wish I could say
Well I struggle with words but they put up a fight
You can keep your mouth shut, because it doesn't really matter tonight

I will guide you all the way
Because I know exactly what you're trying to say
You have the right to remain silent
I'll get the lights
You get that smile

And you say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else

And I know you feel the same
You've been searching for the words,
Now you know what to say

Just say nothing
Don't say a word
Silence is gold
Don't say a word

This is the moment we've been waiting for
If I exercise my right
I will take your body language and hold it against you tonight

And I know you feel the same
I've wondered all my life, if this moment comes would I know what to say
Then you say nothing at all
So many times I stumbled on the words I wanted to say
Then you say nothing at all
So many thoughts, that I should have just let my heart explain
Then you say nothing at all
So many ways we could turn the words around
Then you say nothing at all
So many nights our hearts came crashing to the ground
Then you say nothing at all
So many dreams that are finally coming true
Well, I couldn't have said it better myself
Now you finish me off when you finish my thoughts the way you do

You say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else",Couldn't Have Said It Better
Meat Loaf,"So this is what it feels like 
To be the one left behind 
To give it all you've got, then find
You've already changed your mind

And this is what it sounds like 
Crying on the bed that we both made
Waiting for a sign that you just can't give me 
Any kind of sign

I don't want to be here wide-awake
Clinging to a love that can't be saved
Hanging off the edge of every word 
That you say 

So I asked myself, ""Do I love you so much
That I'm willing to let you go?""
At the tip of my tongue the answer was ""yes""
But, at the bottom of my heat I'm wondering

Did I say that?
Did I say that?
Sometimes you know I over react
And what I say is not a matter of fact
I wish that I could take it all back 

And you know I'd drag myself through fire at your side 
And you know the gates of Heaven are surely open wide
And I need some sympathy here
And I need someone to call my own 
I'm standing in the light of my mistakes 
And begging you, ""come home.""

And I know you need some time to run and hide
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're choking on your pride

So I asked myself, ""Do I love you so much 
That I'm willing to let you go?""
At the tip of my tongue the answer was ""yes""
But, at the back of my mind I'm wondering

Did I say that?
Did I say that?
Sometimes you know I over react
And what I say is not a matter of fact
I wish that I could take it all back 
But I said that

And I wish I could take it all back 

And I need some sympathy here 
And I want a love to call my own 
I want to take you in the back seat now 
And slowly drive you home 

And I know you need some time to run and hide 
But the truth is hard to swallow when you're 
Choking on your pride 
I don't want to be this wide-awake

Fighting for a love that I can't save
And hanging off the edge of every word you say 
Knowing that it might make me cry 
I don't want to be this complicating
You can drag it out but I'll be waiting 
I stumbled on ""I love you"" tonight 
But it sounded like goodbye 

Did I say that?
Did I say that?
Did I tell you that I loved you cause if
Would have been a matter of fact

Did I say that?
This time I'm not letting go
Did I say that?
This time I'll have and I'll hold 
Did I tell you that I loved you cause it
Would have been a matter of fact
Did I say that?
This time I'm walking through fire 
Did I say that?
This time I'll feed your desire
Did I say that?
This time I'll stand by your side 
Did I say that?
This time I will be your pride
Did I say that?
This time I'm not letting go 
Did I say that?
This time I'll have and I'll hold
Did I say that?
This time I'm walking through fire
Did I say that?
And I wish that I could take it all back 

So this is what it feels like 
To be the one left behind
To give it all you've got then find 
That you've already changed your mind",Did I Say That
Meat Loaf,"Bam,Bam, Bam my sweet
You can sip it through a straw; you can throw it back neat
Just don't be hesitatin', waitin' for it

Cause in an ideal world they'll be comin' for you
Could be tokin' on the bale, could be sniffin' our clues
Better stake your fakin' reputation on it

Do it, 
do it, 
just do it!

In a Tax-free zone, down a tin can alley
There's a slipper girl-thing and man name Sally
They were talk-talk-talkin' 'bout a clever little coffin nail
Seems, down at the docks the intended lies awaitin'
And the privileged information's gonna get wet too
You can't be too careful when it comes to being careful

Do it, 
do it, 
just do it!

There's a man in my street keeps a flock of gray doves
And he's set in his ways, wearin' Everlast gloves
His opinion can be beat when push becomes a shove
Says he doesn't give a monkey 'bout the youth of the day
They should all drop dead, should be taken away
Put somewhere cold and all be made to stay

Do it, 
do it, 
just do it!

Bag it up, 
Bag it up

Do it!",Do It!
Meat Loaf,"I sit in my living room thinking of you
And the feelings I fear are coming true
And everything about you is wrong I know it
But I still taste you on my tongue
And I still breath you in my lungs
And I wish I could stop breaking down

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else

Don't make a sound
Don't tell a soul

It's 7:00am and I just want to call you
And tell you I'm falling in love
But, there's somebody else inside these four walls
If she smells you on my skin
I can't let her know where I've been
I wish I could be with you now

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could love you out loud
But I'll just keep it to myself
Wish I could hear how it sounds
To be with you and no one else
Wish I could love you out loud
Because I'm under your spell
Wish I could tell the whole world
But I'll just keep it to myself

Don't make a sound
Don't tell a soul
Don't tell them anything
And I won't let you go

Don't say a word
Don't tell a soul
And I shiver at the thought of you
I can't believe that you love me too
And we quiver when we touch
I can't believe I love you so much
And I hate it when you walk away
I know we can't go on this way
But there's magic when we touch
I can't believe I love you so much

Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud
Wish I could hear how it sounds
Wish I could love you out loud

Meat Loaf,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

Meat Loaf,"Listen
I was born on the other side
Just always looking to you
I made it over the great divide
Now I'm coming for you

Your forces lined up in battle
Your soldiers and your machines
The sun been blacked out by shadows
The darkest hour now you've ever seen

And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

I rose up on the doctor's slab
Like Lazarus from the pit
And everyone wants to take a stab
Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit

I've been held up on money
I've been beaten out of spite
You want a piece of me honey?
Lose or win

You know you've been in a fight
And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you
Try and tear me down

On March 6th, 1836 the walls of the Alamo fell
To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and
Tear him down.

Now there ain't much difference
Between a bridge and a wall
Without me right in the middle baby
You'll be nothing at all

And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you

Meat Loaf,"Come a little closer it's a feeling that I can't deny
I was weak, but I never thought I'd speak about the darker site
Is that a tent? I could repent upon the side of the road
But, I kept on going yeah I headed for another load
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground in the middle of the night
Oh, I testify

I was laid upon the grave by a preacher's hand I cannot lie
And, I forsake the many vows I made to be with you tonight
Could you be the salvation cause I never felt like this before
And, could you lend me your hand because I'm falling back on the floor
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground in the middle of the night
Oh, I testify

On a road outside of nowhere, in the middle of the night
Well I guess I hit rock bottom and the dawn was not in sight
And a Tempest made of fire, onset the sky aglow
And a sweet young thing called out my name
And this is how it goes, she says...
""Go boy, can you hear them?
Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes?""
And I got down on my knees

I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground and I'm falling back down
Up from the ground and I testify

Every cut that heals reveals a scar that you can never hope to hide
All the pain that you restrain keeps building up deep inside
If you think you're above it then it's you my friend that I implore
You've got to walk before you run
See the night before dawn
Before you pull yourself off the floor

I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground in the middle of the night

Meat Loaf,"Should've listened when you said I'd miss you
Should've listened but I could not hear
You said I'd want you back
I said not a chance
Now I can see I was so blind

You're right I was wrong
To ever leave you
I made a mistake
I'm sorry now

You're right I was wrong
To ever let you go
Now I know, now I know
You're right I was wrong

Couldn't see it when I had you with me
Couldn't see that I had everything

Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again

Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And I'l be there until the final act
I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way, tonight

Oh, I would do anything for love

Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that

Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Some nights I lose the feeling
Some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

Maybe I'm lonely, that's all I'm qualified to be
That's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you. So long, so long

Will you raise me up? will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that
I can do that

Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?

Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?

It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around

As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Thought it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed

Cause we were barely dressed
And we were barely dressed

You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
And I gotta let you know
No you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right

We're gonna go all the way
And tonight's the night

OK, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here, 
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth, 
There's the windup, and there it is, 
A line shot up the middle, look at him go. 
This boy can really fly! 
He's rounding first and really turning it on now, 
He's not letting up at all, 
He's gonna try for second, the ball is bobbled out in center, 
And here comes the throw, and what a throw! 
He's gonna slide in head first, 
Here he comes, he's out! 
No, wait, safe-safe at second base, 
This kid really makes things happen out there. 
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch-he's going, 
And what a jump he's got, he's trying for third, 
Here's the throw, it's in the dirt-safe at third! 
Holy cow, stolen base! He's taking a pretty big lead out there, 
Almost daring him to try and pick him off. 
The pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted, 
Bunted down the third base line, the suicide squeeze is on! 
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, 
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it!

Stop right there!
I gotta know right now!

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time, so I can end my life with you!!

I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out

Yes!

And does he love me?

Yes 

Yes 

On a hot summer night 
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?

Yes

I bet you to say that to all the boys.

It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning
There was fog crawling over the sand
And when I listened to your heart I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars, falling through your trembling hands

While you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining
And I was dying just to ask for a taste
Oh we were lying together in a silver lining
By the light of the moon you know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste

Oh will you hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
But my soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

(Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want
Oh the night is young and ain't no-one gonna know where you
No-one gonna know where you
No-one's gonna know where you've been.
You were licking your lips and your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining 
By the the light of the moon, 
You know there's not another moment to waste

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you

(Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

(Love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing) 

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing) 

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing) 

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing) 

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
(It must have been while you were kissing) 

You took the words right out of my mouth oh
You took the words right out of my mouth oh
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Whoa it must have been while you were kissing me

You took the words right out of my mouth 
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me

You took the words right out of my mouth 
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me

You took the words right out of my mouth 
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me",You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth [Hot Summer Night] [Live Feb20
Meat Loaf,"It's only two o'clock
 And the temperature's beginning to soar
 And all around the city
 You see the walking wounded and the living dead
 It's never been this hot and I've never been so bored
 And breathing is just no fun anymore
 Then I saw you like a summer dream
 And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said
 I saw you like a summer dream
 And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said
 You can feel the pulse of the pavement
 Racing like a runaway horse
 The subways are sizzling
 And the skin of the streets is gleaming with sweat
 I've seen you sitting on the steps outside
 And you were looking so restless and reckless and lost
 I think it's time for you to come inside
 I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget
 I think it's time for you to come inside
 I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget
 Come on, come on and there'll be no turning back
 You were only killing time and it'll kill you right back
 Come on, come on, it's time to burn up the fuse
 You got nothing to do and even less to lose
 You got nothing to do and even less to lose
 So wander down to the ancient hallway,
 Taking the stairs only one at a time
 Follow the sound of my heartbeat now
 I'm in the room at the top,
 You're at the end of the line
 So open the door and lay down on the bed,
 The sun is just a ball of desire
 And I want to take you out of the frying pan
 And into the fire
 Out of the frying pan and into the fire
 Out of the frying pan and into the fire
 And I want to take you out of the frying pan
 And into the fire
 Out of the frying pan and into the fire
 Out of the frying pan and into the fire
 And into the fire, fire, fire,
 And into the fire, fire, fire
 And into the fire, fire, fire,

 It's only two o'clock
 And the temperature's beginning to soar
 And all around the city
 You see the walking wounded and the living dead
 It's never been this hot and I've never been so bored
 And breathing is just no fun anymore

 And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said
 I saw you like a summer dream
 And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said

Meat Loaf,"I want my money back
Say it like you mean it
I want my money back
I'm gonna rock your world

(chorus - hey - hu - hey)

It's all or nothing 
And nothing's all I ever get 
Everytime I turn it on 
I burn it up and burn it out 

It's always something 
There's always something going wrong 
That's the only guarantee 
That's what this is all about 

It's a never ending attack (ha)
Everything's a lie and that's a fact 
Life is a lemon and I want my money back! 

And all the morons 
And all the stooges with their coins 
They're the ones who make the rules 
It's not a game it's just a rout 


There's desparation (there's desperation)
There's desparation in the air 
It leaves a stain on all your clothes 
And no detergent gets it out 

And we're always slipping through the cracks (slipping)
Then the movie's over fade to black 
Life is a lemon and I want my money... 


I want my money back 
(life is a lemon) what 
(life is a lemon) what about it
I want my money back 
(life is a lemon)

What about love? 
It's Defective! 
It's always breaking in half 


What about sex? 
It's Defective! 
It's never built to really last 


What about family? 
It's Defective! 
All the batteries are shot 


What about friends? 
They're Defective! 
All the parts are out of stock 


What about hope? 
It's Defective! 
It's corroded and decayed 


What about faith? 
It's Defective! 
It's tattered and it's frayed 


What about your Gods? 
They're Defective! 
They forgot the warranty 


What about your town? 
It's Defective! 
It's a dead end street to me 


What about your school? 
It's Defective! 
It's a pack of useless lies 


What about your work? 
It's Defective! 
It's a crock and then you die 


What about your childhood? 
It's Defective! 
It's dead and buried in the past 


What about your future? 
It's Defective! 
You can shove it up your ass!!! 

It's all or nothing 
And nothing's all I ever get 
Everytime I turn it on 
I burn it up and burn it out 

It's a never ending attack 
Everything's a lie and that's a fact 
Life is a lemon and I want my money...

life is a lemon and I want my money back
Life is a lemon and I want my money back
Life is a lemon and I want my money back
Life is a lemon (and I want) and I want (and I want) and I want my money back

Meat Loaf,"I'm still alive
Must have been a miracle
It's been a hell of ride
Destination still unknown
It's a fact of life,
If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head
You better walk the line or you'll be left for dead

I'm a runaway train on broken track
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing on the ground
As long as I got blood rush trough my veins
I'm still alive

Lost in the night
Feeling so invisible
Oh, a dead man walking the wire
I have broke the devils net
That's made of fire
And it's a long way down from the top of the world
You better look around or you gonna get burned

I'm a runaway train on broken track
I'm a ticker on a bomb, you can't turn back this time
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing on the ground
And as the dust wheels look in my eyes
I'm still alive
I'm still alive

The darkest night ain't black enough
To keep the morning light from shinin'
The highest wall ain't tall enough
To keep the smallest man from climbin'

The more that you resist the tide
The more it pulls you in
The more you hang on for your life

Meat Loaf,"The sea is whipping the sky
The sky is whipping the sea
You can hide away forever from the storm
But you'll never hide away from me
The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark
And we may lose everything in the wind
But the Northern Lights are burning
And they're giving off sparks
I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin

You know I'm onto your scent
We're near the end of the chase
Take a look out your window and I'll be there in the night
Your love is so close that I can almost taste it
The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark
And we may lose everything in the wind
But the Northern Lights are burning
And they're giving off sparks
I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin

You've been living your life like a girl in a cage
And you whisper when I want you to shout
And I wonder why you wanna go on sleeping
When there's nothing left to dream about
But you better remember
If it's something I want then it's something I need
I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed
If it's something I want then it's something I need
I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed

And I know that I'm gonna be like this forever
I'm never gonna be what I should
And you think that I'll be bad for just a little while
But I know that I'll be bad for good
I know that I'll be bad for good
I know that I'll be bad for good

Your eyes are darker than sin
And I've been watching them glow
Take a chance on a promise and a roll of the dice
Put your foot on the gas, let it go, let it go, let it go

I know that I'll be bad for good
I know that I'll be bad for good
I know that I'll be bad for good

Bad for good
Bad for good

For the good of some thrills on a long frigid night
For the good of the fire in your soul
For the good of the kiss let me hold you so tight
For the good of getting out of control
For the good of the action and a race in the dark
For the good of those chills up your spine
For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart
For the good of what's yours and what's mine
For the good of believing in a life after birth
For the good of your body so bright
For the good of the search for some heaven on earth
For the good of one hell of a night
For the good of one hell of a night

For the good of the action and a race in the dark
For the good of the fire in your soul
For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart
For the good of getting out of control
For the good of believing in a life after birth
For the good of your body so bright
For the good of the search for some heaven on earth
For the good of one hell of a night, for the good of one hell of a night

You can hide away forever from the storm

The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark
And we may lose everything in the wind
But the Northern Lights are burning
And they're giving off sparks
I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin

I know that you can be bad
At least a little while
But if you give me a chance, give me one little chance
And give me all the love that you should
Then instead of being bad for just a little while
Then instead of being bad for just a little while
Then instead of being bad for just a little while

Meat Loaf,"Another night sleepless
I don't want to feel this
Nothing can stop this pain
Trying to get to a time I forget you
Still tangled in yesterday

It's so easy for you
To give nothing for me
Did you ever feel anything?

I want you to cry over me
Die over me
Even for a moment
Even for a moment

I want you to hurt over me
Feel what I feel
I want you to cry over, die over me
Baby, just for one time

I want your heart broken
Some sign of emotion
Wanna to see the tears tumble down

Show me I meant something
And that you feel nothing
But your world crashing to the ground

It's so easy for you
To forget about me
Did I ever mean anything?

I want you to cry over me
Die over me
Even for a moment
Even for a moment

I want you to hurt over me
Feel what I feel
I want you to cry over, die over me
Baby, just for one time

Cry, cry, cry

But did you feel something?
Did we mean nothing at all?

I want you to cry over, cry over me
Die over me
Even for a moment
Even for a moment

I want you to hurt over me
Feel what I feel
Even for a moment
Oh, why can't you just cry over, die over me

Baby, why can't you hurt like I do
Like I hurt over you
Can't you cry over, die over me
Baby, just for one time

I want you to cry over, die over me
Baby, want you to fall on your knees
Baby, crawl back to me
Want you to cry over, die over me
Baby, just one time

Could follow me so mercilessly
It's almost surreal
All the pain that I feel
The future ain't what it used to be

It doesn't matter what they're thinking
It doesn't matter what they're thinking of me
It's always so cold
I'm to young to be old
The future ain't what it used to be

Were there ever any stars in the sky
Did the sun ever shine so bright?
Do you have any dreams I could borrow
Just to get me through the lonely night?
Is there anything left to hold on to
When the rivers wash it all away?
Is there anyone left to hold on to
Is there anything left I can say?

[Chorus:]
Say a prayer for the falling angels
Stem the tide of the rising waters
Toll a bell for the broken hearted
Burn a torch for your sons and daughters
The endless night has got a hold of me
Dark days are pulling me forward
And all the tears are washing over me
I'm crying, lost forever
In a future that ain't what it used to be
No more no more no more

It's like a storm that's never ending
It's like a shadow on the land and the sea
There's nothing so sad as
A tomorrow gone bad
The future ain't what it used to be

Some days I feel so numb and empty
And those would be the good days for me
Nothing gets to me now
Unless I'm thinking of how
The future ain't what it used to be

Is there anything left to hold on to
When the rivers wash it all away?
Is there anyone left to hold on to
Is there anything left I can say?

Meat Loaf,"If God could talk, would He tell you to come back to me?
If God could talk, would He tell you it's alright, just leave
And don't look back at all the memories
The best of times, the mess you made of me
Walk on, if you think it's gonna make you strong

Why don't you run away and find yourself alive?
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides
What's it gonna take to break the silence
That's been tearin' you apart?

If God could talk, would He part the oceans straight to you
Make mountains move, crumble at your feet to get you through
Another day, another night alone
Step right out into the great unknown tonight
Even God knows, baby, that ain't right

Why don't you run away and find yourself alive
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides
What's it gonna take to break the silence
That's been tearin' you apart? If God could talk

Did you swear to yourself on the day it was over
That you'd never turn around and get locked up in another cage?
Did you tear all the pictures of us living life together
Did you burn all the memories that have been made in a fit of rage?

Why don't you run away and find yourself alive
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides
What's it gonna take to break the silence
That's been tearin' you apart?

If only God could talk
If only God could talk
If only God could talk
If only God could talk

Would you listen now, if God could talk?

Freedom spits in my face
It was such a disgrace
And I was lonely
And feeling empty

I had my head in a noose
I had nothing to loose
Had enough of abuse
And now I'm dangerous

And now you have to choose
And prove you can take it
To the top before you fall

I've walked a slippery road
Felt a twitch in my soul
Through the wind and the cold
With no protection
Just one direction
Destruction

I've paid for all my mistakes
Taking all I can take
Until I'm ready to break
I'm feeling vicious
And so outrageous
It breaks us

I'm leaving
Still breathing
I'm tearing through these chains

[Chorus]

I've lived a thousand years in darkness
Banished all alone
Inside my mind with just my madness
Behind these walls of stone

I was falling apart at the seams
Holding my breath just to breathe
I tasted the sting of my tears

I was waking up stuck in a dream
Ran out of air, couldn't screamed
Wasted away by my fears

The monster's loose
And now you know the truth
Tell me can you feel it
As you hit the wall

The monster's loose
And now you have to choose
And prove that you can take it
To the top and never fall

The monster's loose
You've lost your last excuse
Now show me that you got it
Even when you fall

The monster's loose
This game is win or loose
Sometimes you gotta' do it
And show the world you want it all",The Monster Is Loose

Meat Loaf,"[Boy:]
There's a hole in the sky tonight
Did the moon drift too far from sight?
I would search through this empty darkness
To see your face in the morning light

We've been lost in a sea of confusion
Got caught up in a selfish illusion
But make no mistake: I will bend till I break
Don't let fate make the choice for us

What about love that lasts forever?
What about time to see it through?
If you don't give you just don't get it
What about me?
What about you?

Once in a lifetime you'll find someone heaven send for you
For a lifetime you'll feel there's a reason to believe
In a love that's meant to be

[Boy:]
It feels like we've fallen from grace
Given up on the higher thing
'Cause I know deep inside if we search we will find
Something to give us wings

To live without you
Is reaching for something that never comes through
Together is heaven
Apart we're in hell

Once in a lifetime you'll find
Someone to share your dreams
For a lifetime
Our love will always set us free
Forever we'll believe...

I can't forget the feelin of your sweat upon my skin
And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in
It happens once, only once in a lifetime

On a summernight's surrender with nothing to loose
You were scared and so was I when I gave myself to you
It happens once, only once in a lifetime

What about time to see it through?
If you don't give you just don't get it

Meat Loaf,"The sirens are screaming and the fires are howling,
Way down in the valley tonight.
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye,
And a blade shining oh so bright.
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in sky,
And A killer's on the bloodshot streets.
Oh and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising,
Oh I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter,
He was starting to foam in the heat.

Oh baby you're the only thing in this whole world,
That's pure and good and right.
And wherever you are and wherever you go,
There's always gonna be some light.
But I gotta get out,
I gotta break it out now,
Before the final crack of dawn.
So we gotta make the most of our one night together.
When it's over you know,
We'll both be so alone.

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
When the night is over
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone gone gone.
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes.
But when the day is done and the sun goes down,
And the moonlights shining through,
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven,
I'll come crawling on back to you.

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram,
On a silver black phantom bike.
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry,
And we're all about to see the light.
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole.
Everything is stunted and lost.
And nothing really rocks
And nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost.

And I know that I'm damned if I never get out,
And maybe I'm damned if I do,
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart,
You know I'd rather be damned with you.
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned,
Dancing through the night with you.
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned.
Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned.
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned,
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night with you.

Oh baby you're the only thing in this whole world,

And the moonlights shining through,
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven,

Oh I can see myself tearing up the road,
Faster than any other boy has ever gone.
And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe.
No-one's gonna stop me now,
I'm gonna make my escape.
But I can't stop thinking of you,
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late.
And I never see the sudden curve 'till it's way too late.

Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun.
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike.
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell.
And the last thing I see is my heart,
Still beating,
Breaking out of my body,
And flying away,
Like a bat out of hell.

It was a hot summer night
and the beach was burning.
There was fog crawling over the sand.
When I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning.
I see the shooting stars falling
through your trembling hands.

You were licking your lips
and your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
by the the light of the moon.
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste.

You hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
But my soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.

And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.

No-one's gonna know where you've been.

Meat Loaf,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust

Drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left

And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby Baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, Baby, Baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me

And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see

All coming back to me

Meat Loaf,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tear turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
But I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made!
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me

When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now

Meat Loaf,"The sea is whipping the sky
The sky is whipping the sea
You can hide away forever from the storm
But you'll never hide away from me
The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark
And we may lose everything in the wind
But the Northern Lights are burning
And they're giving off sparks
I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin

You know I'm onto your scent
We're near the end of the chase
Take a look out your window and I'll be there in the night
Your love is so close that I can almost taste it
The icy cold will cut us like a knife in the dark
And we may lose everything in the wind
But the Northern Lights are burning
And they're giving off sparks
I want to wrap myself around you like a winter skin

You've been living your life like a girl in a cage
And you whisper when I want you to shout
And I wonder why you wanna go on sleeping
When there's nothing left to dream about
But you better remember
If it's something I want then it's something I need
I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed
If it's something I want then it's something I need
I wasn't built for comfort I was built for speed

And I know that I'm gonna be like this forever
I'm never gonna be what I should
And you think that I'll be bad for just a little while
But I know that I'll be bad for good
I know that I'll be bad for good
I know that I'll be bad for good

Your eyes are darker than sin
And I've been watching them glow
Take a chance on a promise and a roll of the dice
Put your foot on the gas, let it go, let it go, let it go

You've been living your life like a girl in a cage
And you whisper when I want you to shout
And wonder why you wanna go on sleeping
When there's nothing left to dream about

Bad for good
Bad for good

For the good of some thrills on a long frigid night
For the good of the fire in your soul
For the good of the kiss let me hold you so tight
For the good of getting out of control
For the good of the action and a race in the dark
For the good of those chills up your spine
For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart
For the good of what's yours and what's mine
For the good of believing in a life after birth
For the good of your body so bright
For the good of the search for some heaven on earth
For the good of one hell of a night
For the good of one hell of a night

For the good of the action and a race in the dark
For the good of the fire in your soul
For the good of the rock and the roll in your heart

Meat Loaf,"I'm not afraid to show you who I am 
And I am not ashamed of my life 
Though I've walked alone down this cold and soulless road 
I've always felt you deep in my bones 

With every step I rise and fall 
With everything to gain I end up losing it all 
When the darkness gets in 
I scream out and your light sets me free 

I'm not afraid of the past no more 
I'm not afraid and I'm bad for good 
I used to dance to the devil's beat 
If I could bust into hell I would 

I'm not afraid to shed all my skin 
I'm not afraid of the faults you see 
I'm tearing down these walls right now 
They're comin' down 'cause I believe 

Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
The way that you're leading me home like that 
Your love is blind, blind as bat 

I'm not afraid when they kick me down 
I'm not afraid when I start to bleed 
I'm not afraid if I live or die 
I'm not afraid 'cause I believe 

Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
The way that you're leading me home like that 
Your love is blind, blind as bat 

And I wish that I could give you something in return 
For the precious time you wasted on the tears I've never earned 
For reaching out to help me 'cross the bridges that I burned 

And in the end you'll finally see 
That, baby, I've done everything I possibly can 
I do it again 'cause know you're everything that I need 

I'm not afraid of the the truth no more 
I'm not afraid of the lies I hid 
I'm not afraid of the past of my sins 
'Cause I paid for the wrongs I did 

I'm not afraid of the things you know 
I'm just a book for the world to read 
My final words on the final page 
Will be amends 'cause I believe 

Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
The way that you're leading me home like that 
Your love is blind, blind as bat 

Your heart is kind, mine's painted black 
The way me forgive me and just take me back 
Your love is blind, blind as bat 

Your love is blind, blind as a bat 
The way that you're leading me home like that

Meat Loaf,"And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'd never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now,
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again

Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And I'l be there until the final act
I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way, tonight
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that

Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Some nights I lose the feeling
Some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

Maybe I'm lonely, that's all I'm qualified to be
That's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do

Anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you. So long, so long
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do...

Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do...

But I'll never stop dreaming of you ev'ry night of my life, no way
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Will you raise me up? will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colourise my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?

I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Will you build and emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

I can do that
I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?

I can do that
Oh no, I can do that

After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that

I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around

Meat Loaf,"Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar
I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car
You got me begging on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone
Baby baby

[Chorus]
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I we got better things to do
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do
But a girl, she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew

Baby baby, baby baby 

[Chorus]

You got the kind of legs that do more than walk

I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk

Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see

You got a lotta nerve to come on to me

You got the kind of lips that do more than drink

You got the kind of mind that does less than think

But since I'm feeling kinda lonely, my defenses are low
Why don't you give it a shot and get it ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action

Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point

You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone

Baby baby, baby baby

Meat Loaf,"Baby we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here

I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie
I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able
To give you something
Something that I just haven't got

There's only one girl that I will ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back
Ooh I know
I remember how she left me on a stormy night
She kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
I want you
I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad

Did you ever lay your head down

Meat Loaf,"I didn't take a suitcase
I had to travel light
I climbed out my bedroom window
It was just about quarter past midnight

Out on the highway
I hitched a ride I was heading west
I had to listen to some trucker
Tell me all about the meaning of life

Got a ride just outside of Memphis
I was wild out on the road
I saw shanties' and shacks
And burnt out Cadillac's
And faces that flittered like fawn

Should have seen it coming
Oh I should have seen the signs
I saw seven horses running
I had a front row seat at the end of time

I was just fifteen
And the world was mine
And I watched my dreams
Come to life on that night
I saw Elvis in Vegas
I saw Elvis in Vegas

Now since that long lost summer
I ain't ever looked back
Now the lines on my face
Are looking more like cracks

When things all crumble
Its time to face the facts
I don't care about tomorrow
Oh there's no looking back

I should have seen it coming
Oh I should have seen the signs
I saw seven horses running
I had a front row seat at the end of time

I was just fifteen
And the world was mine
And I watched my dreams
Come to life on that night
I was standing tall
Felt I would never die
And I watched it all
In the white spot light

I saw Elvis in Vegas
I saw Elvis in Vegas
I saw Elvis in Vegas
I saw Elvis in Vegas

I should have seen it coming
Oh I should have seen the signs
I saw seven horses running
I had a front row seat at the end of time

When the lights went out
I heard a young girl scream
The sound of my heart beat
The make up on her brow

I was just fifteen
And the world was mine
And I watched my dreams
Come to life on that night
I was standing tall
Felt I would never die

Meat Loaf,"To say it's love would be too simple
Too obvious
It's more like a calling, a vocation
Something I was

Put on this earth to do
Now I'm shooting with the stars
And I'm flying with the angels
And my heartbeat is a symphony the

Closer I get to you
I never saw you comin' till you
Came and here you are
I never thought someone

Would ever dare
To come this far
You're up for the resistance
And I'm strong in my persistence

And I've never known
A remedy like ours
If I can't have you
If I can't have you

I would be a river dried up
Into dust
I would be imprisoned
For ever having loved

If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me
Then I would be the same man
You scraped off the ground

I'd have to go back bein'
That broken soul you found
Those days are in the darkness
I buried them with hardness

And I'd have to dig those
Demons out
Your life is like anchor that puts
Me in my place

No you won't let me sink when
I'm off losin' my way
Thank God for your virtue
And the wisdom in your eye

Cause somehow you
Get through on
All that crazy in my mind
If I can't have you

If I can't have you
I would be a river
Dried up into dust
I would be imprisoned for never

Having loved
If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be me

Why did it take you so long to
Finally see
That we had love
That you don't find easily

You broke my heart and the price
To pay for that
Is you'll have to live the misery of
Losing what you had

If I can't have you
My words have come to late
I've already turned that page
Don't you look at me back and

That's the part I hate
I'll stay trapped inside my hell
Where it's so hot
That my walls melt

And I can hear a promise
In every lie you said
You'd never tell
If I had only told the truth

Oh I could never trust you to
You'll survive
No I will die
If I can't have you

If I can't have you
Then I'm sorry for the things I
Cost you in the end
My punishment is more than any

Man can stand
I need you in my life
I can't let go
Why don't you stay with me

Tonight
I feel alone
Turn off all the lights
Take me home
If I can't have you

If I can't have you
Then I would be a river
Dried up into dust
I would be imprisoned

There's a crack where his heart was beating last

Oh we're not dying
We're just paving the way
For the lovers, the dreamers
The kids who say
Never stop living
Oh never stop living

Take your good ideas
And your shout out louds
But they don't know

Will there be a moment like this my friend
To make a change
Stand up and say
Never stop living
No never stop living

She's got a big couch
She's got a Mercedes Benz

She pours me champagne
She drinks a Red Bull

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair

What's really going on below

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It's not somebody who's seen the light

But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start 
You want to shut out the night 
You want to shut down the sun 
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart 

Think of how we'd lay down together 
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong 
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods 
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs 

I treasure your love 
I never want to lose it 
You've been through the fires of hell 
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it 
I treasure your love 
I want to show you how to use it 
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt 
And I know you've got the scars to prove it 

Remember everything that I told you 
And I'm telling you again that it's true 
When you're alone and afraid 
And you're completely amazed 
To find there's nothing anybody can do 
Keep on believing 
And you'll discover baby 

There's always something magic 
There's always something new 
And when you really really need it the most 
That's when rock and roll dreams come through 
The beat is yours forever 
The beat is always true 
And when you really need it the most 
That's when rock and roll dreams come through....for you... 

Once upon a time was a backbeat 
Once upon a time all the chords came to life 
And the angels had guitars even before they had wings 
If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night 

I treasure your love 
I never want to lose it 
You've been through the fires of hell 
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it 
I treasure you love 
I want to show you how to use it 
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt 
And I know you've got the scars to prove it 

Remember everything that I told you 
And I'm telling you again that it's true 
You're never alone cause you can put on the phones 
And let the drummer tell your heart what to do 
Keep on believing 
And you'll discover baby 

There's always something magic 
There's always something new 
And when you really really need it the most 
That's when rock and roll dreams come through 
The beat is yours forever 
The beat is always true 
And when you really really need it the most 
That's when rock and roll dreams come through...for you...",Rock and Roll Dream [Live][*]

Sweetest dream you'll ever see
Make my dream reality oh carry me
Carry me to my grave

She placed the blade within the king's throne and in mine did I place my own
With the lamb's blood we purchased our sin's pardon
The sky ripped open and the shadows bled the moon blew out and the stars burned red
The song of madness madly crying to her

On a night such as this
An angel's lips and the devil's kiss
Morning gonna carry me to my grave

The sweetest dream you'll ever see
Make my dream reality

Wasn't a pretty picture, I must say
Well, I threw a dagger of poison words straight for my heart
Was it deserved?
Well, it's too late to make up some excuse and say it wasn't me

Oh, you've seen too much
Ooh, let me introduce you to

This is my anger
This is my shame
These are my insecurities, that I can't explain
This is my fortress, crumbling 'round my feet
Take a good look, baby: this is all of me

They found that nerve deep in my soul
Poised and ready to explode
And no one else on earth but you could get close enough
To light that fuse
And you crawled up underneath my skin
Crept now through my veins and through my head
Ooh, you got so deep
You might as well get to know the rest of me

We go by the same name

Meat Loaf,"I, I fall for everything
Under the sun, over the moon
Coming undone, broken in two

You, you fall for anything
Living the lie like all the rest
Walking the line out on the edge

Every saint is a sinner someday
No one is safe

You can fall from grace in so many ways
One step forward, two back
You can't run away from that empty space
You will find your place
When you lose your way
We all will fall from grace

I, feel like I never land
Out of the grey, into the black
Wasting away, starting to crack

Life, life is just history
Learning to die, reaching for stars
Coming to life, wearing the scars

Every saint is a sinner someday
No one is safe

You can fall from grace in so many ways
One step forward, two back
You can't run away from that empty space
You will find your place
When you lose your way
We all will fall from grace

And it's a sweet salvation
When you know you've reached the bottom
And you can finally pick yourself back up

Fall from grace, in so many ways
One step forward, two back
You can't run away from that empty space
You will find your place
When you lose your way
We all will fall
We all will fall
We all will fall, from grace",Fall From Grace

Meat Loaf,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Mad Mad World/Good God is a Woman and She Don't

I can feel that cold winter wind creeping in again
Sometimes it all comes down at once
Sometimes when it rains, it pours

Oh baby, money's just money, it comes and it goes
Things are just things, baby, so breakable
Ain't nothing last forever 'cept our love and our souls

'Cause I ain't that hungry and I have a home
I ain't fighting for my life and I'm not alone, ooh
So may I pray every morning
As I make up the bed
""Lord, all I need today is my daily bread""

Ooh darlin' don't you worry

Meat Loaf,"Whatever happened to Saturday night?
When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright
It don't seem the same since cosmic light
Came into my life, I thought I was divine

I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio
A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show
We climbed in the back seat, really had a good time

Really love that rock and roll

My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled
My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine

Get back in front and put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song
With your arms around your girl, you try to sing along
It felt pretty good, woo
Really had a good time

Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?

It was a hot summer night
And the beach was burning.
Fog crawling over the sand.
When I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning.
I see the shooting stars falling
Through your trembling hands.
You were licking your lips
And your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon.
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste.

You hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
My soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
Just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
It must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you. (love you)

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh and I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you. (love you)

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want to.
The night is young
And ain't no one gonna know where you
No one gonna know where you
No one's gonna know where you've been.

Crept up from behind me now it's here to stay
Too real although it's not

Couldn't have possibly been avoided anyway

Holding back the forbidden places
Abolished music, lost for ages

Though dust has gathered on honest feeling
Forbidden truths through twilight stealing
And in the eyes of the listless faces

Glisten hints of forbidden places

Everything at the door

Because they are soul lost and poor

All her lovely companions are faded and gone
No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, to pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead

So soon may I follow when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown
Oh who would inhabit this bleak world alone?

Mecca Normal,"Mother Africa walking along with Stephen Lewis
The dancers are dancing towards the camera
Hips moving real fast

A young woman in a school uniform
Is singing in front of the choir
Singing a song perhaps she wrote
For this occasion this television opportunity
Make no mistake it's directed at you and me.

She sings, ""Why me, why him, why her?
Why me, why him, why her?""

But the real question underlies the theme.
We know you have the drugs
You keep them under lock and key
In the west away from us.
And you choose who lives and dies.
Why him, why her, why me?
Why her, why him, and why do you choose?""

Mother Africa takes off her large lens glasses
And wipes her eyes
Stephen Lewis doesn't look he's going to cry.
He takes the message back
Back to where it's heard.

Why me, why him, why her?
You choose who lives and dies.
Why do you choose who lives,
Who dies?

Who dies?",The Message
Mechanical Cabaret,"I taste like polypropylene, a silicon face with a plastic sheen
I'm a carbonized robot, a synthesis of what is not
The food I eat is electric blue
I only drink sci-fi pink c02
I communicate via binary
I never sleep and I don't have dreams

Are you a user? are you being used? 
Are you a user? are you being used?
Are you the abuser 
Or are you the abused?
Are you a user?

I was contrived from a tube of cum
A flick of the wrist next generation
The internet shows me how to behave
I downloaded my life but forgot to press save

Sterilized, immunized, willingly hypnotized
Kill yourself with a virtual gun 
And then your death, too
Can be pointless and numb",Sterilized
Mechanical Cabaret,"Dedicated to Sam Powell 1982-2001
""Go lightly down your darkened way."" 

In order to gain, I'm taking away 
the only thing that is mine
I have nothing to lose, 
Maybe I'll win this time.

I know there's still color
But I only see with monochrome eyes
I prefer those black and white scenes, because
Everybody lies

I can't take it today, I can't take it today
I can't take it today, But I can take it away

I'm hanging hope on the end of a rope,
I'm drunk, and the words of a boy
Still ring in my ears, after so many years,
What else is there to destroy

I can't take it today, I can't take it today
I can't take it today, But I can take it away

I'm never looking back, there's nothing to subtract.",Subtract
Mechanical Poet,"Lightnings!
The flaring claws
Tight strings
Of typhoon's bows

Whiz, rave, howl
The insatiable storm!
Shrill, laugh, growl
Like demoniac swarm!

Vibrates in the rain
Some dancing people
Reflect in a pane

The wine drips
In highwaymen's lair
The chief keeps
The birth of his heir

Stormchild!
The daughter of thunder and hail
Entwined
Her crying with laughter of gale
Come to us and fly!
Break the glass and try!

Squall of a tearing gush
Winds in a violent rush
A moment of hush

Bluster and fright
Tumble and bite
Piercing the shower

Meco,"If I Were King Of The Forest not queen,not duke, not prince.
My regal robes of the forest would be satin, not cotton, not chintz.
I'd command each thing, be it fish or fowl,with a woof and a woof, and a royal
growl.
As I'd click my heel all the trees would kneel and the mountains bow and the
bulls kowtow
And the sparrows would take wing, if I were king.",If I Were King of the Forest
Meco,"Come out, come out wherever you are 
And meet the young lady who fell from a star.
She fell from the sky,
She fell very far and Kansas she says is the name of the star.
Kansas she say is the name of the star.
She brings you good news or haven't  you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas a miracle occurred.
It really was no miracle, what happened was just this.
The wind began to switch, the house to pitch, and suddenly the hinges started 
to unhitch.
Just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing 
for a hitch.
And oh what happen'd was rich.
The house began to pitch,the kitchen took a slitch,it landed on the wicked 
witch in the middle of a ditch.
Which was not a healthy situation for a wicked witch.

Silence is filling me up
I tried so many times to reach you
But nothing is ever enough
Still I'm trynna get through

Cause the distance is filling me
Have this thrills killing me
Caught up in the change of your love

Holding on to memories
Don't wanna be in between
I'm lost without you

I just wanna be in your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe

In your arms
I only wanna feel safe
Been waiting for eternity
Cause all I wanna do is feel safe

Silence is filling me up
Feels like I'm drowning in the water
But nothing is ever enough
Am I crossing the border

Cause the distance is filling me
Have this thrills killing me
Caught up in the change of your love

Holding on to memories
Don't wanna be in between
I'm lost without you

I just wanna be in your arms
I only wanna feel safe

Medina Green,"Yo I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin'
Middle Passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denyin' history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their niggas be beaten viciously
Battle in the wilderness of North America
Ran by the river, only stoppin' to pray
Chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom
For their protection deserve neither
Fuck a name, fuck tradition
Religion, you learn Jesus
Turn the other cheek
Inherit the Earth, just stay meek
Fuck the way you speak
Try to walk, we chop off your feet
Fast forward to 2003, niggas beef
The psychology of children are slaves to run deep

Hell yeah, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
What's beef? hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo

It's always your own peoples
Sometimes it's your own peoples yo

Beef is not what Jay said to Nas
Beef is when workin' niggas can't find jobs
So they tryna find niggas to rob
Tryna find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack kids can't find moms
Cause they end up inna pine box or locked behind bars
Beef ain't the Summer Jam for Hot 97
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef don't come with a radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin' you ""defendant""
Beef, it comes with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit
Talkin' bout ""I'm pregnant by some other nigga""
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need a loan for your home and you're too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doin' is gettin' bigger
You tryin' not to raise 'em around these wild niggas
Beef is when a gold digger got ya seat and a
A manicured hand out like ""pay me nigga""
Or I'm tellin' your wife
Or startin' up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangster ain't doin' it right
Another gangster then decided what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight
Yeah, beef is not what Ja said to 50
Beef is more than Irv not bein' here with me
When a soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is tryin' to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what y'all call beef is not beef at all
Beef is real life happenin' everyday
And it's realer than them songs that you get at Kay Slay

Médine,"J'ai mis des couplets sur ma plaie ouverte
Décuplé le sens profond d'un seul proverbe
J'ai mis de l'eau pas dans mon vin mais dans mes vers
Pour celles que l'on juge qu'entre les oreilles et les ovaires
Je ne ferai pas mieux que le Miss Maggie de Renaud
J'n'ai pas le charme, ni la vocation de Julio
Mais, une chose est sûre derrière chaque homme une femme existe
Pourquoi j'en parle avec l'impression que mon cœur s'exhibe
Car j'ai le même problème que des millions
Pour m'arracher un ""je t'aime"" faut un canon sur mon caisson
Garçon avec le cerveau dans le caleçon
Et un appareil génital placé au plafond
Qui tire une tronche d'enterrement à la naissance de sa fille
S'affirme adultère le jour des noces de saphir
Puis s'enfuit lâchement par la grande porte
Avec la certitude que le masculin l'emporte
Trop de choses qui me désolent alors qu'ici
Ce sont les femmes qui font de nous des hommes
Et que bien plus que les hommes elles sont chastes
Que chez les lions ce sont les femelles qui chassent

J'ai mis des mesures sur ma large blessure
Démesure le sens profond d'une belle formule
Puis j'essaye de repenser comme un fœtus
Pour celle que l'on juge qu'entre la mâchoire et l'utérus
Dans les coulisses d'une bête se cache une belle
Épouses mères et sœurs je rends hommage à chacune d'elles
Avec lesquelles je passe le plus clair de mon temps
Elles me sont ce que Simone Signoret était à Yves Montand
Ce que Rita Marley était à Bob
Winnie à Nelson ce que Betty était à Malcolm
Tous les leaders partageront leur couronne
Avec une baronne moitié épouse moitié daronne
Le mérite est dans une robe
Et ne soit pas étonné si ça sort de la bouche d'un homme
Même en étant le ou la maire du Havre
Je n'aurait pas l'instinct maternel que requiert un seul mouflard
À l'ombre du mal se cache le bien
Dans l'ombre du félin tu trouveras son féminin
J'répète, à l'ombre du mal se cache le bien
Dans l'ombre du félin tu trouveras son féminin

Que les viols en réunion n'est pas le propre des banlieues
Que ce n'est pas qu'autour des yeux de rebeus qu'il y a des bleus
La maltraitance n'a pas de peuple
L'Afghan n'est pas plus misogyne qu'un zonard de Malakoff

Quand on leur prouve par A+B

Du kidnapping des 3 français les mieux draftés
60 millions de coeurs pour un rockeur, un rasta tennis man et puis un beur footballeur
La nouvelle est tombée comme une averse en été, journée de deuil national décrété
Pour un trio black blanc beur entré dans les mœurs
Tragédie titrait l'agence Reuters
Disparition de Johnny, Yannick et Zizou
Accusés dans la nuit du 5 au 6 août
Alarmé par les bruits de l'US Army
Dès le matin, emmenés manu militari
En position de stress dans une soute
Une cagoule cousue sur leurs têtes leurs coupe le souffle
Des colliers colson leur sert chevilles et poignets
Tellement fort qu'il le ressente dans leur moelle épinière
Attaché à l'appareil par une sangle
Du ruban adhésif chatterton les étrangle
Un casque anti-son les coupe du monde
Aucun tissu sur le dos jusqu'à destination
Un bourdonnement de réacteurs brise le silence
Des perturbations les réveillent par intermittence
Interminable est la phase d'atterrissage sur la base militaire sécurisée la plus redoutable
Au Camp Delta, les goulags de Cuba
Même Gambetta n'y pourrait rien en tant qu'avocat
Vocation terroriste alors prison de terreur
En Occident aucun soulèvement d'aigreur non
Rien que le support de politiques entités

Hallyday Johnny, de son vrai nom Jean-Philippe Smet
N'a rien à se mettre si ce n'est une combinaison
Teinté du traditionnel colorant des prisons
En gros caractère dans le dos est écrit : Propriété du gouvernement des États-Unis
Ouvrez les portes de Guantanamo, sandales et barreaux remplacent santiags et perfecto
Drôle de voyage pour star de rock n'roll
Maintenant, menotté à des anneaux cimentés au sol
Si montés au cerveau sont les liquides, Johnny ne pourra plus jouer de la guitare électrique
Quelques jours plus tard, dans la cellule voisine
Zizou, de son vrai nom Zidane Yazid Zinédine
Interrogé pour ses voyages en Algérie
Son argent aurait servi à financer des groupes salafis
Dénoncé par un concurrent sportif : un certain Materazzi Marco italien natif
Plaide innocent, Zizou compte porter plainte, pour les multiples coups reçus au pied sur sa plante
Des coups de Rangers, de type Doc Martins, frappés à plusieurs reprise par le corps des Marines
Une coupure près de l'artère fémorale mettra fin à sa carrière internationale
Quelques mois plus tard dans la cellule mitoyenne
Quelques privations plus tard, essentiellement de sommeil
Yannick Noah désormais n'est plus le même
Il cherche le sommeil sous une ampoule imitant le soleil
Grévistes de la faim nourri de force
Un œsophage artificiel glissé dans sa gorge
Endommagera sévèrement ses cordes vocales
Et fera du chanteur un parolier sans son organe
Étrange torture acoustique, un transistor qui du matin au soir joue la même musique
Du hard rock métal à plein volume
Mort clinique pour Yannick, l'athlète n'est plus qu'un légume

Un démenti en bonne et dûe forme est de rigueur
Personne n'enleva ni footeux, chanteur ou rockeur
Petite frayeur pour grande réalité
D'une majorité d'inculpés à Cuba Bay
Où les suicides sont des tactiques de guerre asymétriques
Où les grèves de la faim n'ont d'écho que dans les ventres vides
Où le water-boarding n'est pas une attraction, mais la noyade par simulation
Où la privation sensorielle est censée
Stopper la diffusion à profusion du sang d'innocent
Sont-ils sourds?
Au sein de cette enceinte
Aucun secours quand un soldat urine sur un livre saint
Quel qu'il soit, le monde flatule dans la soie
On remplit nos piscines même si nos semblables ont soif
Petite histoire de rappeur consterné

Médine,"Elle a plus de sens que les lunettes à Polnareff
Et sur un prof de sciences, elle symbolise la sagesse
Elle, ce n'est pas sa taille qui fait la valeur d'un homme
Ni, sa présence qui me fait vendre des albums
Camouflage pour une partie du visage
Elle est, bien souvent de façon falche dans les braquages
Associée aux black binocles et gabardines ou carabines
Les caméras de surveillance, elle baratine
Plongea dans l'anonymat le comparse à François Besse
Protège quiconque sans changer d'adresse
En 2001 elle devient star de l'actu
En 2002 rien qu'a cause d'elle j'ai voté Robert Hue
Elle est détestée outre-Atlantique
Et les seules puces qui la démangent sont électroniques
Direction le barbier lorsque le poil est courbé
Moi sans elle ca me barbe, c'est mon coté Corbier
Les médias en parlent comme une mauvaise herbe qui se propage
Comme un poil pubien dans leur potage
Otage de keddabs et d'amalgames
Si l'habit ne fait pas le moine elle ne fera pas l'imam, non!
Accuse à tord tous les boulahyas du bout du monde
Quand tu t'imagines sur le bout du bombe
Potentiel coupable de son port, moi je le plaide
Elle est du poil a gratter dans le col de ce bled

Une coup afro sous la mâchoire
Silhouette sur le pochoir
Fourrure de panthère couleur bon-char
Sur le menton j'ai les rastas de Marley
Aussi grosse que Freeway
Je la coiffe et la fait briller
Pourquoi tu parles de ma barbe dans le fond de ta moustache?
Pourquoi tu parles de ma barbe?

Elle a plus de sens que sur le faciès de Chabal
Inexistante sur l'épiderme d'un vieux chaman
Elle est prohibée des règlements de l'école
Et n’a pas le même rôle que sur la gueule d'Abraham Lincoln
On n'y voit qu'un signe ostensible de foi
Et portée par une femme elle devient phénomène de foire
Ses reflets rouquins sentiront le roussi
Quand elle fera licencier les bagagistes de Roissy
Elle installe la crainte dans les circuits d'un pilote automatique
Allergique à tout produit cosmétique
Quand elle m'inspire j'écris des rimes sur un post-it
Sans elle, que serait le Gang des Postiches?
Imagine la sur Hit Machine
Puis imagine Soprano avec la barbe de Médine non!
All Acces elle n’est pas, personne ne l'épargne
Que tu l'acceptes ou pas elle sera tout-par en tout cas
Même dans de beaux draps le bras haut je l'arbore
Je la porterai le jour de ma mort
Puis avant qu'ils versent du poison dans l'after-shave
Leurs dernière vision sera une barbe et un chauve

Médine,"J'écarte la végétation qui me gêne
Mes pieds écorchés piétinent ma terre gambienne
Quand bien même je continue ma course
Poursuivi depuis l'aube par je ne sais quelle bête de la brousse
Mon souffle est à bout, je m'économise
Mais quel drame, quelle malédiction me colonise?
J'entends les brindilles qui craquent sous leurs pas
J'accélère, décidé à ne pas faire partie du repas
Non ! Un tant soit peu le rythme s'intensifie
À mesure que la verdure se densifie
Impossible d'échapper à ce plan
Je sens mon corps transporté dans le ventre de l'oiseau blanc
Tout s'embrouille, mes poignets sont ferrés
Je vois s'éloigner la silhouette de la forêt
Fuyez derrière les fougères, au fond des fourrés
Tel est le cauchemar d'un homme du village Djouffouré

""Kunta, Kunta
J'ai fait un cauchemar""

À quatre jours de pirogue de la côte de Gambie
Le fleuve du même nom a vu son niveau grandir
Ces eaux pluviales, dans un climat tropical
À Djouffouré, village de l'Afrique occidentale
Où les histoires se content la nuit
Où le ciel se contemple et les années se comptent en pluie
Où tout bas, on évoque les toubabs
Pour effrayer les enfants, le soir, sous un baobab
Où personne n'est plus âgé que les arbres
Où l'on dit que les armes du chasseur ont une âme
C'est ici que naquit dans cette jungle
Kunta, guerrier noir, de la tribu des Mandingues
Fils de Binta et d'Omoro Kinté
Voilà deux lunes, que la hutte familiale il a quitté
Équipé d'un lance-pierre rudimentaire
Offert par son père, qui lui aussi le tenait de son père
C'est ainsi que les enfants deviennent hommes
En quittant leur famille pour l'enseignement des psaumes
Circoncision et lutte africaine
Feront de Kunta un redoutable adversaire
À son retour, il déchargera sa mère
En s'occupant quotidiennement de son petit frère
Petite fripouille à la frimousse qu'il affectionne
Pas une seconde se passe sans qu'il questionne
Son ainé sur la longueur de l'année
Sur la taille de son nez, ou a propos du grain semé
Afin de mettre fin à son éloquence
Demain Kunta lui fabriquera un tambour de brousse

Au matin, il partit en quête du tronc
Qui lui servira de caisse de résonance
Avec pour seul ami un chien qui guette les trous
Et sa poitrine fraichement gonflée d'assurance
Rien ne semble perturber la matinée
Par aucun cri de babouin, le silence ne sera brisé
Les chevilles dans la rosée, il tape le bois
Le résultat, il lui tarde de le voir
Presque autant que le reste du monde
L'idée de voyager s'accapare de son attention
Il rêve du Mali via la Mauritanie
Du pèlerinage, à la Mecque bénie

Soudain une impression de déjà vu, le chien n'aboie plus
Une odeur de poulet mouillé, c'est le toubab et ses alliés

Un objet lourd lui écrase l'épaule
D'une force insuffisante pour l'envoyer au sol
Dieu merci Kunta se dégage de leur merci
Mais court vers un filet qui oriente sa poursuite
Un coup de fouet réduit ses vêtements en pièces
Un deuxième lui dépèce l'épiderme des fesses
Il dépêche au passage une pierre qu'il décoche
À toute force dans le visage le plus proche
Il déteste que des noirs lâches aident à la débauche
Que sa personne soit l'objet des négoces
Et que les traîtres soient peut-être de sa caste
Des Noirs qui, contre un miroir, leur Histoire saccagent
Des chasseurs au services d'un armateur
Qui deviendront sûrement la proie de leurs employeurs
Une fois le travail accompli, les complices
Redeviendront de la marchandise
Kunta a le cœur qui s'agite
Tandis qu'il enjambe les champs d'arachides
En espérant pouvoir échapper au guet-apens
Mais l'enfant vient d'être violemment frappé à la tempe

C'est dans l'entre-pont que Kunta s'éveille
Dans le ventre de cette bête qu'il n'avait vu qu'en sommeil
Le corps gisant dans ses propres déjections
Infection d'une centaine de corps en ébullition
Matières fécale et vomissures purulentes blessures brûlantes
Sur fond de mort pullulante fulgurante douleur entre les omoplates
Combien de temps s'écoulèrent depuis qu'ils quittèrent la plage?
Peut être 5, 6, 7 ou 10 jours peu importe ce navire fera demi-tour
Avant que de la mer jaillisse la terre
J'emporterai ces matelots aux portes de l'Enfer
Les toubabs n'ont-ils pas de divinité?
N'ont-ils pas d'enfants ou d'épouses à aimer?
Puisqu'ils violent tuent et souillent de leur sperme
La virginité de nos princesses africaines
Ces toubabs n'ont-ils pas de dignité?
N'ont-ils pas de savoir-vivre à enseigner?
Puisqu'ils frappent fouettent et bien pire encore
En laissant pour morts les moindres recoins de nos corps
Embarqué à bord du Lord Ligonier vendu au profit d'exploitants cotonniers
C'est ce qu'on raconte désormais de ce voyage
Kunta et les autres deviendront des esclaves
Alors profitant d'être sur le pont
Pour l'exercice quotidien, il saisit l'occasion
Le mot mutinerie en Mandingue est prononcé
Et de sa chaîne émoussée, il étrangle le geôlier
Bascule à bâbord c'est le fouetteur qu'il bouscule
À tribord libère ses compagnons de cellule
Bientôt le ponton sera rempli de foyers
D'assez de guerriers pour dérouter le voilier
Mais devant ces bâtons qui crachent le feu
Leurs poitrines se creusent et ils s'écroulent comme des feuilles
Kunta bataille sous les voiles du négrier
Parmi les cris et les tirs de leurs canonniers
Avant qu'une grêle de fouets siffle sur son corps
Tellement fort qu'ils lui sillonneront le cœur
La peau zébrée par des lanières de cuir ou de cuivre
Aucune manière de fuir ou de vivre
Mais bien pire que la mort serait sa captivité
D'effectuer toute sa vie les mêmes activités
À bout de force il n'a plus de plan
Les yeux pleins de sang, il aperçoit la terre des Blancs

Kunta Kinté fut renchainé
Son peuple troqué par centaines de milliers
Enfant du destin
Enfant de la guerre

Mandingues, Soninkés, Peuls, Cereres et Saracoulés
Bambaras, Yoruba, Baoulés, Ashantis, Diolas et Lobis

Toutes les castes, toutes les tribus

Aucune hyène, aussi futée soit-elle
Aussi cruelle, n'est responsable de l'Apartheid

Comprends que les prisons sont des abattoirs
Les ghettos, des labyrinthes pour rats de laboratoires
Et qu'au sommet de la pyramide des espèces
Règne en souverain le pire ami du respect

Qui marchent la terre, sans que repousse le gazon

Aussi versatile, n'a les intentions d'un Janjawid

La vérité se trouve dans les mots du Muppets Show
Crois-moi sur parole, bonhomme ou tombe dans les pommes
La cruauté n'a d’égal que l'imagination de l'homme

À dos gris, telles sont les conneries des pourris
C'est le singe qui descend de l'homme et pas l'inverse
C'est la thèse de Darwin qui a retourné sa veste
J'atteste que cette vie n'est qu'un test
Que le jugement approche pour le clave-es et l'altesse

Médine,"Souvenez-vous, c’était en juillet 2004

Commissariat d’Aubervilliers, déposition
C’est Marie Leblanc qui porte plainte pour agression
Contre une demi-douzaine de méditerranéens
Sanguinaires, maghrébins qui n’avaient rien de caucasiens
En effet, même si la mémoire vous fait défaut
Tels sont les faits, qui sont ces fous?
Quel trajet avez-vous fait?
Marie raconte qu’en ce 9 juillet 2004
Elle se rendait à la plus au nord de toutes les gares
Embarquement 9h37 station Louvres
Sous le wagon la pression souffle et les portes s’ouvrent
20 personnes sont dans la rame
Un mélange de français de souche, de noirs et d’arabes
En parlant d’eux, ils m’ont fusillé des yeux, monsieur
Je n’ai jamais eu aussi peur de la banlieue, monsieur
D’autant plus que je transporte l’enfant
Que j’avais durement mis au monde 13 mois auparavant
C’est d’ailleurs le sujet qui amorcera la discute
Ou bien devrais-je plutôt dire la dispute
Prétextant que la poussette irait bien à sa sœur
Ma dignité a fait les frais du premier agresseur
Un second trouve ma carte en fouillant dans mon sac
Mon adresse postale m’amène dans un cul de sac
Cul sec, c’est la façon dont j’avale ma salive
Lorsqu’ils précisent que le XVIème est rempli de Juifs
Ashkénazes ils sont tous pleins aux as
Pleurnichards à l’occase, ils ne manquent pas d’audace
Marie Leblanc n’est pas au bout de sa fin
Car les 6 barbares découpent désormais ses vêtements féminins
Elle sent le froid de la lame sur sa peau blanche
Les noirs coupent à l’arme blanche la chemise de Miss Leblanc
Et au marqueur laissent un souvenir macabre sur son ventre
Des croix gammées sorties du IIIème Reich
Avant de descendre à Sarcelles-Garges
Tel un scalp d’apache arrache une mèche à sa tignasse
En tout, 13 minutes dans un train d’enfer
Démoniaque signifie le D de ce RER

« Premier titre de ce journal, une jeune femme dans un RER a été agressé par 6 hommes
Parce qu’ils la croyaient juive »

« La France est sous le choc »

« Indignation générale
Condamnation après une agression à caractère antisémite dans le RER au nord de Paris »

« C’est un acte épouvantable »

« De tels actes sont inadmissibles »

« Ça ne doit pas exister »
« C’est la France qui est visée à travers ces actes ignobles »

Le certif médical et le procès verbal
Seront transmis d’Aubervilliers à la PJ de Versailles
En raison du caractère antisémite de l’affaire
Il faut faire sortir cette histoire du rayon faits divers
Les enquêteurs subissent une triple pression
Hiérarchique, politique et publique opinion
Chirac en personne a fait part de son effroi
De Villepin et Nicole Guedj relayés par les médias
Le conflit palestinien nous pend au nez
Il est aux portes de la France, sur la Méditerranée
Il gangrène les banlieues, plongées dans la crise
Dont les ficelles sont tirées par des barbus marionnettistes
Islamistes de surcroît ou du moins deux sur trois
S’ils sont tombés sur elle, la prochaine fois ce sera sur toi
A aucun moment le conditionnel n’est employé
Ni par la classe politique, ni par les chaines télévisée
Pourtant les enquêteurs n’ont d’autre preuve qu’une parole
Pour eux, c’est désormais une histoire qui ne tourne pas rond
Aucune trace des agresseurs sur caméra, mais le pire
Aucune trace de Marie sur les quais de la gare
Au moment des faits un témoin l’aurait vu
Pas à Louvres gare, mais sanglotant sous un abri bus
A l’envers étaient les croix gammées qui collent au corps
Il faut qu’elle collabore pour que l’histoire corrobore
A l’audition les enquêteurs mettent la pression
Ils veulent voir clair en confrontant les deux versions
Trois jours plus tard, la dépo devient pot aux roses
Marie Leblanc a menti parce qu’elle est amoureuse

Et vous, Médine, quelle est votre opinion sur cette affaire?
Affabulation de femme ou défaillance?
De la vengeance dans un costume d’innocence
Pour quelle raison selon vous on vous accuse?
Incarnation commode de français qu’on refuse
La presse doit-elle publier son démenti?
Et qu’elle le fasse pour tous les mensonges à venir
Que pensez-vous ici de l’antisémitisme?
C’est un cancer tout comme l’islamophobie
Arabes et noirs ont-ils eu réparation?
Trois petits points de suspension

En ayant vu tous leurs soldats sous injection létale

Moi j'écris des trucs qui ne se disent pas
Heureusement que ma main droite ne les lit pas
Je te le répète, fuck Le Point, fuck Marianne
Chez nous, leurs éditos servent de litière au chat
Tous ces cons vont s'éteindre, sans avoir été des Lumières
Leur demander ce qu'ils pensent de nous
C'est demander aux chiens ce qu'ils pensent des réverbères
Ils font des lois pour les enfreindre, leurs sourires sont publicitaires
Pour ces ordures, le tri sélectif des déchets, ça commence aux frontières
Le game tombe en ruine
Je l'escalade comme les châteaux d'Uncharted
Rappeurs et journalistes se croient dans la jungle comme El Chapo et Sean Penn
Je leur mets la gueule en chantier, y aura pas d'Akhi, enchanté
Le cygne chante avant de mourir, toi tu ferais mieux de mourir avant de chanter
Boum, tchak, les médias m'haïssent
Pas un endroit de mon corps sans cicatrices
Sais-tu ce qu'on dit du côté de la Jamaïque
Toutes les larmes de l'Afrique font pas pousser le maïs
Records Din, nouveau mode de vie
On ne dit pas des gitans qu'ils font du camping
Mon équipe arrive par la voie des grandes lignes
Dans les bacs d'OGM on est le ver dans le fruit
Indépendants, grandiloquents
Dans moins d'un an, on réédite les Dix Commandements
Le game je réinvente, je vais marquer mon temps
Même si je vends qu'un album comme le clan du Wu-Tang
C'est le nouveau son, grand
Mon nouveau slogan, celui qui dit ni rire ni pleurer mais comprendre
C'est pas du Sagan, soit dit en passant
Je deviendrai peut-être consultant chez Culture France

C'est la force de la culture face à la culture de la force

Médine,"J'suis né le jour de la Saint-Modeste
Ça fait pas d'moi un modèle
J'mériterais même pas la réplique d'un prix Nobel
J'ai des maux d'tête sous l'glaive de Damoclès
Car aucune serrure ne s'ouvre avec des mots-clefs
J'suis haut-normand depuis la sortie du tre-ven
Pas d'outre-Manche, j'arrive en criant par voie basse et pas autrement
Seino-marin élevé au sel marin des Sept Mers
J'suis l'chaînon manquant entre Kersauson et Césaire
J'crois pas qu'le hasard soit l'gérant
J'ai vu du sens dans ma naissance à hôpital Guillaume le Conquérant
Héréditaire s'rait la bravoure de ma Nation
Mais, paraît qu'le courage ça saute une génération
Alors trente ans plus tard j'appellerai mon fils Massoud
Pour en faire un lion féroce, gardien de my soul
Pourtant ni tadjik ni pachtoune
Et bien avant qu'une page tourne
À moins d'seize ans pour l'rap j'engage tout
Parcours épique, épopée d'une équipe
Si l'mektoub était une 'zique moi j'la laisse en repeat
Toujours véridique, c'est le socle de ma vie
Sur le sample de ma vie, Dîn Records en est la rythmique
Élevé en batterie, on est le premier groupe bio
Au scénario digne des longues séries d'HBO
Biopsie d'un biopic qui prend aux tripes
B.O. d'film d'une vie du bic à la billetterie
Track autobiographique
Black and white les potos d'ma clique
On s'bat pour nos droits civiques
Lève le bras devant les complots d'la vie
On braille dans tous les endroits mythiques
Nos raps sortis des tombeaux d'l'Afrique
Gratte des lyrics thérapeutiques
Et scande le slogan ""Don't panik""
Premier studio dans une ancienne régie
Quelques boîtes d'œufs pour l'acoustique feront la tapisserie
On refait le monde jusqu'à pas d'heure
Jusqu'à l'aube et sa pâleur
Avant le Fajr, on décortique les phases de nos fathers
On joue les ""spin doctor"", les pères fondateurs
Bien plus puristes que la foi d'un ""five percenters""
Parfois la politique peut s'avérer très poétique
Alors comment ne pas trouver le rap si romantique?
Alors comment ne pas trouver le rap si romantique?
Comment ne pas trouver le rap romantique?

J'ai fait le tour de ma vie sur des notes
Pour qu'on m'ouvre les portes, ouais
Du paradis des poètes
J'ai tout donné pour écrire mon époque
Sur des pages j'ai gravé ma vie de bohème
Entre mes doutes et mon bonheur
Tant que je garderai mon honneur
Je ferai le tour de ma vie sur des notes
Au paradis des poètes

Toute ressemblance avec des personnes existantes n'a rien d'fortuite
Si j't'évoque de mauvais moments, que Dieu me forgive
J'pensais pas qu'un jour j'raconterais cette histoire
Non pas par pudeur mais parce que j'pensais pas l'avoir
Si j'ai un nœud dans les entrailles, des larmes dans la voix
C'est qu'la douleur est une faiblesse qu'on ne montre pas
J'préfère m'déclencher un ulcère que d'grimacer dans l'effort
C'est tout le mental Dîn Records
Usine à valeur, fabriquant de contenu
Artisans du slogan et ouvriers d'la grande plume
On était tout sauf un label ordinaire
Avec pour pierre angulaire la pratique d'un art populaire
Aucune guerre se mène au pistolet à air
Avec la rue on a vécu qu'une relation épistolaire
Plutôt l'air de s'perdre, espère voir quelques lueurs d'espoir
Mais notre histoire intraçable comme un donneur de sperme
Nous étions des pêches échouées loin du pêcher
Qui n'voulaient pas d'poison mais souhaitaient apprendre à puncher
Des ambitions qui dépassent le mont Rushmore
Après Abdoulaye Diarra moi j'serai le meilleur story-teller
Une demi-dizaine de disque s'ensuivra
La vie d'famille se consumera dans des heures d'studio inchiffrables
C'que l'on sait moins, c'est qu'les idéalistes n'ont pas d'vie
Ils savent quand ça commence, mais rarement quand ça s'termine
Malgré tout, j'donnerai tout pour converser d'son
Pour une conversation sincère sur un beat de fond
C'est la cause qui nous a réunis, est-ce elle qui nous séparera?
Est-ce qu'on s'parlerait s'il n'y avait pas eu l'rap?
Alors tribute au noble art, à ces pairs qui nous font honneur
À tout ces indés qui font mentir les chiffres des monarques
J'en crache un mollard, aux snobeurs
Détenteurs de valeurs de merde
Les sauvés sont souvent ceux qui s'prennent pour les sauveteurs en mer

J'ai fait le tour de ma vie sur des notes

Mais depuis quelques temps, j'ai comme perdu la foi
J'ai comme un voile devant la vue qui me perturbe la voix
J'me vois comme un bénévole parmi les traders
Qui spéculent sur la fin du film sans même avoir vu l'trailer
Ou comme un pudique dans un film de boule
Les on-dit diront qu'j'suis tiraillé du prénom comme le fils Debbouze
J'porte un costard trop large pour mes épaules
Moi qui voulais faire du rap français une passerelle vers les grandes écoles
Mais pour les gens d'la profession, donner du sens avant du son
Dans nos chansons c'est donner d'la confiture à des cochons
De la fioriture dans nos bandes-sons et paraboles
Tous de mèche pour produire plus de merdes qu'Endemol
Et quand le doute s'installe, il pollue tout c'qu'il croise
Ma conviction s'ébranle, j'ai l'impression d'faire du remplissage
D'être devenu comme c'que j'ai toujours combattu :
Un con d'l'actu qui calcule, un incongru que l'on congratule
Une figure publique qui sans cesse doit faire bonne face
Suis-je devenu un faussaire comme dans le bouquin d'Boniface?
Est-ce que je fais du rap ou est-ce le rap qui me fait?
En effet, peu d'choses me séparent d'un Keen'V
Mais qui n'a jamais pêché me jette la première pierre
Mes mots sont p't-êt' à l'origine d'un dernier spliff ou d'une dernière bière
J'ai p't-êt' changé des vies, fait se rencontrer des cœurs
Suscité des vocations de journaliste-reporter
J'ai pas à rougir d'un parcours plus qu'honorable
J'ai comme aura que mon rap et le bien comme morale
Chef caporal de toute une armée d'auditeurs qui m'honorent
Par leur écoute et me connaissent mieux qu'Akinator
C'est à eux qu'je pense quand j'martèle le clavier
Écartèle le papier, quand je parle des quartiers yeah
Qu'ils continuent à me transmettre le juice
J'continuerai d'donner du taf au webmaster du site Rap Genius
J'rapperai à bout d'souffle jusqu'à l'écoulement nasal
Aussi vrai qu'j'suis ton vassal Alassane, Proof
T'es le master de mon groove
Depuis toujours mon double
Tu m'sers des loop de ouf à la louche
Une chose est sûre : il n'y a rien que je regrette
Et si c'était à refaire, avec les mêmes personnes je recrée
J'renouvelle mes vœux du feu sacré dans les cieux
Si l'amour rend aveugle, j'crois que l'amitié ça crève les yeux
Mon nom d'famille c'est Din Records, prénom Médine
J'suis l'homme aux mille concerts donnés aux allures de meetings
J'porte mes t-shirts comme des pancartes de manifs
Mes fans sont mes amis et mes amis sont tous de ma mif'
J'suis un Jedi venu d'ailleurs avec mon beatmaker
J'ramène l'équilibre à la force même sans Skywalker
J'ai dit ""non"" comme Amy en rehab
J'm'enfermerai pas non plus dans l'image du muslim réac'
Si t'as l'adresse du Paradis, petit passe le lien
Car sur bwin.com j'ai pas vu d'paris pascaliens
Je suis un loup que certains ont pris pour berger
J'me laverai d'mes pêchés dans les bains d'foule du Bourget
En attendant j'me dois d'être droit, d'être digne car
Encore dans ma ville certains appellent leur fils ""Médine""
En hommage à cet artiste politique qui
Trouvait qu'le rap avait quelque chose de romantique

Jamais un album ne m'aura pris autant de temps
Cinq ans, cinq ans d'absence, cinq ans d'épreuves, de remise en question, de doutes
Alors quand les professionnels de la musique, analyseront les ventes de la première semaine
Moi, je me souviendrais des heures de studio inchiffrables, de toutes les fois où j'ai dis à ma femme:
""je reviens dans deux heures grand max""
De ces nuits blanches qui ne prenaient fin qu'avec la sonnerie de l'école maternelle ""Edouard Vaillant""
Des discussions avec Proof et Salsa, des marathons à travers la France
De salles de concert en cabine d'enregistrement
On se souvient surtout dans ces moments, de tout ce que les gens ne pourront que supposer
J'me donne pas d'excuse, je ne cherche pas à susciter une quelconque empathie
J'ai pas à me plaindre, on pourra certainement me compter parmi les chanceux
J'marche avec les mêmes gars depuis la primaire
Le rap nous a réuni et aujourd'hui le rap nous fait vivre

Tu crois qu'y'a qu'à Paris qu'on accueille bien les Qataris?
Ferme ton bec, ravale tes blagues raciales
Ou dans ton bled, tu t'feras rare comme un black-asiat'

Rien à battre qu'tu sois un brave muslim
Vu qu'un Arabe qui fait du rap, reste un Arabe qui gâte ma black music
Tu t'chies dessus quand c'est la tempête
Donc laisse nos panthères noires, t'aurais du appeler ton album ""Arabian Pampers""

Tu crois réunir les Noirs avec ton ""Noir Désir""?
Mais t'es qu'un demi-leader, comme Harlem Désir
Avec vos différences de langue tous les dix villages
Si les Noirs sont divisés, c'est qu'ils sont divisables

Tu divagues ! J'ai pas besoin qu'on m'accepte chez les macrelles
La pire des négrophobies, moi je l'ai subie au Maghreb
M'appelle pas ""khouya"" : on sait qu'vous êtes racistes
Et aucun Nègre n'oubliera que les Arabes étaient esclavagistes

Parle-moi plutôt de l'esclavage des Noirs eux-mêmes

Ils négligent leurs femmes, excisées à la clé à molette

Médine,"Le bus m'emmène dans la ville d'Hébron
Ancienne cité, à la minorité d'hébreux
Souffleur de verre pour le compte de mon oncle
Mon nom c'est Daoud un arabe au regard ténébreux
Je suis né dans ce genre de nid, tout près du quartier juif en Cisjordanie
Jamais je ne sors la nuit
Pas pas peur du noir, mais par un couvre-feu qu'on me force à suivre
Mon défunt frère est mort l'an passé
Officiellement, pour défaut de laisser-passer
Il voulait faire de mes seize ans un jour exceptionnel
C'était sans compter Tsahal et son excès de zèle
La garde-frontière en charge de son contrôle
À cru drôle d'ouvrir la boîte au couteau commando
Celle qui contenait le keffieh traditionnel
Et qui le soir constituerait le fraternel cadeau
Gâteau vandalisé par les gants de cuir
D'une soldate qui n'avait que l'intention de nuire
Une vexation à laquelle mon frère réplique
Par des insultes et des menaces en langue arabe et en hébraïque
""De quels droits tu crois pouvoir me gâcher la fête
Je ferais de toi ma chèvre si j'avais l'doigt sur la gâchette
Enlève tes sales pattes tout de suite de sur cette écharpe""
Aveuglé par la colère un coup lui échappe
Il lui en fallut pas plus pour que le canon crache le feu
Un triplé d'M16 dans le poitrail qui craque le mieux
Ce furent les derniers mots de mon frère
Et leur sens était dirigé en ma faveur
Alors aujourd'hui à la date anniversaire
Je m'apprête à rendre la pareille à l'adversaire
Qui m'a ôté la compagnie de mon ainé, de mon bien-aimé
M'a pris une large part de mon âme peiné
On me prêtera des intentions politiques
Les médias du monde diront que je suis croyant fanatique
Que j'ai agi programmé par un parti terroriste
Et qu'aussi j'enterre ici tout espoir de paix possible
J'aurais milles raisons de m'ceinturer le torse
Ce qu'a enduré mon peuple dans un sanctuaire de la mort
Ces blocus, mépris, obus, phosphore blanc occulte, bouscules, l'ONU qui fait semblant
Interdiction d'accès à certaines professions
Et sur ta carte d’identité, on y appose ta confession
C'est donc ça la seule démocratie du Proche-Orient
Agir en toute impunité sans qu'on lui reproche rien
Mais ma vengeance n'est que personnelle
Lorsqu'on arrive près du checkpoint et des criminels
Dans le bus, dix personnes tout au plus
Un enfant étrange qui vient de monter semble perdu
Ses yeux me fixent avec insistance
J'ai la drôle impression qu'il cherche assistance
Mais mon pouce a déjà enfoncé le bouton rouge
C'est ici que se rencontrent David et Daoud

Leur demander ce qu'ils pensent de nous, c'est demander aux chiens ce qu'ils pensent des réverbères
Ils font des lois pour les enfreindre, leurs sourires sont publicitaires
Pour ces ordures, le tri sélectif des déchets, ça commence aux frontières

Même si je vends qu'un album comme le clan du Wu-Tang
C'est le nouveau son, grand
Mon nouveau slogan, celui qui dit ni rire ni pleurer mais comprendre
C'est pas du Sagan, soit dit en passant

Medium Cool,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Niggas used to hate me, turn into my friends
You should see how people treat you when that money coming in
Bad bitches callin’ cause I'm ballin’
And these niggas hatin’ on me cause they starvin'
And I'm parkin' Aston Martins where they walkin'
These niggas ain't important
They informants really talkin' when them people get to honkin'
I'm a boss really, Nino or Al Pacino
Hundred racks on his Rollie, he light up like a casino
Niggas really be fraudin', I’ma keep it a C note
Got shooters down in Miami, they throw it like Dan Marino

Huh
Rozay
Had a couple seizures, call 'em minor setbacks
Everybody prayin' for me, I respect that
Woke up in the hospital, where my checks at
Then I put eight chains where my necks at
Hoppin' in the Ghost, I feel I'm best at
Worth forty M's, I respect that
I put all my jewels on just to bone your chick
You know the boss well known for leavin' bonuses
We makin' money, may it marinate
When the work clean, cut it like it’s carrot cake
D-boys love the way I narrate
I still whip it like it’s Anna Mae
Remember Momma had a Cavalier
Now she livin' like a Cleveland Cavalier
Better check the stats, we fillin' arenas
And I got the gats, Gilbert Arena’s

Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh)
I call the calls (huh)
We in this bitch
It’s goin’ down
Yeah, I'm the king
Now where my mufuckin’ crown?

If you a boss, you a boss
Seven five, seven showers on her
Spend about thirteen hours on it
757 with the showers on it
We spent about thirteen hours on it

Look, I be probably on my skateboard, tryna learn a new trick
I just fucked a Avatar, now I got a blue dick
Money talks, bullshit walks if the shoe fit
You pushin' up daisies, daffodils, tulips
I'm in my zone, I'm Angie Stoned
I point the pistol at you like a camera phone
I'm Young Money, Cash Money, I'm not human
Boy I’m tryna get money, money like Mark Cuban
If she don’t respect me, she gon' respect this dick
The world is a asshole and we the next big shit
Damn right I gang bang, tell 'em blood up slime
Fuck, I had to say fuck one time, get it

When I came up in this bitch I was shinin' every summer
Took the whole thing, the young nigga doin' numbers
Tote two nines bitch, iced out stuntin’
Candy on the ave, candy on the slab
Hundred G’s nigga, Cash Money Millionaires
Hundred mill nigga, how we flipped it off the ave
Blood rich gang, you know we filthy nigga
The money do swing, behind a killin' nigga
Catch me uptown puttin’ it down
Movin' all around, new fleets with my round
Touch another town, puttin’ it all down
Pop a hundred bottles bitch, we wear the crown

Bitch I'm a boss (huh)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (huh)
I call the calls (huh)
We in this bitch
It’s goin’ down
Yeah, I'm the king
Now where my mufuckin’ crown?

If you a boss, you a boss
Seven five, seven showers on her
Spend about thirteen hours on it
757 with the showers on it
We spent about thirteen hours on it

Scissors, clippers, please forgive me
Real nigga, hoes around me

Finally got a rich nigga, baby, you made it
Long as you hold me down, you know that it's goin' down
Be there when I turn around and I'll turn your world around

Meek Mill,"Yeah, I was on that corner, tryna get my coins up
Coppers run up on us and we turn to Jackie Joyner
White man kill a black man, they never report us
Black man kill a white man, they gon' start a war up
Mama she was sour, sippin' on the Absolut
Young niggas brainwashed, they just wanna rap and hoop
Could've been a lawyer until they came and shackled you
Felons on your records so them jobs ain't gettin' back at you
Them kids ain't eat yet, so you can't even sleep yet
That's the only thing we ever saw, we repeat that
They was playing ball, fouled him hard, said I'd be back
Broad day, threw his life away, soon as he clapped
Gave that boy a life sentence, made his mama relapse
Damn, they don't understand
Comin' from the bottom, it's so hard to make a plan
Know them kids beefin', they let it get out of hand
OGs never told us nothin' in advance
Young niggas killing young niggas, shit is like the Klan, I said
Told my young nigga, ""You the man,"" I said
You don't wanna end up like my man Ahmed
Praying five times a day, prostration on his head
Screamin' ""Insha'Allah"" that he don't make it to the feds
Caught up in the system, visit from his sister
Talkin' 'bout all these niggas, how they ain't even with him
Said that they would ride or die, but it ain't even in 'em
Always postin' on the 'Gram, but hey ain't sendin' pictures
Never answer when you call, but answer for them bitches
Got you thinking twice, damn I should've been a witness
Dismantle my business, just telling my story
All guts, no glory, been going on before me
We slaves in the Forties, still slaves in the present
No toys for Christmas, ain't get us no presents
Only made us evil, made us hungry, made us desperate
Youngin' in the ninth grade, he got a Smith and Wesson
Grew up with the goons, now he need protection
He dropped outta school, then he got arrested
Lord with a blessing, I just hope he learned his lesson
They told us, if we go to jail, we would be respected
They told us, if we make a sale, we would run a check in
Threw a rock out in that field, he got intercepted
He stumbled, he fumbled, y'all niggas just rumble
They told you to hustle, them niggas don't love you

Young black American (na na)
Wanna live like the fairer skin (na na)
Fall to the paradigm (na na)
Occupied on that Marilyn (na na)
The prophecies of the wild nigga, no church
My uncles said stop bitching nigga, no skirts
It's kinda crazy there's another world on the other side of town
Pastor rollin' up in that Rolls
Pullin' up in that Holy Ghost
Preaching, while niggas dying by the Bible code
The destruction, the hate
The obstruction of my faith
My prayers, my faith
Will never be the same

Meek Mill,"Ain't this what they've been waiting for?
You ready?

I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, ""Yeah, I do""
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said, ""Achoo""
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please before them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and hated when I was departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawling, went straight to walkin' with foreign cars in my garage
Got foreign bitches menaging, fuckin', suckin', and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga I'm fly-er
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater rest in peace
Hater rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, it can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' bout my niggas then what you talkin' bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve fuck nigga
Hold up wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
When I bought that Aston Martin y'all thought it was rented?
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm the lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo, my new bitch, she'll ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hands strapped around my toes
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my momma need that bill money and my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke
All I know is murder, when it comes to me
I got young niggas that's rollin' I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOAs I done did the KODs
Every time I'm in that bitch I get to throwin' 30 G's
Now I'm hanging out that drop head, I'm riding down on Collins
They like, my nigga back home that young nigga be wildin'
We young niggas and we mobbin' like Batman and we're Robin
This 2-door Maybach, with my seat all reclinin'
I'm that real nigga what up, real nigga what up
If you ain't about that murder game then pussy nigga shut up
If you diss me in yo' raps, I'll get your pussy ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA, at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet, like that little engine I could
Boy I slide down on your block, bike on twelve o'clock
And they be throwing deuces on the same nigga they watch
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still calling them shots
And these lames talking that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hating on me, hoes waiting on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money have ya friends turn into enemies
And with these beef I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go from 40 ain't no 10 a key, hold up
Broke nigga turn rich, love the game like Mitch
And if I leave you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was something 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feeling like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone",Dreams and Nightmares

My trigger finger itchin', Palms itchin' too
We back-to-back in ghosts, playin' peek-a-boo
We went to war with Sosa over a brick or two
So for a hundred ki's, think what my clique could do
I'm talkin' clappin' toasts, bullets 'll hit your roof
They hit his body he went in shock, no Pikachu

Niggas ain’t bout it they talkin’ but really pick and choose

Sold your soul to them people, they gon’ get you to sell it
They gon’ get you to move it, they gon’ get you a buick
They gon’ get you a wire, like niggas gon’ use it
You gon’ tell on your brothers, what a lame homie
I got a bullet with your name on it, and a full clip I autographed
Kids cryin’ at the viewing, I guess it was upset

We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best

First time he went to prison he ain’t get to leave
Feds takin’ pictures, niggas is rats, you should say cheese
Once a local dude, shit the fire now
Never ever spit a rap but he got bars now
I’m talkin` fed time, yard up, yard down

Baby mama can’t pay the bills, shit is hard now
How that make you feel, you should pay them bills
MA spittin in them trays when they make yo’ meal
Niggas shittin’ out them packs just to take them pills
And his baby mama brought em in, boy this shit is real

Niggas turn to Muslim, niggas turn to Christian
They gave him life, he try’n appeal it, got him on a mission
His homies ain’t learn, they still in the kitchen
They firin’ bullshit, that coka ain’t swimmin’
It’s coming up short, no food on the fork
Niggas is catchin’ cases, niggas is goin’ to court
He done slaved in the field, you the one on the porch

Was the city’s most wanted ‘til I said gimme yo number
Youngest nigga I’m stuntin’, no more Civics from Honda
Money comin’ in bundles, that’s the reason she wanna

Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up

I keep a vest on my chest, to cover my heart
I’d rather fuck in the light, ‘fore I make love in the dark
'Cause she was fuckin’ me right, it felt like love from the start
Was gettin’ money on tour, so we was lovin’ for fall
But first we go together then break up, tears drip on her makeup
Fuck all night ‘til we wake up, and like George Gervin we lay up
'Cause all them lies I made up, it’s big checks no pay cut

Floor seats in Florida, Heat game vs Lakers
Shorty on my team now, it was us versus them haters
And everybody they talk bad, when they talk that she take up
She mess our flavor, young boy get paper,
And all I know is go hard, and every time
I touch that ball I go swish

She know it’s game time when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (Don’t miss), I don’t miss (Don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

Sittin’ back with this paper fallin’ in my lap
Feelin’ isolated nothin’ but them hundred stacks
When your money up tell me who you’re supposed to trust
Every night a different woman, fuck your money up
My bank account in shape, I could run with Puff
I came to put you down shorty so what the fuck is up
Since I met her she can’t keep that pussy off me
On the pill, Ima kill that pussy softly
Back to back time to show you how a gangster move
Keys to the pad, talkin’ infinity pools
V12’s ain’t a thang, time to change your name
Paper stuffed in her purse can’t hear her phone ring

She know it’s game time when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back

She be tryna lay up, all right

They be fishin’ for compliments, I’m just fishin’ off Boca
Made a grip off them vocals, got a gift with the vocals
So much over these hoes should have been on a poster
Infatuated to say the least
He lay it weak, I lay you once you lay a week
Wale a freak, he know it doe, no go with hoes
When it come to showin’, I am working with totem pole
That’s head on head, she give me head, I give her glow
I’m in her body, I’m in her head like quote unquote
The coldest flow, the flyest combination was voila

I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

From the night to the morn’, yeah she tryna lay
Got a freaky, freaky game and she tryna play
Couple more shots baby can you make it stay, stay up
Lay up, lay up
Might just slap the backboard, give you what you ask for

Meek Mill,"Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

I think Ima dedicate this one
To all the people that thought I wouldn't make it here
Dream chasers

Yeah, it was all a dream
On the corner servin' all them fiends
Me and a bunch of my niggas, yeah, we was all a team
The system labeled us killas, but momma called us kings
Walked through the hall of a prison, now it's the hall of fame
And people got the nerve to ask why I wear all these chains
When I was booked, they had me shackled to the wall of shame
So I'm just representin', better yet just reminiscin'

Put down on that Bentley truck, I used to want the Expedition
Now it's bigger things, grew up and got bigger dreams
Cause in my hood, niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine
And this money shit ain't funny, all the shit it brings
You bound to lose your family and your friends, boy this shit is mean
And birthdays was the worst days
Last week I made a hundred on a Thursday
And Club Liv got me sinnin' on a church day
Stevie J all on the mic, he screamin' out my birthplace
Philly, we back!

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

I'm blunted, you wanna see life's meaning?
On the radio, Al Green, while Mom's cleanin'
Mom's singing along with the songs
And shortly I learned the words to 'em
Nerf balls, I threw 'em
But now I'm a perfectionist to a fault like Jesus
Judgin' his own miracles, but he won't cause he automatic
I'm like an old blues singer living in the bottle
Whose wife left him down in the bottom
Writing songs is how we solvin' the problem
My liquid money's a hypnotist to your Mrs

Lay back like I'm in the chair of a dentist
Nasir relentless, a freak like Prince is
Mystique like Sade
Soon as I enter people, point and see my anointment
I ain't tryna do too much
Same time, I ain't no bum nigga not doin' enough
But I ain't tryna do no dumb shit, chasin' my tail in a circle
I made it so I'm chillin' now
Transparent ceiling now


Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

The chorus cinematic, going back to Cali
Young street nigga, late 80's suede Bally's
Jewels like Rick the Ruler, looking like I ripped the jeweler
I could cut a check, make some people hit your shooter
Domino effect, you in that magic city
Where all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli
Coming from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly
Young legend outta Queens, take over city to city
Honor thou mother, go to war for my brother
Giving sufficient funds to significant others
Went from poor now women screamin' for my signature
More war came from the bottom so I know the war
Never worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm
Talking cash over salads, heavy croûtons
Cuban Linx's equivalent to having suits on
Stretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed",Maybach Curtains
Meek Mill,"Yeah, yeah
I remember

I remember nights I used to sell rock, posted on the corner like a mailbox
First class ticket to a cell block, just to get some Polo and some shell tops
Cold world and they say hell's hot
But it ain't hotter than that choppa when them shells drop
Man I seen niggas play that block and get they bell rocked
Cops cleared the scene and I was back by twelve o'clock
Tryna get it, Dickies on and my fitted
Gun in my draws, ducking the law, I'm all with it
Money, cars and clothes, I wanted 'em all nigga
I never was good at hoopin', I wanted to ball nigga
Cause the OG's sold keys and I had no cheese
Coppers lock me, beat me down like I was Cochise
Old fiends coppin' work through their old dreams
They got shattered, it ain't matter cause we thirst cream
Niggas serving niggas moms just to make a flip
Homies murder other homies just to make a brick
Most my niggas done got busted tryna take a hit
The feds were lurking, we was serving, they was taking flicks

This how it goes down in the jungle
Where niggas learn to shoot before they could rumble
Cops rushing, they gon' kick in the front door
And if they chase you better hope you don't stumble
I wanted Polo with some shell tops
I just wanted Polo and some shell tops
And I was out there tryna sell rocks
Cause I wanted Polo and some shell tops

I done seen close neighbours lose hope
Fall victim to the streets and start to use dope
I used to load my gun before I went to school first
It's crazy niggas wanna kill me, we was cool first
And when it comes to friends you can't let 'em too close
That's why they call 'em close friends, you turn your back they move first
And I just bought a new Ghost, and a crib out on that new coast
And it all started from a dolla
Running from the law, scuffing up my Pradas
Crack all in my draws, tryna make a profit
All I wanted was some shells and some Polo for my closet, aww
Drug money, turn to blood money
I only roll with niggas that'll take a slug for me
No matter what it is, I'mma pay that bail money
To get my niggas right, my niggas for life!

Riding through my city with a chick I used to lust
Bout to make a movie starring me, the two of us
Penthouse at the top floor, elevator shooters up
So I can eat that pussy for breakfast, dinner, and lunch
And uh, she been waiting all night for this hard pipe
I think she called twice
Before you knew it I pulled in she seen them fog lights
And I can see it in her face she had a hard night
Up and down that pole selling dreams, selling love
It was sort of like she serving fiends and selling drugs
Giving them a fix, body solid as a brick
With no baking soda on it I went raw every time I hit
Life's a bitch but I go deep up in that pussy Jerry Rice
And every time I'm in the building I ain't never like
She be on that pole, tryna chase her goals
Going up and down like that angel on that Rolls. Lord Knows!

Shorty so pretty and that pussy so good
She used to say I was crazy, I was up to no good
Till I slid all in it, started fucking her good
Red bottom, I damn near had a crush in the hood
I slid up in the ass and she heard them pipes they was growling
Friends wanting to fuck me because they like how I'm styling
But I'm cool on the snaking cause I like when she smiling
We gon' leer in the air just to get right on an island
We ball harder, ball horrible out in Florida
Isabel Marant sneakers, you got all of them
Tatted up, passports just to cross borders
She calling me daddy and I ain't got a daughter
Said I'm cooler than them other dudes
Five racks just to get her Cinderella shoes

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
She gripping on my H belt, but I tell her grab it for me
She was messing with me way before I had the money
You niggas playing games, I'm really getting mad money
Just to commentate, peep how I operate
I put your chick up in this ghost, Bet she cooperate
I really balling, tat em all up in and out of state
Been getting money for a while, I don't know how to hate
They call me racked up shorty, she can smell the Aura
Had her out in Bora exploring like she was Dora
Million dollar sponsor, spoiled her like my daughter
And put her in the game, She ain't fucking with lames",Rich & Famous
Meek Mill,"Paulie killed Tony right and Tony killed Ty so it was only right
Bring 'em back twenty years, they was homies, tight
Sixth grade, for the love of the paper ain't nothing nice
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles, blowing paper
Balling hard, he know they hating
But they gon' respect it, cause he rocked Tony
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding, they ready to fall for him
'Cause word on the street that Paulie did that
Used Key gold digging ass to get back
Text him through her phone, found out where he live at
She woke up in the morning like, I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth, fitting to start a war
'Cause Tony's little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law (LOOORD)
And Paulie on a rise now
Niggas that played the middle picking sides now
Plus he heard Tony's brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head, he gotta die now

Paulie's youngest on the corner
Tony's little brother he slipping, yea he's a goner
Fucking with that lean, he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired, niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too, reach and fixing to get up on 'em
The gat jam, he bang back trying to avoid 'em
Them niggas dumping, he get up running and hitting on 'em
He hit the alley, get a body he dipping on 'em
Said it's on now, try and kill 'em it's war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feeling like he dead there ain't no remorse now
Getting high and he thinking 'bout kicking in doors now
Momma and little kids get on the floor now
Finger on the trigger he feel that it's going down
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
Cause they sad when it rain it really gon' pour down
And it's raining like Katrina, he got thirty in his nina
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his beamer
Paulie wasn't in it when he heared it he was steaming
Addicted to the murder so you know that nigga fiendin'
And he want this nigga dead before Sunday hit
But youngin' tryna live on some Sunday shit
And time fly fast it was Monday quick
And paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show 'em how it's done so he loadin' up his gun
And show this young nigga he fuck with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin' the long gun
And it's on sight he don't give a fuck if the law come

So he out here
Ridin' dirty put down them birdies
And without fear niggas lurking
They tryna murder heared he out there
Niggas spin 'em they tryna hit 'em
Hitting every corner seeing niggas but he ain't with 'em
Youngin' layin' low he know Paulie ain't playin' though
There's money on his head and niggas is sayin' go
But youngin' he ain't scared, he cool as a fan though
He know it's get down with that burner or end up a tag-toed
It was four in the morn', Paulie goin' home
Windshields wiping, middle of the rain storm
And Paulie he ain't slipping yeah he got that thang on
You know what he did to Tony he won't get the same song so
When he hit the crib he spin the block before he park it
Paulie ain't bitch at all Paulie just cautious
But little did he know niggas in the streets talking
And out his rear view it's like he seen a reaper walking
Nigga with a hoodie all you hear is heaters sparking
Shot hit the window get low he tryna off him
Youngin' boxed him in and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching, trigger squeezing, trying get him off him
Them shots ringing youngin' squeezing clip empty
That's when Paulie rose like Derrick, put six in him
Walked down on him he laying in a puddle
Looked him in the face, ""you ain't learn from your brother nigga?""","Tony Story, Pt. 2"
Meek Mill,"It really hurt me when they killed Shotty
I was locked down in my cell and I had to read about it
And when they killed Diddy, left him out in Philly
We was young and gettin' money, man we used to run the city
We was rockin' all them shows, fuckin' all them hoes
And when they killed Darryl, Renee had to see him froze on the ground
Downtown, I can hear the sounds now

When she walked up to that casket seen her son and fell down
I drop tears for my niggas that ain't here
And still think about you even though that it been years
Cause half the niggas that I grew up with is all dead
All this pain and all this stressin' I should have a bald head
Cause when my Aunt Rhonda died she looked Tock in his eyes
Saw death comin', when she seen it she just cried
Prolly part of the reason we drink and we get high
When I find the nigga that killed my daddy know Ima ride

Hope you hear me, Ima kill you nigga
To let you know that I don't feel you nigga
Yeah, you ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
Cuz I was only a toddler, you left me traumatized
You made me man of the house and it was grindin' time
So Ima let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days Ima let this rain hit you nigga

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry

And I ain't ready
Niggas wanna murder me I'm ridin' around heavy
I think they wanna wet me like New Orleans and the levees
But I got this mac elevy, these niggas 'll never get me
Lord knows, I got a lotta homies in the dirt
Niggas sprayin' metal tryna take you off the earth
Really over nothin', tell me what it's worth
Tryna take you out the game just to put you on a shirt

I Rose from the jungle like Derrick
Death to anybody that oppose my spirit
My future lookin' brighter than this rose I'm starin' at
We be runnin' trains on the hoes y'all cherish
Rest in peace to my niggas, I swear I miss them to death
My hammer sing murda music, I'll let you listen to death
I'll have you walk with the reaper when hollows rip through your chest
Cause if you throw 'em I throw back like Mitchell and Ness
I'm gone

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry

And for all them cloudy days Ima let this rain hit you nigga

Man my life so real
Last night I went to sleep and woke up with the chills
Started with a dollar now I got a couple mil
And I make a hundred thousand every time a nigga spill
Man I almost got murked in front of the same church
My dad got carried in, family got married in
That was in my older days, this is now, that was then
Had the block jumpin' for them dollars, Shawn Marion
Young nigga gon' get my own that's why I'm arrogant
Homie need the bail, for them bonds we'll bury 'em
Lock 'em like a terrier
Breakin' all barriers

Just to beat the trial we go miles like Darius
Cause cops tryna catch me, niggas tryna clap me
Haters runnin' at me, know they wanna get at me
And people got the nerve to ask why I don't look happy
I did it for my niggas, and I did this shit for Kathy

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

Prolly bring my father back, just so he could witness me
Back up in my zone I swear my haters is history
Bitches say they missin’ me, I never fall for it
`Cause they just miss the money, they know I go hard for it
And if my niggas need it, I tell ‘em come for it
'Cause when it comes to me, they shootin’ like a small forward, swish

Know they hatin on the rise and the chilled I spin.
In the Phantom, I'm lookin fly in whatever I'm in
Mostly you big niggas soft like the Michelin man.
When you see other niggas standin with a pencil in hand
Carry me on stage rappin with my dick in my hand.
Tryna distiguish the difference between a bitch and a fan

Ridin round in the Kia, no spare tires
Chopper round shots fired,
Nigga flatlines zip came to it and keep the powder savoral.
Drive bys on dirt bike with Meek Milli O.
Crow rock shells,
I bleach em and watch em fade away.
And leave a nigga block,
Wetter than a rainy day
West beat Beavis when you scared to leave the crib.
Guzzi and he inspired for some of the dolla mill.
I'm worth mills and I beat a niggas ass still
Ya'll niggas get wasted I ain't talkin spilled bills.
School a hunt knox I'm a hate a cheetah.

Cause I broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right
But you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight
So they don't deserve it, it feel like it's perfect
I'm loving your style the way you preserve it
You look at my eyes and see what's inside
You know that it's pride and know that I'm worth it
But said I ain't ready, baby I'm ready
Really I'm ready I'm ready like never before
I'mma just give you a key to my heart
You'll be the first that I let in the door
I used to hear that you flirt with them guys
They never would score
All you would hear about me was the women
Ain't trust them before
You know what you're doing, fuck what they said
You know what we on, when we in bed it's like we on stage
And I got the mic so let me perform
Sing it

You bring a feeling to me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'mma good girl
But I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad",Bad for You

Meek Mill,"Oh it’s hot outside man
Meek Millys coming daddy

Hundred for the walkthrough Im not who you talk to
Drive by wet you up, nigga thats a carpool
Spitting all this hot shit, every single bar cool
Diamonds in the rollie face, animated cartoon
Call me Meek Milly I don't play that shit
Got me on my nappy braids before the Maybach clique
Riding in the wheels of fortune, Pat Sajak shit
And all I rock is Balmain like I made that shit
I’ve been, front row fashion week
Looking like I'm in the show
Sitting in the foreign leather, softer than a dinner roll
Make a movie on your bitch, tell her friend to get a role
You thought she was innocent
We laughing like she been a ho
Chopping up those benzos
Me yo bitch in the friend zone
She told you I was friendzoned, what?
I'm in the endzone
Touchdown with a 2 point conversion
Give her that dick long
She busting like the clip long
Uber to send your bitch home nigga

I got a fever bitch, hot outside I got a fever bitch
Feeling sick I gotta fever bitch
In these philly streets situations is
Police ain’t respecting the youth and
The youth ain't respecting the truth and
The Glock 9 on me in the booth and
All I talk is that real shit the truth and

The money turned your bitch into a gold digger
The money got me feeling like the old Jigga
And Jigga even told me you a cold nigga
They ain’t believe me I was broke
But I showed niggas and I told niggas
That I would dispose niggas
Went to buy a pair of sneaks
Landed at the rawest dealer
Brand new paper tag
Haters never made me mad
You get at your baby momma
I’m flyer than her baby dad
Looking at my neck
What that cost? Hundred-eighty cash
Looking at my bitch, she remind me of a Stacey Dash
We was selling rock before Kareem Biggs, Dame and Dash
Oh you think you fly with your lil' dream chasin’ ass?
We don’t chase bitches, we chase money and that [D'ussé]
Cause when you get money, the hoes do whatever you say
Riding in a drop head, Phantom with the toupe
And if you’re just hearing this, then it’s probably too late

I got a fever bitch, hot outside I got a fever bitch
Feeling sick I gotta fever bitch

Meek Milly
Mack Milly
Get smacked silly
Come to Philly
Come see it live and direct
You know it, God dammit",Classic
Meek Mill,"Yeah, yeah
I never had a role model
I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40
A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they ? me
Nigga's is jealous
Fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try sell us
Probably why I'm rebellious
To the fraud niggas, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll up and smoke you like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and you're homie chilling and
You know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you
Instead wait for them haters because they'll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small sucker, I ain't never really around squares
They say it levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bosses
Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly that shit cold
Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall
And that was A1, they thinking how we get this far?
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't deem me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like ? but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?
Go ? all bust down, fuck clowns

My heart getting cold
Then the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day
Young lord knows

Dedicated, de-terminated and disciplined
When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking I'm listening
When I be in the jungle the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling, that was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur
I was like told y'all
Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's going I got your medulla
? I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
If I don't get he'll probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?
Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me
Getting high even though ?
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did

Ayo
It gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit, money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you ""you acting different nigga""
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
With all this motherfucking money
But then when it comes from your brother, your sister, your mother, your father
That shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen you done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?
You got raised, you done played in the park with them
This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man
You got to watch what you ask for
You sure you want this son?
You sure you want this money?
You sure you want this fame?
You sure you want this power?
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit
Yeah everybody want it, everybody need it, money motherfuckers
Get money don't stop but I ain't mad at them
Shit, but shit even bosses got feelings you know?
Dear mama, dear papa, family, we're all we got
Don't let this money bring us down
Shit, everybody eats B, everybody eats, everybody eats lets go

Uh, yeah
And we started off as kids, stomach's touching our ribs
And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live
I remember somedays we ain't have nothing but live
Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick
And you main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit
Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant, Meta Peace and Gasol nigga
But i know just what I saw nigga
It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight
And as long Pop is probably smiling
Imma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit I know you ain't mean it
But yeah nigga I've seen it

My heart getting cold
Then the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day

To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I with some niggas that remember we took some risks for this
I'm talking risky business flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows that if I get penned for this I prolly won't get home until I'm 56

I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
They spit my new verse at your wake while your lying
The middle the Chruch [?]

I did not put trust in and I rode with the lion
Like hold up
From balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls when I called to collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail

Meek Mill,"When you go out, you want an obituary or a documentary? Which one you want Khaled?
(I want money)
A documentary, right?
(I want that too!)
We gotta make movies

Bright lights attracted bad bitches
And attracted to mad niggas
Whoever thought lil' ol' Meek Milly'd pass Jigga?
I'm just thinkin' a tad bigger
You niggas talk fly, only fly at your last picture
And you look like the last picture
I just hit a home run, on clash with us
And this money, [?], comin' for the ass, nigga, ass, nigga
Last nigga, there were cemeteries diggin' grass, nigga
The obituary leaves the last scripture
Mama said he was a good kid, thinkin' would kid
I signed my deal with my AP on
In the drop top with the AC on
Stuntin' with Cash Money, get my Baby on
No, never fuck a chick that got Bakers on
Or no Michael Kors
I'm on the same shit that Mike was on
Jordan, Jackson, Tyson on
I've seen niggas your type twice before
I'm in that white velour, look at the flights I bought
These mothafuckin' hoes got a right to war
When a young real nigga light the floor
Hundred black bottles, man that's lights galore
Before Tom was Ford, I'm talkin' Honda Accord
Lookin' for a plug, tryna find the cord
Niggas gettin' shot tryna find the Lord
This bust down Rollie say the time is yours
I get my grindin' on
Like [?] in the [?], it was mayday
Started with a warden, gun until I got an AK
Kids in the projects when we was by the bay, bay
Kids with the Pyrex, I hit it first, Ray J

When the lights low, and the show starts
And the champagne spill on your bow tie
And your dawg change up, playin' both sides
No it won't stop, when the dope stop
When the fed rush in the dope spot
And your main man tell 'em how the coke drop
How he rain danced with me by the boat dock
I know when he did that, I bet that your ghost drop
I hope that you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I'm just hopin' you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
Real nigga for life

As the rain drop, drop on the pavement
I came through my hood Mulsanne'n
On the block all night like I ain't famous
I still run with the same niggas I came with
Where I came from, where I came in
We eatin' lobster and steak from Top Ramen
Oodles and noodles, when you're hungry them killers'll do you
And when you're gettin' to that money them people pursue you
The Feds lurkin', the streets watchin'
Them hoes talkin', like ""he got it""
And he nervous, cause we plottin'
We call that boy for a burner and we rob him
Like Batman, pussy niggas gettin' backhand
Talkin' to the people you a at man
Half rack, we got more ghosts than Pac-Man
And for that paper we be grindin' like a lapdance
Get the money young nigga
Get the money, never fold, cause they comin' young nigga
When the feds get to rushin', better not tell on young nigga
Don't be selfish young nigga, just man up, don't give the fam up
Facin' 20 years when they added them grams up
Plus 5 more, he got booked with a handgun
And now he in the courtroom, givin' his mans up
Rat ass nigga

When the lights low, and the show starts
And the champagne spill on your bow tie
And your dawg change up, playin' both sides
No it won't stop, when the dope stop
When the fed rush in the dope spot
And your main man tell 'em how the coke drop
How he rain danced with me by the boat dock
I know when he did that, I bet that your ghost drop
I hope that you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I'm just hopin' you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up

Meek Mill,"Was the money good?, Was em bitches bad? Was them fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love?, did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne boils and the campaigns roar
And the lights shine bright every night that plug, for the trillest

See my momma cry too many tears
And we been broke like too many years
It ain't too many kids, a couple homies, there ain't too many there
And they all gotta eat, they got too many kids
To many kids with no fathers, doing too many bids
Too many bids, just gave 'em kids too many years
As soon as you get that money, that's sooner they appear
Some ? as soon as you share
And yeah, I've been losin' touch with my family, it ain't the same
I should've gave my sister some money, but I made it rain
I should've hit the crib with my son and play a game
But instead I ended up at the jeweler to make a chain
It's saying saying when you make money it make you change
Like four quarters, the fourth quarter, I made a lane
Shit, I had to walk forward they talkin' 'bout takin' trains
And takin' planes, I put the work in and made a name
But the question is

Was the money good?, Was them bitches bad? was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love?, did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne boils and the campaigns roar
And the lights shine bright every night that plug, for the trillest

I never wanted to be like Mike, I wanted to be like Mitch
Now all the lil' niggas wanna be like this
I wear my chain in any city, let you see my shit
Cause I earned that, it's on me, I'mma keep that shit
I got blood on my money, ether in my soul
Do you know the feeling durin' Easter with no clothes?
Now it's stars in the ceiling, bringing ether out the rose
With the curtains on the windows, I'm just peepin' at my ghost
Money made me iller, already was realer
Young kings killin', young kings over skrilla
That's why I ride around mac on me like I was Miller
Or Reggie when I shoot for that three
They drop fetty, that's good money
Come to my city, we talk heavy and die young
When we get some paper, we cop Prezis ?
20 inch rims for the dope boy
Sellin' that coke boy, trappin' on your note boy
Got that ? off money, fuck I need a note for!?
In them school hallways like ""fuck I need a note for!?""
We ain't wanna go to class, was sellin' coke raw
The principal was coppa too, hit him with a snowball

Was the money good?, Was them bitches bad? was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love?, did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne boils and the campaigns roar
And the lights shine bright every night that plug, for the trillest

Lookin' for that intro I was at the dealer lookin' for another Benzo
Match kicks with my Kenzo, young nigga
Heart of a lion, hungry as hippo
When I was on my last, nobody ain't tell me shit though
Flow slicker than Crisco, niggas talkin', I get low
Do my thing, they jump back, know how that shit go
And they still say I'm arrogant
I'm still eatin' steak with the asparagus
When I get that money like I married it
1 milly, 2 milly, 3 milly, buried it
Since they say I'm underground, I run that bitch like Harriet
Rolls Royce pushin' real slow like a chariot
Pull up on 'em niggas that got to me, shit, embarrassin'
I'mma real nigga with money, never trash it
You a fake niggas with money, it's no comparison
Told me that I couldn't get signed when I was rappin' it
And told me I couldn't do songs when I was battlin'
They told me that I couldn't be trap, I started trappin' it
Never listen to 'em, oh well, shit is immaculate
I'mma just go sit up in this back again
Smoke the weed and laugh at 'em
Make a couple million by accident
Couple niggas dropped on Twitter say they back again
Couple months later on Twitter they say us laxative
Shitted on 'em Nicky voice, did it on 'em Benjamins
Plently of 'em Benjamins, semi on 'em a many on a-
Whole 'nother level from before now
Tell my niggas when I see a hundred mil its going down
When I made my first mil, I was like ""it's on now""
Then I made my second mil, money on the floor now
Then I made my third mil, I'm like ""I need more now?""
I got in my zone and that money started pourin' down
Every time I hit the booth, microphone torn down
We couldn't get a pair of Pumas, we up in the store now, bitches!",The Trillest

Totin' them pictures and serving them addicts

Started with nothin' we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't flyer than me

I call the shooters, they hop out the van
Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan
Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie

Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
I just seen a nigga get a L
Never coming home, minute on the phone, sick and tired of seeing niggas fail
Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose

Meek Mill,"Tony dead and his brother too
Streets talkin' every week the coppers comin' through
And homicides scoopin' niggas out of Paulie crew
Damn, he in some shit just like a number two
So he need that lawyer money, plus that Sig Sauer money
On his second body so you don't want to war with money
Paulie got the word that somebody turned informant on him
Remember when he banged lil' Tony brother spin the corner on him
Maybe its them young niggas, talkin' to the police
Thinking about it every night, ain't been gettin' no sleep
He been spinnin' 'round that same corner for the whole week
Lookin' for them muthafuckers that was there 
With Tony brother when he let the clip roll on 'em
Going crazy thinkin' 'bout who told on him
Time tickin' doors 'bout to close on him
Them boys on the way to see the judge for a warrant
And they got his name on it, tryna put them chains on him
Cold as them streets is, he tryna remain on it
Even though the cops lurkin', got to keep them things on 'em
Layin' low at Kee crib, only when they changed on him
And she givin' info, told where to hit for
Put 'em deep with Tony lil' cousins and his kin folk
Paulie on some other shit, tryna get 'em sent for
Them young nigga bendin' backwards for him like its limbo
And they tryna kill somethin', cops tryna build somethin'
Paulie ain't tryna do no time take a deal, nothin'
Loadin' up his AK banana tryna peel somethin'
Tryna catch a rat nigga slippin' 'fore they spill somethin'
Somebody gon' die
And mommas gon' cry
Before Paulie doin' time
Cause Paulie gon' ride
Back in the field he got his 40 on him
Watchin' out for tinted windows when they pull up on him
He don't even trust the niggas 'round the corner from him
That he grew up with, he done got into it with
Investigatin' niggas if they tellin' or not
And then they feel some time of way he disrespectin' the block
But Paulie don't give a fuck, you disrespect him, you shot
Live by the chopper law and respect of the Glock
Hold up the phone ringin' said they rushin' the spot
The only time he play that crib is when he fuckin' a thot
He was fuckin' with Kee and she was fuckin' an op
But he ain't never think about it, she'll fuck with the cops
She told 'em everything nigga
I know you thought that she'll never sing would you?
Rule number one: keep them bitches from out your business
Rule number two: better kill 'em you know they snitchin'
It's all fun and games 'til them bitches turn to a witness
And know you in the courtroom waiting to get your sentence
Saw you out at Kee crib four in the morn'
Parked up seat low to the floor
She on the way he feel a way, this was one of his whores
And since he been on the run, he been fuckin' em more
Thinkin' about her if she come, open the door
Take a deep breath, I know what I'm doin'
Cause she gon' go to court and she gon' go to them all
And he gon' to jail and she gon' go to the mall
So he started walkin' while she parking
Wasn't even cautious
Parked up on her, had to drive her window out the darkness
He was supposed to shoot her, but he started talkin'
She screamin' out ""I'm pregnant,"" now he thinkin' ""Aw shit""
Started second guessin', that's when them cars spin
Paulie heart dropped he seen the Taurus
So he took off runnin' with the hammer, tried to toss it
Cops shootin' metal slugs rippin' through the car tint
Bullets hit his body while he runnin' and now he fallin'
Damn Paulie, bullet holes
Cuffs on let him bleed
Double murder, attempted murder, yes indeed
If he live, life sentence never leave
If he dies nobody cry for the bad guy
Fronted niggas workin' they the glad guys
Happy they ain't got to pay the tab guys
Paulie make it through to see the trap God
Drownin' in his own blood on his back side
They say he gon' pull through and he gettin' charged too
Lawyer came to see him said he need like 80 large too
Got him in the County Tony people 'hind them walls too
And they say his little cousin crippin' bangin' hard too
And Paulie killed his favorite little cousin back on Part 2
And he can't wait to fall through
Friday they callin' yard too
And Paulie on crutches took the screw up out the 
Handles scrape that bitch 'til it got sharp too

Niggas taking shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough

Now every move I make, I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it, they be like, you did it
My teacher always used to tell me you gon' lose nigga
That's why I never went to school nigga

Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp, I geting two with it'

Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me, I know it
I go through it, don't' show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't taking back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half, turned that to an ounce
Got some shit in the stash, nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag

Cut the grass and all the snakes gone surface
Nobody's perfect
Shawty bad, she kinda made me nervous

Talk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell

People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh the stories they'd tell
If anyone would listen, anyone would listen

You come from a town where
People don't bother saying hello
Unless somebody's born or dies

And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But it's much to late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promise

There's so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved

Their intentions aren't that good
And I can smell the asphalt
That's their personal road to hell being paved

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
But it's much to late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the next life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you

Bona fide win and roulade.
But he had to give it up.
His heart was raw.
But his fingers were numb.
His first words.
Were his last verse.
An aesthete since first sun.

Come on.
A second chance at love.
The moments slept.
Make you feel like it's never staying.
It burned.
The first attempt or two.
But I remembered you.
I need that moment back.
Please don't, don't, don't.

A tremor for death.
Ivories that sliced sedatives in half.
Relief in Rhine.
Washed away regrets.
And let him char before he caressed the ground.
Dear artist you will rise again.
A last arabesque in faint fashion.

Come on.
A second chance at love.
The moments dead.
Make you feel like it's never staying.
It burned.
The first attempt or two.
But I remembered you.
I need that moment back.
Please don't, don't forget.

He woke.
A final view of blue.
Dear cordias.
Wet rouge.
Relieve romance to graves.
Please, please don't forget.","Courage, Robert"
Meg & Dia,"Fate leave on my doorstep
A soldier, a soldier
A fable, a fortune
I long for, I long for

Ever so secret I see
What's in store for me
I won't let it mislead
Oh no.
No, it hasn't happened yet

As for the dying
And the fading
And resolve to be
Okay with the natural decay
I'll choose illusion
And safety a hundred times over
I'm prepared to be happy and deceived
I'm supposed to be happy and deceived

Let us find perfection
And nonsense in all we are
Save defects for later
We're angels for now

Hide my uniform pride
Your arrogant side
I'm aching already
Hide your taciturn, mundane expressions
Affection will carry us a little while more

As for the dying
And the fading
And resolve to be
Okay with the natural decay
I'll choose illusion
And safety a hundred times over
I'm prepared to be happy and deceived
I'm supposed to be happy and deceived

Let us be entertained
Let me believe it ends this way

As for the dying
And the fading
And resolve to be
Okay with the natural decay
I'll choose illusion
And safety a hundred times over
I'm prepared to be happy and deceived
I'm supposed to be happy and deceived

I'm prepared to be happy and deceived

I wasn't ready. 
I wasn't ready. 
Did I say come and get me? 
Too bad I held on when you tried to tell me, 
This was wrong. 
This was wrong.

I am no masterpiece where innocence is painted green
Isn't it strange to think how you created all of me?

[Chorus]
Done by the hands of a broken artist
You painted black where my naked heart is
Now I finally know what wrong is
Carved like a stone with hands still shaking
On display through a soul still breakin'
Aren't you proud you're the one that made me?

You can't erase these, lines you can't save me
You can't display me, you know what dismay means
Can't even try to 
Remember what I knew
Before I became your model to claim no

I grew tired 
You expired
You finished me
Now that I'm all that you planned
What do you think?

Can I ask you where you gonna run to
And you think your really really funny
Well I don't think your funny as you do

We all feel like we're breaking sometime
But I won't give you up tonight

Stay awake, stay awake

Give your name tonight

And I wanna scream, wanna scream your name.

You're my wish tonight

Don't tell me it doesn't matter
I'll tell you what matters

Open windows at night
You think that no one needs you

You don't have nothing to see through
Well I needed you.
Don't I count?
Lets fight.

Fierce fists clutching onto air.
Show me anything.
Just show me you care.

The way that you keep me when I'm out of sight
What if I need you
What if I can't see you

The way that you keep me when I'm out of time

What if I can't see you

Grabbed my wrist.
Said, ""Now, darling, there he is.""

His eyes calm and distant.
His mouth so severe.
Though half his age I was.
I've never been in love.

Perhaps, I'll help you out.
Your wife was so much more than me.
But I can be her now.
I can be her now.

Rush down the stairs to that man.
Mr. Summer, he nodded his head.
With laughter in his eyes.
A smirk followed close behind.
""We're strangers but I'm sure we should be married.""
I spoke to my master.
She nodded her head.
Though I was young and scared.
With Max standing there.
We took our first step.

How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window

That night he caged her
Bruised and broke her
He struggled closer
Then he stole her
Violet wrists and then her ankles
Silent pain
Then he slowly saw their nightmares were his dreams

Looking through the windows
I will
Hear their voices

I often loose track
So I took a drag
Of my first cigarette
And I found my head
Roll down the dumps
Of twenty seventh street

I drew a sketch
With lipstick and sidewalk
Of Newports edge
Legoblock cliffs
And an ocean that doesn't
Deserve the sounds of silence
I'd swear on a dead artists grave

I found a spot
Where the drunk never got to
And it rocks me gently silent, silent
If I never surface
Then it doesn't matter
Hold my breath
It's silent, silent, now

Diligent
Escape by the water
Not sick of it
It only gets harder
That's no excuse
To block all the cliches and
Reason for kicks

He strokes her hair
Both sitting on sand
And her shoulders bare
Nothing to demand of them
Laying back on a lonely stone wall
And passersby look passed it all

I found a spot
Where the drunk never got to
And it rocks me gently silent, silent
If I never surface
Then it doesn't matter
Hold my breath
It's silent, silent

You could hear the organs not,
The violins or the words the pope was saying.

While most prayed they wouldn't last a winter.
It was a black wedding,

So,
You're finally viewing this at five foot six.
It's not all roses like your mama said,
We're not spoon fed anymore.
So you gonna tell
All our kids I was an accident?
Ironic true,
But that's the way you act when you're upset
So let's take this outside.

We see our mirrors from outside,
And he said we are only pride,
We stay hidden all our lives.

What else is there to know when our bible's here?
There are no lies to find when the page is bare

That lasts for more than a shoe shine.
I'm older, took all the words of my mother, saying,
It could be worse,
Could be born with that disease,
Instead of catching it first.
So lets go back, to the first time,
That I met you, in your Chevy,
With your hands stretched,
And me crying, screaming, Mercy. Mercy.
But I know that, I was put here, to fight Vikings
In the cold war, with my arms out,
In the front lines, singing, Dare me. Dare me.

These things take backbone.
And they'll tell you what you want to hear

But you better know how to point out the liars.

You're not fighting for nothing. Nothing.
Are you fighting for nothing?

Growing slowly upside down.
Maybe I should move to China,
And straighten this mess out.
Maybe Ill be a poet.
Watch all the sky for falling words.
And write about my grandmas curtains,
Or the lady who put the Chinese buffet in her purse.
I've got my mouth.
Its a weapon. Its a bombshell.
Its a cannon. I've got my words.
I won't give them mercy. Mercy.

I've got my words. I hope they hurt you.
I hope they scar you. I hope they heal you.
I hope they cut you open,
Make you see you've been warring
For all the wrong reasons.

Make you see that some things are worth bruising for.
Make you see that your name is your honor code.
Make you see that your hands you're accounted for.
Pick and choose where your sweat and your blood will go.
Make you see your life's not to be lived alone.
Run their spit through your hair,
You're worth nothing.
Nothing.

Just maybe those genes that you were forced in,
Although heavy, are no excuse

I think I'm on the bright side.
Got my hair cut short,

I hope I'm on the bright side.

Is a fake from what's inside.

Now I hate to speak of magic
But what other words do I have to tell you?
For the record I knew
As for my ""Diamonds & Rust""
Well I don't feel damned no I feel blessed
Yeah I feel blessed

Than I pray that they will show me
Pressed into the hollow of your fingers
And the hollow of my throat

Than love it seems comes easily

And they pulled out all their charm
And you shook each and every hand 

And then were gone

At a time in which I questioned
The value of what we do
Between impending war and unpaid bills
Mine was the privilege of confusion

They've been working on it for years now
Just about finish up 'fore it occurs to anyone
They built that damn thing just about a foot off the ground
Way way higher than the road around

Hit the bridge at fifty-five
Feel like you might just take flight
And every time the crossing comes as a surprise
See my flying

I've found quiet in this room
Down by where the trains run
I've learned to hear the rumble, long before it
comes
And the things I'm working on
Are invisible to everyone
Something 'bout an empty hip or the angle of the sun
Every time the crossing comes as a surprise
See me flying

Maybe these stitches in my throat
Have just about dissolved
Like the sad moan of the drunkard
walking home from the bar
I hear the thin song of the fire house
when they sound the alarm
I hear the church bells on Sunday... ringing out

Used to be a town of dirt and horses
Now it's all liquor and cars
There's still a whole lot of nothing
up between those stars

Then a wall of crumpled nothing tumbles down till you surrender

From a cast of bittered thousands gilded, rusted golden cage,
Silver spoonz that lick their bottomz open up the bird's eye view

Feel, now you know it's the season of the witch
It doesn't twitch The kinda wound that might of fooled the diggers ditch

Alive to the Universe, Dead to the World.

Memorizing pin numbers and secret codes,
Swaying robotically to non-existent rhythms, Flashing memberships to clubs so exclusive nobody belongs,

And each kiss an inspiration

Full tank, pockets lined with cash 
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass.

Romance the road, winding left to right.

Driving fast makes me feel good, 
The speed of light trapped under my hood. 
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do. 
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502. 
Hundreds of miles rolled off today. 
Signs lose their meanings, minutes tick away. 
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all. 
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol. 
Drive until daybreak, always on the go.

I know you'll be lying until your dying day

Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave 
Your mind is sickly from Alzheimer's disease

And if it comes the living will envy the dead 
Racing for power and all come in last 
No winning, first stone cast

No one will be left to prove that humans existed 
Maybe soon the children will be born open fisted

Dragons sleeping in my veins

Once stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
I'm the sun that beats your brow in
'Til I finally threw the towel in

And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance

His limitations

Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip

This is no hoax, no one pushed out
Recieve a preieve and bea pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
