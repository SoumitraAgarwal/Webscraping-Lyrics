Cyril Cinelu,"Les silences que tu gardes
Les sourires que tu esquisses
Les larmes que tu rattrapes
Juste avant qu'elles ne glissent
L'idée qui te traverse
Les rôles que tu joues
Tes moments de faiblesse
Ce qui te met à bout

Le revers de ta main
L'arrière de tes pensées
Le geste que tu feins
Le jardin de tes secrets
La minute que tu perds
Les actes que tu manques
L'endroit où tu te terres
L'émotion que tu planques

Je voudrais être 
Ce que je ne suis pas
L'autre côté de toi

Je voudrais être 
Ce que je ne suis pas
L'autre côté de toi

L'envers de ton décor
Le rêve que tu caresses
L'ombre au pied de ton corps
Le chant qui te bouleverse
La main que tu retiens
Les risques que tu cours
La terre dont tu viens
Les nuits après tes jours

Je voudrais être
Ce que je ne suis pas
L'autre côté de toi

Je voudrais être 
Ce que je ne suis pas
L'autre côté de toi

La bouche qui te respire
Le mot que tu ne dis pas
Le son de tes soupirs
La flamme qui brûle en toi

Je voudrais être 
Ce que je ne suis pas
L'autre côté de toi

Je voudrais être 
Ce que je ne suis pas
L'autre côté de toi ...",L' Autre C么t茅 de Toi
Cyril Cinelu,"Sous ce regard un peu triste
Je n'ose lire que tu voudrais partir
Je n'aimerais pas qu'on me mente encore une fois
Si tu le veux vraiment dis-le-moi

Je n'imagine pas une vie sans toi 
Tu illustres mes rêves
Je reste sans voix quand tu n'es pas là 
Les ""on dit"" nous achèvent
Ils te parlent de moi
Ils me mentent sur toi
Ils refusent que l'on s'aime
A en oublier qu'on en récolte de la peine

Promets-moi de vivre la moitié de ma vie
Sans hésiter, sans plus rien écouter
Promets-moi de toujours m'aimer, toute la vie
Sans regarder ce que les autres peuvent penser

Sous ce regard un peu triste
Je n'ose lire que tu voudrais partir
Je n'aimerais pas qu'on me mente encore une fois
Si tu le veux vraiment, dis-le-moi

Sous mon regard un peu triste
Je n'ose te dire que je te soupçonne de me trahir
Je ne voudrais pas être seule à vivre ça
Alors si t'as quelqu'un, dis-le-moi

Je n'imagine pas une vie sans toi 
Tu illustres mes rêves
Je reste sans voix quand tu n'es pas là 
Les ""on dit"" nous achèvent
Ils te parlent de moi
Ils me mentent sur toi
Ils refusent que l'on s'aime
A en oublier qu'on en récolte de la peine

Tous mes amis me l'ont dit
Que dans ta vie, d'autres partagent notre lit
Je ne supporterais pas qu'on me juge à chaque fois
Je suis victime de l'amour et de ma voie

Promets-moi de vivre la moitié de ma vie
Sans hésiter, sans plus rien écouter
Promets-moi de toujours m'aimer toute la vie
Sans regarder ce que les autres peuvent penser

Je n'imagine pas une vie sans toi 
Tu illustres mes rêves
Je reste sans voix quand tu n'es pas là 
Les ""on dit"" nous achèvent
Ils te parlent de moi
Ils me mentent sur toi
Ils refusent que l'on s'aime
A en oublier qu'on en récolte de la peine",Une Vie Sans Toi
Cyril Mockridge,"Through a long and sleepless night
I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night
Of who is to blame

Can't help but wonder
If you're lonely too
As I lie here and toss about
So alone, so without you
How I wish, my heart with me

My memories alone
Why must I re-dream, re-live
The Joys we have known
I pray that someday

Our love will see the light' til then
In thick dark silence I beg my heart to replace
All through and oh so long and sleepless night

I pray that someday
Our love will see the light' til then
In thick dark silence
I beg my heart to replace
All through alone so long and sleepless night",Through Long and Sleepless Nights [Male Vocal]
Cyril Neville,"Little girl don't you want to stay?
I want to be your lover man
All by myself
All by myself

I don't need no one to love you
I'm gonna love you all by myself

You'll find, little girl, you know it too,
Don't you know I'm in love with you
All by myself
All by myself.

I don't want no one to love you
I want to love you all by myself

Meet me in the parlor 'bout half past one,
We'll go on down and have some fun
All by ourselves,
All by ourselves,
We don't need nobody with us
We gonna do it all by ourselves.

Cyril Neville,"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
How she made a fool out of me

At last something shook me
As if it came down from above
And now the fortune teller
And I fell in love",Fortune Teller

Cyril Neville,"Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Wake up in the mornin' fix you somethin' to eat,
'fore I go to work I even brush your teeth
Get home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got yourself a rag tied 'round you're head.

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do

Cyril Paulus,"C'EST SI BEAU
Tu rêves de t'envoler
Loin, très loin t'évader
Ce feu qui semble éteint au fond de toi
Toi et moi
On l'attisera pas à pas
Tu veux t'évaporer
Tout près d'abandonner
Je t'en supplie accepte le combat
Accroche-toi
On le gagnera toi et moi
Refrain
Tu sais la vie
C'est si beau
Brillant, léger comme de la mousse
C'est si beau
Joli et clair comme ta peau douce
C'est si beau
Si tu ne crois plus en rien, tu vois, moi j'y croirai pour toi,
La vie, c'est si beau
Tu ne peux pas renoncer
Partir sans essayer
Me dire que tout doit continuer sans toi
Je suis là
Demain tu chanteras pour moi
Refrain
Tu peux réapprendre à sourire
Je suis vivant quand tu respires
Mais reste avec moi

Cyril Paulus,"J'AIMERAIS DORMIR
Même le temps parfois est menteur
Les secondes passent mais durent des heures
Le réveil qui sonne
Ne réveille personne
Et même le café en perd sa saveur
Et quand le jour réveille mes pleurs
Sucre et sel se mélangent
Tout a un goût étrange
Refrain
J'aimerais dormir
Simplement dormir
Et que mes nuits me laissent t'oublier
J'aimerais dormir
Simplement dormir
Et que mes rêves te laissent t'en aller
Les jours défilent mais sans la couleur
Depuis que j'ai vu faner tes fleurs
Je reste en suspens
Je vis en noir et blanc
Et j'essaie en vain de trouver ailleurs
Un peu de toi, un peu de chaleur
Ton image me revient
Même quand je ne pense à rien
Refrain
Dans la maison
Ce matin
J'ai cru sentir ton parfum
le lit est froid et me glace
Et de toi rien ne s'efface
Dans ma prison
Un à un
Je grave les traits de mon chagrin
Je n'ai plus de palce
Pour toutes les heurs qui passent

Te laissent t'en aller, te laissent t'en aller,
Te laissent t'en aller?",J'Aimerais Dormir
Cyril Paulus,"TOUT DOUX, DORS
Quand il tombait de son vélo
C'était elle qui pansait les bobos
Les petits maux
Aujourd'hui il ne bougera pas
Pas plus qu'hier il ne l'entendra
Mais elle est là
Tout doux, dors
Dors mon trésor
Elle lui chante une fois encore
Tout doux, dors
Dors mon trésor
Tout ton chagrin, tout s'évapore
Si tu t'endors
Si tu t'endors
Elle seule pouvait calmer ses peurs
Chasser les cauchemars et les malheurs
Pendant des heures
Même s'il est plus grand aujourd'hui
Elle seule peut bercer son tout petit
Cette dernière nuit
Elle lui allumera ce soir
Une lumière au fond du couloir
Tout doux, dors
Dors mon trésor
Elle lui chante une fois encore
Tout doux, dors
Pars sans remords
Tu vaux bien mieux que ce corps
ET il s'endort
Elle chante encore
Tu t'endors
Dors mon trésor
Je ferai taire les cris du dehors
Tu t'endors
Pars sans remodrs
Tout ton chagrin, tout s'évapore
Si tu t'endors
Tout s'évapore, tout s'évapore?","Tout Doux, Dors"
Cyril Paulus,"TOUT NOUS APPARTIENT
Un jour de plus à porter le poids
Tes yeux perdus, ton café froid
Tout est trop lourd, trop long, trop noir
Gorge nouée, tu ne respires pas
Les yeux mouillés devant l'écran plat
Tu te sens trop sourd, trop con, trop noir
Mais tout nous appartient
Tout nous appartient
Refrain
Dépêche-toi
Ta vie se lasse
Tu peux encore trouver ta place
Dépêche-toi
Le temps s'efface
Toi seul peux y laisser ta trace
Les secondes filent, toujours malgré toi
Immobile, tu ne les vois pas
Tout est trop court, trop long, trop noir
Mais tout nous appartient
Tout nous appartient
Refrain
Car tout nous appartient
Les heures d'hier ne se revivent pas
Nos yeux ouverts se ferment déjà
C'était trop court, trop bon, l'histoire
Dépêche-toi
Ta vie se lasse
Tu peux encore trouver ta place
Dépêche-toi
Le temps s'efface
On peut tous y laisser nos traces
Car tout nous appartient
Tout nous appartient, tout nous appartient,

Cyril Stapleton,"They say that falling love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful
Cyril Stapleton,"Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice.

Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?

Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low

Cyril Stapleton,"If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A garden of Eden, just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy

I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Cyril Stapleton,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue.","Me And My Shadow (for ""Harry Delmar's Revels"")"
Cyril Stapleton,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings",Volare
Cyril Stapleton,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Cyril Stapleton,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song [From Knickerbocker Holiday]
Cyrus Chestnut,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Cyrus Chestnut,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All
Cyrus Chestnut,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You

With blue satin sashes

Alone where we have walked together

Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Cæcilie Norby,"What goes up must come down
Spinning Wheel got to go 'round
Talkin' 'bout your troubles
It's a cryin' sin
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel spin
You got no money, you got no home
Spinning Wheel all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you
You never learn
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel turn
Did you find your directing sign 
On the straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign?
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real
Someone is waiting just for you
Spinning Wheel spinning true
Drop all you troubles by the river side",Spinning Wheel

No complaints and no regrets
I still believe in chasing dreams and placing bets
But I had learn that all you give is all you get

And even though I'm satisfy I always still
To see what done on other road behind the hill
And do it all again

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
So here's to life
To dreamers and their dreams

Honey, all the times just climes
A love can go from more hellos to sad goodbyes
And live you with the memories you memorized
To keep your winters warm

There is no yes in yesterday
And who knows what tomorrow brings or takes away
As long as I'm still in the game I want to play
For last, for life, for love

The meadows of your mind
Just think if Winter comes
Can Spring be far behind

Beneath the deepest snows
The secret of a rose
Is merely that it knows
You must believe in Spring

Just as a tree is sure
Its leaves will reappear
It knows it's emptiness
Is just the time of year

The frozen mountain dreams
Of April's melting streams
How crystal clear it seems
You must believe in Spring

You must believe in love
And trust it's on it's way
Just as the sleeping rose
Awaits the kiss of May

So in a world of snow
Of things that come and go
Where what you think you know
You can't be certain of
You must believe in Spring and love

Soaked through for the job I hate,

every day i'm wondering, will something new begin
time is flying, minutes dying - every day

unsure of my heart, unsure of myself
wondering silently of what could be

i will move on, the journey never ends",Every Day

All alone and it's alright

Bitches honeys that swollen 
The riches, Nas get in ya 
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer prize winner 
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater 
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters 
Commentators ring side try watchin' my paper 
Almost a decade quite impressive 
Most of the best is in the essence 
For this rap shit that I stand for 
Expanding more to the big screen 
Bill gates dreams 
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail 
With state dreams 
Want me off the scene fast

Like your favorite M.C. still makin' some mean cash 
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque 
Back to the projects

Do it now, I told you do it now 

You want to hate me then hate me 
What can I do? 
But keep gettin' money

I had to hustle hard never give up 
Until I made it 
Now why'all sayin' that's a clever nigga 
Nothing to play with 
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G 
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy 
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us 
Sayin' we left the hood 
But can't get it out of us 
My bad, should I step out my shoes 
Give 'em to you? 
Here's my car and my house 
You can live in that too 
Criticize when I flow for the streets 
Hate my dress code 
Gucci this, Fendi that 
What you expect hoe 
Nickname esco 
Took this game to its threshold 
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know 
Try to make it like you the realest 
But who the illest? 
Think we all know the answer to that 
Cause niggas feel this right 

Do it now

Its a thin line between paper and hate 
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights 
Hell or the pearly gates 
I was destined to come 
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs 
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows 
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one 
Took a little time to claim my spot 
Chairman of the board until this game stop 
And I side with the Lord 
Ride for the cause 
While driving, niggas shot out my doors 
Plottin', I'm sure to catch me 
With they glocks to my jaw 
Try stickin' my up but I 
But I flipped on these ducks 
Instead of me

Hate what they can't conquer

When things weren't as we know 
Back when I was younger and had a hunger 
For all the things I didn't know 

And I remember the day when 
I went out to play 
And I bird flew down to my hand 
Didn't want to leave and 
When I asked to keep 
I remember my dad said 

Yeah son let it go away 
Hope that it comes back 
Here to you some day 
Just let it go away 
And if it comes back 
you know it's here to stay 

Since then I've gone through changes 
Since then I've gone through life 
Since then I found me a beautiful woman 
I thought could be my wife 
She said she really loves me 
But she said she couldn't stay 
She said I've got to go my love 
To find things my own way 

So I let her go away 
Hope that she comes back 
Here to me some day 
I let her go away 
And if she comes back 
I know she's here to stay 

There's not always reasons for the things in life 
But it's comforting to know within your mind 
If you love something enough 
And you've done all that you can 
If there's one thing I have known and learned first hand 
Sometimes you have to just let it go away 

Hope that it comes back 
Here to you some day 
Just let it go away 
And if it comes back 
You know it's here to stay

As long as he can fuck his girl
And prove that he's a man
He got wasted eating 'ludes
He's a teenage vegetable
Getting high through the night is cool
Johnny hates to think he's ignorant
He's a mindless brainwashed pig
Ring a bell he starts to drool
Degenerated, degenerated

And our minds are vegetated
Degenerated, degerated
And our act is imitated
He's got PCP in his veins
Got a boy in his brain
He's addicted to the TV
When he's old he's gonna have a son
Said a kid grow up baby deaf and dumb
To become a young Johnny

D Generation,"Frankie baby wears leather boots
She likes the stooges and punk rock groups
Born in something she just can't win
She strives for pureness but she's built for sin

She tried it once with Jesus and she once was a June bride
When I met her on the bar stool she just smiled

Frankie, Frankie, Frankie, got me down on my knees
Frankie, Frankie, Frankie, going aahh!

Frankie baby's misunderstood
All the time in the neighborhood
She's the beauty that they can't get, she's the freedom that they resent
A well respected husband but your kids don't know you well
Hiding with your whore at the motel...

When your picture made every fashion spread
And the things that stayed inside my mind
Well, you didn't drop dead and you won't drop dime

D'Angelo,"Africa is my descent
And here I am far from home
I dwell within a land that is meant
For many men not my tone

The blood of god is my defense
Let it drop down to my seed
Showers to your innocence
To protect you for all eternity
And with this wood I beat this drum
And we won't see defeat

From kings to queens becomes a prince
Knowledge wisdom is
Understanding what we need

Ever since the day you came
My whole world began to change
I knew then to dedicate my life
For your own
Everyday I see you grow
And remember what you already know
I receive the love
That radiates from your glow

From which you came was love
And that's how it all should be
You and my soul are one
Through all the time and history

To secret rooms in the mansions of my mind
Shower you with all that you need
Take my hand, I swear I'll take my time
I'm not surprised to find that angels compete
For the chance to lay down at your feet
I'm gonna touch in all of the places that please

It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
In the middle of the night I hear gun shots go off by my window, window
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy 'round here

The streets is so cold, it's hard to hold a smile
I'm in the hood and I’ve been pushing blow for awhile
And things ain’t looking up, niggaz is in denial
And I ain’t seen no better days beyond all the trials
I walked the church isles and prayed for God's hand
To lead me through the jungle cuz imma lost man
Still no response, damn been through a lot fam
And all I’m searching for is peace up on the blocks and
All I see is murder Dope fiends and Johnny law
And niggaz struggling, please believe it man I've seen it all
If you a ghetto product and you've got it hard
This one’s for you cuz it ain’t easy being who you are

Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
In the middle of the night I hear gun shots go off by my window, window
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy 'round here

Murder and drug abusing, Alcohol and prostitution
The streets are not protected under America’s constitution
Got cops and criminals and they both can't seem to stop the shooting
So we hit the 40 and the blunt like now we got solutions
Bullet holes I stop signs, crack sells I got mine
But can we stop crime so our mothers stop crying?
D-Eazy yeah I got us, we both them ghetto products
I love the ghetto so don't ever let the ghetto stop us
Don't let me get some paper cuz I can do some good
If I get rich then I gotta give back and I’m gunna give to the hood
To all my ghetto people, keep your chin proud and high
Cuz all you gotta do in life is just stay brown and die

Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
In the middle of the night I hear gun shots go off by my window, window
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy 'round here

Whoa, it makes me wanna say 
It makes me wanna say
Oh, Oh Oh

I've been to California and Phoenix Arizona
It's all the same struggle nigga just a different corner
We see an OD daily out in Espanola
G the struggle never stops it's like it's taking over
It's hard to stay sober when you know you're living greasy
The hood ain’t all that shit you niggaz see on the TV
Believe me homie none of y’all out there wanna be me
This life we lead ain’t easy ask Reno Beazy
I make a little money but everyday it's spent
And with the price of gas it's hard for me to pay the rent
Livin’ that check to check ain’t never been easy
Fuck a nine to five cuz I grind cuz minimum wedge will never allow me to find a
Way out of this struggle and suffering
So my mother and sisters stop worrying that I’m hitting the streets and hustling
Customers keep on coming in dozens and have to pay
But that's the ghetto and it keeps you trapped until you pass away

Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
Dear father

She says she needs a G so girl come on
Maybe it’s the freak in me that makes me want
To hit that body cuz I’m feenin’ for a thug girl

I love your thug swag, you know you’re all that
A hood type bitch with hips and all ass
You ain’t even gotta have no class
I need a street type bitch that'll hold my mag
Or hold my stash and hit me when I’m low on cash
I heard you’re the type of hoe that’s known to blast
You can roll you ain’t got to ask
We can hit the mo mo if you're down to mash
You got the '08 Jag well I got the coupe
64 chromed up with the rag top roof
We can ride girl I got the loot
I got it covered Ma chill and sip this 100 proof
I got the Gin & Juice I get high too
Smelling like marijuana smoke kinda like you
You wanna roll, I can tell, that’s the right move
But tell your girlfriends don’t trip they can ride too

In the fast lane live as the days pass by

I live for today like there's no tomorrow
That's why I do my thang with the time I borrow
Tippin’ bottles daily tryna drown my sorrows
Heard God's on my side and I tried to follow
My pops even tried to tell me life is short
Too short to be spending all your time in court
But life is a game, kind of like a sport
When the clock stops ticking there's no life support
We all die of course; when you're gone you're gone
I don't worry ‘bout tomorrow when the chron is strong
All I need is a hit of the bong like Cypress
All my niggaz try to tell me how my life is priceless
It's hard to fight it though, they could be right
Ask Jigga man he'll tell you that this could be life
I'm livin’ life in the fast lane, mind on my cash gain

I don't know why homie but I live for the moment
Too many niggaz waist time and don't even know it
Walking on egg shells and don't even notice
But, I don't waist mine though, I'm focused
On today fuck stressin’ when tomorrow's a question
If I see another day imma count it a blessing
I take a puff and let it ease the tension
And I tip Hen to release depression
Ain’t no worry on my mind when I breathe the weed
Livin’ in the fast lane cuz I need the speed
All my doggs try and tell me how I need to be
Cautious, But, imma keep it G believe
And as long as I’m free imma tip the Hen
Maybe, hit some skins if I miss the pen
I'm livin’ life in the fast lane, mind on my cash gain
I'm staying high till I die nigga I can't change

I make it do what it do with the time I'm given
Livin’ life to the fullest cuz time is tickin’
I ain’t got time to waste in prison
But I might end up there the way I'm livin’
I hope I’m forgiven when I hit them gates
But as for now imma push my weight
Get high like Styles P and chase my cake
Live it up right now before it gets too late
If tomorrow comes for me imma do it again
Imma get my money up and stay pursue them ends
Maybe smoke a little something mix up juice and the gin
And thank God for the time that he gave me to spend
All my friends try and tell me that I move too fast 
But, life ain’t forever homie time don't last

D-Eazy,"It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood
It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood

I was born to the world, born to the drama; I was born to the streets
Born to the anger, born as a stranger, in a world with no peace
Never had a choice, never knew nothing more than a war that I wish would cease
Man I was forced to a world gone madd, forced to deal with the pain and the grief
All I ever seen growing up is shootings and young mothers out prostituting
Everybody feuding lives left ruined stuck in a world of mass confusion so
What was I to do? All I know is what I’m doing
I wasn’t put down here with a manual, answers or resolutions but
The streets embraced me in a world where we all gone crazy
And it gave me that fatherly love I needed daily
You can say I’m shady and hate me but you can't blame me 
Cuz I’m hood but I’m gunna be hood until they take me

It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood
It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood

I'm a product of a world so cruel, 
Like Flesh Bone but I had my crew
I had my click when shit got thick growing up they taught me like a father do
They're all I ever knew
I had their back and they had mine too
If they had they gat then I had mine too
They taught me life in a world confused 
If you was in my shoes then you'd know what I see every day
Know what it is to live in the pain then you'd know why we live this way
Unless you're blind like Ray, then you see all the anger and rage
All the feuds and the hate displayed all the struggle in the USA
I shed tears for the homies locked up and the ones in the grave
But I hold my head high and show that I ain’t afraid by
Staying down for the niggaz that stayed and never strayed
And staying loyal to the gang until I pass away

It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood

If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain

I know about the revelation and the ending of times
So my life is a sign that my vision is blind but
It's hard to see how these conditions are fine
We in a prison locked up without committing a crime
I never chose to live a ghetto life, never chose struggle
I never wanted this pressure, I was born troubled
I'm in a fight take a look at my knuckles
It's like I’m hitting brick wall living life on the hustle
Trying hard not to buckle under all of my stress
I confess misery got me wishing for death
Is this life worth living given all of my tests 
I'm just a man in the flesh trying hard to progress
See my life is a mess full of drama and hurt
I'm feeling cursed and my life got me down in the dirt
I'm on a search for some light through the thunder and rain
You wouldn't be so quick to judge if you were feeling my pain

If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain

I'm on a journey through a maze that I call my life
Getting scared through the process, I call it a fight
That got me up against the ropes and I’m holding on tight
Trying hard not to fall so I call on Christ
Is there a way out this ghetto prison
This life I'm Living got me paranoid wishing God would listen
I'm losing all faith in religion falling deep in depression
God, I’m going crazy holding all this aggression
I'm here stressing tryna find some direction
Begging God for his blessings but I get the impression
I'm all alone in this life of sin
It's like I’m lost in a jungle in this life I’m in
Without a friend to depend on lately I've been livin’ in fear
Heading straight for destruction, my ending is near
It might appear that I’m legally sane but
You'd think twice if you were feeling my pain

If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain

You don’t really know somebody till you walk in his shoes
And you don't really know his struggle and the shit he's been through
Until the shit hits the fan and the person is you
In the struggle all alone and you don't know what to do
I find it hard to keep my composure
The ups and downs of my life is like a roller coaster
Without a shoulder I can lean on, maybe I just need to be strong
But I’m suffocating daily trying hard to hold on 
You can tell that I’m hurting by the words of this song
So believe me when I tell you that this journey is long
It's like me and misery have been building a bond
We've been together for some time but we ain’t getting along
I'm sick of living life cold hearted, sick of shedding tears
I'm sick of calling to God and getting closed ears
I love Jesus but I’m looking for change
He'd probably offer me a hand if he were feeling my pain

If you could feel my pain

You don't stop, a keep on
Yo, this is the Nice in full effect..
I send this one out to my man McBoo..
Special request out to Mo, Shawn, KRS-One
and the BDP posse in full effect with Ms. Melodie..
And you don't stop
I send this one out to my man, cool DJ Red Alert
and the Jungle Brothers..
I send this one out to my man Dino
Big Steve, and the whole 164th street posse, why'knahmsayin?
I send this one out to my man Willie Dee
Manager Mo, hehe, Simone..
And you don't stop
Yo here's a little small promo..

Bust it, listen MC's, or get broke
The mic I strike and all that's left is smoke
The mics you struck, was held by ducks
You want to light my mic, hold up, you're outta luck
and time, chant this rhyme as I tell ya
Front on the mic tonight and I'll sell ya
a wolf ticket, to the Twilight Zone
Like Al. be	 Sure, you're off on your own
microphone that alone could display all day
Then I'll slay your array
of deranged rhymin, no timin
Like a mountain man I keep climbin
Over your vocals, reignin supreme
Takin me out on the mic is a dream
Age 19, and my theme
is hittin skins while I make the ends
meet while I speak straight to the weak
For those that oppose, I'll even defeat
Point blank, period, your rhymes are slayed
You're feelin the clash of the knight's crusade
So clear the stage, as I invade
When compared to me you're low grade
On this stage, you better be stable
Compared to me you're just ""Crumbs On the Table""

Ha ha you don't stop, keep on, a keep comin strong
I'ma send this one out to P.E., MC Lyte ha ha
Robocop, my man Scott LaRock, ha ha!
My man Big Bob, Sidney, haha
And you don't stop, and you don't stop, and you don't stop, haha!
Word up, we outta here..",And You Don't Stop
D-Nice,"(Chorus)
My name is D-Nice...
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

Yo, this is D-Nice and I'm about to drop some funky lyrics on this track I 
made up, you know what I'm saying, huh, yea and you don't stop, yo

My name is D-Nice although I hate to admit it
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it
See every episode remains in this mode
Very cool, very calm, there's no sweat in my palm
I just pick up the mic, proceed wit a song
I get right to the point, my competition's not long or short
It's like a sport hanging in the middle
But now if you're puzzled, let me kick the whole riddle
That my name is Derek and if I didn't mention
D-Nice is just a description
It describes the kid on the mic
I'm the TR-808, huh, but just call me D-Nice

Chorus

I start to think, a very big conscious all around me
Who will be the sucker MC to try to doubt me
Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or him
But I'm like a tree and every lyric is a limb
You throw it on the turntable, very unstable
But you gamble because you need that example
There's a 1000 MC's on the planet earth now
What is the word you say to get hers
Some like to explain, some talk educated
Some like McBoo, he's X-rated
I like to think of myself as a pure rebel
A radical thinker on a musical level
'Cause suckers want to stop me and girls want to kiss
Wherever I go, yo, it seems I can't be dis
'Cause my name is D-Nice but all the girls call me Derek
It ran through my crew so I guess I've inherit
The job of explaining and also retaining
The fact D-Nice is remaining
Not a king nor a prince but as a teacher
Wit dopies like this, I know I'm gonna reach ya
So now I don't think you should all despise
This fact D-Nice is on a rise
Straight to the top like a bubble of water
It's a slaughter so I think you oughta
Think realistically, not egotistically
It's suicide if you even think of dissing me
'Cause if you try, I'm a make you wait
To learn the reason I'm the 808, but just call me D-Nice

Chorus

I live in the Bronx by the D and the 4
Writing lyrics, it's addictive, writing more and more and more
About peace, about wars, about whores
Breaking city laws to me become a chore
I wear no jeri curls but I still pull girls
I don't slur my words when I rap 'cause that's wack, huh
But in fact, I do not slack
When I drop the funky, funky lyric on a track
I'm not conceited when I walk the streets
And you can tell by the words that I speak
That I'm not just another brother on the mic
'Cause the females love me and they call me D-Nice

Chorus",Call Me D-Nice
D-Nice,"(Is that a turntable?  Well get on it, it's your turn)

Who gets laid, the chicken or the egg?
How about the MC that has just been led
To a renegade teacher, preacher then he got stomped
Cause I'm a feature straight from the Bronx
Productions, better known as Boogie Down
If I was a king right now I'd get crowned
The Nice is a teacher, not a prince or a rap lord
I even write my rhymes on a blackboard
To get specific, and probably make you understand
What makes the 808 plan
It's simple, I'm a round it off like this
That's how many stupid MC's I've dissed
But if the commence to try me I won't buy it
I'll look them up and down and I'll say ""Don't even try it""
Cause I can go on and on without breathing
The TR, another form of BDP-eating
MC's like Chunky, moving real bluntly
Shaking and baking MC's like a junky
Fiending, hitting MC's like they was cocaine
Calling them John Doe, meaning they have no name
I'll spin you like a quarter, drink you like water
Hit below the belt with things you never thought of
I lay down the law that I am a slaughter
I roll like a tital wave, so you oughta
Float like a sailboat, move like a speedboat
In water, now watch you soak
Into a rhyme of mine until you hit the bottom
It's heavy like an anchor, it's no problem
For me to just bake you, eat you like a cookie
I am a profressional, boy, you're just a rookie
I'm here to sing a song, but some are not able
Compared to me you're just crumbs on the table

In my prime, more vocal than I've ever been
I'm not an amateur, sort of like a veteran
Split from the bums, arriving from a long trip
Now I'm back to just cold rip
MC's like confetti, eat 'em like spaghetti
I chill for a year and yet I'm still ready
To house MC's, sink 'em like a boat will
I roll heavy, thick like oatmeal
So now you know the 808 is showing
I do damage in just one moment
Here's a little message to those who want to hang out
Just remember that I give pain out
The TR-808 relates to a terrorizer
Never hiding, clever always memorizing
Poetry, history, math, or even paragraphs
I'm not into be	-boying, just hoeing
Showing, blowing MC's like the wind does
I might lay you, sort of like a hen does
Cause your rhymes are weak and unstable
Compared to me you're just crumbs on the table

You must think, before you even get soup
I'll put you on the corner and sell you like a prostitute
Like a street whore, make you want more and more
Move you to the side, up and down like a seesaw
Pulling out a gun is uncalled for
But I'm with it, so go for yours
You may even try to diss, but I call it flattery
I pack more volts than a Duracell battery
Charging MC's, smooth like the breeze
Scott made me funky, yo, that was one theme
Or topic, showing I be rocking
Every little city I play I leave a heat wave
Burning up the industry, never try to get with me
I'm the type of person that never needs rehearsing
Just a little sex, a six pack of Beck's
And my room to move about, and a Guinness Stout
To make me feel able, chilling, and stable
Sometimes I'm on the mic, sometimes I'm on the turntable
I'm superb, sort of like herb
A man of my word and I've never been served!",Crumbs on the Table
D-Nice,"I grew up in the city where everything is rough
Where everywhere I turn, I seen somebody gettin bust
Plus everywhere I look
All I could see is a crackhead or a goddamned crook
Runnin' around with a pistol or a blade
Stickin' up, in other words, gettin' paid
But I chose not to follow those ways
Cause the only place you headin' is to jail or the grave
But on the other hand
I know a man named Stan
Who in the future had plans
To be successful on his quest to
Take his moms and pops out the ghetto
But that plan was soon to be crushed
When one day he realized he must
Get a better job to pay for his schoolin
While his friends would sit around just coolin
He applied for a job in the system
And everywhere he looked, everybody would diss him
He doesn't have any type of skill
And life is not all games, it's real
he took a long walk down the street
Tryin' to think of a way to make his ends meet, huh
So he could buy the fly things he adored

And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more
As he walked home, he thought to himself
Now what am I supposed to do to get wealth
He felt that his life was worthless
Then he ran into his man named Curtis
Now Curtis, he's the type that stops and brags
About all the things he's got
Drivin' a Saab with a black ragtop
Come to find out Curt's workin' for the cops
He told Stan there's a job that's open
Makin' it all sound good, just hopin he would take it
Yup, and like a big dummy
Stan said ""Freak it, yo, I need the money""
Curt took Stan to meet his boss
Officer Sims, a sergeant on the force
He gave him a gun and Stan began
His new career as a damn hit man
his boss really liked his work
And gave the boot to his partner Curt
he didn't realize what he was in for

And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more
A few dollars more is what he started to make
Now he's drivin' around a Saab, with a house upstate
He got gold and diamond rings
Crazy girls and all those glamorous things
But one day this life-style end
When one afternoon while hangin' with a friend
Sittin' in the park, drinkin' quarts of beer
And somebody said ""Throw your hands in the air,
It's a stick-up"" and put the gun to his head
And said, ""Make another move and you're dead""
Now Stan had to make is choice
He paused and said I recognize that voice
Huh, where have I heard this
Now he remember, it's his man named Curtis
Curtis is mad and felt he'd been robbed
""Cause Stan is drivin' around in his Saab
He looked at Stan and said, ""I can't believe him,
Now its' time for me to get even""
Stan made a move real quick
Curt jumped back and said, ""Yo, that's it""
Shot him in the back of his head with a nine
Reached in his pocket, grabbed his cash and then dashed
Now here lies the man on the side
The same way he lived was the same way he died
He never knew what he had in store

And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more",A Few Dollars More

Back in the civil war days of 1863
was the year that free
blacks would try to adapt as soldiers
Live as equals and get what's owed us
And in this time they had yet to find inner peace
Which comes from the heart and mind
So listen close as I explain the story
of the regiment of blacks on the path to find Glory

""Courage, spirit, and honor"" .. on the path to find Glory
""Courage, spirit, and honor""

[D-Nice]
Bust it, yo
Here's an example of courage and strength
that dwelled in the men that went the whole length
To prove that each can stand as a man
And demonstrate, he can carry his own weight
But there was some tryin to add to the plight
of the black man, denyin his right to fight
as an equal, for self-esteem
Ran through the crew or so it seemed
Cause even in times when life seemed colder
He still remained proud to be a black soldier
Waitin for the chance to advance
and under the circumstance, managed to enhance
his courage, and when put to war
he'd do much more than what's bargained for
And each man, that can tell the story
knew from the start deep down in his heart they'd find Glory

""Courage, spirit, and honor"" .. on the path to find Glory
""Courage, spirit, and honor"" .. break it down

{*scratch: ""here's an example of courage and strength""*}

[D-Nice]
These brothers have died and cried, for power and freedom
But now look what we've done
We're robbin and killin our own race
Black and rap will be lost without a trace
So take heed to the knowledge I'm bustin
You're sellin yourself short, that's ""Self Destruction""
The song I sing to let freedom ring
So listen to the knowledge I bring as I speak about Glory

""Courage, spirit, and honor"" .. as I speak about Glory
""Courage, spirit, and honor"" .. yeah

""Courage, spirit, and honor""
""Courage, spirit, and honor""",Glory

So what's up?  I hear you've been lookin for the Nice
But now I'm here, standin clear in your sight

Mess around and this becomes critical
Easily, cause any rapper I ruin
You're talkin bout foolin me?  What could you do to me?
Nothin, you're frontin, it'll be your last
Mess around punk, and get a foot in your {ass}
Cause my voice on wax, gettin paid in stacks
You tryin to diss?  Well you might get smacked
In fact I might stomp you straight in the ground
So kill that talk and have a Coke and a smile
Or else have a glass of milk, and a cookie
Cause to me you're just a rookie
In my world, playin my game
To hang with the Nice you must be insane
I reign/rain like a shower, with power
Servin MC's every hour on the hour on a platter
Watchin you shatter, like glass
Fallin by the mass, I'm trainin by the class
And last, I'm here to cold tear you up

Please, huh, cause I'll fry you like fish
But just in case you misunderstood
or can't comprehend then boy you should
pick up the telephone, and ""Call Me D-Nice""
Area code eight-oh-eight, and I might
teach you how to rhyme on beat
Teach you that dog don't rhyme with skreet
Show you how to tell a real hit from a flop
And teach you what's wack don't rise to the top
Stop - but let me tell you somethin
Steppin to me is like ""Self Destruction""

D-Nice,"It was a hot summer day, I was dyin from the heat
Walkin up 118th street
Although I'm hot like stew
In the back of my mind it was a bottle of brew
Now a ice cold bottle would just quench my thirst
Or get some boom from the dread, which ever one comes first
Now is it brew? (yeah) or is it boom? (yeah)
So I lit up the boom and now may I presume? (yeah)
Now about 3 o'clock I had to meet my crew
I looked at my watch and then I noticed it was half past 2
I saw these two honeys walkin down the avenue
And one of them said: all I think about is havin you
Now in my mind I realized I coulda took her, coulda took her
But Nice is not the one to treat the ladies like a hooker
Don't mean to diss, but it's not on my list
So I gave her a kiss and said: ehm, good-bye, miss
From the streets I heard a horn beep
There was a crew 4 deep in a dark blue jeep
I heard em speak, he said: my ride is fat
So why you're sweatin D-Nice, baby, he ain't all that
Now first things first, why all the rude behaviour
You shoulda been taught how to respect this flavor
He jumped out the jeep like yo, what up chief
But I don't eat pork, so I guess he wanted beef
I realized I was on my own
I didn't proceed to make a move until a blow was thrown
He swung but missed, I caught him with a fist
Although I wish it didn't have to come to this
I started breakin him down with the speed, had him astounded
The right caught his jaw and it sounded
Like boom boom bap boom bam
He had no idea that D was nice with his hands
He stepped back, so I thought he was through
But right about now up steps his crew
We all threw down and went round for round
I'm givin it all I had to give until I fell face down

They proceeded to stomp but in all of the madness
Somehow someway I was damn sure glad this
Person slid me a pistol from behind
Not the weasel, pop-pop-pop goes the 9
So if you're wonderin why you ain't heard word of them
I (murder them murder them)
But since I pulled the trigger I guess I have to pay the price

Now I can recall the first time I was out on tour
With my boy Too $hort, leavin everyone in awe
I met this little honey, she said, ""Hi, my name is Bunny""
I never would have thought she was out for my money
Now she appeared to me to be smart and legit
Equipped with hips that'll break your whole shit
But before that I can get a chance to knock it

First she tried to say that she was playin
She musta thought I was a fool cause she was sayin
""Ugh, oh D-Nice, I want you, I want you""
I wouldn't try to trust her even if I want to
I wanted just to smack her in the face
But hittin females is just a bad mistake

Cause next she tried to kick it to my boy Too $hort

[ VERSE 1 ]
The TR 808, and I cultivate with this trait
Nobody can imitate or relate, cause I'm the great (say what?)
Here's your fate, put your weight down on it
And if you try to step to me, I make you pay down pon it (bo!)
Cause I'm the one, and some compare me to the drum
The lyrics and bass combined will make your sound system hum
So when I come you should bow down gratefully
Cause even if you're protected, ya can't face the D
Cause the microphone is just a crumb in your possession
Considerin that I take the cake in this profession
So here's a lesson on the bass with smooth deliverance
And it's called the 'TR 808 experience'

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
There's no mistakin, there's not another brother great when
I step in the place, step out my face with the haste, and
Cause I'm the TR 808, and
Rippin the mic up, in other words you know I'm breakin
New grounds with my sounds, so don't consider
Tryin me (say what?) cause I don't pop the glitter
On my gear, no, not even a tiny bit
I'm Nice, not Ice, so I don't rock the shiny shit
I rock my Nikes instead when I strut (say what?)
I may rock a ring when I feel, but so what?
My rhymes are sharp, so they cut
You're on my tip so much, I mistake you for my cup

Yeah
Right about know I want all y'all suckers to know this is real
(Yes, D-Nice, you got the rhymin skills)
So anyone who cannot go with the flow that I throw
I get the dough, and oh - now you know
I got the

Well I'm known to wreck a mic like a prince, so all hail
To the raw deal, on a scale your style's frail
I don't believe I can fail, cause I'm headstrong
You're trackin me, plus jackin me knowin that you're dead wrong
I got a Tec for those that want to step
You're ghost, cause since you're playin me close you're gettin checked
And I can't conceive a better way to do it
So when you're in my comp, get ready to be stomped, there's nothin to it
Cause I got piles of wicked styles and files of tracks
I get wild with a South Bronx style of rap
So you think you got rap sewn happily?
How's that: you couldn't sow shirts in a factory
You're what I label as a hip-hop hypocrite
You smile in my face, behind my back runnin off with lip
But I got somethin to kill that, though
I'm a real rap pro, bad bro, so now you know

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now back to the scene of the crime
I was taught to bust a nine
At any and all who's outta line
Yo, that's the way I was shown how to hold my own
Until I found other ways on the microphone
I used to see so many out on the ave. die
Strung high, playin a game, and that's why
So many up in the Bronx, they got done
For livin a lifestyle of crime like it was fun
But now I'm hittin ya hard and pullin the cards
Of those that want to act a fool, they got schooled
And got caught with a right to the mug
It wasn't enough, cause they wanted to bug and caught a slug
And got they bodies just laid to rest
Cause in the streets you gotta get all you can, and no less
The first minute you do, you get bucked
So you and your crew better duck
When you step into the Bronx

(The TR 808)
(Straight, straight from the Bronx)

Check it
I want to take this time
To send this out to my man Dino
And to my man Scott-La-Rock
Cause if it wasn't for them
I wouldn't be here today
But since I'm here
I'ma continue to make funky music for my brothers
You know what I'm sayin?
I'm outta here

Well, it's about that time for the hyper one to react
But in fact, get back, cause I got the sudden impact
And I get hot like a sunny day
So the man D-Nice ain't the one to play
Cause I remember the one who tried to carry on
Stepped up and got ran like a marathon
Cause he thought he was able
And got served with the 'Crumbs On The Table'
Cause I'm the type wihthout Vanilla hype
I rush into the night and snuff you with a pipe
That's right, so rappers with lip
When I flip, you might just catch a Mac-10 clip
Cause I've had it up to here with the nonsense
Swingin with this you get dissed
Cause yo, my mouth is like a loaded Tec-9
For those that try to take mine

Now guess what I heard: a brother can't flow
That is a no, no, no, cause I flow just like a all-pro
So now I'm ready to go, cause I'm open now
Competition that's dissin gets broken down
So just sit down, clown, or I'm smackin ya
Cause I'm rough, yet smooth as an Acura
So capture my stature and rapture
And I'll never ask you to praise me like a statue
Just dig into the music that I threw down
And now you know who to call for a new sound
Cause I sat back and watched some get laughed at
Tryin to get live with weak raps and a half-track
But here's a piece of the whole pie
So grab your mic and give it a bold try
You try to step up, remember I stepped through
For those that get stuck, it's Nice to the rescue
(To the rescue, Nice)
I burn rappers till they turn to dust
So all competition better catch the bus
Or get crushed and ate like food, boy
That's the outcome messin around with the rudeboy

I feel your troubles lifting
I'll be there to break your fall
When your feeling small

Chorus:
It's gonna be alright
Don't luck yourself away
It's gonna be alright
Coz everyehere loves goes
Somebody feels the Pain,
It(ll be alright again

No words that I can say
Can drive your fears away
But I'm trying
Everyone knows best
But Really they know less
Of what your going through
I see the bigger picture
I feel your troubles lifting
I'll be there to break your fall
You can have it all

Chorus

If you're lost and alone at night
I can be your guding light
If you're gonna run then run to me
Fly with the highs and share the lows
We'll always have each other to hold
To the end you can depend on me

Chorus(Ã?2)

It's gonna be alright



",Alright
D-Side,"When she said I'd love you like no other
And she said our love would last forever
I was young and didn't understand then
What it was could beat inside of me

And she believed in ever after
In a world where all your dreams come true
And if I had a chance I'd tell her a thousand times a day
That I still need you I can hear you

Chorus:
Say you'll always love me
And be the one to understand
Take my life and never leave me
And just remember that I'm always near you - always there

We used to live and laugh about tomorrow
Running out of precious time we borrow
And there was you and love was all you wanted
In your heart you'll find where we belong

And she was always there beside me
Reaching out and holding me tonight
If I had a chance I'd tell her a thousand times a day
That I still need you I can hear you

Chorus

After love has come and gone
You wonder what remains
And you will you have the strength to let
Your feelings show again
It's never easy but I tell you
A thousand times a day
That I still need you I can hear you

Chorus(Ã?2)



",Always
D-Side,"I won't forget you, I'll miss you more all the time
But I need yo let you, know that apart you're still mine, because

With everything I ever have, everything I 'll learn on the way,
I'll wipe your tears away
Everything I ever have, everything you'll ever need
Everything you want me to stay
You'll still be mine today I'll wipe your tears away

Chorus:
Crying now, won't drown the love out
I'll wipe your tears away
You and I don't need a goodbye
Don't hide
I'm here tonight so baby don't cry

There's no tomorrow, without you I don't feel the dance
But I need to follow, my own feet to give us a chance, because

All the dreams I ever have, everything I long for today
Might take me far away
All the dreams I ever have, it's not as if I wanna leave
When every last look that you take
Just makes me want to stay please wipe your tears away

Chorus

It's cold and it's lonely tonight

Because everything I ever have, Everything I'll learn on the way
I'll wipe youe tears away

",Baby Don't Cry
D-Side,"Isn't it strange?
Isn't it wrong?
When we've known it for so long
This is insane
We're so right,
But we'll be all alone tonight

And if I tell you girl the moment that I met you
I knew my life would change and now I can't forget you
You're the one believe me now

Chorus:
One more night alone in my bed,
I can't sleep without you
One more night alone in my head,
Can't stop thinking about you.
You're still the one
And I can't live without you
Always the one
We can't have one more night alone

It's not too late
But it's time
That we both made up our minds
It's okay, it's alright,
There's so much more than one more night

And if I tell you girl the moment that I met you
I knew my life would change and now I can't forget you
You're the one believe me now

You're still the one
And I can't live without you
Always the one
We can't have one more night alone

",One More Night Alone
D-Side,"Hey you what do you say
You found yourself alone today
Did you lose your place in line?

Hey you what do you know,
All messed up no place to go
Do you feel so left behind?

You can't stay
Sleeping on your own again
So close your eyes abd count to ten
The love you need is here again

Chorus:
I'll be your ticket to the final
Junkie to your vinyl
I just wanna be your groupie
You don't need Brother Blaine or Beckham
You shoud just forget them
Baby you're a superstar to me

So come on back look at me
I'm the one who wants to be
The greatest fan you'll ever find

You can't stay
Sleeping on your own again
So close your eyes abd count to ten
The superstar is here again, she's here again She's here again

Chorus

So what if they're super famous
Their 15 minuites are over
And everyone knows
The superstar is here again, she's here again you're here again

Chorus:
Who wants the world if I can't have you to be my love?
Who wants the world if I can't have you to see me through?

Only time can tell you that you've made a big mistake
Now I can't let our time pass me by
I was such a fool to think that I could walk away
When all that really counts is you and I

I've lost everything now
But you could bring it back to me somehow

All the dreams I had lie shattered
I would give the world away
If I could hold in my arms again

Yeh, you wild man, you wild
That's no place to meet a nice girl
You want to meet a nice girl you gotta go to nice places
Like church, the library, or shit
Go where I'm goin' tonight
Go to Hunt's Point boy, Hunt's Point
That's where they at, that's where they at

[Verse 1]
Started off the night right, it was me and three of my boys
down at some bar sip lil rum, feelin' kinda lonesome
Mad open off the port hole that made me want to explode one
Figure we'll go find something to do once this nigga Dalow come
I chilled continued takin' sips, I knew I was buggin'
Cause I see this chick pass by and had thoughts ah rapin' that
nah my mind was buggin', eased up to the rump
I wanted to exchange some words with this chick
and not come off as being dumb, so I
Settle for the car a little tipsy so I stumbled
Got distracted by a horn goin' off feelin' the conscience rumble
I turned around and see my man Dalow
I peeped him call my man Isley to the car
and ask him where he wanted to go
We all hopped in, inserted some hip hop in his radio's cassette deck
Conversatin' who can have sex best
Gettin' bored circlin' the block
Talkin' about how lovely it would be right about now
to have a chick, workin' the cock
My man Eric said let's go to H-P, no doubt
We haven't even been there lately, yeh we out
I said, I'm gonna have a bitch drinkin' my babies
My man June said you crazy
Nowadays these condoms'll dead the AIDS be	
So we hopped on a major D (detour) and
Tip of my joint buck wid pre-semen
Ready and willin' and heavily breathin'
Anticipatin' the moment as we hopped on across Bronx
My man June was singin' along til Ikinelli tossed him a blunt

We finally get to the area
Seen a blonde black chick wid a fat ass
Lustfully sayin' I'll take care of ya
Tell her to get close to the car so we can get a good step at her
She pulls false teeth out her mouth
tellin' me just get prepared for ya?
The sight made my joint go down
My man Isley said make a left on this corner
I'ma show y'all where to go now
Some next chicks suckin' some next dick
We see her face is bangin' so we're tryna find out if the rest is
She steps up, get a good glimpse of her breast-eses
Pulled her shirt back down
reaches for the door handle then exits from out the vehicle
Tellin' her home gal, here we go we got some customers
I said, how much would it be for up-in-yas?
So we started negotiatin' prices
I said chill what if you 5-0, and you tryna arrest me
Let's see some titties or somethin'
Bitches physical frames was pumpin' they said
Let's break it up yo them niggaz seem to be frontin'
I said yo, if you show us somethin' it's on
She flashed a left breast
Had us open askin' if she accepts checks
Makin' em laugh, anything to get there face in the grass
She smiled slightly, sayin' that, all they accept is cash
Chargin' thirty bucks a blow, twenty if it's three sucks or more
I was broke and my man spotted me the dough
So we, parked by the curb
Three of my peeps stepped outta the car
While me and my boy where patiently awaitin' to get served
Two chicks stepped into the ride ready to get loose
I said, you gotta rock my mic correctly in order for me to produce

Meus olhos não veem a minha direção
Da minha boca saem coisas sem sentido
Você era o meu farol e hoje estou perdido

O sofrimento vem à noite sem pudor
Somente o sono ameniza a minha dor
Mas e depois? E quando o dia clarear?
Quero viver do teu sorriso, teu olhar

Eu corro pro mar pra não lembrar você
E o vento me traz o que eu quero esquecer
Entre os soluços do meu choro eu tento te explicar
Nos teus braços é o meu lugar
Contemplando as estrelas, minha solidão
Aperta forte o peito, é mais que uma emoção
Esqueci do meu orgulho pra você voltar
Permaneço sem amor, sem luz, sem ar

Perdi o jogo e tive que te ver partir
E a minha alma, sem motivo pra existir
Já não suporto esse vazio, quero me entregar
Ter você pra nunca mais nos separar
Você é o encaixe perfeito do meu coração

Som e det liv det gjeld

Så vei'n e litt for smal

På ei veikro nordom Stjørdalen

Og no merke han at han plutselig e pigg
Attmed Sentralsykehuset finn han parkeringsplass

D.H.T.,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth...

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say ""come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen... 

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said: ""Pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly... 

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debitures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen...

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
the world was younger than today
when dreams were all they gave for free
to ugly duckling girls like me...

We all play the game, and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say: ""Come on, dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen...

You can run to me,
You can laugh at me,
Or you can walk right out that door.
But I can't be your friend anymore.

So, baby, now it's up to you:
Do I win or do I lose?
Will my heart fly or lie broken on the floor.
Well, take me as I am,

Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes

And it rages out of control
And the love we made is so deep, so strong
And when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, slow burn

Tell him, 'Step off, I'm doin the Hump'

then analyze the information and press send

obstacle or pussy to stop him from bonin a hoe

Had the same effects from coughin blowin smoke out

My skills ill, and all of that above
Confidence, I'm not worried bout a street buzz
I'm O.C., who you?  I never heard of ya
Get out my face 'fore I turn into a motherfuckin murderer
I want the green like indo, a mansion, a car
A wife who's never been a bimbo
Too much to ask well to me that's simple
want to retire on a yacht called the S. S. Minnow

Treatin me like a nigga havin a million records sold
Now a starchild, phenmonen like the X-Files

Fear me like genocide, serious
How I do it through your stereo, mysterious

Like robot Kong on a destroy mission
A matter of life and death you try to fight for breath
I snatch your heart from a slice through your chest
Who the best, from New York to Bogota
Who got face thinkin they scare me with a scar, shit

New York is the city, Bronx is the county
Learn from the best so the rest just fest
Now I'm gettin booked at the Philmore West
Or either in the village so kill it skillet
Ya ask ya'self
Will it eva cease?
'Cause Diamond's sharp as a crease
I only use bees wax, I'll neva use grease
On my dreads but instead if you want some kicks
Step to the mic I'm an 8 to 1 pick
You reap what you sow and I can reap it

Now, you might catch me at a party rhyming, talking shit on the mic
And sippin on some Bicardi Limon 
That nigga Diamond, prone to shining cause I'm nice 
I turn, men to mice walk around with the ice
On my necklace, in the 7, drivin reckless 
Hon-ey you blew it if my CD ain't on your check list 
See you should expect this so blow see it's the bro
Who gets the dough, on the low like Piss Capone
What you ain't know? Steady flow's my deposition
I bet you wishin you had it but you suffer from repetition
I bet you listen, I catch you slippin on some smoke
Crush your throat, plus your broke, your just a hoax
When it comes to this here, cause this year
I'm lettin competitors know, that whenever this predator goes
I leave foes on the verge, niggas see me on stage, lose the urge
My style merge together when words come together to spurge
My endeavors on meat, furs, and leathers I use verbs
Some better pronouns, you better go now
You don't want to throw down seen how I knocked the other foe down
Yes-ter-day, seems niggas had less to say
Didn't wear your vest today, lets just say
Your reaction, resem-bles a threat
You get sweat (sweat) fuckin with the best kep

Find a nest on mercury speculations

Get vexed, like I'm hittin some new butt
And fade MC's like a crew cut
You do what?, not to the greatest and when you play this
Some Mercedes not even after a 3 year hiatus
The kid is still nice with his, tight with his 
With no advice to give son, so suffice to this
To say I'm on my way, see ya paid 
And you could catch us on belay chillin in Bombay
My palm stay holdin, federal reserve notes
I bet a few've your nerves broke in a tussle
I'm tryin to eat lunch with Russell, flex my muscle
While your busy bitchy, my record label doesn't hustle 
Enough for me, it's tough to be in the spot light
You froze under the hot light, and wonder why your pockets not right
I'm elevatin sip Moet and Bruce gone celebratin
Through the Bronx, acceleratin on private blocks
Nuthin about it stops like powdered rocks 
Ve-ry addic-tive and I become vin-dic-tive
Pains inflic-ted off foes, how it goes
I put the blows, on your weak ass flows, huh!

Check it out, for those that know me
Ya wonder why I always play low key
I know I got people and fans that like me
But all the noise and attention don't excite me
So I just lounge and play the D.L
In the crib with just me and a female
I'm still slick besides the others
Cause a player like me
Yo, I'm smoother than the Isley Brothers
When I'm on the scene I get feedback
Brothers runnin up, wassup, where you be at?
I be by myself just coolin
Cause I don't have time to sweat what someone else is doin
Cause their not equal to me
I got places to go, money to make, people to see
What'cha gonna do
The man is comin through
(You got it goin on)
Hey yo, that ain't nothin new
But my fame is stressin others
So you always got some that always want to test a brother
But I'm wildin at home kid
I'm straight makin papes, so tell me what ya problem is
Ya talk about unity, but when I turn my back
You talkin about what ya want to do to me
Yeah, you could keep riffin
I ain't the one, I sent ya home with ya teeth missin
So stop runnin at the mouth
Straight up and down
You, you know what I'm about

Knockin brothers off
Knockin brohters out (3X)

I'm out to get dough
Makin brothers petro
Some suckas don't like me
But I could care less though
Cause I'm a command y'all
I'm smackin' brothers up like Puerto Ricans play handball
But I ain't the funny type that joke around, huh
I gotta get my money right
And I got the right game
I'm definetely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
Cause I got strategy
I'm rollin head cracks, trips
And makin all the brothers mad at me
They might as well give up
The way I'm takin all the dough, this might as well be a stick up
Cause it's a mans thing
The way I got things sold
Yo, they can't do a damn thing
Tryin to gain props
I ain't the one to see
Ya clowns mess around and get played like a drum machine
You gotta find a better way
I'm pullin everything from your car to your resume
Cause I don't play clown
I'm tryin to get mine 
That's why my face stay frown
I don't smile or try to play my foul
I light your boys like ?tile?
Hey yo, you know my style
So just slow down, cause y'all can't throw down
And y'all can't accept that a brothers makin dough now
And I'm livin better, true
I makin more noise than the loudest heavy metal group
It's the cool man, brother with the smooth plan
That's why I'm seeing more papers than a newstand
So peep it, don't try to run and speak it
Point blank that keep my way about secret
While brothers is packin still, actin ill
I'm on the D.L, with a female
And I'm stackin bills
How ya livin?  Yeah I'm livin swell
Cause a brother like me 
Yo I'm ringin bells

No repetition holdin down Bronx tradition
My composition simply squash the competition
Step up and get beat into submission
Cause this musician with the street intuition
7-35 fuel-injected transmission
My opposition will have to recognize my steez
Exotic trees leave a trail of scuffed up knees
So please you couldn't touch this cat with a stick
Quick to inflict tricks blaze up in the flick
Son I'm sick and you could put that on my mama
Exclamation point, quotation, comma
Lay up on the beaches when I'm down in the Bahamas
The skills go back to the days of wonderama
So pass the scama, son its time to get this money
So we can relax and recline where its sunny

I went from standin on the corner sellin cocaine
To rippin shows live on stage the hoes yellin my name
To be precise rippin mics is the light of my life
You frontin like you trife but never pulled a heist in your life
The price of my ice is sky high, I'm a fly guy
Its every thugs dream I really love cream, its in my blood stream
You mad cause I got more chicks than you, more bricks than you
More nines and extra clips than you

Jackin creeps, packin heat, these Harlem streets is for keeps
Much love to all my peeps who got a couple of sheets

Yo, most these rap cats don't know
Where it started, where it came from
We been rappin this shit since Day One
Diggin' In The Crates originators
Why niggas playa haters
Knowin' damn well you can't fade us

You better take me out quick
'Cause I'm accurate when I bust mine
And make it count like Jordan at crunch time
Just in case I play Fishburn and double up on nines
You can never make it rain or stop my sunshine
So I keep eyes on these chumps the whole time
Take note of your technique like we scheme on dimes
Disregard your crew, fuck your heart 
Put a slug in me, it'll be marriage
'Til death do us part
Until then master this art and kill them

Hold my head, but when I've had it I test chins
If that ain't real then feel the stainless steel

We all gleam, plus we feind for more cream
You got some nice players they just on the wrong team

Avoid concern we'll set you straight like a perm
Rap apostle lyrical type picasso kinda hostile
Nothing less than colossal, you dig me like fossils
Be the cat with the groovy soul
Lotta rappers out here acting with no movie roles
You know the deal I represent skills
And niggas with bank reels that live to make a mil

On beat off beat drunk flow here we go
Assignments handed out each individual stand out
Carryin his own clout
Phenomenal motions of rap I pose a threat
Foes I put em on a block like a hole in a pin

And what you make in a year I make in one show 
Now you want to frisk me and search my ride 
Call me all kinda names try to hurt my pride 

You're just mad 'cause I'm a young cat 
Pockets dumb fat, talkin' bout where the gun at

I walk around with six thou without the pistol 
My whole click's wild I'm rich Pah 
No more sticks I'm makin' hits now 

I drink Cristal I'm through breaking laws 
I don't sell coke anymore I do tours 
So get that flashlight out of my face 
To bring me down Jake do whatever it takes 

Word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped 
Praying that I fall for the mouse trap, I doubt that

Why do I end up in so much shit 
I don't came way too far to be calling it 
Jake want to lock me up even though I'm legit 
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick 
 
Hey yo enough is enough federals try to set me up 
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lost into dust 
Plus they want a nigga
But they know Big Joey Crack ain't never rat a cat that he know 

I left the streets alone, and almost killed his mama 
So I'm a keep doin' what I'm doin' 
Pursuin' my dream til there enough cream to start my own union 
And show these kids how legit it is 

Shit is real I use a steel but now I own several businesses 
So where is your witness that you claim to have sayin' 
Extortin' New York and not payin' tax 
I lean back playin' the role playin' too low 

But it's the same ol Joe so don't get K.O. 
Hey yo I'm gonna fry for what I never did

Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel

You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

But the plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage.
Shady stay creative baby, hold your head up don't you let ?
One bit on these motherfuckin' suckers, your a soldier get up 
Stand up for what you believe in, as long as you breathin' 
They jealous of you man that the only reason they beeffin'

[Chorus: x2]

Its that Dirty dozen renegade, who done pulled the pin outta my grenade
38's so move your shit up out the way, you niggas won't forget about Mcvay 
You got summit to say let it out today or watch these bullets spray from these ten black fingers Huggin' these deadly mm's make Jeff domers think he caught a mistameaner,
See I'm dirty so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater don't lemme see you wid your heater you gets wet wid it,
Tell the motherfuckers Swift did it, packin' summit special in your crib, bitch get it,
Physically fitted to run your digits, I'm pastel with this rascal pointin' up your nostrils
You can split it and guess what we blowin' up the hospital
We wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe, I'm Hannibal Lector
This vinal cord disconnector findin' whores to lock them up in motels to inject her

[Chorus: x2]

I'm eatin' crews like I'm Hannibal 
There's no way I could be the gay rapper (why not) I only fuck animals
Stupid trick got my dick startin' to itch
Went to my mothers grave site and called her a stupid bitch
One on One in this blunt sport
I'm in divorce court 
Suein' my bitch over a pack of newports
Six times I've been arrested 
How would you feel if you were a Jehovah's Witness and always gettin' molested
I'm smokin' dank and drinkin' drink, I can't have any kids 
Cause I'm fuckin' shootin' blanks
Don't you know Bizzare don't give a fuck
Nicole's a whore I'm glad OJ murdered a slut, responsibility I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, how could Richard Simons beat the president
Call me a weirdo, call me bizarre, I stick it up your ass while you shit diarrhea

Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is 
Whoops I did it again, didn't I? my shit, 
Its harder to figure out then what Britney's tit size is
I probably pissed you off again, didn't I bitch? (so what)
Grab Christina Aguilera, kiss my grits 
Do you know how many shits I give, I wish I did 
So I could quit giving these twisted little kids ideas 
This just in, Britney just kissed Justin 
She just fucked Ben 
Got tit fucked 
And dick sucked him
If Affleck can get his ass licked how come I can't, shit 
God damn bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this 
Are those pictures I made of us together on the internet 
As close as I'm eva gonna get to hitting her from the back 
Shit, when it comes to that, I hit harder from the back 
Then everlast when he's plugging lethal in his fucking ass 
Just gimme 1 more chance, Britney hit me 1 more time

They like where I'm from (uh huh), we don't bite our tongue (yea)
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns? (blah blah blah)
Its sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme 
When you work, you ain't getting paid for that overtime (damn)
Its only music, media know it, but they blind (that's right)
I ain't in you're life so stay the hell up outta mine (nigga)
And your the reason why princess Diana ended up dying
You people get offended, I don't care

Trying to get us to leave

But holding me back from what I say just ain't me

Carson drinks beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch(shut up)

I'm (what), a human mutt fuck a being I'm a dog
Fuck lambs, I'm silencing 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walking, talking, Ouija board
Speaking in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before

Picking up transvestites on my Harley-Davidson (hey hop on)
My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
And take your bottles to the store (nigga, I'm takin these)
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay (dad it's me)
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage (I'm sorry) I had to eat it (ohh)
My dick is burning, it ain't cause of disease
Because I'm jacking off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze (AHH!)

As a yung'un, I was beat where I was living (aight)
Cross-dressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed caused the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin caused the cop's feelings
To be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you Bo Derek; I throw you face flat off the terrace
So you can have somethin' to stare at

And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz done felt
A deranged team, smokin ganja greens
This car beam'll make your fuckin head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the D

Shoot 'em up my ass, let your little brother try 'em

You just know - that's the new shit

With a prosthetic arm and smellin like Boone's Farm
Hidin under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own moms

Strapped to my stomach screamin, ""Let's get it on!""
A lush that love to drink, drunk drivin a tank
Rollin over a bank, cops see me and faint

Push your baby carriage into the street, 'til it's mince meat

And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles

Blow his head back right in front of the priest sayin, ""You hear that?""
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink

Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made 'em drop his coffin

These beads I'm swingin is stingin 'em
See all these niggaz? When I step in the club, I'm bringin 'em

Hey yo dog
I got some shit on my motherfucking chest that
I need to get off 'cause
If I don't
I'ma fucking explode or something
Now look
This is the story about
Some little fucking girls that I know
It goes like this

It's so easy for me to make enemies anymore it's sickening
People are looking for an excuse to jump on my shit list
Sticking their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that
I don't want to be in shit
I never had a beef with you corny son of a bitches
But now this shit is broke and you can't do nothing to fix it
So I'm telling you right now
Motherfucker Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real
B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefing
See he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'da never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpacking cyphering name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you say in it
I'da never involved you
But you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shit list and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known
That song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV
Now look who's mentioning me
That little fucking weasle, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props on that song you on national TV
Talking 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me
Come on dog, you was supposed to be on that song
Talking 'bout how bad you hate him
Now you all on his thong
What's wrong, you scared, and Fred, you said you was dissing himtoo
I should of knew better than to listen to you
You fucking sissy
Up on stage screaming how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act
And don't call me kissing my ass
Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song
I'm trying to prewarn you
Lethal, when I fucking see you dog, I'm swinging on you
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't draw
Up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all are some

Girls (y'all are some God damn girls)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fucking sissies
You pussies keep talking shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, ha)
How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentley's
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and walk around

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't want to be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'cause I don''t ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't want to be in 'em
All I ask is that you don''t open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

Now see if you diss me and I respond
The beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show I'll strip you naked
See I was smart
I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dogs that'll die for me like I;ll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot, like I fight for Kim
All of them been with me through this fucked up life that I'min
That goes for all of my dogs from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Melman
Till I'm hoist away
In my coffin
I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I never give a fuck
I won't ever be interested
Love me or hate me
As much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I've stated
The shit that I been through
My pencil never could pencil
But I won't ever be this gullible ever again, no
Next time I'll know when someone's copying off me
I'm not being cocky
I just know when somebody's mocking me
I stick up my middle finger
He sticks up his finger
I say fuck Christina
He says fuck Christina, but meaner
So from doing a song with Method
To begging to get accepted
I'm pegging Fred
With the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal don't forget what I said
I'm fucking you up punk
You're dead
Don''t think that I'm playing
And fuck Bizkit
'cause I know you're saying fuck D12
Only not to our face, under your breath, and to yourselves
Little

Girls (motherfucking females)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fucking sissies
You pussies keep talking shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (now we all know the truth)
How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentleys
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and walk around

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't want to be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't want to be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

And that's it
That's all there is to it dog
If you don't want to do the fucking song
Don't say you're down with doing the fucking song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfucking MTV
Talking about Everlast can whip my motherfucking ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog
Just say you''re scared of Whitey Ford
That's it
That's all you had to fucking say
I wouldn't a said shit
I would of backed off
Did the motherfucking song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it
That's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fucking you up shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards

I'm an instigator
Ain't nobody worse than me
I'm an instigator
I be the first to beef
First to squeeze
Take heed to the words I speak

[Kuniva]
I love getting shit started
I instigate a peace talk into a beef talk
Until police need chalk to chalk you up
Have bitches walking up
Smacking you in your face screaming that you talk too much
Tell women you said you fucked 'em
Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him
Raid his pockets and stuck him
Till they gather in front of your crib
Guns and law clips
Laughing when they shoot at you over the wrong shit
I lock down your block with lies
It's so believable
You run and grab your shotguns, glocks, and nines
Walking blind
Incite fights until they erupt
Instigate my own death 'cause killing you ain't enough

[Swifty]
I don't give a fuck if we beefing or not
I squeeze first
I'ma heat up your spot
I'm a nigga that breathe dirt
On these streets everyday
Snatching nigga's lle'
How you bitches needing work?
You can get it from McVay
I'm despiteful
I tie a hoe
A maniacal vile animal
Liable to leave you strapped with your Bible
I'm psycho
My bullets won't fly by you
You want to kill me?
(bang)
You got the right to
Ain't gotta wait till night to snipe you
If I don't like you
You getting hit in broad day light with a white rifle
In front of your window I'm looking right through
I love when I see a nigga get stuck

(I'm an instigator)
Drama tends to follow me
I know
I probably owe all of my friends apologies
Lie to every bitch just to get her to swallow me
Get a lobotomy?
Nigga this runs to my artery
Guns are a part of me
I pack more than pottery
I ought to be jailed for depicted mockery
Ain't gon' fight
The blood on the niggas that shot at me
I don't twist the truth
I just make it gothic, see?
I'm nothing but a liar
With a big ass mouth, dick, and fists
Big enough to knock your bitch ass out
Got no reason to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you
I rap with him
But I don't like Proof

[Proof]
Nigga fuck you
Me and Swift got plans to jump you
Type of nigga to shake your hand and stomp you
(I'm an instigator)
Convinced a tenth grader
To run up inside his classroom
And leave the kids sprayed up
Bitch straight up
This is the season for squeezing off triggers
On niggas for no reason
Either jump or quit running your mouth
Pull a gun out
Better use it till the bullets run out

I throw a brick at your crib
Having you standing on the porch screaming
(Look what you did!)
I ain't feeling no remorse
Nigga just pick up the kids
Swift got first dibs
On these cherry hot slugs 
That'll barbecue your ribs
I'm preparing death beds
Quick to bust lead
While I'm staring at the feds
Tearing off their legs
Once you drop dead
They'll be swearing it's a plague
I'm sicker than a ?
Watch the ? with dreds
You could shake if you move
Ditch with no clue
Don't put shit on your tape
With your skits and interludes
And once I finish you
They wouldn't put it in the news
I'm nuts so you hoes ain't got the guts to interview

Wrapped in a quilt

Man, I could persuade any bitch
To have eight of my kids
Shit, bitch
I should be locked up
For having honies' legs cocked up
In the back of my pop's truck
I'm not fucked up
I just got a fetish for shooting
Cum in coochie
'Till the pussy is booting it back out
I 69'd this one bitch and she bled in my mouth (shit)
Kicked her out
Cleaned the couch out
And beat up my crouch
I don't gotta creep in motels
I cheat at my house
See I''m a dog
I don't need to keep a secret hide out (naw)

All night I been snorting
Your age and where you're from
Is just not important (naw)
You look like one of my mistresses
On welfare, ten kids like the rest of my bitches
Dreams of fucking a handicapped bitch
Suck my dick while your teeth start to grit (whore)
Inner slave, that's how I want you to treat me
I ain't into S&M
But I love when you beat me
I told you I was a horny ass freak
While I'm beating my meat
Your daughter acting like she asleep (ya right)

D12,"Yeah, welcome to Amityville (Detroit, nigga!)
The reason why rappers gotta pack pistols (Why is that?)

Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this do
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

Nigga, we violently active, so fuck with us
See I'm backwards, I slap niggas and punch bitches
Just for asking, they musta been wanting to meet the Lord
When my parents talked to me, they got mean mugged and ignored
They were snooping through my closet, seen drugs on the floor
Shells from the 44 scattered over they porch
Busting pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
Tryna break your neck to conversate? Bitch, I'll do it for you
Catch me laughing at your funeral when they lower you
You and your ho, you gots to go, bitches died slow and horrible
There's no tomorrow for any nigga we'll shower you
We young strapped and powerful and I ain't gotta lie to you

Stepped in the door, waving the 44
Blazing at po-po, escaping and lay low
They call my tongue ya-yo, but I spit fire
I lit five inside a fucking dick-rider
The clip slider, love to blast a Mag
You a fag, you love being ass to ass
Grab a gun by the nose with the butt to gat-spank ya
Never say that I'm a gangsta (Now that's gangsta)
Y'all niggas sound like Jigga but act like Pac
Yo my trigger got the flu and this gat might cough
It ain't nothing to tell, empty shells for the witness
I'm the hot nigga that's gon' put hell outta business
It won't be the same since we touching the game
Make the hardest nigga in your crew, tuck in his chain
Y'all think this shit's a game and I'm bluffing for fame?
I'll squeeze off this tec until nothing remains

Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

The only time that I'm at peace is when I'm close to one
Cause I don't know what's waiting for me when my vocals are done
Tote the gun, it's my way of life and it works
These cowardly niggas'll put your fucking life in the dirt
Cause it was wrong how they left my dog, he was priceless
Alone in the streets, bleeding, staring, laying lifeless
That's why I'm heated, you never know who starts creeping
Waking you up with AK's while you lie sleeping
I'd rather pack the heat and not need it
Rather than need one and not have it, I married this Glock-matic

You know the sound when I'm spinning round
Spitting these rounds from four pounds
While the whole crowd screaming as loud
From they mouths as they possibly allow?
Nothing is parallel to making you carousel
Aerial somersault like ferris wheels to a pair of shells
Denaun carry the nine where I go
Bullets whistle and hit you while I'm shooting at 5-0
Some semi-automatic for static's the motto
Spitting like *Columbine kids* from Colorado

Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to

Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

This nine'll turn a softy to a hard rock
It'll make Jehovah's Witnesses, think before they knock (Sorry, sorry!)
It'll make your grandmother come outta her purse
It'll make Limp Bizkit, get rid of Fred Durst
It'll make Holyfield start fighting
It'll make Mase say fuck church and go back to writing
It'll make Shyne say he sound like Biggie Smalls
It'll make R. Kelly, give respect to Aaron Hall
It'll make Christopher Reeves start walking
It'll make a dog with no voice, suddenly start barking
It'll make a nun turn to a filthy slut
It'll make the hardest pitbull, turn to a fucking mutt
It'll make a Muslim dye his hair blonde
It'll make a redneck start to read the Holy Qu'ran (Need Jesus!)
It'll make Ike stop beating Tina
It'll make Slim Shady fall back in love with Christina

Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (AHH!)
These 'shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
I said come on, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (me!)
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb-ass sit down

Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out

It gotta be acid cause the X is gone
Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan

Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum

Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?

Pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible and killed the Hulk

Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm, old and gray look for dope to smoke
No okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a (you're crazy!)

I pop fo' E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine

I don't want to go to school, I don't need no education
I don't want to be like you, I don't want to save the nation
I just want to live my life, everyday a celebration
One day I'ma leave this world, I'm waiting for the revelation

[Bizarre]
I want to kill myself! I'm still debating
In front of a baptist church, masturbating
Praying to Satan, think I'm crazy cause I smoke crack
live on in a two-family flat? (Fuck it)
Tired of gettin hit in the face with a broom
My moms on her period, my dad's in my room (Daddy no!)
I got ten rocks and I need to get out
I told him in five minutes, out my own damn mouth (Moms smoke crack)
My poor grandmother, God bless her soul
The bitch got AIDS (aww) she just waiting to die of a cold
There's three things that keep me from being a Nazi
I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace

[Kon Artis]
No matter how bad the beating, I went to school cheating
My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meeting
Stick with school I had to have nuts just to do it
Got bored and became truant
When I had the gall to go I just couldn't do it
I was lured into corners by the peer pressure shit
How would you feel if you was held by the tip of a barrel
Getting threatened to get your skin ripped to bone marrow
Bet suburban kids never got rushed for their apparel
like me, outcast, last in class
First to leave, when the teacher called on me
Best believe I had somethin up my sleeve

[Eminem]
I've been praised and labeled as crazed
My mother was unable to raise me, full of crazy rage
An angry teenager, nothing can change me back
Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
I was boosting, so influenced by music I used it
as an excuse to do shit, ooh I was stupid
No one can tell me nothing hip-hop overwhelmed me
to the point where it had me in a whole another realm
It was like isolating myself was healthy
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
Compelled me to excel when school it failed me
Expelled me and when the principal would tell me
I was nothing, and I wouldn't amount to shit
I made my first million and counted it
Now look at, a fucking drop-out that quits
Stupid as shit, rich as fuck, and proud of it
That's why

Steadily beating my psychiatrist ass just for asking about my past

can get yo' beloved abducted, smothered in blood quick
You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck
Was crazy like my father, it must of been poison in that nigga's nut
Far as probation, fuck peeing in cups
I violate at any time, let 'em see the blunt
I grew up steadily masturbating inside of cells
Young as hell, having conversations with myself
You could tell I wasn't lenient, a disobedient
Lynched and slapped teachers, bitch I'm not reading it
You don't know what dos go through, a little nigga
Sipping liquor with my old dude, what the fuck you goin' do?
I'm quick to curse you, I told my mother that I'ma hurt you
if you ever again mention a curfew

Look, my family ignored me and I don't like that
They don't even listen when I tell them I'll be right back

Cause you know daddy's a drunk and he don't clean shit
And yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man
I couldn't stand up to him, I just ducked and ran
I'm sick of this, I wish on Christmas
that I can get a loaded four-fifth and put a fucking end to this
(Fuck it) I got no friends and I can't get a bitch
Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
Nothing to smile about, I'm about to lose my mind
Got me an automatic nine, now I'm balling out

Wait 'til school's over, pu-pil are people to shoot through
Kids going cuckoo, with a two-two
Since my fame is this new dude, in this high school
Losing his noodle learn that people don't like you
The football jocks is, spitting on him
Popular kids in school is now picking on him
Burn out youngsta niggas now hitting on him
And his teacher in his English class keep flipping on him
And now he's grounded with no allowances
for drinking forty ounces, cause he was caught by his counselors
And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach?
Already got expelled for wearing a trench coat
All I ever seen is (violence, violence)
Told me to keep silent, stepped back in my eyelids
It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all
That's why I blew out my brains and murdered you all

The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin' the shit how borin' it gets

Its they who rapped me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry

Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin' my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin' (what?)
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
I hang you up naked by your ankles danglin' (ow, ow)
My need I stay stranglin, I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll shit on you!)
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest

Yo it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in choke holds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(hey, hey, hey!) I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like D-Bo fightin' Peablo Bryson (I'll shit on you)
So what you hollerin' and yellin' about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin' skeleton out
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; bling bling
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(C'mon, I'll shit on you!) Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimmin' pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too (*bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child (I'll shit on you!)

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you
I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me
I'll shit on you

You heard me
Bitch, I'll shit on you
D-12 will shit on you
I'll shit on you

Your life
Your wife
Your kids
Your car
I'll shit on you
Your house
Your spouse

[Chorus 1: x8]
Shit can happen

[Kon Artis]
Yo, yo, huh, yo, yo, yo
That's right motherfuckers we back
Same slanging, orangatangin, wilding out on hoodrats
They say I act like I'm too famous to say hi
And tell 'em what my name is but really I'm still nameless,
You niggas don't get it yet do you
Dealing out platinum or flop I still put it through you
Wit a luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal wit you in front of St Andrew's still?
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that roll you got
You goin' see these Runyan Ave. niggas that really need some Prozac
For sure that, ask the others
But gator lay you down next to your mother's mother's grandmother

[Kuniva]
You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight
Ready to fight and half the niggas I give dap to I don't even like
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it like the next selling Clippers' game
I kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom
You and your madame, it's really unexplainable how I have 'em
Who call they self screaming about a challenge
Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off mere talent
My skills are deeply embedded even your hoe said it
She was knock kneed I fucked her now she's bow legged
In the middle of rapping I drop the mic
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping
Kuniva and Kon Artis my nigga we get it cracking
While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughing

[Chorus 1]

[Kon Artis]
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen in him and yo' ass
You can be touched don't think you can't
Cause niggas ain't fucking around no more man [Repeat: x2]

[Swifty McVay]
The feds can't hold me, I hold feds
I was born wit a dark ass cloud over my head
Raining acid, you can't refrain from getting yo' ass kicked
Cause you talk too much you ask for it
I'm on some massive shit, everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performing at an orgy
These niggas get confronted, then they change stories
I touch you then they thinking everything is hunky dory
I even have you pour me the gasoline for me
Pulling up slowly, cocktailin' your homie 
You met a lot of niggas which you wouldn't want to know me
Yo' ass might not even make it home wit your rollie
Don't even try, in your system like e coli
Trying to beef with me, nigga please yo' people die
I'm so wicked that my mama gave birth illegally
I survived the abortion immediately, surprise! ah!

[Eminem]
Picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting
Or barricaded in a motel wit twelve shotguns
So when the cops come knocking each hand's got one
Cocked, ready to dump slugs heavy as shot puts
One man army, guns can't harm me
Young and army, worse than my Uncle Ronnie
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop carrying out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flipped and censorship
Your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship
Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite
I been giving it a hundred and ten percent
Cause when I'm bent most of my energy's spent on enemies
Eighty percent of what I invent is innocent
Twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
Ten's because I love being under your skin
Yeah shit can happen, so stick to rapping
Quit the yapping or I'ma lift the mack and
That can lead to another mishap happening
Skip the crap get the can of whoopass cracking

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
It can and it will (nigga)
Fuck around with Amityville and you DIE
Insanity spills from the mentality of twelve motherfuckers in six different bodies
With their personalities split
Fucking you up wit hit after hit
Sticking you up with clip after clip
Making you suck dick after dick
Dirty motherfucking dozen
The Kon Artis, motherfucking Peter S. Bizarre, Swifty McVay, the Kuniva
Dirty father fucking Harry
Putting you down in a cemetery, you get buried
All you of you motherfuckers suck our motherfucking cocks
We are not playing, we are not playing
We are not bullshitting, this is not a motherfucking joke",Shit Can Happen
D12,"Shit can happen
Shit can happen
Shit can happen (throw ya hands up!)
Shit can happen (throw ya hands up!)
Shit can happen (yeah, yeah)

[Kon Artis]
That's right motherfuckers we back
Same slanging
Orangutangin
Wilding out on hoodrats that say I act like like I'm too famous
To say hi
And tell 'em what ""My Name Is""
But really I'm still nameless

[Kon Artis]
I said hold up, hold up!
I know you didn't just go shit up on that stage, bitch ass nigga.

(Hey, fuck you!)
Fuck me?
Nigga 
Fuck you!
(Nigga!)
Whoa!

[Kon Artis]
Motherfucking ass nigga

That's how niggas get fucked up!",That's How (Skit)
D12,"[Chorus 1:]
It's (it's) be (be) cause (cause) of (of)
These drugs I do, that's why I do the things, I do
Be, cause, of,
These drugs I do that's why I do the things, I do

[Eminem]
It was like, whoa and then the fucking room started spinning and shit
And my friend came in he was like, ""Yo! Yo! Em! Em!
You putting that shit up your nose again?""
And I was like, ""Naw"" nothing like, everything was just spinning
I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster n' shit
Then I just started laughing and threw up all over the fucking floor
It's crazy

[Chorus 2:]
It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me
Do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do

[Eminem]
My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
You probably do what it said to do just from listening to it
It's got the power to get you to do it (c''mon)
So when the shit comes on, I want to see some shit jump off
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfucking kid get stomped
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did
Cause times like these, got me doing lines like these
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does
And is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids

[Bizarre]
Hey Stephanie (hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (okay!)
Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next tome
(huh?) 'Til I'm dead I''m taking blunts to the head
Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead
These mescalines got me sure
That I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour
Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?
Causing out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!)
Fuck it, I was born with half a brain
Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick
Cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit
The last time I sniffed blow
I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show
Bizarre be smoking a half a pound
Fucking the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down

[Chorus 1]

[Eminem]
It's like, back when I first went on tour
I like, went crazy I was like out of control
And, just was fucking wasted every night, like
Waking up the next morning like, where the
Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is going on
You see what I'm saying? I was just like, out of control

[Chorus 2]

[Swifty McVay]
These Benadryl's got me stiffer than a mannequin
Eight years old swallowing Anacins, standing over my Bannister
Laughing with a chromed out caliber 
The weed that I'm selling this ? look like the back of a tarantula
I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura
Smashing it, after framing a nigga with smack and dust
I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months
Cracking capsules to expand our blunts
I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head
Now I'm looking like a extra on ""Night of the Living Dead""
Until they find me on a stretcher
I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?
This crank'll have me blowin up banks like Uncle Fester

[Proof]
Watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend
Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (oh)
Blue pills, and purple mushrooms
(Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?)
Missing since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin see
Swallow Hennessy along with Tylenol 3
Grinding the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
While D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf up my stomach lining, drown in my vomit

[Chorus 1: x2]

[Eminem]
Cause I like, I always tell people, ya know what i'm saying like
If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody,ya know what i'm saying?
Keep that shit to yourself, because if anybody sees that, ya know what i'm saying
When you're out in the public eye and shit
They're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not
That's why I always tell my friends, know what I'm sayin but
I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck
I'll probably end up, dying from this shit one day
Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like
""Eminem dies from, drug overdose"" you know what I'm sayin? And
And my friends, they ain't no fucking better, ya know what I'm saying?
They ain't nothing but influences, bad influences to me, ya know
It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it
So do they

Trying to wild out
And we see just
How you laying
And we peep your style out
(You a punk)
When you chilling out in
Front of your truck
And get stuck

That's how n****s
Get f***ed up

No love at home
With your in-folks
And the world just keeps
F***ing with your mental
And all these kids making fun
Of your trench coat

Get shot up

Hating on us but
You come to our show

I crowd surf and you let me go
Oh no
Whip your as* when
I get off the floor
Just so you know though

When the police pull you over

Cops got AK's
why'all only got pumps

Got locked up

want to walk in the club

Push and shove (move)

So move over

Outta the stash

To go and shoot up a pad
Soon as you finished
why'all run out of gas
You better haul as*

That's how groupies

Chokin' your wife all in
Front of your peeps
She toss a brick through
The window of your Jeep
They back together
By the end of the week
That's so sweet

Slim and Kim argue too much
Invite a h*e to your house
While your b**** is out
Now you got the dick
All up in her f***in' mouth
Pull it out
And then you bust off
On her favorite blouse

Our mission every day is
Just to smoke bongs

D12,"Good morning
Haha, wake your mother fucking asses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my roof bitch!

For whatever it's worth it's worth me having my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
I just can't get past these little peasants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Hawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't crap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having a slapping
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
'Cause I'm telling you right now your not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit be	
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?

[Chorus]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an
Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
So have sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know 'em motherfucking join in
Everybody come on an


Its in the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popping slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a Holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit,
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathing
You die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefing free when
You niggas need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a boutique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

[Chorus]

Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
'What the fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seeing them white I empty out them white to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!""
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life

I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off-a the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shooting them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on moving key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you selling is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you coming

[Chorus]",6 in the Morning
D12,"Yeah, homie
I thought we, told we been fucking loco
Cypress Hill, D12, bitch!

I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain, 'cause I'm a psycho

We're fuckin' crazy
We'll fuckin' snap in a minute bitch

I'm a motherfucking omen, I bow down to no man
Split a nigga open, killing folks compulsive

I hold 'em then unload on you, put it on a poster
So everyone can notice who was focused on us
Poking they nose in our business, hoping that I don't come smoke 'em
No one knows my notions or emotions, I'm a vulture
You niggas close to croaking any moment and I know when
I could fuck the culture up, probably rap
A maniac with anxiety attacks, I don't wanna chat
Speak when you spoken to and I don't have to read a fucking
Magazine or quotable to notice what you hoes will do

We all soldiers, we move as a unit, we all roll up
And show up at your residence, light your front door up
Get scared, life ain't fair
And I'm prepared to blast you just as fast as Dre can say ""Hell yeah!""
So watch what you say cause it can happen either today or the next minute
I can draw the heater and spray and I'm dead serious
You could be dead period, end of story
I'm on your porch with a gun and your son, sipping a forty
Nobody can hold me, I does it all by my lonely
I stomp your head when you awake, you be looking like Gumby
Aftermath and Shady, bitch, you can read it and weep
You see my poster in the 'hood for ""the G of the Week""

I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho

You know what, I am crazy
As hell

Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain, 'cause I'm a psycho

Nigga I'm about to snap any minute nigga, evacuate

They found Saddam, but they ain't gon' find me
I'll be under a tree in Buttfuck, Tennessee
And I don't know too much about my daddy
Except he spit in my face and fucked me in my fanny
I ain't a racist, I just hate whites
Fags and dykes, blacks and transvestites
Thirteen years old and joined a fucking gang
Hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain
Am I insane? Who really knows?
Cause any second my temper can fucking blow
I get colder than December
Black the fuck out, tomorrow won't even remember
See Bizarre can show you what violence is all about
And this Dr. Dre beat done brought it the fuck out
Run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
And blow your brains the fuck out!

I probably got a screw loose or two
Or maybe three or four of 'em
Some fell out and hit the floor
All I know is ever since my fucking head hit the snowbank
I been a little neanderthalish, no thanks to my man D'Angelo Bailey
But I just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's
Trying to figure whether to use the flat head or the Phillips
Or just go to the Home Depot and pick the new power drill up
It's been two hours and six days and I'm still up
I feel like I'm about to snap any minute
There's a new Tower Records about to stop and get a fill-up
Pick the new Cypress Hill up
And go find who did that shit to Xzibit
And go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
And shatter his fucking lips with it

I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain, cause I'm a psycho

Catch an attitude and shit
We got one for them. Goes like this

[Eminem]
We wrote a song for the hoes
You like to hear? here it goes
A little something you probably won't hear on the radio
So when it comes on in the club it's one that everyone knows
And if I'm talking to fast it just means you're listening to slow
And if you listen a little faster maybe you'll catch up, Bitch!
D D D D Don Di J Do Ja
You just made me mess up, Bitch!
Bleeb Blab bli bli blah bli bli
It don't matter, I'm just blabbering
Like you understand what I'm saying anyway
I'm just traveling In one ear and I'm out the other
You're so fucking drunk all you hear is the beat the-da beat
I could be saying anything, just get ya ass on the floor
Wear the same pants that you wore from the day before
Baby and shake that ass like a whore

[Chorus:]
Yeah I'm talkin to you Bitch!! (get up and dance Bitch!)
Wiggle that ass Bitch!! (yeah that's it. yeah I called you a Bitch!)

Sit there and cry like a little Bitch!? Bitch!.

Get up and dance Bitch! (wiggle that ass Bitch!)

Not trailer trash switch!
Take the person you with and exchange partners

[Kuniva]
Tell me that it ain't no hanging, and fuck calling home
Until you look at me before you answer the phone
When I flee, your ass can get as naked and be as free
As you wanna be freak
But I'm taking the key with me.
You ain't gonna get shit, so don't even ask
Disrespect my wishes, I'll beat your ass
Watch me coming home floor eating half of your doggy bag
And I leave laughing, while you calling me on the rag
I'm the type that might cut off the lights when I hit
And before she cut them on, Kuniva already switched!
Your ass ain't even riding with Swift unless your going
When I'm done, I throw you out and ask you where you going

[Bizarre]
Hoe ain't the only thing you call a girl
Slut, Tramp, (oh, how you doing sir?)
Ever since I was 8, I been starting to hate
I said fuck the Ho's, started eating cheese cake
Scrambled eggs and steak, strawberry's and grapes
Damn that sounds great, hold on wait (Bizzy)
Ok, back to the Bitch!es, wash the dishes after that
Give me stitches. a fucking half Indian chick, suck my dick
This time tomorrow, I won't remember shit
Got respect for a player, got on snoop gators
And they ain't now and laters Bitch!.

(what did he say?)
Nothing, he said you seem stressed

And you wearing your nice dress(cause I was gonna say)

(excuse me?)
He said Michael Jackson just got another face lift
(dumb hoe)
(oh, nigga!)
No, gumbo, he wanna cook it for you tonight
(Bitch!, what up though just fuck for a buck, 
Do something strange for change, maybe holla for a dollar, just hop in the range)

Why you a Bitch! but don't choke

Quick out is the motto and just swallow breathe, swallow breathe, now swallow these e's
I know you moca lotti mommy's won't get down on your knees
You won't some money honey damn you must be outta your weave
Hit the telly fuck her belly you ain't gotta go weak
Plus you wanna be a mattie you need a lot of more sleep
I'm a pimp Bitch! don't be shy, show me them big tits
Your lipstick, I want it smeared all on my limp dick
For instance, busting nuts is only my interest
So princess, don't get your feelings hurt 'cause men just
Partying bullshit till she gargle and swallow my dick
I'm taking the train to Spain, don't bother calling Bitch!

Yeah, you heard me Bitch!.

You ain't listening to the words of this song anyways
All you do is listen to the beats with your dumb ass (Bitch!)

With your stupid manuper self
I was talking bout you Do-do
You, you dumb Bitch!
You!
The one that want a drink but don't want to pay for it

You heard me rippin' on there, they just edited my verse out.
Then I was on Obie's shit, I was in Obie's video,
And that Obie go ahead and I didn't get paid for that shit.

Either you gon' die or need a new kidney.
Till I drop, I'm a sell to your friends.
Till I get some of that tin, in the federal pin.

Cause you'll get dropped like an Aftermath artist.

They catch me mingling by a bitch with class,
When she turn I'll be sprinkling some shit in her glass.

When I cock back might put the door on you're friends
Make a run, gotta him, bust a slug on his chin
Ain't going no were like the drugs outta Kim
I'm a psycho icon, a mightful might bomb
Get a eye full of lid when I slight you're lights out
With a street cleaner, whipe you're life out
Bullets know at you're ears, like a Tyson fight bout

How the fuck we sneak in with this many heaters in our jeans
Nina, 2 nina's, a peace and they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one they gon' think its machine guns
Vanos vo vano, bananas in our flannels
Hands around our colt handles, hold them like roman candles
Vannas vo vannas, banana fanna fo fannas
Who come back all bananas, banna clips loaded
Managers, bouncers and the club owners, the motherfuckers don't want us
To come up and rush in the club and run up in it with a bunch of
Motherfuckers from Runyan, steady popping them onions,
Ready set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixing to get into some shit just itching to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mixing coke with coke and nut rum up
Yeah Yeah oh, what up, see my people throw shit up
See you talk that hoe shit now when you down you don't get up
And can't sit up your so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater no heater, automatic no matic
Mac or no mac it don't matter if I have or don't have it
You never know what I'm packin' so you just don't want no static
And open up a whole can of whoop ass you don't wanna chance to
Risk it no biscuit, mili mac a mac milli

Git Up Now!
Lets get it cracking, Git, Its on and popping

We bout to get this motherfucker crackalatin'
Quit, procrastinating

I keep a shit load of bullets a pitbull to pull it out
And automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth be closed permanently
You get burned until I quickly you can not hit me niggas to terrified to come get me,
Tempt me if you think Swifty won't send a slug, people run,
When the reaper comes, the repercussions' gon' leak your blood,
Inglewood, steepin' without a weapon, you leave, you gone,
I'm still runnin' with stolen toasters while on parole,
Snatch you out our home, like eviction notices hoe,
When I unload, I'm known to never leave witnesses to roam,
When I'm blowed, I'll write the wicked in scroll,
At the toll, when I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, nigga.


Now it's proven it's about to be a misunderstanding
In furniture moving, bullets flying, lawyers & mothers suing
Cause niggas don't know the difference, you bitches just stick to fiction
It's sickening, you can't even walk in my jurisdiction rippin' it,
Grippin' the pump and who wanna fuck with a walking psychopathic
Pyromaniac shady cats with 80 gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst a
And since you jumpin' in front of everybody you gon' get it first
I disperse the crowd with something vigor and versatile
So go on and record you verses now while you got a mouth,
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle,
Kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my equittle,
And a glock that ? stop you from waking,
Bullets'll hit your liver, I'll even shoot native Americans,
A ? nigga, we back in you life and back in your wife,
Hit you in the back with a knife and get it crackin' tonight.

Man you look so peaceful now, how can I argue wit that

Its true that everybody heard, there mama say every days like this
When you see, one of your friends die in the mist
In the struggle, went through circumstances
Arrested every day just to prove a point to a friend
Even then, accidents are prone to happen to any man
A woman is dumb enough to pretend
That her, God won't hold them accountable for sins
If they commit, they try to repent to ??
But I guess (that's just the way things go)
I was blessed to see 24 (24)
To wake up to that how my name is video
Motivated me to write what I wrote
And I knew my little brother sold dope
An mom and daddy want to move our road
I did it, I still got a lot to prove and show
I just which we ain't have to lose Bugz to the struggle
'cause you know

I know you used to Bizzare on some silly shit
But Niggas in my cliq, is dying quick
In Detroit, niggas don't party
They pull a .44 out, snatch off bacardis
That's why I keep the pistol under the trunk
I'm 27 years old, too old to be getting jumped
And fuck rap, I miss Karnail Pitts, be	-you-g-z
Tattooed on my wrist
Me and you in the jeep, listen to ?? beats
Its a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak
I got married, my wife name is D
Peace to 31 and 51-50, miss you

[Kuniva]
I came back on that tragic, my phone rung
And Bizarres voice telling me, Bugz was gone home
It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldn't breath
I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it
I swear with this weight dog, I cried so hard
Literally, Denaun had to carry me to the car
While I stand in this booth now its tearin' me apart
But I had to let it out 'cause it was tearin' at my heart
'Cause he died over something so petty and so small
A human life is so very precious I hope y'all
Understand how I'm feeling 'cause I love you bugs
I wanna rhyme wit you, laugh wit you, hug you bugs
But I can't and you was so close to seeing dreams
A coward came along and took you away from the team
So don't mistake this track, its just another song
This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one
'Cause you know

[Chorus]

[Proof]
They say its never too late, to have an early childhood
If I could, turn back the hands of time, God should
Forgive what I did as a kid to run blocks
Now my dreams are just dream cops and gun shots
The fun stops when your homies up in a box
My dudey bole, rest his soul, snuffed by the cops
I use to smoke shit a lot, if there's a guy by me say something
If you love her so much why didn't you gave nothing
When he took my homie, snuck was only in 11th grade
Now I hope to see your face at the heaven gates
It ain't never late in the game, this hating remains
With a grudge to see slugs straight through my frame
My heart aches with the pain, the life in his breath
We gotta have fun now, there's only minutes left
In the depth, distress youngn's is sucked in
To get task my fallen homies I got enough

[Chorus]

[Swifty]
When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasn't wise
That crash and the driver died,
My partner on the passenger side was paralyzed
And I'm surprised by the look of that ride that the other peeps survived
Nine months later another one died
Somebody shot him in the side when he was starting up his ride
3 years go by, I made a hell of a run
And that's when funky got done, a joey playing wit guns
And ?, karty was my man
And reggy, I wish that I was wit you in that van
And Bugs if it wasn't for you
You know I wouldn't be standing in this booth,
That's the truth, I miss y'all

Call me

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We family
Ain't a damn thing changed
Unless its you

We were so young
So full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5'ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
You're cold, your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We family
Ain't a damn thing changed
Unless its you

It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I would of killed a nigga first
'Fore  I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her
Stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas must of hurt your pride or something
'Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your mans, lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player
The one that's changing is you

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We family
Ain't a damn thing changed
Unless its you

It's gettin' lonely at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speakin' all rude
Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping
And poof it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance
Since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intelligence
That's forever 'til the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(How come) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(And how come) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true

Yeah! this is DJ Seven Deuce, live at
Club runyan, where all girls with burgundy hair get in free.
G-unit in da house! what up baby.
Performin' live tonight live on stage, captain save-'em-hoe,
And the fabulous case y'all. stick 'em out y'all.
All my detroit playas, let's go!

[Chorus: Kon Artis]
I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games,
I just came to fuck and maybe get some brain.
I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man.
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned.
You know all I really want to do is fuck. I ain't
Gon' let a money hungry women set me up.
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck.
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned.

[Kon Artis]
You gave right. yes I love monage-ois
And I got drawers as big as guys's big ""wah"".
I'm a trick daddy nigga, so bitch how you figure
That I wouldn't turn my niggas on to you when I hit ya.
I probably could forget ya if I hadn't been drunk,
But choke a dunkadunk, keep my mind on hump.
When my mind's on hump to me my .9's in the trunk,
And Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt.
Not once, twice, but three times the lover 
That your man is, and I'm a freak undercover.
I got plans for you, trick, I don't need a baby mother.
I got five of them motherfuckers tryin' to smother me already.
We can't go steady, but you can give me head.
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shit.
My chap lips will cut nipples when breast fed,
And on the way, leave the bread with achman.
I'd love for you to stay but I got another date,
With a fat chick that eat cake on play skates.
She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grace
Plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape.

[Chorus]

[Swift]
I'ma make this one thing clear,
Ain't no woman hear gon' ruin my career.
All the hell you doin' is pursuin' a dream,
That's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems.
All these hoes be lyin', bullshittin' each other.
And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber.
He might as well have went and told the hoe that he love her.
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother,
Or my wife, and my sisters. so motherfuck a mistress.
They signin' a contract before these bitches hit this.
Never will a woman take me out that way.
I keep a car camera in there motherfuckin' face.

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
What's your name again? it doesn't matter.
My name is bizzy, a bodyguard for Mr. Mathers.
Sit down girl. let me get you a drink.
I'ma buy you a mink, and rape you in the sink.
From day one, I knew you was a hoe.
I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'.
Turn around, let me see your nasty ass.
Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pads.

[Kuniva]
These hoes be on some bullshit. always tryin' to pull shit 
Outta they ass. get mad and put you on blast.
Tell 'em bitches how she fucked you,
Sucked you, put it on you, boned you.
Yappin' off with they mouth sayin' she loved you.
All on your dick, callin' your phone, spazzin' and shit.
Havin' a fit until you feel like callin' it quits.
Then she starts callin' your chick,
Wantin' to fight. everytime you show up at a gig,
She front row with her friends. flippin' you off.
Follow you to the bar, the bathroom,
The parkin' lot, to the car, pissin' you off.
Until you blackout, now you and the hoe is having a scrap out.
You get locked up for assault and now you asked out.

Talking nasty shit, Bizarre won't stop.
I fuck two twins, with a midget on top.
A sick mind, raping an old lady.
Knowing damn well Bizarre shouldn't have a baby,
All I can teach you, learn how to mac.
Smoke crack, smack a bitch when she talk back.
Matter fact slap her until she's a slut.
Don't you realize Bizarre don't give a fuck?

Don't go to school, become a catholic priest.
Sell crack to your auntie Denise.
If auntie Denise is short 40 cent
Make her get on the ground and suck some more dick.
Nas is probably gon hate me.
When Mos Def hear this he probably gon suffocate me.
Why they let Bizarre rap on Hi-Tek track?
All he gon do is talk about whores and smoking crack.
If your wife is pregnant I call her a whore.
Leave her no money and go out on tour.
Nah, I'm playing leave her something.
I pack a hot dog and a fucking dirty muffin. (Damn)
You're my son, I'm trynna teach you something.
You're eight years old? It's time to start fucking.
You know daddy won't give you the wrong advice.
Smoke weed and listen to Obie Trice.

It ain't no explainin'
I'll change your language wit a stainless
I'm contained wit a anguish to leave your famous
I'm a deranged pit y'all lift an AK to pinch ya face wit

If its a bystander standin' by I'm firin' at ya, cause I can
You get squashed like pop cans

I'm about to sell your mama bud, and lace it

It's my attitude that's making me bust shit
I hate to be fucked with
So basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Returning bows 'fore you be looking at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation I run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her mouth to gun resuscitation
A niggas information, they hunted and they sad
Got you mad 'cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag
We coming too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancing
Coming here is the worse mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle I'm pulling you in
I guarantee the world will never see you again

[Kon]
Honest to god I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain something to ya
A real street nigga ain't trying to get in the streets
He's trying to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb hoe punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
This nigga dying over prizes to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I don't play deep
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's wrong that you hoes thinking you can't really get sleep
'cause you laid a nigga down without any meat
Well my cops won't allow me to make decisions in vein
I'm a man I do my bidding and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever

[Chorus]

[Kon]
Now people I live trifling I express it through writing
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting
And I just bought me a new gauge and added on a knew knife
And I strike people so fast people think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few height men
Been harassed by two dikes who wanted (lou pikner)
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling
'cause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kunive son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, skinny or wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none
You niggas get dropped once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stuck till your eyes shut
No time for the wild ones, I'm writing these five words
Fuck you dick riding niggas count it, it's five words.

You don't me, McVay and I doubt if you understand me
Why would I give a fuck about you if we ain't family?
I roll with a chosen few, and those of you that's behind me
Witness the most potest' ferocious niggas that rhyme
These bitches turn they back on you, actin' like they ain't did shit
When you rappin' never mix business up with your friendship
If you lackin' up in this jungle, then what you breathe for?
Niggas don't love you, you got habits of breaking street codes
Far as static, I automaticly get medieval
When I'm after people, then I'll explode you bitches with see-4
These hoe's, have no insurance, bodies get repo'
Making you vanish even when we ain't got our heat close
Keepin' .44's where you're hoes are swallowing deep throat
If you owe me dough then you know you falling asleep, close
Niggas pupils that's what I do, I'm foolish will shoot you
'Cause I'm coo-coo, But I don't think niggas can take in heat tho'

See I'm a man, and a man gon' do what he gotta do
And he ain't really family if he ain't loyal to you
If they was really soldiers then they would do what we do
And be loyal to crew and crew was loyal to you


I don't give a fuck, I'm quick to blaze chronic
Smoke on so much green, use twelves and supersonic 
Bizarre pack guns and knives, put to dick to nuns and wife's
Now who the fuck want to fight?
Ain't nobody fucking with me, Ain't nobody fucking with the D'
They get beat like a M-P
You heard about Bizarre taking all them drugs
You heard about Proof wilding in the clubs
You heard about that nine that Eminem packs
You diss us, you get you're fucking face cracked
I'm from 7 Mile and stout, I'll shoot up you're house
Next day, I'll pee in you're mouth.

Aiyyo, loyalty's first, all the bullshit second
I showed you on the record, Cheers to who respect it
Most of these niggas neglect it
Even though it's a known method
From the hectic hood that you slept in
You want to' be an exeption
That's when the weapon is leaving you're half stepping
With that 'caine in you're left hand
Obie from a section that'll stain up you're flesh and
Have you on bare breast
Questionin' you're affection for streets

One of the best groups that done it
And Obie is their reflection
Lil' homey that know sowly that loyalty is reckin'
D-Twizzie fo' life, Obie Trice is second

Which one of you niggas want to be abolition bump heads
When I got a passion for clappin', with one hand
Talent's on my roster this mobster's in dump land
Send a gangsta to sleep two by two like bunk beds
Never leave the crib without packing my black burner
On some T. Ali rapper to merk a have murder

Reach for me one more gain' and that's closed

we thug it out. Pourin' 40's out and give each other ?. In fact,
we both hate goin' out, we both hate small gats.
You the truth I'm for real yo I love you to death.

So I got to be in that seat at Four o'clock
Shoot I need me some crispy-ones to go with my new outfit
So tell ya people.

Understand me now, I'm cool as a breeze (Wassup playa, wassup)
On the black hand side, gimme some grease (Alright)
I want a liner but naw I don't want you to fate me (Nope)
A ghetto girl with a attitude to contegrate me
So what's happenin', the hood's seein' in
I get the scoop on everyone in the ghetto so let's begin
Who got shot? (Mike)
Who got jumped? (Eric)
Who got ganked? (Shay)
Who got robbed? (Dee)
Who went to jail? (Chuck)
Who got saved? (Rick)
Who's gettin' money and who's broke as a joke
And hear about your lady called me that started smokin' that dope (For
Real?)
You get it all at this little dusty place
Let me be still, she gettin' out the razor from my face
You see.

You heard of me, the fat guy that raps
Now its time for Bizarre to take off his shower cap
Its been five days, I patiently waited
Saturday morning, its time to get faded
And I mean get faded, ""I mean get faded""
Damn at four o'clock, I didn't almost make it
My barber's name is Sarah, she don't really know how to cut
But she gots nice teeth and big ol' butt
So two days a week, I get faded for no reason
Same ol' haircut, keep it low and breathin'
If you see me in a barbershop, go on and run
Cuz I'm probably gettin' a perm and my toe-nails done

Got here full grip, but can't call the cops
I gotta get the script from the lips to the barbershop
Jump in the seat ""Yo gimme the line and""
And tell me who came through shinnin'
(Homeboy scooped up, in a new truck)
(Gave everybody a cup and gave me a few bucks)
(Then he started braggin' bout his last lick)
Cut me a design along with his address

You can have a million dollar suit on, shinnin' with ya karats up
But it don't mean nothin' if ya floggin' in ya haircut
Now who next? (Um I just want my son to get a tech)
What about you sweetie? (So what you tryin' say?)
I'm just playin' with you baby (Hey He do this all the time)
And all you do is whine, and drink wine 
Yo' you know that Cho-chie got knocked out (Man) (When?)
Early at Le'mott's house (Again?)
(I wouldn't let that man sit on my couch)
(You was wit him yesterday)
(Man what are you talkin' bout?)
I'm just about ready to throw y'all out
(No you ain't, I'll be here for bout a hour)
No I'll raise up the rates

So go tell ya people, that I'm the man
I can't be faded, there's been a change of plans
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (C'mon, where?)

D12,"So I changed huh?
You got a phone
Pick it up
Call me

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We family
Ain't a damn thing changed
Unless its you

We were so young
So full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5'ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
You're cold, your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We family
Ain't a damn thing changed
Unless its you

It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I would of killed a nigga first
'Fore  I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her
Stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas must of hurt your pride or something
'Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your mans, lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player
The one that's changing is you

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We family
Ain't a damn thing changed
Unless its you

It's gettin' lonely at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speakin' all rude
Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping
And poof it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance
Since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intelligence
That's forever 'til the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(How come) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(And how come) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now

D12,"I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my God it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem""
""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock""
""Please Marshall please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
Roxanne

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back

Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code

Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa

D:A:D,"He laid face down 
In the desert sand 
Clutching a sixgun 
In his hand 
And me & Maria went to watch him die. 
Suddenly the raised and said: 
Help me now, or I shoot you dead!. 
- I got an arrow in my back 
And it aches as hell!! 

So we jumped on down in the yellow sand 
Started helping this gunfighting man 
He was six feet tall`n`four feet wide 
And the wagon tipped from side to side 
Driving into the red, red sun 
Poor mule he could hardly run 
I turned my head to Maria 
And she turned her head to mine: 
And we knew... 
What he was going to do 
He was going to shoo-oo-oy 
His whole way through 
And his name was on the pistol 
- And he was son of a gun!! 

As we went driving into town 
We saw these posters all around 
There was a big reward upon his head 
'Cause the Marshall wanted to see 
him dead... 
As we talked about this gunfighting man 
We saw the steel in his hand: 
Now folks I want to see you run! 
To the rhythm of my gun!! 
And we knew... 

Well I was saved & I was glad 
Thanks to my old stetson hat® 
It went through the top 
Only leaving a spot 
It was fabricated by an Indian bud 
Who did not now that he was hot 
Hanging on the posters everywhere... 

So I took one step back 
And tipped my hat 
And looked him in his eyes 
Aom shit he was telling me the 
Dirtiest lies 
I had no time to get away 
I was trapped in the USA 
C`mon Maria, let`s get out of his war... 

And we knew...

D:A:D,"On the first part of the journey 
I was looking at all the life 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There were sand and hills and rain 
The first thing I met was a fly with no buzz 
And a sky with no clouds 
The heat was hot and the ground was dry 
But the air was full of sound 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can't remember your name 
Cause there ain't no one to a give you no pain 

After two days in the desert sun 
My skin began to turn red 
After three days in the desert fun 
I was looking at a river bed 
And the story it told 
Of a river that floated 
Made me sad to think it was dead 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
After nine days I let the horse run free 
Cause the desert had turned to sea 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There were sand and hills and things 
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground 
And the perfectest sky is above 
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground 
But the humans will give no love 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name",A Horse with No Name

It was moonlight; call of the wild
They forced him to bury his father

And the glance of his eyes got malicious
He thought about revenging his father
He sweared he would turn out as another

He traveled on trail wide and narrow
He would draw and shoot at any shadow
Checking the decks with his back to the wall
Hiding the tracks of his lonely call
The blood on his hands was still dripping
Hunting by instinct and no sleeping
He remembered the face of the gunman
Who slaughtered his dad the same evening

Heavy grinda for paper

Froze wish they ear lobes heavy weight in my chain
Hittin the game where you niggaz be slackin'
Got the dro for the lo that what my niggaz be sackin'
My shell toes peddle chevys and boles
White leathers on the cutlass with mahogany flos
I'm riding through oakhurst coated like starburst
Candy paint glisten lookin greasy like bratwurst
The dude on my jersey is greatly deceased
You rested in peace for snitchin to Decatur police
Servin niggaz with a ghetto subpoena
Got that A-Town stompin' back in Phillips Arena
I'm passin hoes like collection plates
And keep a broad on my squad who on section 8 (Oh!)

They gon love me after this one
To all my trap niggaz and dro smokers
Keep the strippers stay focus
Pussy poppin and rollin

Shoppin at malls
White tees, Cartiers
Jeans creased up straight out the cleaners
Plus my George Jefferson strut and my southern demeanor
When they see me when I speak my slang
Everybody wanna know my name (Sho 'nuff)
I was born in Atlanta, raised in Decatur
Where we pushin' LeSabres and blow like inhalers
Say he kinda skinny wit a full size jimmy
Ay man I got broads in different cities
Like gimme gimme
They used to treat me like Urkel the nerd
Now they flock when the see my LeBrons on the curb
See my upholstery it got women approachin me
Some look like they too old for me
TVs hangin' appropriately

And I tell you that the price of the worth just dropped

You tried to see my dough

I'm from the dirty, but I stay so fresh, so clean
With all these throwbacks, you think I got a time machine
Kodak moment, everytime I hit scenes
'cause I'm a young (???), I flip keys
Alicia ain't, got, nothin' on me, I'm so shady
Tha benz is amazing, tha color is all gravy
Please believe, my squad be them DBE's
We ridin' in them drop tops, wit them DVD's
Spreewells on them alloys, daddy I'm so jiggy
I flow so sickly, I roll with P. Diddy
Fa-Shiggety!!!, tha thug shit just run in my kidney
Always on point ain't no nigga gone put no steel to me
Feelin' me, every move I make
It replay, EA Sports style, especially on tha freeway
whodi so wild, I keep thangs that bark loud
move the whole crowd, I suggest niggaz to roll out
Listen!

[Hook 2x]
I'm a bad boy, get out my way, 'rilla
bust shots on the block, when I spray, 'rilla

ya dog ass gone get done for it
ya betta run for it

[2nd Verse]
Tha bad boy's untamed guerrilla
I keeps it rilla' man ya gots to feel me
Worldwide connected from Ghanistan to Philly
What the dilly, I'm in tha milli' dropped 2-seater
With creepers strapped with nina's, fuckin' with senoritas
Jesus, I'm just off the meters
Believe, I still do got more stripes, and shelves than Adidas
Slang base-n-ball like Alex Rodriguez
Put ya foggles on, ya'll niggaz can't see me, like
I up, my level a notch to better
I can make a hit, a-capella
Ya can't, knock tha fella
I'm here now, I ain't going nowhere
Believe that, love it or not, the boy is here
The boy don't fear, shit, I been bad since birth, dog
Taught to blast, mash, get the cash, and murk off
Skkiirrt!!! fake niggaz catch down syndrax
call 9-1-index, these niggaz is jive
ya hoe, I'm all in that, she lovin' the guy
fa' sho', look at her now, the stomach taped with pies
Ya heard me!

[Hook 2x]
I'm a bad boy, get out my way, 'rilla
bust shots on the block, when I spray, 'rilla
ya get, chopped up, with the chopper
ya dog ass gone get done for it

[3rd Verse]
I'm that nigga, I got clout, like Big Guy, and (???)
I'm that fly, with big guns, that splat guys
I shit pies, van diesel, triple X, I
And pull deadly stunts, just like I'm Left Eye
Ain't, no, half steppin' to test mines
If ya, want it then come and get, I'll make a name for ya
You gone get, what the fuck you came for, the chainsaw
(chainsaw rumble)sawed off ya ankles
play like it's slavery, and hang ya, daddy
I catch ya playin' me, its danger
Taught to rap, make it crack, snackle and pop
all out of type, that's the way I act on the block
Bout green, dope fiend supplier
Keep a beam of iron
In the jungle full of thieves and lions
I am, focused man, the bad boy soldier
landed on the top, I thought I told ya man
Listen!

[Hook 4x]
I'm a bad boy, get out my way, 'rilla
bust shots on the block, when I spray, 'rilla

Do you know

So where you from?

Where chicks rock air force ones
Betty's shirts tied up and our hair stayed done
So where you from?

Well they don't rock air force ones
We hit the block, out the spots, holdin air force guns
So where you from?

Philly spitters, rock niggs and boots
A duece duece in my tube socks itching to shoot
Man where you from?

Where guerrillas don't be messin with cops
Catchin a case, go on the run and still huggin the block

So what you doin?

Big ballin', money making and flawcin'
Sean John and you know how we do it in New Orleans
So what you doin?

What I'm doin', man i'm doin' it big
I'm cockin' it back, the mack, crack-cracking your rib

But so it go and so it go
When the sun come out to shine, I be so ready for dying-o
Forgive me for my sins, but I still holdin' my nine-o
VIP lookin for another man to rob now
Just another way to escape Rikkar's Island

I'm gonna prove to these dudes
I can get me a crew
Without snatching you outta yours
With that still on you

I'm gonna prove I'm a superstar
Rims sitting on Shaquille O'Neal's
You know who we are

I'm gonna prove it, that Babs is the best in the game
So thugs hold on tight, like I'm snatchin' your chain

And I'm prove it, to the chicks that cold shouldered me
And all the record labels that chose to look over me
Ha, I ain't goin' back to jail
To a pack of oodles and noodles and a whack in my cell
Dudes be cutting the yard, we rushin' the guard
We takin' over, it's a riot, gun buttin' the sarge
All of my homies with wheels waiting foward to peel
Oh it's all the way real, we peel, penitentiary still

Do you like the things that life is showing you
What you gonna do?

Bad Boy, Refugee camp
Calabo, let's go

Babs from Brooklyn and I do my thing

Real nigga that I am, so if you need me you can call on Slim

Just to be alone and get next to you
I like your style, beautiful smile, you're kind of wild

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

[Ness]
She pretty in pink, damn what they put in my drink?
It's either I'm color blind or too pissy to think
Straight, take it slow, wait for a minute, uh
Chill, fall back, we can date for a minute, uh
I'm renting out with an option to buy
She blow weed so her nosebleed top of the sky
Female with an attitude as cocky as mine
When I ride, she right there in the passenger side

[Fred]
Well this week I made plans that were set in advance
Lobster and shrimp in  Sevilla, then we jettin' to France
Under the stars, sippin' Cristy, laid back in the sand
Tellin' me ways how you act when you were back with your fam
How your mother was smoking crack and your father was dead
See that's the type of stuff that get in my head
And you're very emotional, you make a real thug want to get close to you
With the permission you give, your lotion, let's get ghost girl

[Sara]
Baby how ya doing?
Off the scene for a minute, but right back into it
Tell me can you feel it?

Yo, Blaze the fire and watch the enemies crumble
(Jamaican chant)
See the blood of a slave
The eyes of a Banta
Rise from the grave
When they listening to Dylan
Action and ways speak clearly like a veteran
Looking both ways
When concealing my weapon

(Babs)
I was raised in the gutter
Fifties for elevens
And a dirty box cutter
I'm standing my ground
Back and forth out of town
I'm getting that cash
And niggaz can't see Babs
If you ain't licking my ass
One tough chick
My flows is not to be fucked with
Send the word out
To them bitches that you run with
I'm here now
Bitches in trouble I spit fire
Quick to bust off
Like Weebay from the wire

(Ness)
Fucking with the grimiest nigga
Look in my eyes
My life was paralelled park
Until I put it in drive
D.U.I. smacked and broke both of my headlights
Chicks gunning me down
Running mad redlights
Had low mileage
It was either hugging the block or Hip Hop
I never will in college
I'm only being honest
Cadillac with the Mac
With the serial stratched up in the lining

(Fred)
Now pass me some diamonds
With some dudes who move
When I say them good
So the hood call me Simon
When I rob I ain't rhyming
I change climates
And break more records
Than Rice did for the Niners

Chorus: (Dylan)
Them silly one now (hey)
All gangstas get them bless (hey!!!!)
To be wake
To be among so many Living Legends
Nobody stop me
Don't ask me why
This a real tall guy saying Budda Bye Bye Bye

Them silly one now (hey)
All gangstas get them bless (hey!!!!)
To be wake
To be among so many Living Legends
Nobody stop me
Don't ask me why
I'm a real bad boy saying Budda Bye Bye Bye

(Chopper)
Man fuck them other niggaz
Cause I'm down with my niggaz
Yep, we Da Band
y'all niggaz ain't fucking with us
Don't make me have to spend that bend and do a pull up
Reach for that 10 that have you duckin' them bullets
Hit you where it hurt it be hard for you to push up
Half-way crook ass niggaz I got you shook up
You walk with your head faced down
You scared to look up
And I know Black and Blue
I got the hook up

(Babs)
I stay on my grind BK niggaz know
In your face everyday like a Bad Boy video
On the block for a couple of years
I done smoked a lot of blunts
Drunk a couple of beers
The streets know me
The hood hold me
I paid dues
I'm the chick in the click
Full of niggaz, I made moves
Stay on top of my game
I can't lose
Get down or lay down
Bitch niggaz better choose

(Chopper)
I ride in the biggest trucks
All day, call me, shit
I supply the biggest stuff
Hit the block
Like I'm Cartel blunts
Ready for something to dump
I feel as though I got the biggest nuts

(Ness)
Wait, move
I put blood in your socks, your shoes
Overflowing now you shaking your leg
Man I run with the gauge like bacon with eggs
It's white, when I bite
When I bake it, it's beige

Welcome, welcome

Life is what you make it

[VERSE 1] {Ness}
Hit the bricks chicks like, 'Damn where you been Lloyd''
Locked up with a bad case of hemorrhoids
Writin' and fightin' triflin' rhymes about the
Life and the times of niggaz on the grind
White collar criminals climb the corporate ladder
While niggaz like me gotta sell coke and crack
It's riskin' my freedom, boxed up missin' the season
It's a setup'hypothetically speakin'
Even my pop was knocked over tickets for speedin'
Drinkin' and drivin' and I ain't forget, he think I forgot 'em
Mom got gray hairs from worryin' sick
And my sister got a house now, pushin' a stick
Just a little somethin' to get 'em from A to be	
I got nowhere to go come and stay wit me
Wit a niece and a nephew that love me to death
My little brother Nick, I guess he lovin' what's left

Welcome to my world (Welcome, welcome)

[VERSE 2] {Freddrick}
I remember one mornin' I was cookin' the O
And out the blue I heard a knock at the do'
I looked through the peephole and it's a fiend and he needed some coke
And at the time I really needed his dough, but I know the rules
You never sell crack where ya rest at
'cause haters send shells where ya chest at
But in my case them muthafuckas sent shells where my vest at
Found out I ain't dead, give them a place to rest at
I found out 'bout they spot, had to go and X that
My eyes redder than Cyclops, call me the X-Man
I thank God just for every blessin'
Though the roads got tough thanks for every lesson
I carry loads at times even though it gets stressin'
I remember stickin' the clip in, cockin' and second guessin'
I couldn't stand the rain I'm the 'New Edition'
The fast lane had me layin' in the coop wit pigeons in my life

[CHORUS] (Sara)
(In my life)
Life is what you make it
Though it may sound basic (In my life)
Goin' through some bad times
But be thankful for the good times, yeah (In my life)
Though we must build up
The strength to carry on
Welcome to my world (Welcome, welcome)

[VERSE 3] {Babs} (Sara)
Hotheads and high school dropouts
Little girls wit they stomachs popped out, I seen it all
Niggaz stretched out by the corner store
Life no more, dough seem small--I'm gettin' focused
In the crib writin' rhymes while I'm smokin'
While niggaz on the block totin' I see 'em later
My moms make paper but cheap wit her cash
Ask for a pair of kicks she tell me ask my dad (Ask ya dad)
So I'd rather hit the Ave and knock off work
The 100 pack in the pocket of my Guess Jeans skirt
Meanwhile still tryna get a deal on the side
Battle bitches outside in front of Kennedy Drive
A lotta niggaz want to see me shine
But I still got the lames laggin' behind, hatin' on mine'it's nothin'
I'ma get to the top regardless
Got love for female rappers but think I'm the hardest
In my life

[CHORUS 2x] (Sara)
(In my life)
Life is what you make it
Though it may sound basic (In my life)
Goin' through some bad times
But be thankful for the good times, yeah (In my life)

You know the story bout the boy with a name
He did things like kill people and stole Kane
The hood got three lanes, Life, Death, or entertain
Now sellin's the life. In that box is the D-word
In that house by the lake wit the yacht is the Keyword
Fuck it, if he work and she work Da Band
We work on P.D.'s nerves
Man we probly gon clash when he hear these words
But fuck it, I love that nigga, he the reason we hurr
If it wasn't for him, I'd be livin to see dirt

Oh, Lord! You don't want no problems wit dude

[Bridge: Sara]
Something happens when you touch me (Yeah)
I get open, and my leg starts quivering
This sensation, emotions take control of me (That's right)
Is it temptation, I don't know what's come over me (Woo)

[Babs]
Yeah baby (Tonight!) tonight's the night
I'ma ride that thang like a motor bike
Grab my waist and hold it tight, I'm not frontin'
You think I bought a box of Lifestyles for nothin'?
Please, I got blunts, you supply the weed
I'm the best, so baby keep yo' eyes on me
It's about time, I get mine, nigga I'm ready
And sex ain't the bomb if the girl ain't sweaty (Yeaahh)

[Chopper]
Listen ma, we've been chillin' out for a minute
And right now I'm in the mood to straight hit it
We know enough about each other, I've been patient-look
But every nigga got his limits, I'm tired of waitin'
I feel like tonight is the night
To get bucky-ball-naked and make love all night
You ain't gotta worry about me bustin' in quick seconds
I can handle mine, plus I'm young and energetic, is you ready? (Ooh)

Sara: Tonight!

So hurry up ma show me your sign (Tonight!)
I've been peepin' you all night, and you're alright
The reason I'm starin', I'm comparin' some things we may have in common
And tear your garments, on our plane to Bahamas
I love how you abuse the charm
You got a bad boy, it's time to leave dem fools alone (Yeah!)
Any place that you stay, I can move your home
I'm talkin', shoppin' sprees from weeks in Rome
Leave the airport, four in the mornin' we gone
Off to Paris to meet Sean
I can't disappoint Mister Combs
But first I need the number to your phone

I get open, and my leg starts quivering

You ain't gotta act Bourgeois or be all up tight
Tonight's the night, E-Ness'll put up a fight
I'm the best that you ever had in ya life
If it turn out right fuck around gettin' married tonight
Rock that hand off the one night stand
Hop in the van, go in a honeymoon in Amsterdam
Tomorrow mornin' we gon' drive back home
And smoke lines so we can watch the Twilight Zone

Rode deep to the club my truck is packed
If there ain't enough room lap it up in the back
Circle the block, pull up in the parking lot
We all smell like weed cause we spark a lot
Table reserved, chicks stand up when they see me
Flag down the waitor get an Apple Martini
All night stuntin doin it up
A bunch of bed style bitches with big ass butts

[Fred]
Could it be the snake skin with gators or the throwback Raiders
Every moment is a Kodak for the world
But tonight I'm no mack
When I match your girl the human spatula is attached to her
I snatched her up, pulled her real close to the fur
gave her a, bottle of crisp fuck a plastic cup
Let me know if we gonna bump with your sassy self cause

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why?  Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin

Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game

Bounce off from the scene in a Lincoln Nav
So motherfuckin' plush you just sink in the back

See me in the streets stunning in a yellow Valor

[Wild Son]
Columbus thought the earth was flat
I copped the map, to navigate on track
Repercussions don't buy Black, false allegations
I rush through nations like some Haitians
Since my incubation I been destined for this paper
Timbs scraper, fly shape up, got my weight up
Laugh at haters, smack 'em now, kill 'em later
Small Soldiers, action figures in motion pictures
You read off scripts, and for the feds gave tips
Icebergs sank ships, Shades load up clips
Cock back the four-fifths then continue to spit {*two gunshots*}
Blow ya neck off, ya specs lost, respect black to the boss
Get those hands chopped off, for thinking I'm soft
I'm quite well of course, many feet with this rhyme technique
Beat off the heat with an ear to the streets nigga
Word life motherfucker
Wilson Ave, hand cock, Wild Son motherfuckers

[Wilson Ave]
Now you know what type of shit I'm on
I feed on the broke, the poor, and the weak-n-sore
I defeated all these tribes and the gangs
I'm that number one killer, Drama!

[Wild Son]
why yall niggas can't fuck with this
Black mongol slave, Pastor Gray,
low see's and no feds, it's time to get paid
Hold the hand grenade with the pin in my mouth, issued army
So when you come to get me kill off everybody
Escaped from a trapped room, my hood is Beirut
The buds recruit, while all the guards, crackers was true
Good health and wealth, for cheddar cheese as green as dough melt
Some cried some died from the pain that's felt
Why fight? Why fuss? That's what the want from us
But if it's love that's lost, then there's no more trust
With that fake love, that cause to get your brain straight plugged
Gun held snubbed, seen your fams and gave 'em a hug
Did I see you? Nah, I wouldn't want to be 'em
Sort as wounds treat 'em, deep in foundation
Best believe that's how I leave 'em
 
[Wilson Ave]
Ain't no cure for this, what I suffer from is mentally
I got drama with one, drama with these hoes
Shit I even got drama with this finger
And I'ma damn sure die with it, forever having drama
Since birth I've seen it everywhere
New York, Houston, St. Louis, even Kansas City
What cha'll know about that

[Wild Son]
Competition, there is none, fuck with Black and get done
Pack guns, gat-lers, rocking all the latest fashions
You gotta love me, for being young, black, and hungry
Considered ugly, but since this money wanted to plug me
I keep it humble, speak to myself so call me Mumbles
Move some Buddu's, until the these rush through
Or maybe touch you, cats wanted two from the crew
This shit is tense, you out the fence, you even lost one shoe
Ran a marathon even though the cops ass won
Shit was on, rapper we get it be gone
Meet you at the stash crib, twelve blocks from where you live
Don't say shit, even turn your wife and your kids
Daddy's on the run now, all alone with low reprise
No cries now, the way a real nigga gets down
Facing death, stealing somebody's life's called theft
Black know's best, this even go's for the opposite sex
No regrets, I did what I did, ah from the whip
Kids think sick, pack big shit, extended clips
Motherfuckers, yea yea
Get it all, bring it on what

[Wilson Ave]
There's three types of drama
One that gives drama, one that receives drama
And one that watches drama
Sometimes the outcome you wouldn't believe
Don't sit there and front like you never felt it
Maybe just that the wrong nigga sent it
So when you find yourself afraid, frightened
Fearing for your life, pray I'm not after you
Drama!

I got real street niggas that ride on my side, what
They know the code, either do it or die
You got rich street niggas that ride on your side
They know the code, it's either do it or die

So what the world gon' tell us
Me and mine too strong and rebellious, the petties stay jealous
Find me in the dusty cellars, writing
To feed the 5,000 fellas, hustlers and street dwellers

Heather be devoted, quote it
I feed the desperate and demoted
Want passion? I'm loaded the truth, I uphold it
Wisdom, I tote it
Bet that outdoes me, Heather be self promoted

I know thieves, thugs and crooks
We be ridin' and I don't care how it look
You better take it easy 'fore you get that took
Yo my mans and them be off the hook, PA

My peoples be's behind me so I fears nobody
Foxxx push the Navie, while I'm ridin' shotty
The last nigga that tried me, what, he came apart
He dropped mine and they took his heart so don't start

You got real street niggas that ride on your side, what
They know the code, either do it or die
I got real street niggas that ride on my side
They know the code, it's either do it or die

Who got real street niggas that ride on they side, huh
They know the code, it's either do it or die
You got real street niggas that ride on your side, huh
They know the code, either do it or die

My walk through life is iller than most niggas that carry toast
I'm ya emcee, lyrical host
Stretch a nigga if he stand too close
My niggas know who the boss is
The 240 pound bald-headed killer that don't know what a loss is

We like black Yukons and Navigators
Real street agrivators and we'll kill you in a suit and gators
Don't get it fucked up, niggas'll run you like plays
And cut you like 'Back in the days'

I got real street niggas that ride, right or wrong
They always on my side, so bring it on
Take ya picture, then we come and get'cha, ya little bitcha
We bust ya with them four pound shells

That split'cha when they hit'cha
My unpredictable style of emceein'
Kinda reflects the unpredictable zone a nigga be in
My niggas seein' what I'm seein'
Bustin' out the back window when we fleein'

We heard your radio record, you bitch nigga
Now we sittin' back waitin' to rob this fake rich nigga
Biters and snitch niggas, get put in PC like lyrical police
Stay the fuck away from me
I'd rather bounce to Jerse' and rock with Heather be
Then fuck with fake ass niggas that ain't like me

You got real street niggas that ride on your side, huh
They know the code, either do it or die
You got real street niggas that ride on your side baby
They know the code, it's either do it or die

Da Beatminerz,"Yo, everybody lookin' at me like I'm 'bout to drop
Some real fucked up, dissin' black people shit
Just gone give it here, check it out

Man, it's some cold-hearted shit you doin' dawg
I guess tha-that's the way it is
Yea, folks don't write about this shit
Why you got to focus on negativity?
You forgot that didn't cha, yea, but I see it good now

Yo, I remember when the summer was hot, I'm huggin' my block
The soldier, tryin' to get over with this hustle I got
Lookin' out for the cops, on my way to the top
Ain't no reason to even question if I'm rugged or not

I saw the neighborhood stars drivin' our favorite cars
See they out gettin' theirs, so now we tryin' to get ours
Through a neighborhood tours, goin' through neighborhood wars
Gettin' bigger doors, mixin' this neighborhood sport

We had a powerful team, doin' powerful things
The American dream, I'm about gettin' cream
It ain't just for me, it's for my whole family
This is for all of y'all, I call it the hustler's theme, knah'mean?

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now

Amidst the dangerous days, and the dangerous nights
The lost wages and the salary heights
I stayed out of harms way, helped my family to fight
When I slipped into darkness, they brought me back to the light

Pray to the Lord above for added insight
A man confronted with these challenges in his life
To the ladies I might, be the compassionate type
Come see if it's real and feel what my action is like

Right, the man of your dreams, I'm handlin' fiends
Fabulous things, more than mansions and rings
A palace built for a king, is how rich'll be
You tryin' to win, get a piece of this victory

And don't ask about my past, that's history
Don't be afraid of the hustle girl, just get with me
You gotta love supreme, but as good as it seems
I'm in love with the cream, this is the hustler's theme, knah'mean?

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now

Can you stay alive in this strugglin' thing?
Stay alive in this hustlin' thing?
The hustle's only as good, as what the customers bring
Some are no longer with us, others locked up in the bing

See I found a knew trade that I hustle with
It's called hip-hop and I got a love for it
Far from easy believe me y'all, I must admit
'cause y'all customers'll never get enough of this

And now you can depend on your local suppliers
The Last Emp again, down with Da Beatminerz
Rockin' wit'chu, we ain't forget 'chu, as we continue
Catch us at the venue, the hustler's theme

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now

I design this rhyme in my slime where miracles happen
Scheme; world domination, snatch Queens next Manhattan
So hold the Latin Quarter,  behold the prophecy
I'm levitatin' on water, demonstratin' somethin' properly
The A to the be	, there can only be one
Freeze time through the needle when my vinyl gets spun
Get respect 'cause I earn it, first time learn it
With the keys to six, but the five'll burst and invert it
Spray and burn it like I'm holdin areosol to a brick wall
Type my name indelibly, so my legend won't fall
Apani why'all yes yes, the rest are powerless
Who assassinate the queen, our strikers shut 'em down like gravity

Who stay spittin' flows that get underground booties and cats pissed,
Jean,  black listed from shows, the rap antagonist
I work with ladies with brains twisted and talkin' loud and shit
I'll liqour it, fire spittin' women will knuckle you bitch
You troublin' whips, niggas rent, can't afford a six
Crash and when the cops come, you'll find me hurlin' the fifth
We got no dough, frozen wrists, or Cris',
guns'll bust when wind blows
My fist could knock holes though nigga
Wittier shit, gritty as hell, pretty as fuck
Dirty as motherfuckers who actually fuck they mother's what
If you don't like it,  then don't listen, but don't talk

No posin and crap, beg your pardon, por favor
Superior, Orator came jaws like Thor
Soon as I drop some thunder shit, greedy niggas want more
Run the play-by-play, tackle cats like a fullback
It's a dangerous game, come strong or get your skull cracked
Blahti raise the thermostat, collapse, robber formats
Dodge traps like the clap, do it for all ghetto blacks
Stand firm like I'm cemented, Jean Grae my comrad
Enter the Dragon, we demented, sick, and highly complemented
Slick witted, star figures, acid-laced hallucigenics
We fire-spittin' bitches, disregard the bullshittings

Niggas stay runnin your mouth, teeth or shit drippin off
Bottomed-out, permanent south, some bitter cats, so fuck why'all
We hot on wax, we hot on stage
My tongue's a twelve gauge, lips,  uzis, spray the page
why'all some click-n-drag niggas,  chatroom with fag niggas
Backpack and bag niggas,  play body and tag niggas
We raps best when we step in the ring
Get knocked 'fore the first bell, hell with the clock

Take 'em to the crib then I fuck 'em that day (true)
Kick them bitches out, you know my gun play (play)

Jump out the whip, I'm not the type of nigga that trip
Somethin' sick from the nozzle, wanted large when it spit
Hittin' you up, lettin' you bleed in the seat of your truck
And flee the scene when the smoke clear, quiet as fuck
Startin' to lose it, for me that is realer than music
Hold ya plaque up to ya chest and blow right through it
Eight bars on some next shit, probably don't fit
But that don't mean for me to keep quiet and zip up my lips

It's good I can rap, so you don't catch bullets in your back

I'm seeing red, the blue, the brown, black, and gold
Time to stand as one and snatch back the soul
Gangsters, we all can jack back control
Got the bitches coming with the booty and bubbly
Time to discuss streets 'cause shit got ugly
I thought they all facing enemy to enemy
Cause ain't a motherfucking thing here industry
Who in here banging over money, or a bitch that you ain't sure to get
Or soon as you get it, split it
Over a block that's hot, or a chain that he got
The nigga he popped, or over the dimes that HE dropped
Either way we got a bil' a day
Cause nowadays it's kids that spray, they feel that way
And if we chill and wait, and don't delibirate
You see they feel that way, and then they kill that way

Is that the real recognize real
 
Niggas who rob and steal,
could give a fuck about image and sex appeal
So when they see you on the streets (Nigga you know the deal)
hey yo these so-called gangsters, as so-called hard
I seen 'em rolling with a million man entourage
But then they still get touched on by the law
That makes me think, what the fuck they even hired 'em for
You see we all in the same gang
Because we've all hit the same thang
But now it's time niggas game changed
And while he's sleeping calling us 'lost souls'
We send a million O.G.'s straight to the pole

As our people with a purpose, see the shit surface
They get us, 'cause the feds is the nigga you do the dirt with
Sick of pleading 'Your Honor' fuck you, contempt on getting calmer
Sick of these warrants, and drinking and driving drama
Time to, get connected, and stop making them records
Bout slanging and banging, but they can't hold it when it get hectic
A lot of niggas live soft and act hard
A lot of rappers be claiming they be gangsters but trackstars
A lot of cops kick ass, for quick cash, and fast cars

Bangin till the boogie end boogie time I'm hip hop
I know you still feel
The devastation of my lyrics so please kneel
To the king that I may very be
The macadocious A-town player the M-A-C

When your in the mood to flow let me know
Cause to me it ain't no thing I'm always ready to go
So I know that you know that I know you gets none

Da Brat,"My day starts out light, but it is very heavy as the night approach;
When I take flow from all dat smoke dat I smoke, no joke.
As I commence to take flight, it's gotta be first class 'cause this ass
Could give a fuck about coach... bitch.
(How high do you fly when you fly back?)
From da bottom to top; top to bottom and back.
Now as I lay me in da cup, gettin' fucked up,
Puffin' on blunts, and comin' up with some mo' of dat funky stuff.
Rough and tough is not enough to keep my focus;
No, it's dat hocus pocus, abracadabra, smokeyas;
Fills up da room as I breathe again.
One smoke from da ghetto; it's dem braids, and
When flossing in my benz, with my friends, it begins.
Smell the aroma puttin' you in a coma;
It's dat super sanky dank that'll make ya faint, go blank.
Hey, when I hits da door, all my niggas say...

[Chorus]
Adi, adi, adi, adi, ah... (It's probably all dat chronic that I smoke.)
Oh, how we love it when ya fire it up.
Adi, adi, adi, adi, ah... layin' in da cut, gettin' real fucked up.
Layin' in da cut, gettin' real fucked up.

It's a new day, new day; truly, ain't nathin' changed.
Fall up out my bed to the same ol' thangs.
Your average, everyday, black, surrounded.  Barbecue, a little weed.
It's some niggas with some bass pounding.
One o'clock is da time to raise.
Take a shower, brush my teeth, and correct my braids.
Now listen up to what I say, because this typa shit... it happens everyday, and
(I gotta place where I soak some, so...) In da summer it's a coolin',
In da winter it's a smoke, ho.
Twenty feet away from da house, in da back,
Surrounded by a gate draped in all black its. 
(It's where me and my homies go smokin' on that thang till it ain't no mo'.)
How we smoke?  (We smoke till I blast some mo'.)
Doin' my thang, kickin' back, relax, and then...

Hey nigga ain't shit gonna ever change 
Between you and your boo. 
Put a hold on me ever since I held you 
What compelled you to be my nigga 
Besides passion and love 
You ran up on a real bitch with understanding and trust 
Fuck the others, none of them compare to us 
And under covers you my muthafucka nigga, 
When you stickin my stuff 
You laid pipe unlike any other plumber 
Took me shoppin all day and at night, you kept me cummin. 
Made dinner, collard greens, candied yams and steak. 
Taught me how to measure grams, cook rocks, and chop weights 
Caught a case, cuz you're boy ran his mouth too much. 
And it's a disgrace how the pain felt to miss your touch 
But as the days keep passin, keep it actin with stacks of letters 
Hit you so you don't forget us 
When you'd rather not be livin in the cella 
Hella muthafuckas want your occupation 
But they can keep pacin, cuz I'm gonna be waitin on my Baby...

That you was soft, braggin he collecting your cheese, 
And pissing me the fuck off. 
The first thought of committing a felony never left 
I missed the big breaths you took when we waz puffin an L, 
Just the little things you do with the bigger ones I 
Saw better SL 500s colorful Gucci sweaters and leathers 
Diamond letters girl you broke, I saved the sugar for you 
Keep the business runnin, droppin off keys in Cancun 
Cash rules, and you remain to be the King of my throne 
Position taken, flippin calender pages till you get home 
Wanna blast your boy for snatchin up my happiness 
But I regret what'll happen to this dollar foundation 
If I'm incarcerated 
Too you can make it through, we bail on the Jealous 
Who tell us the opposite of that, 
Forever you and Brat 
I tried to take the blame, but you prefered to handle my fame 
So i'm waitin with open arms to rekindle the flame...

Fuck over the dough and die 
Pick yo casket if you feel that you gone try some shit

Da Brat,"[Featuring Jermaine Dupri] 

Uh oh o  uh uh o  ah ah ah ah ah 

Uh oh o  uh uh o  ah ah ah ah ah 

Verse One: 

Bringing more noise than pg we true and flew in life 

Leave us JD and rock a party all night tight nigga 

One two three four five six seven 

I can rap like hell but make it sound like heaven well 

Seven six five four three two one 

JD what the deal is? Lemme get some 

How many occasions you and your liasons 

Can't fuck with this phenomenon,division,separated from the norm 

Pop a lot of Shawn Don and celebrate the good times 

So get your groove on, pulling on the in-and let's all get high 

In the back of my-Black on Black,you come through in ninety 

Bumpin' you remind me with the cops right behind me 

I got head rest, Genesis played by the Brat-Hey 

Bulletproof windows, for negroes, that want to act 

Don't want to face the fact, That that's the way we live 

Lookin' everyday Jig, Buyin' everything big-You dig? Nigga 

You don't want to' go the distance-Surrender-Consistence 

Allows me the key clock contender 

And enter a new millennium,Cracking mutherfuckers craniums 

Droppin Bombs-Saddam Hussein and nigga's straining 

Hit a little,I'm feeling tickles from the nickels I smoked 

The sweat trickle,as I slid a little liquor down my throat 

It ain't no hope for these nigga's who broke and acting big willy 

They dream to see a milly and talk shit before it happen really 

Spark up another philly and eyewitness 

The Brat fulfilling champagne and caviar wishes 

The lifestyle of the bitch is famous,Make the payment to chante 

embarrass nigga's live a hobby-All day harris 

Fly me to the moon,soon and very soon stay tuned 

Prepare to meet you doom 'cause it ain't no room for you 

Chorus 

No matter what they keep on saying and what they thinking 

We be keepin' in live,Keepin' it live-Its' like straight to the scene 

It's like that it's Da Brat just 

Keepin' it live,Keepin' it we make you say 

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,ah-ahh,ah-ah-ahh 

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,ah-ahh,ah-ah-ahh 

Verse Two: 

And if you're feeling for masquerade,I can rock a party today 

Breaking parlay as we stack cakes of cheddar 

Butter like parkay,wanted in four plates-sex 

So-so definitely the best,Better watch your step 

It's pooky,Trap with hits I make 'em clap to this 

You knew we was coming back to kick some asses kid 

It's nigga's like me that have more fun 

Pop mo' bottles than the next one 

Supermodel sex and make a portion 

Now catch me if you can like the gingerbread man 

Fifty grand in my hand sit-tin' on top of the world 

Half drunk,high as fuck,shitting hard,legs swinging 

Bringing the ruckus to all motherfuckers-woooo 

Hey yo,Brat you Da funk bandit 

Act like you know,the baddest sweet habit having mommy to hit the door 

Flash it a little,living riddles can't buy the vittles 

Get cash,Life don't only come once-to let it pass 

To all my nigga's rockin' big jewels,brand new shoes and new kicks 

Nigga's from the old school that started all this shit 

Big time weightholders,Dope clocking for years 

Nigga's you watched as a shorty thinking that's the way to live 

Giving all I got to give,us bitches is pushing sixes 

With ten thousand dollar bracelets around they wrist 

Legistics,is strictly riches,the other fishes in the sea 

Can't be malicious as me,fucking with G's 

Chorus 

No matter what they keep on saying and what they thinking 

We be keepin' in live,Keepin' it live-Its' like straight to the scene 

It's like that it's Da Brat just 

Keepin' it live,Keepin' it we make you say 

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,ah-ahh,ah-ah-ahh

Don't give a fuck.
I'm denied nothing, gotta still get it.
Spoiled rotten, real with it,

Spoiled rotten, real with it,
Deal with it.
Don't you feel me living in you?
When muthafuckas make promises and can't come through.
Whatever obstacles that detour me from getting my way,
I gets revenge to the end, then begin the foreplay.
My forte is sipping Alize, and acting up.
Looked into your mirror at your face you started backing up,
What the fuck?
You slowly step away and started panic,
As you witness anuthatantrum, fantastic, mantic, keeping niggas frantic.
Your manner don't want to be told shit.
If I can't get it you might feel my spirit off on another mission,
Fishing for my next victim with no permission.
Switching bodies, had to get some new Gotti's put on the Benz.
Jumped in the minds of many mens with no patience.
The worst thing to do is wait and waste time.
It's constantly sipping away taking.
Manipulating all ages, bring the frustration.
Waiting for the lift of my karat, to face in your location.
Appearing crazy on track, but seen daily,
Some say shady, but so what muthafucker?",Anuthatantrum

We jackin' these niggas for they beats and shit.
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Put this shit in ya mothafuckin' mouth...

Niggas know when they see the afro-symbol, they embrace themselves.
Lock doors and hold their breath.
For the black on black beamer drivin'.
Shitin' on niggas time after time,
And on da west side is confinement.
It ain't no gettin' outta line with me, I stays ready.
Split a mothafuckas shit fo' free, if necessary.
Gotta love for gettin' blunted
What you want to do I done it, bitch.
And about to do it again,
So run and tell ya friends I'm comin'.

My motto is make it all, and never miss a buck.

The next destination is to be the greatest heavyweight, and undisputed.
Due to dem other bitches, to the back of the bus, with nothing much to it.
My millions my main concern, fucka factions and hurting feelings.
Its niggas that'll care just to kick it, 
With a real bitch gettin' real rich, quick.
Live it up to the fullest, notch set up the plot.
Life expect to see levels drop, its on again and it don't stop.
Anotha tantrum for crematin' mothafuckas in random.
Leavin' none standin', keep da big willies hold'em for grants.
The money it cost, to be boss, is high, my all time condition;
To da day I die, that's why I be the best for this position, listen.
Cleavage decorated wit' ice flooded pieces.
I live for drop top corneshes and new releases.
Bouncin' in little islands I can't even pronounce.
Way out, laid out, by da beach smokin' a whole fuckin' ounce.

Malicious with malice and mayhem straight out of a p-funk dictionary
Give me the mic and watch me slay
Them those lame and illiterate poeticistics pisses me off ?
Be missing me with that shit putting your petty torched packaged
Pathetically in front of me I suppress 
I'll rest of the best of MCs regularly

In the beginning I was bout it slid in and we write it
This shit deplace yall bitches wouldn't even thinking bout hit
Heads flipped shittin' hard on niggas
With a name like Brat exotic cars and large bank figures

Maker of some hot shit lose
Makin' it hard for all yall bitches to move around like moose
Truth whateva touch come through in a clutch

Ay, when I step inside your party, yo, I turn dat bitch out.
Let 'em know what I'm about, this is my fuckin' house.
The uncompatible, capital be eyes stay chinky.
From da green inhaled into my body,
All spot lookers kill ya search 'cause this block on lock,
And plus dem little bitches you got don't want no work.
Not even to come in contact with.
It's ritual to da death that we don't tolerate no wack shit, and that's it.
All da way crunk, half drunk off da remi. 
Makin' niggas jump, speakers pump is all dats in me.
Spittin' shit like a semi-auto, don't never stop getting cheese,
Is da motto you's follow drinking straight from da bottle.
Attitude is shitty, very inqwery kitty holdin' down the windy city.

Test me, and watch me make something happen.

Das right. Umhmm, Brat make it happen.
Well. Umhmm, I like that, well make it happen, hey.

Uh, she was the one to make it happen, when dat bitch went platinum.
Ain't nothing average about the magic between me and da mic, and da actin'.
When asking a question, who put it to the test, check the record?
Hit top, hottest rap and R and B single, July second,
In ninety-four, you flew the funk in, ninety-six back again.
Committed some mo' sinnin', fuckin' up most men and women.
The bad seed with mad weed, follow no fuckin' leader.
True believer in da factor, can't no motherfucka beat her.
Keep ya feet up, Brat bout to sweep up, niggas can leap up,
And creep up, still stay beneath her. 
'Cause she bust and what to death discuss they between us. 
Take precaution, prepare to bite da dust, and just take dat shit as a loss. 
Collect billboard and soul train awards from my trouble 
Crappin' you motherfuckas out and coming back for double.
Nice on da dice sippin' on Hen and ice, da time is right.
Seven eleven on the first go round with funkdafied, I made it happen, bitch.

Da Brat,"Some motherfuckers believe 
That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit  huh 
That I should cuss and shit  huh 
That I shouldn't do the shit I want to do 

You know what I'm sayin'? 
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think 
That's they beliefs  here go mine 
I gets embedded in your cerebellum  deeper than the ocean 

Focusin' on fuckin' a nigga up  who got jokes? 
Provoke me  my vision of lust is money  trust is funny 
Too many sheisty motherfuckers comin' for me 
One in the chamber, ready for repetition if possible 

Hate to mention this, poppin' that nigga, bitch 

It be the intellectual, get sexual in a second heffer 

You could never be no competition to me 

You bit the poison apple, tryin' adapt to this shit 

Show you how it happened 

While we laughin', diggin' your ditch 

And you can get your boys 

I got Disciples and ViceLords 

Planted through every city ready, declare war 

If you feel I stepped on your toes 

It was intentionally 

Cause it was meant to be the shit since I found JD 

My lyrical thesis broke in pieces 

For you pussies who can't feed off it 

Everything'll be fine, just hit the weed often 

Chorus: repeat 2X 

I believe good things come to those that grind 

Never take a step back, leave the past behind 

Keep your mind on some money and don't ever stop tryin' 

And everything'll be fine, everything'll be fine 

It's time to let your lighter spark 

Crank up the weed session 

With one of the best in the Midwestern section 

Flexin' with no shame 

Cause a mi solo female MC's be back in the game 

Sun up to sun down I puff leaves 

Filled with imported trees from the West Indies 

Chi-town's finest in more ways than one 

Me follow in the path of another, days is done 

See I got mic checkin' down to a science 

Meanin' I perfected the ways 

To shit on you and your alliance 

I write the type of shit that'll hypnotize ya 

Fuck around and kill your whole click like Kaiser 

In the streets of Prazza, the Westside of niggas 

Ain't expects, smellin' like cannibus 

Can't nothin' handle this 

They want to dismantle this but it will never go down 

Shit, cause my beliefs is I'm the baddest around, bitch 

Chorus 

Now it's the shit, you want to contest me 

Never will you be the opponent left 

Leave'em swept off they feet 

So So Def got that chief shit, keep it brief 

Under the covers ain't another bitch bad as me 

So I must keep comin' 

Keep on runnin' but you can't escape me 

I'm in your brain 

Remember the bitch you love to hate 

She on the paper chase 

In any case, but not any rate 

Keep the currency's increase, shit ain't cheap 

And my belief is to get the money, nigga 

So what's the beef to this? 

Enough cheese for Brat, never endin' G's 

Hundred thousand dollar bills by the stack 

The weak supportin' my habits 

Enough karats for the whole salad 

Smokin' cabbage every five minutes 

Beginnin' my days rollin' swishes 

I never listen to penny pinchin' 

Pussy eatin' punks advice 

To catch'em slippin' is my theory 

Be weary what I bust, make niggas weak 

And pack a bleeder, top notch in my speeches

Where is all my bitches at?

You a bitch, you a bitch, i'm a bitch,
We all bitches,
In this motherfucking game
Just be a bad bitch,
When you be a bitch

[Verse 1]
I wakes up from dreaming of money,
To thinking of money
On a daily basis,
Make sure the money
Make the way to the safe
Put your bet's on the ""be	"" to the ""ra""
From the west side of chi' ""t"",
niggas want to ride with me
Cause i'm the live-est,
Get high with me
Cause i'm fly
Obsessed with me
Cause i'm shy
No matter which whip i pick,
And butt-kick your little buckets
And leave your face with a disgusted look
As you bite the dust
I get them big things
This is hard shit, head bob,
Breakin your neck,
Raw shit
My bitches keep hollin'
""dollas""
""til'god""
Call us
And it don't quit
Till the earth split
This bitch
A baller wit' it
In a black jag,
It's a fact that,
Brat the first solo
To go platt,
And if it sound like i'm braggin,'
I am, cause i'm proud of myself,
Pat a bitch on the back,
Damn...straight to the bank i go
Created a game plan
That ya'll follow
Switch four in the diablo
Vacationin' morocco
Keep chasin' the papers faithfully
And cause i get it
Niggas permanently hatin' me
Fuckem'
I'm talkin' to...

Hook:
All my bitches
That live the hood life,
Good life,

A nigga for shit,

I dedicates this one to you...

[Verse 2]
From the start i was in a hurry to crawl,
And walk slap niggas before i could hardly talk.
Now i gottem'on they knees screamin'
That's what the fuck i thought
No matter how i part the braids
Hear ya'll chatter when i rock it straight.
I'ma bad bitch even when the style flipped
I get paid cause dough come fast in large amounts
Too much for one nigga to count
You must not know how a so so def hoe bounce
To bust open another niggas accounts and be out
To the tellee or the atm in a 750 gray bm
Made a motherfucker pay for the rims
I fucked his friend but it's all good
He understood the way i live my life, my life
That i can't depend on nobody
For me to survive and stay high.
Where all my bitches at? Girls
Make 'em love to hate us
And whether you classy to dick suckin'
Or a trashy bitch get your papers
I gotta eat throw these bows
Silently creep on these hoes
That's robbin' my flows you impostors to me
Prophets is all i see i ain't got time for beef,
So i rhyme for cheese financially stable,
Tryin' to make g's and i'm talkin' to

Hook
[Verse 3]
And since i cover the mortgage,
The car note, the porsche, and the condo
We still smokin'
Dollar signs are all i see excuse me,
I got to cut the line leave you niggas behind
For the third time and shine on purpose
Blind'em every time i surface
If an aries hurt you you must deserve it
Every bit of a dime is worth it,
Keep on swerving not perfect
But striving for that working with diamonds,
And flirting with the finest cats,
Desert the broke niggas that still live
With their momma's at
Provoke most to want to wine a dine brat,
Cause i'm dope from coast to coast
Guarantee to fall in love with me
After just one toast,
Smoke weed that'll make you say,
I ain't never getting' high again
Niggas always want to see what i'm riding in
So i slide in the benz outfit match
From head to tims
Rims you ain't seen before fein for doe,
Screamin' cream for mo and mo,
Reap the benefits if it's free shit,
I take gifts in all shapes and sizes
And diamonds is my favorite wish,
Picture me rich a genious,
When it comes to me collecting these chips,
And this to...

It's ain't my fault if he looking

Every time I come near
All he do is stare
And I can see it in his eyes that he wants some
He know what's in the prize, it's Red Rum
To any of these hoes that come
Stand next to me and look like bums, they make pennies
And all I do is stack the paper
Just in case I run into some complications
I'm set for life, never in debt
And you frustrated when I get all the niggas' attention
You fall off
Guess you was born to make the coffee for us
Writing bitches with a higher position

Go get a nine to five
Cause you can't keep up with the shit I cook up
I can't help it if you're nigga wanna hook up

And ya really wanna stop me bad
But fix your face bitch I'm here to stay
And I don't give a fuck, you

And I'mma make sure that my niggas lookin'
Tell you broads to calm down there ain't no competition
I'm flawless as the rocks on my left pinky
And I love it when y'all wanna get at me
And make me think my shit don't stink
Evidently you ain't satisfied at home
She ain't got no style of her own
No body of her own
Not roaming in the V12
You turned on because I bought it myself
What other bitch do you know like this?
That's tight as a hot curl
Known to rock worlds
Once I'm spotted you will probably drop your girl
My intimidation to niggas is challenging to 'em
He fiending to get in my Vicky's Secrets
And underneath my Girbaud and my boxer shorts
I rock ice burg sports and Da Brat prints of all sorts
Interesting to you cause I got some dough

You'll never go broke

But I want em to keep on watchin me

I always feel like
Somebody's watchin me, watchin me
Could it be the way I'm still tight?
Niggas that didn't use to feel me jockin me, jockin me
The, whole world got too much money for me
To not get no dough, dough, can't no hoe
Rock harder than the one from So-So
I never go broke broke
I keep comin with the vocals that make most know
Why the fuck I boast, boast and brag
Why should I look sad that I got some loot now?
In fact, I knew how
watch when I back the Coupe out
Can niggas just troop out
The same way they do when I show you Brat
With a little bit of boobs out
And her big ass protrude out
Get the news out
Some of you bitches lose out
When the sexiness ooze out
Like orgasms, I'm the best at this
Throwin tantrums when I move into makin shit
If you thinkin of becomin one of my favorites
You gotta pay a bitch
Cause I be stayin rich
I ain't quittin, quittin
Way before ""Funkdafied"" I was spittin, spittin

Throw yo hands in the air like you dont care
This fo niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on em, get cash on em
And make em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever im high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired
To get that paper, baby

If y'all wanna see me, see me
Im give y'all somethin to look look at
Make a nigga neck turn turn for Brat
Burn burn these hoes cuz I'm back and my pants still sag
It's automatic, they wanna jump on my wagon, wagon
I ain't lackin lackin on shit
Open ya eyes when my body when I try on clothes that fit fit
I'm articulate and particulate on who I let hit hit
And get up in the middle of the center of my tootsie roll
Roll me something to smoke smoke and burn slow slow
Don't keep it a secret, tell all ya folks
See you when I shine, I glow, glow
From the C-H-I-C-A-GO, 6-0-6-4-4
And I trust no, nigga that make a mistake for me
Guns ready to blaze and to leave with you
Some of the ones run
I can't control my trigger finger when it pump pump
Stay out the way when I come come
It's guaranteed to bump bump the trunk, uh
And put a hump in ya back
If niggas is askin who's thumpin, it's Brat Brat

(chorus)

(Mystikal)
I keep my bad braids back when puttin the dick on the track
You can turn it down playa, we don't listen to that
The bass dont thump, we spit on crap
That beat ain't tight nigga, that shit ain't fat
Everytime that shit come out, I toss it back and I slap
I be breakin ya back to the rhythm of rap
(?)Test it loud for the low frequency, where it's at?(?)
Niggas say, ""I love that fuckin shit ya did wit Da Brat!""
Actin bad with the pad, with the pen, with the paper
Still smoke a nigga under the table
Put the lines in the words and the hooks and the phrases
Instead of puttin out sumthin thats blazin
Get ya hand out my pocket, get ya foot out ya mouth
And ya head out ya ass
And keep ya nose out my buisness
And I mean it, goddammit, cuz I'm fiddinta get MAD!
I put em in the trash bag
Twist tie, put em out Monday and Wednesday
I kick em in they raggely ass
Take money from em and you know I better get some
I know it ain't fair
but I smoke with alligators and I wrestle with bears
Throw ya hands in the air
As high as you can, and leave them bitches there!

Yeah  yeah come on 

[Da Brat] 
Each day I come in  it's always somethin' 
Don't stress me  I'm paid like Phil Drummin 
I pop like ten Crist'ies a day 
In the spot like  I'm way past risqué 
be	 are A T hard and sexy 
And you can't get next to me baby 
With a blunt in my hand shit is obsolete 
I don't want to be fucked with when I cheat 
It's my smoking lye, how it's supposed to be 
You bitches could never get close to me 
Hopefully you know not to blow my high 
Impose in my zone extinguish my fire 
It's my desire to blaze it up 
Mad cause I puff I don't give a fuck 
Don't come around me with no negative shit 
Step up, step up and I'mma bust your lip 
Cause… 

[Chorus] 
Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high 
(To the sky) 
First thing you can do is make my high come down 
(Down, down, down) 
Ooh when you make my high come down 
I don't want to be around you no more 

[Da Brat] 
Let's space it out, my faith is out 
When I get frustrated I take it out 
On the optimo so break it out 
Gun me vicariously till I choke me 
Make no mistake about Miss Harris stakin' out 
Good cabbage lay it out 
Gray for glycoma, rotten to Daytona 
How to survive? 
Get high all by your lonesome 
Unless you want some company 
I might pass the blunt but this bud's for me 
My concentration and know nothing else 
I take my problems lay 'em on the shelf 
Block all the calls then shut off the cell 
It's not absurd niggas get on my nerves 
With bullshit too much for this bitch 
Me and my spliff don't want to be fucked with 

[Chorus] 
Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high 
(Too the sky) 
First thing you can do is make my high come down 
(Down, down, down) 
Ooh when you make my high come down 
I don't want to be around you no more 

Usually, when I split my gun down the middle 
Got good weed, so strong it takes just a minute 
For me to get to that place we love to go 
I made this shit so you would know 

[Da Brat] 
When the ashes burn off 
I get flashes on how you were turned off 
And a big distraction 
Don't nobody want to be agitated 
Upset or annoyed, and aggravated 
Masturbation ain't stimulating as this 
When it's twist, put it up to my lips and hit 
Don't forget to puff, puff and pass 
My blunt is stuffed up with chunks of hash 

[Chorus] 
Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high 
(Too the sky) 
First thing you can do is make my high come down 
(Down, down, down) 
Ooh when you make my high come down 
I don't want to be around you no more, no more

Da Brat,"Buckwild outrageous do what you feel like doin'
'Til a motherfucker know when you don't feel like screwin'
I did it, you do it, break the ties that bound
Keep a motherfucker off you, keep your feet on the ground

Hey, fuck you if you can't go for that
And a double fuck you from Da Brat a tat tat
Let it all hang loose, never feelin' afflicted
Go for what you want and it's called, unrestricted

May the Lord be my witness
From the ""Funk"" to the ""Tantrum"" now ""Unrestricted""
The K Town bitch too weak
In Chi villain they be killin' every mark in the district

Can y'all skill match it?
Right I kill Patrick from the six oh six fo' fo'
Got hit 'cause ya clip so slow
Motherfuckers can't do shit with ""So, so""

Shine like a twenty inch mo, mo
For the Navi' on top of them dub's
Hit me in the mug, and deliver the bud
Now you talkin' 'bout my gul

Terror for the millenium, straight fuckin up anyone
(Hah, anyone, shit)
Steady bust like a semi gun
Murderin' over any drum, comin' out from the dark
Here to let you know here she come

Can't nobody do what I done
Niggaz and bitches think they run
Fin' ta throw another one of my ""Tantrums"" redrum
And the six oh six fo' fo' is where I'm from

Callin' on my nigga Twista to set this shit off
Two of the best motherfuckers on the West side
If I need to relieve stress I get high
This the introduction, unrestricted is how I bust in

Like a blow to the dome and a severe concussion, shock a hoe
And niggaz can talk about me, all they want
'Cause I'ma bad bitch
And I'ma continue to be that, 'til I'm gone

Shit, baby girl you ain't even gotta hurt 'em like that
Commit a murder like that
Let off like a ass kick and serve a hype track
Hit the world like volcano's

Earthquakes, bombs, thunder and lightnin'
No wonder it's frightening
Hoe's might as well not come out of hiding
Could you really be about to crush em'

Dustin 'em off like Hoffman and hush em'
Feel the repercussions of a girl
From a place where that gangsterin' and hustlin'
Ballin' and bustin' so lie low

Dodge low from my Chi flow
We smokin' up five oh
And work thirty calories off like Tae Bo
In the middle of the function flossin'

With a grip no script but ""Legit Ballin""
Better go on with the shit talkin'
I create corpses for caskets and coffins
Niggaz don't want Twista to spit
I kick that Mobtastic shit
Introduction for a raw and sometimes psychotic bitch

Oh, I'm the befo', but Da Brat is the after
We pimpslap lame bitches just for the laughter
All or nothin', never a fraction
Yeah, you got it motherfuckin' Millie Jackson
You bitches, you bitches

With my pretty eyes, a cute nose and these fat ass lips
My medallion sit in the middle of my tits
It's hit after hit, shit sweet every sip
Down to the last drip drop, watch the hips rock
Color Me Bad, tick tock you don't stop

Just wave you hands from side to side
Cause we gone show keep it live
We got greed in our eyes, I keep spittin', I keep rippin'
I keep women, I creep and keep hittin'
They impressed with my shoe size, deuce I'm with you tonight
Girl if you do it right, me and you can do it twice

When I'm called on to bust, wanna get yo brawl on with us
Can't ball with us, too hard to touch
22 Fuckin' up they callin' us

I'm the first one off the bus, got nuts to lust
They keep rushin' for status, some more than you got it
All for cabbage as far as we got it

So don't push me, I'm too close to the edge
Bout to go loco on these niggas, leave'em for dead, and

When it's time for us, bitch we diamond cut
I'm 22, We West-Chi

And I'm da motherfuckin' Brat right

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours

When I hit the door, nigga best move, guess who
We ain't got no dress shoes, just a couple scarves and a vest too
Test who why you trippin' we came to party
Run game and probably leave the party with somebody
Gotta be hard, women they love to touch it
And when I fuck 'em they hypnotized
Sprung cause I hit it right, tongue tied sometimes
Like Zinfandel wine, got they mind blown
In my zone, I'm a grown man, gone I ain't tryin' to keep her
She got nice features, but so do Mesha, Imma keep creepin'
Keep getting deeper they playa hate me all of a sudden
A new kid bussin', you hear it hush and she
Scared to cut fuckin' too many hoes, me I got
Twenty hoes, I'ma hoe, be a hoe, spend the dough, see a show
Let it be known playa west to east
Cause I'm the dog that fell in love with the Georgia Peach

I heard you wanna hit this twat, nigga I thought not
Fell up in the party with a phat knot, glock cocked
Got too much of my own shit to stop
And look for niggas, when I make any dick rock
Shook them niggas, took all they cheese, still they say
They body's callin' for me, wanna go half on a seed and shit
Fuck that, I got half on the weed and shit and I'm Brat
One of a kind of my breed and shit and you can find me
On the West Side of Chi with my thieving click, believe a bitch
Cause ain't no nigga hated on the pussy yet
Squeeze the dick, got grip, they can't forget
Ain't a hoe tight like me, flow tight like me
Quote, write and recite, fuck all night like me
They say is she is or is she ain't a dyke
You curious cause you wanna fuck me tonight

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours
",Breeve on Em
Da Brat,"Uh, any chance I get I'm on a plane
I book advance tickets and pay the fees with no complaints
In the summer its off the hook no time to waste
Just lie at the lake and I'm shoulder dry to the taste

Even though some niggas I grew up with hate
I keep a few good homies that try to stay outta jail
Tonio tell me what the bail is it'll be there
And when you get out my coke tail here

The crack head deals in my daddy
And all he seem to dream about is bad ass habits
The gun shots scream loud 
So I soak the radio from upstairs to outside the house

With the extended cord no night is boring
On the front porch even if its pouring
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring 
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

[Chorus]
Chi town chi town the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show 'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime

The liquor store on every corner packed
The bus run twenty-fo and my stop Jackson
Fire hydrant busted time for action
Niggas come out like its the beach in Miami

The cops chase thiefs all through the alley and don't stop
These niggas kill for rocks 
If you can't stand up for your spot don't squat
Shop for a vacant lot or get shot

'Cause Chicago niggas don't play them games
When it comes to slanging them thangs for the money mane
Fuck around and get short for the playas ball
And call don Juan to flash green on why'all

The pimps got the hoes pinned up on the wall
Just pass me the blunt and I puff it all 
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

[Chorus]

Don't worry about what I do for my city
Some of y'all run your mouth too much and what a pity
If you outside looking in, shit seem pretty
But it's a lot of shit to do with bitch...I did it

I'm cold in the winter my mink track the flow
With the hat to match cadillacs in the snow
If its a block party the whole hood know
Niggas from 3 and 1st streets overcome the smoke

It's K Town times 22 next shine
Who label he on mine Westside nigga right
To my Southside niggas and my Eastside niggas
And my Northside niggas get high

We really don't give a fuck what side you from
Just keep on hollering out Chi!!!
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

Da Brat,"Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

If ya thirsty I could possibly slide down your throat
If you work may let's say we skip the foreplay
Picture me kicking in the doorway to set off the storey
Negligee hot tip of the knockers stay brick like rocks

Figure if you drop ice here I don't stop
'cause it's twice as nice when it's frosted up
Sweetness like this could never cost enough
With a so, so twist, try this stuff

Mouth watering love succulent to all taste buds
Must of been us you was dreaming of the crush
I breeve on 'em and make 'em feel the lust
Then jiggle the lemons a little so they feel to touch

Cream to us say nothing to us scared
Premium pink stuff and swing with us sweetened it up
To it make you wanna say, ""Ooh its cool""

Seven eleven can't satisfy your appetite all night
JD and I planned it to be dickable so it's alright
You can come and escapade in my escalade

Lay me flat on my back and slurp away
I get action in a Bentley with no brains
Just pure satisfaction cracking with no cain
I came for the thrill of it I ain't looking for real love
Just the feel of it

After just one taste you still bugging
Da black cat make you wanna handle business
Until the pleasure principle kick it

If you hit this I'll make you tell your wife and your mistress
To leave town 'cause they been evicted
Hit up a record store pick up Brat and get addicted

It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby

Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby

A thirst quenching mouth watering concoction
Your only option drink to ya pink why stop it
One think its refreshing isn't it the best when you sipping it
Heaven sake honey buns built for dipping in

Money come quicker than a two minute brother
That concentrate on stiffin' when he love it
Stick when too dry so keep stirring
It still be the sweet even if it turn syrup

Hurry up and get a cup full cop fills and get' cha cap peeled back
Rash a little rat first smash went classic
Even with my homies help on the west you wack
Sincerely Brat where my girls at

We stick together in the rain
Batches of pink lemonade bringing da pain
Any day and every minute make you wanna get up in it
'cause it's just that cool

Da Brat,"Wonderin' where you been, baby, baby?

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

Really though how much time you think I got?
The clock is ticking, it's ticking away
You're slippin' away fucking the honeys on the block stop
'Cause if I gotta drop kick a ho, I'll kill her fa'sure
Let's stick around till the murder occurs
How you gonna creep with me and sleep with her?

At the moment of time when I heard the news
My vision must have been blurred
'Cause I ain't think you deserve to lose the nerve for fools
Shit people were saying was absurd to me
But I certainly never thought you would take it to the degree
Of hurtin' me, purposely

We were supposed to be husband and wife
So I dedicated my life to you
Why? So you could keep a chick on the side
'Cause if I sneak a dick on the side you lookin' to die
And booking me a ticket to Chi cause you choose to lie
I need a nigga with an attitude, maturative mind

Give me gratitude when I'm giving him shine
No matter who the bastard was, I was past his love
But he never ran fast enough
I'm a master at the craft 'cause I roll with some master thugs
Laughin' as I pass you up
Should've told me that you wanted to get ass and fuck
I would've set it up so we all had some fun

You assist to get around, I'll be the aid and assist you to get out
Thank them hoes cause you're shit out of luck
And I don't regret what I spit out and bust
I'm sick and tired of you us, I had enough for this sittin' at home
Cryin' 'n' stuff 'n' being alone
Nigga if you want to roam the streets then just let me be
There's a whole gang of niggas that wanna hit my sheets

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

Shit, all I ever did was wait and look out the window
And smoke me some endo
It drove me to drinkin' and getting bent mo'
Gave myself 100% more time to think, was love designed to stink?
Repeatedly you lied to me, told you to confide in me
Ain't nothin' them other hoes could do 'cause I molded you
To fit properly was inside of me

When you're strokin' them, you're thinkin' of riding me
And most of them hopin' to slide with me 'cause I'm a ferocious hoe
When it comes to freaky shit the dopest, you had to blow this
It's all out of proportion and lost your focus
Wasting my time cause I'm just getting older
You're the reason I keep a chip on my shoulder
44 in the holster bulletproof vest under my clothes

I'm supposed to trust you
Every time I leave town I bust you, fuck you, the moanin' and groanin'
Led me to the pillow where you laid your head
Felt like I'd rather be dead instead
Went ahead followed the sound through the hallway
You said you'd always be true
But the neighbors say the bitch was there all day with you
That's why you ain't answered when I was pagin' you

I hit the door, you duck and dove, she tried to find her clothes
Y'all was dodging bullets holes together
You gonna stay with that broke hefer
You know who the So So Defest is
I ain't gotta show a motherfucker breastesses to keep 'em interested in
You better recognize the good investment
From the West Side of Chi nigga

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

Make the whole table go crazy the first second
Third I'm ready and able to hit the middle
Under that disco ball so I could shake a little
This s*** for why'all who dance with me
Touchin' my a** and titties so frantically
Don't get carried away with it
I'll let you have a little fun if you play with it
Insatiably, when I cum I do it patiently

handed to her

Leave it alone when the sweat trinkle down my

And making eye contact
Homie put your hands on my waist and occasionally
Run your fingers through my fresh a** braids and say
to me
That you feel horny 'cause I want to know
If you want some of this I wish you tell me so
'cause if I let you touch me I must want you to go
Home with me be alond with me to get some mo'
'cause we smoke we drink we bump and grind
And even though I'm tipsy I want to know what's on
ya mind

When I'm pissed I let it flow

Without having to forge a signature 
Or getting a nigga to co sign with me

Sour on the g4 to Cali for more sticky gravy life
Come hop on this tour with me lets get faded for life
I used to save up cookies they are brown even
But I got rid of the whole box 
And I didn't even turn the loot in' 
I'm shootin' its all cause of you lame ass butlers 
When I smirk if devils could talk mine would say fuck ya!

From the mansion to the high rise to the block we hot
I rock the white people the Latinos and foreigners
Niggas can't see me when they cry I scratch out there corniers
I'm warning ya I was born a winner 
I scare crowed off like that Anna Lotono
Did right after she sang 'home in the weares
After the blizzard that's 
When I came through with them frosted pieces was dripping like icicles
Keep a few of dem precious V-V-S's next to my skin 
So with the best investment jems ain't no second guessing its here
Ain't not question who the best is 
Take a lesson from a bitch who is the goodie in years
Never skooted in here got dem all in here
Cause dirty money spin like clean money from da A-T-M dummy 
So when you done bumping your gums there's a lot of dough to be made
You should get you sum before its too late
And you left wiv none
Now its all bout the cash where ever it come from
Nigga

Da Brat,"[Intro]
Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your man
Bitch! I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
And I'd do it again

[Verse 1]
When I first saw your man we was really fine
And you was getting a little irritated that I was looking
Like you knew what was on my mind (fuck you)
You're not secure
It's written all over your face
You thought it wouldn't last (not tomorrow)
Top kitty in place
You see me as an obstacle
Staying away much as possible
It's mandatory that I command the attention of your man eye
Not to mention he can't help it because I'm fly
The plan is
I stroll by
Big bubble Chanel shades with diamond tips
Get up close and personal
Seduce with my lips
I ain't gotta say shit
He felling me and you all bent outta shape
'cause I'm about to take who you with
Keep crunk
The run in my blood make a nigga jump jump
His body was banging
His teeth was pearly white
He had those strong keen features like Mario Van Peebles
His check bones was chiseled
His smile made me sizzle
His cologne had me sniffen' him from all the way home
I want to smell this nigga and I this nigga to smell me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
So the night went on
We keep it in each other sides
He kept coming around me just to see my behind
I was being so flirtatious with the body language
I was so anxious to make those arrangements
Tangle him up in the sheets
Transaction about to happen anytime that we meet
I put one foot in front of the other
Stopped to look in back of my nameplate in the mirror
Gotta make sure my lipstick is straight and not smeared
Its clear he wants me severely
So I slide over up to his ear and whispered it gently
Fuck Me! Fuck Me! Fuck Me!
You on the other hand nowhere to be found
Told you he was going to pee
But he came to find me
He felt you standing around
I'm a fuck him

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You came to the bathroom
And guess what you saw
You saw my big brown titties popping outta my bra
With his mouth on my nipple like a suction cup
I was wrapped around him like an octopus
He was rubbing me down so I couldn't get up
I know you hate me now but I don't give a fuck
If he was yours like you said he was
His dick wouldn't have got so hard when I gave him is first hook
Ever since then he be loving on me diligently
Being all I need a nigga to be
He got me crawling the walls
I never been so quick to come up outta my drawers

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You damn motherfucking right
I fucked that nigga
And I'm a fuck him again
Over and over again
Diligently bitch!
You know why I fucks with him and he fucks with me
'cause I'm fly
Don't me mad that I caught you man's eye
It's the be	 to are-A-T once again from Chi
And it ain't no lie 'cause I fucked him
I fucked your man
Shit bitch we more than friends",Boom

'cause you had me wet boo. 
I couldn't let you get away 'cause then when would i see you again, another day?

Your face was all I needed to see on a daily basis my heart in you're hands would make it all gravy
But i was  mistaken highly, you slid shit right by me bein decietful n hidin keeping secrets but still

Get somebody don tell everybody 'cause somebody gon' try to crash you're party


As much as I miss you I can't get wit you
We painted a perfect picture
But I can see clearly now, the rain is gone 
But tha pain still come on strong

Every so often I get discombobulated
Callin' Miss Cleo to see wat the Tarot Cards are sayin
Hopin' that she kno how to help a bitch out or somethin
Give me you're lucky number then come up those

Mothafuckas I'm not frontin you only get one strike here, you blew it
so i won't be	 right here
The best friend that you claim you eva had is gone and it happened because you played me wrong
Sing tha song for me:

(repeat chorus)

An' now that its over that predicament taught me to be	 a soldier n stay at attention
Fold my colla up an' pop it 
An' keep hollarin at tha rich niggaz wit tha deep pockets that keep me goin shoppin
I'm better now than ever now, you've never found somebody quite like me to stay down
Whateva is meant to be, Ill be	 that n whoeva is sent to me will be	 crashed

Da Brat,"Yo, (ok) kids I was sittin on the block the other day man
Some fine ass girl walked by
And she was lookin, I'm lookin back
She said uh ""JD I love those 20's on your car""
I said I beg your motherfuckin pardon
Them is Michael Jordan's baby
She gotta understand the type of nigga you dealin with
A young, fly, flashy So So Def representer
The biggest thing in the city since Martin Luther the King

Uh, holla at 'em
Brooklyn is what I'm reppin
Disrespect and bullets fly in your direction
Ridin shotgun with JD I got so so connections
Locos and the chrome blows, homie not to mention
I got four homes that I own, I'm certified pimpin
Cross my path, shots blast instant
Extort your ass the kid got henchmens
The whole Brooklyn for instance
Red dot, ruthless, head shots stop you from thinkin
A best seller's what I'm inkin
Another Brooklyn classic, straight acid, keep listenin
Twin Desert Eagles, duck when I'm twistin 'em
Rims spin on sick vehicles, look we killin 'em
Manson and gas my adrenaline, racin fast
Switchin four lanes with weight up in the stash
I'm livin so so better now, the so so dash
is what I'm sittin on, blowin up so so fast

Yeah, uh huh
Yo, You really don't want to get hit
Hot lid when I empty the clip
Drop kid if you droppin your lip
Never know enough about but I talk shit
You must want to eat up my clit
Everything we ever did on is sick
We don't have a party, we rich
We cut it up with anybody we with
And I'm the main one, havin to fit
Can't nobody do it like this
I got a gat by the side like my man Big
Stand out on that song he did with me
You feelin the presence of So So Def
Rest assure we gettin the money
crush your label there's no more left
Just fables fictional characters I
Stay away from those who 
embellish the truth and LIE
I'm kickin the same shit you been 
used to since ""Funkdafied""
Let your mind escape, you laid 
away back and enjoy the RIDE
Yeah, I'm rollin on deuce trays
Shoot all my Tequila straight
Catch me at the bar of the bay
I might even buy you a little drank
We been choppin paper for years
Ain't scared of you niggaz out here
Some of ya'll might think we disappear
But everytime the resurgence is clear

Yo, yo
Brooklyn has to be two of the illest
Felons to be diluted I do whatever, to foot it
Like I want to do it, like I do it
When I done it
PUSSY (PUSSY), roll like caine
Just rhymin with Benz or
 present with the Coupe-a
Drive my lifestyle down
I'm between lines and my new slip
2003, M.O.P. nigga you see
My fundamentals of a street life nigga
Cuffin her hair, have it over left
nothin to fear, BIATCH!
Warriorz! (WARRIORZ), Come out and play!

From the dark side, where we reside, we die for (BK)

We'll get in where we fit in like 
BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK
Still rockin what's poppin, you still lookin shooken

And to the tick-tock ya don't stop
Would ya believe I ain't never left the scene

I could of stayed in your face but I waited in the wings
Patiently 'til the coast was clear, some hoes ain't goin' have no hope this year
When I kill it I murder it dead, sippin' on some remi uh!

Trippin' they whole body, mummy wrapped, up in the cask
Gotta sip through a straw now and piss in they pants

[Chorus: x2]
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am

And it's shockin' I'm the one you mockin'
(Oh yes!)

[Verse 2]
JD, lemme get one of them beats please
DJ this motherfucker while I spit 16
Replay this motherfucker for the radio show
It's all about who you know and I know everybody

You're the receiver, we dealin' for heat
Make you a believer So So technique
The freaks come out at night and it's two in the mornin' so what you gon' do?
I'm at the studio yawnin' JD sayin' I can have company so come on through

Don't you? Love my ? 'cause it rings yo' bell
I'm more tender than a roni and I'm hard as hell
If you ever wonder where I'm goin' - straight up top
And I'm the best from the West of Chi

On my block we gunnin' we runnin' shit til we die we high
I make a nigga so sick to the stomach 'cause I'm fly!

[Chorus: x2]

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh give it to me give it to me
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh sock it to me sock it to me
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh give it to me give it to me
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh sock it to me sock it to me

[Verse 3]
I got the strength to make it through the rainy weather and storms
But I don't got the patience waitin' on the doe to come
I chase it until the job is done
Ain't nothin' basic about me I'm the livest one

I'm on fire, now I see why ya, bitches want to bite me like a vampire
It's just the way that I am, really don't give a damn
From the fat on your back it's a fact that you wack
And you want to be Da Brat

That'll never happen come on! That's suicide
You might as well put your neck in a noose
Take ten vicaden and chase it wit grey goose
Or start your car in the garage with the door down

Sit down and think about where the crown sittin'
It's where it s'posed to be, the dome of the be	 to the are-A-T

Well I don't know what's with all this stress 
Got up in the morning many man a contest 
And so I think 'em 

[Chorus] 
Everybody want the same thing one day 
Everybody want to be number one (x2) 
Rudebwoy you want to be number one 
I'm gonna run it down the line one time  

We in this modern day Babylon with empty palms 
I think about my last dollar while you hollar for these rap songs 
I'm in my Eden when I rap about what I believe in 
No deceivin' Illuminati got that ass thinkin' 

Should I even rap or will I ever blow 
Or should I take the loot I got and call a cab and go 
'Cause now-a-days you can't smile up in your video 
I'm livin' off sour milk and cold cereal 

My moms stated that life is what you make it 
Hold everyday sacred I'm filled with such hatred 
'Cause a lot of niggas in the east don't represent 
And out west I saw a few that was fraudulant 

Hesitant to give a man a pound and step 
'Cause when your songs don't bump 
They look through that ass like fish net 
With no respect how could you look up at the mirror 
The world is lookin' shadey and the futures no clearer 

[Chorus] 

Now as dem rumors done spreadin' I want a single now-a-day 
Everybody want to the king but no man want to work ? 

[Chorus]

It's time to invent the future cause there ain't nobody else 
Who can make it happen right so make it happen for yourself 
Instead of stressin' everything the next man got 
And trying to blow up the next mans' spot 

And always actin' like you got a whole lot 
When the fact is you're trying to be something you're not 
Yo if you don't cut it out you're gone be forgot 
'Cause the madness got to stop 

See life is kinda stressful 
So many twist and turns it's like you walkin' on a pretzel 
Yet and still I swear to build by any means 
Mr. Man and Non Either represent for evil Queens 
And you don't stop

More complicated than life so rappers can not understand it 

Talking that hardcore shit; but I don't buy it 
Sit down eat your slice of pizza and be quiet! 
Cause all that noise you talk is not needed 
I cut headz off at the knees and leave em all defeated 

So stay seated, or get deleted from the program 
Let it be known I don't follow cause I'm my own man 
With my own plan, cause the mind is infinite 
We got four minutes, so everybody get widdit!

One are we in love, a way dem cyan't dub 
They'll find it in a pub, and I said in our club 
Wha-wha-one love (one love) gonna take it, gonna take it 

Gonna take your jeans and your dungarees and it will be on sale 
Things I can try to make you move on the wail 
Aiyyo, no play yo, don't go astray yo

What man is planning to do
Trying to control the world
In the end they lose their soul

Mankind is obsessed with misconceptions, yeah
Still trying to find paradise in their disillusion

I say, life is what you make it some say
But I know that Jah has a role to play
I say, life is what you make it some say
But I know that Jah has a role to play

Some may get weary and down
'Cause they are living without
The teacher and master of all
So one by one they will fall

Until they learn to respect and honor
And work hands and heart with the creator

I say, life is what you make it some say
But I know that Jah has a role to play
Life is what you make it some say
But I know that Jah has a role to play

Life could be easier if we could learn to follow
The footsteps of the Father any way we go

Life is what you make it some say
But I know that Jah has a role to play
Life is what you make it some say
But I know that Jah has a role to play

Who makes the billows roll?
And who keeps the stars in control?
Who makes the sun shine so bright?
Who makes the ant crawl and bite?

Only He, the great one, Alpha and Omega
Is it great and sustain us in this dispensation

Life is what you make it some say
But I know that Jah has a role to play
Life is what you make it some say
But I know that Jah has a role to play

Life is what you make it
What you make it some say
But I know that Jah has a role

Da Lench Mob,"Listen now Blind Baby what we want to go for on this record
Is not just a blues record, but we want a document.
An epic document depicting the struggle of da black people
Against the white devil slave masters

Sittin' at the pad watchin' cops
Trippin' off the pigs keepin' niggaz off the block
But don't let a nigga get got out the ghetto
'Cause you know gettin' caught out the ghetto
Is a motherfuckin' no-no
'Cause you'll meet Mr. Boot, Mr. Feet
Mr. Billyclub and (who?) Mr. Concrete
Face down on the pavement
Keepin' niggaz out of Crackerville, they do it and they love it
But vice verse the kicks
And put the Lench Mob crew, on the other end of the stick
Fee fie foe fum, the niggaz overcome
Everything is numb and it's filmed at eleven
It's like bustin' caps at the bunny
You get a buck buck buck, buck shots in the tummy
They didn't have a fuckin' clue (fuck you!)
Yeah, it's time to get the ankle blues

[Chorus: x2]
He is the epitome of anti-disestablishmentarism
What's your latest hit brother?

We caught the punk pluggin' on our block
He looked like he's armed so I went for my glock
Call up the homies, look like we got one
Lay on the ground paleface, and that's when the fun begun
We beat him down like we were loco
(And said, ""Fuck John Lennon"") (and his punk bitch Yoko)
Steady takin' charge of the neighborhood
We got a nine-eleven call on another fuckin' pecker wood
We rolled up on him and he broke
He looked like he was tryin' to sell some fuckin' dope
Nope, we ain't goin' out like that
That's when I let his ass have it with the gat
Shot him in his back, stopped him in his tracks
He will never sell dope to another fuckin' black
('Cause it's like that)
It's untraced without a clue (fuck you!)
Yeah, his ass caught the ankle blues

[Chorus: x2]

Nigga nigga nigga nigga, nigga damn fool
(Monkey see, monkey do!)
House made nigga's on his way with a fat pay
But the motherfuckers, paid for his doomsday
We laid in the cut for some days
Trippin' off this nigga lookin' like he's in a daze
What do whitey what do whitey really want to know?
The outcome of a sellout, is an Oreo yo
We hung him by his neck til it snapped
That's when my homey woke me up out my nap (wake up 'loc)
Wakin' back up to the signs of reality
Trippin' off the shit that we watchin' on TV
Them motherfuckers think I'm soft (psych)
It's a sign of the Lench Mob settin' it off
It's untraced without a clue
It's the niggaz, that's catchin' the ankle blues!

Give the nigga, give the nigga, give the nigga ROOM
Must be a full moon, here comes a tune
Bullets fly by your head zoom zoom zoom
(A to the K to the 4 to the 7
 Little devils don't go to heaven!
 Last night I shot eleven at the record shop
 Most of 'em dropped when my 9 went pop!)
Damn; see the fuckin cop with the flat-top
standin over niggaz face down on the blacktop
That shit's gotta stop, so I kick the hip-hop
Pop that devil in his ass and make him flip-flop
Flip-flop flip-flop back when I talk back
Now his name is Stucky Mack, tryin to fuck a black
In fact I got the 411, so you can buy a gun
Lench Mob's got the devil on the run, down with King Sun
(And we bring fun to all ages
 Short Dog got the motherfuckin gauges
 Shootin through yellow pages
 That's why whitey want to catch us in cages)
But no no no I don't think so
Shorty joined the nation, and he don't drink no mo'
Show 'em how to eat the lip, and how to beat the shit
out of a devil see a brother he's agreed to give
asalaam alaikum, shake 'em, and whitey can't fake 'em
And if they try F.O.I. will break 'em

[Verse One]
Lord have mercy, the devil he cursed me
I heard you had the cup of life, and I'm thirsty
My niggaz keep fightin for a street, the white man own
So many died, before they got full grown
Plus I got an ingrown toenail
I sit back in the window, and watch all the hoes sell
a lot of ass for a blast (that's right)
Plus my litlte sister is gettin fast
Usin mo' niggaz for financial aid (what?)
They pickin her up from the 10th grade
In a Jeep they try to creep
Takin her ass to Lover's Leap
I admit I'm a sinner (yeah?)
Did what I had to do, just to get dinner
But I was told you was the first G (no shit)
L.A. is a war zone Lord, so could you have mercy

	""You know who the FUCK Jesus is..""

[Verse Two]
I admit, I don't call too often (I know)
I wonder why I don't live in a coffin
Cause I know, a lot of my homeboys pray
but when it was time, they still got sprayed
The grass is greener, in my neighbor's yard
He's white, so his house is barred up
by the windows and the doors
But my moms gotta clean his FUCKIN floors
They won't let us in (that's right)
even if we learn to act just like them (word?)
But if you don't learn you flunk
On a road to sleep, forever on a jail bunk (all day)
But I ain't no punk, and I won't get punked
by the system, so I gotta diss 'em
I was told you was the first G
Somethin ain't right Lord, so could you have mercy

	""You know who the FUCK Jesus is..""

[Verse Three]
I'm dead, so bury me alive (six feet)
under all this bullshit and jive
Cause I know when you made South Central
shitty - it wasn't done intentional
Cause I looked back before the crack
before the macks, in motherfuckin Cadillacs
It was the same old thing
But nowadays, niggaz mo' brainwashed
And I can tell everytime I see
L.A. Compton to Long Beach gangs talk
I wish when my pops got the erection
he woulda used protection
And I wouldn't be a squirrel tryin to get a nut
And I want the nut, just to get some butt
It's like the battle of the sexes
My head spins around like I needed a exorcist
But if you blew up the world today it wouldn't matter
(Nope) just send down a ladder
to the people who had it the worst G

Da Lench Mob,"Woke up, Friday morning feelin' damn good
Took a shower, got dressed, and rolled out to the neighborhood
Had no idea what I was in for
So I pulled over, I bought a forty at the liquor store
Popped the top, commenced to start drinkin'
And all of a sudden, I start thinkin'
""Damn J-Dee, why did you roll down Florence?""
I forgot, I had two warrants (Damn!)
Yeah, but like a fool I kept drivin
Until I ran a red light, and heard a motherfuckin' siren
One time pulled my black ass over
Put my hands behind my back and it was over
I was arrested, because a warrant I wouldn't pay
Headed for the county jail, downtown L.A.
I got processed, put on my county blues
And now I'm smokin' a hump, watchin' the news in the day room
A fool jumped up and said, ""What set you from?""
I didn't say shit, I just bombed
I beat his ass right down into the concrete
Turned around and saw the doom squad's feet
Yeah, the motherfuckin' deputies
Tryin' to do the same thing that they did to Rodney King
I stayed strong and kept my self-control
That's why my black ass got tossed in the hole
I'm doin' thirty days in the hole cause I dissed 'em
That's how it is, gettin' lost in the system

Hey homey, you know the way out this motherfucker?
I'm lost G
Ay, how you, ay, where are we goin'?

Here I go, on a fucked up bus ride
And yo I'm takin' a trip, to a place called Wayside
It's on the back side, of Magic Mountain
And ain't no rides no games no shows and ain't no water fountain
Five, hundred acres of land
Plenty niggaz, and you still your own man
I stayed down, and ran into a few of my homies
They told me, ""Watch your back kid and go for self only""
'Cause I wasn't on the, same side they was on
And like my nigga Cube said, ""Once again it's on"" (Yep!)
'Cause shit erupted on the compound
A C-O dropped a pen, I picked it up and stayed straight down
Until some devil tried to nut up, over the phone
He got stuck and it was on
Gone, to the hole again
For shankin' the devil with my motherfuckin' ink pen
Things gettin' kinda rough and disturbin'
They takin' me to court for this motherfuckin' servin'
Since I'm black and I'm supposed to be wrong
The prosecution wasn't very long
Start stackin' months on me like hotcakes
And in the morning I was headed upstate
For shankin' a fool who'll never be my brother
The simple fact the motherfucker had the wrong skin color
Yo, I told the judge, don't even try it
He gave me a year for startin' a riot
I told this old-ass fool, ""Suck my dick!
Givin' me a year for this shit!""  Yo,
He added on another year, 'cause I dissed him
Now here I go gettin' lost in the system

Yo man I'm just tryin' to get up out this motherfucker man
I'm lost aight?
Which way, how you get back to South Central G?

I went from Chino West, Chino East, Folsum
Soledad, even Tahatcha P-C-R-C
San Quentin, and even Cochran
Lost in the system, and I couldn't stop them
Them motherfuckers kept tryin' to lose me
And some faggot kept tryin' to choose me
Stuffed the faggot and send them on his way kid
You know why? 'Cause I don't play that fuckin' gay shit
The final pen I was in, was called Blythe
And that's where I damn near lost my life
By some crazy devil with eyes full of hate
The motherfucker got mad cause I had a release date
Yo, this shit is crazy, it can happen to anyway
Didn't pay a ticket, look how much time I done
But it's alright cause I'm back on the streets
Layin' down fly rhymes to these funky drum beats
And yeah, the day I got out, man I was wishin'
But I'm back on the streets, still lost in the system

I can do that shit over, no?
'Cause I, I was 'sposed to say
Hey shit, yo I can freak that shit yo",Lost in Tha System

But you still want to jack for my six-two
Impala, it's all about the dollar
You claim you're gonna bust if I holler

Don't say nothin' as I jump out
But why you gotta blast me, before you stomp out?
Start runnin' cause I'm terrified
Two shots from his gat made me realize

You would of let me do if I was a Caucasian
A jew or an asian
But I see you want to do me, do me
Is it cause, I'm black as you be?

Don't talk about a rep to me
Cause deep inside, I know you're white as a deputy
Saw my car and bought a brand new gat
Punk, but who you gon' shoot with that?

I'm fin' to go put in some work man

""I am pleased, to have the opportunity to discuss,
Your new gun with you.""

[J-Dee]
Now it's time to trip
This fool done caught me slippin and he jacked
I'm off to the house to take my pistol and my khakis
Never ever thought I would get, got

So I grabbed the fo'-fo' with the thirteen, shots
Hunted him down, like an animal
Caught his ass slippin' with a skanless hoe
I crept up behind him, put my hands around his mouth

Fo'-fo' to the dome, yo punk we breakin' out
I ducked in the alley of the boulevard
Jumped in the back, trailed by one car
I'm thinkin' to myself I can't kill him he's a brother

Even though he keeps robbin', and stealin' from our mothers
He's lookin' in my eyes, he's gazin' at my gat
And then he said, ""Who you goin' shoot with.."" {*BLAM*}

Da Squad,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Da Youngsta's,"[ VERSE 1: Taji ]
Another day in the hood, I awake from the sound of a gunshot
Pop, pop, pop, who needs a damn alarm clock?
I got a homie out there clocking the white rocks
He carries a hype glock, but he came to a slight stop
He found himself behind bars
Collected more scars, got right out and broke more laws
Some people wonder is it just because he live in the inner city
He want to be a hood like Frank Nitti
Cause when he's rolling the streets he don't care
He'll stick you up for your money and make you strip to your underwear
I know it's kinda pathetic
But where I live at you get used to the sound of the paramedics
Because it's brothers like him all around here
Ain't nowhere to go so you gotta stay down here
Cause if it ain't another brother shot dead
It's a junkie OD-in laying on his death bed
This is the type of thing that I see everyday
Everything is gloomy and grey but what can I say
I'm still surviving cause I'm taking the bad with the good
It's just another day in the hood

[ CHORUS ]
Da hood, da hood, da hood, da hood, da hood
It's just another day in the hood
Da hood, da hood, da hood, da hood, da hood

[ VERSE 2: Qur'an ]
Another day in the hood, a kid is caught in a crossfire
Gunfire lighten the streets like fireworks
Prostitutes sell their body for drugs and loot
Flagging down cars with businessmen in suits
They always come to the hard parts
Filled with the dealers, swindlers, hustlers and car sharks
Gun shell that grabbed lives litter the playground
So tell me, where the little kids gonna play now?
Going to school I gotta walk through the metal detector
Cause too many kids, they pack tools
A lot of kids my age, they want the fast money
Because their moms and pops never had money
Out of nowhere they wearin the hype gear
Don't nobody care to tell the kids to hold it right there
Only your friends wonder where you got the money from
Two years ago you was nothing but a young buck
Now you're rollin with a roughneck troop
Looking for kids to recruit to your roughneck group
They try to tell you that it ain't that hard
You can make mad money selling dope by the school yard
But either way I take the bad with the good
Cause to me it's just another day in the hood

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Tarik ]
Another day in the hood, a man is laying on the ground
But he ain't dead, it's just a homeless man named Fred
Always asking for a quarter and asked me to marry his daughter
So he can get off the cruddy corner
I know this man is really mentally ill, but still
Hard to kill, so I hand him a dollar bill
Cause through the winter and the summer
A fifth of wine on the side keeps the man from goin under
I know some chick named Helen, always beggin and yellin
Begging for money but they gettin nothin
Cause if you give her some cash flow fast
She's going straight across the street to the dopeman to get a blast
This type of thing I see through my young eyes
So I realize I gotta uprise
And stand my ground like a grown man
I seen more drama in the streets than an old man
And I admit it ain't easy
Lookin out my window's like watchin Baretta on TV
Cop car chases, niggaz smackin girls in their faces
And redneck cops that are racist
But either way I take the bad with the good
Cause to me it's just another day in the hood

I'm feeling kinda good cause its good to be alive
The radio is playing (""Its so hard to say goodbye"")
It makes me think of all my homies that died
Pain in my heart frustration in my mind
Is my kind or is man blind
I see my black sister sellin booty in the street
(Do she want to get high?) Or do her kids need to eat
I creep; later along I see more drama
(Oh Lord) What a brother got to do to make a dollar?
Sellin more cain than the little stick up kids

Then again, will he make it when he's older?
Never knew his moms and pop when they were sober
(Project livin ain't nothing to laugh at)
Rat-A-Tat-Tat watch out for the black tech
Which way is out? Is it the gates of hell?
Or a jail cell, or getting a job doin well
I excel I'm just a young brother tryin to make it
I worked too hard for a fool tryin to take it
Livin in the badlands step to bat and
Hurtin the mind now you want to be a bad man

On my block, downtown, and even in my family
ain't no escape like Alcatraz

Dark clouds in the sky turn into rain
I know you wanna cry from the hurt and pain
It's hard to see God in the eye of the hurricane
And so you wanna turn away from this chapter in your life wanna turn the page
It's the hard knock life and the earth's decaying
Trying hard not to murmur and complain
It's easier said than than done with those hunger pangs
You can't even buy your son Burger King
Just got laid off so currently
Trying to make ends meet and that's a further strain
I know you're stressed out gotta learn to pray
So God can give you peace for the burdens laid
Down at his feet where the servants lay
He loves you, so don't turn away
You in the fire, but won't burn in the flame

I know it might feel like a little much
And though deliverance is slow like the little bus
Don't faint stand firm no givin' up
Understand that, God won't give you more than you can bear
Your trials are just little cubs
Big Him, big plan, man little us
I know the season in your life is a little rough
I know you're drinking up strife from the bitter cup
God is painting a picture of
Himself, so it's gotta be beautiful
He's gotta use bright colors and muted tones
Gotta use life's comforts and funerals
I know it hurts, but it helps you to grow

Help us grow. Help us get older.}

Praise God that the Father is forming us
Shaping, making, and conforming us
So at times our pain is to grow us up
Other times my pain is for someone else
Cause death in me is life in you
That's what we see when He died for you
'Cause one man's pain is another's pleasure
Just as one man's trash is another's treasure
'Cause sometimes God will cause the pain
He'll create the fire and the rain
I hear you praying Lord take it all away
But if He won't it's because He knows what it takes
To produce fruit and make his people whole
He knows when pressure is applied to coal
A beautiful diamond is the goal
You're in the fire but you're coming out as pure gold

Right now I hear
But I wanna see
I need you to show me
You bottle my tears
Pain is the key
To making me Holy

See I think it's important for us to have a big picture
Perspective on pain. A lot of times, we see pain as a bad
Thing, trials, suffering, you see it as a bad thing. But when
We look in the scriptures, we see that God prescribes pain.
He doesn't just allow it he causes it sometimes, read
Deuteronomy chapter 8. But it's so necessary, because in it
He conforms us into the image and the likeness of His Son.
So I just wanna encourage the people of God, please understand
That God is using your pain for His own glory.",Pain

That Jesus would make me fall whole

I ain't tryin to be hot just tryin to be relevant
I ain't a candle I ain't trying to wax eloquent
I'm runnin from my life, now I'm tryin to fight hard
These ain't just lyrics but a contrite heart
Yeah, feeling it like the heat in the summer
We know better but the flesh be keeping us running
Back the leeks and onions that's the recent discovered
If it's in the dark it's impossible to keep secrets covered
Who would have known that my indiscretions would reach my cousins
I apologize to Mimi my niece and others
Should have been able to trust but I breached the covenant
I knew you all before you was able to reach the cupboard
Now when I preached in public it's all out the window
Cause sin contradicted a lot of what my pen wrote
Especially when I wrote an open book
Apparently there was something in me I overlooked

They call em nights surprise like Harlem Knights
I need Jesus David's son like a holly Harley bike
Wasn't hardly right what I did was wrong
And it ticks me off and sets me off
And I hate the consequences cause death is
But I know I reap what I sow like Betsy Ross
He ain't tempt me but He let me fall
Now I carry all that pain, sin left me scarred
He let me fall but He ain't let me go
And now I wouldn't stray, sin left me broke
Yeah the life in me ain't no crystal stair
But I keep climbing cause the diamond is crystal clear
At times I'm quiet, I get a chair
Sit and stare think about the ways the sin affected my fiscal year
Yeah the tide is turning now, shifting gears
The weak is given strength in midst of tears

[Chorus]

Felt dead and lonely
Only God knows
That Jesus came to breathe life on my dry bones
I know a lot, knowing a lot's not wrong
But now it's all about application like the iPhone
I got hang-ups like dial tones
Yeah but Jesus hung up and died so
No condemnation, that's my consolation

Am I still guilty? 
Not a conversation
Now I just wanna proclaim it in the congregation
God is good and Doctor Jesus got a lot of patience
I wanna operate and take the heart palpitate
And look at what the bride is shaping
God I thank the body, cause y'all came behind me
When my foot slipped and I sank in the valley
Something supernatural happened when the saints rallied
My true friends held me up like a bank robbery
And that's foolproof, I can't even front like a gold tooth
I hate what I had to go through, 
But I love the fact that I got to know you
So what you are witnessing now is the whole truth

To always want a new love
So we drive into the night
Pass those roadblocks
When I look into your eyes I see deep love
And I'm staring at your face times have been rough
Whenever something's so bright
Hide your new love
We both know that we lied
But still want a brand new love
And we hopelessly try
To be coy enough
Can I welcome your pride
Can I welcome starfreight
Half of most days you love her
And always read between the lines
There's this something
More hard than heavy
The heavenly crime
But there is a brand new love
Like a renegade losing memory
I can't stand it when you hold me
Hate me painfully rising too
That it's only love
Just a brand new love
Fight your love fight your love for me

When I look into your ryes I see deep love
Bet we're never choosing side run to get caught
Whenever something's so bright hide from new love
You've got something to hide
If you still want a brand new love
Every day's a wonder but a miracle week's too long
Try to separate hell from heaven
When you know that they rhyme
But there is a brand new love
Like a renegade losing memory
I can't stand it when you hold me
Hate me painfully rising too that it's only love
Just a brand new love just a brand new love

Fight the love deeper love than you",Love

Don't you get my puzzle wrong
I don't let no reason rule
But I'll protect ya from my truth
Substitute your demons too
Please let me release the peace
I need your keys I'm hooked on you

I don't need ya

By jealousy struck
Outnumbered by hard boiled luck

I was cutting a tree
And turning my jack into lumber
When the hitmen arrived
On a boat from the isle of song
I was shocked by the nude
Identical twins on my lap

Depending on northern refineries
How deep is your fjord
How shallow thy watery eyes
How could I recupe
Surrounded by 95 dogma's
Like a reindeer I'm struck
By Swedish designer drugs
I'm dating the maid
And driving electric wheelchairs
I'm cleaning the fish
With biodegradable pride
I was pulling the strings
While playing the fifteenth violin
In a director's cut
Of Swedish designer drugs
I was hurting a fly
And winning all nobely prizes
I was probably drunk
By the probably best beer around
Like a viking in need

And my drummer really needed a kit
He's really into Bonham and Ozzy
You know he really likes to hit
So we spent our days lookin' at drum ads
'Cause neither one of us had a job
We circles this one cool offer
""Cheap drums ask for Bob""
We jumped into my pinto
And we flew over to his place
We ran up the stairs and knocked on the door
Enter Robert's face
Now ol' Bob was a drummer
He lived with his kit in Glendale
Weddings and bar mitzvahs
He'd do any gig for half-scale
With his five-piece 'slingerland
Silver two-tone glitter
He played her skins like a gentleman
He didn't like to hit her

Like a mime with a megaphone
Like snow comin' down in summer
Like Dr. king with a submachine
Like rock n' roll and Bob the dummer
Bob the drummer

Now he fixed us both some coffee
He let me play his snare
He lied about the good old days
And how he ended up here
We let him go on for hours
Talkin' 'bout one-night stands
He said you gotta pay your dues son
I said I think I understand
He didn't give a crap about the Grateful Dead
Green Day or Pink Floyd
But when he got down behind that set
Old Bob could make some noise

We wondered where the time went
And did I still want to buy some drums
My throat went dry and I felt kinda sick
When I offered him two hundred ones
He said he guessed he wasn't ready to sell her
You never know when there might be a gig
He shot me his best Mona Lisa
And took the last drag off his cig
With his Mr. Rogers sweater
And his velvet Elvis eyes
He stared into oblivion and said

Is there anyone I could have been
To make you feel that way?
Someone to turn into for one last night
Two black birds caught inside of a church
No one to set them free
Except for a window that they'll never find

So look into my eyes and say
The words to me

[Chorus]

So look into my eyes and say
The words to me

[Chorus]

The word I fear
""Goodbye""
Through tears (through tears)
""Goodbye""",Goodbye
Dada,"I turned on my T.V.
Put in a CD
Opened up the morning news
I tuned in the radio
To hear the latest video
A seven second sample of blues

I'm everywhere I wanna be
Nowhere especially
Somewhere in between
I'm faded, and jaded, and way overrated
I read it in a magazine

[Chorus]
Information undertow
Everybody's in the know
I think I'll hide my head up in a cloud
Superstardom overload
I need to get back on the road
Tune it all out, and turn it up too loud
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?

I picked up a new toy
To get me some quick joy
It's got all the whistles and bells
My friends are all jealous
That's what they tell us
So why do I feel like hell?

I lit up my Apple
Surfed through the shrapnel
Accessed my online babe
She reads Aristotle
Says she's a model
But I've never seen her face

[Chorus]

Oh, I can feel the ocean
Oh, it's calling out my name
I'm gonna get all wet
Just as soon as I get
My fifteen minutes of fame

Information undertow
We're dying to be in the know
We better off when our heads were in the clouds
Superstardom overload
We need to get back on the road
Tune it all up, and turn it up too loud
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?
Do people still wave lighters in the crowd?

Dada,"Nostalgia's great, and stories are good
Nothing like an old time coming 'round again
Nostalgia's great, thinking 'bout fate
Wondering how it all could have been

I've been outside, drifting outside
So long; can't start again
I've been outside, living outside
Don't see me walkin' back in

The sun is cruel to a stranger's face
Takes its toll, then fades away
Nights are long, in a lonely place
Darkness shows just where you are now

I've been outside, drifting outside
So long; can't start again
And I've been outside, living outside
Don't see me walkin' back in

I think about you now
And again, my autumn love
I think about you now and again

It moves within the wind
I think about you now and again

Dada,"I could be a Casanova
If I could get out on my own
I'm always tied to someone's finger
I'd like to break that little bone
Be the big man in this small town
Try my hand at being cool
Drink martinis with a virgin
Cash out on the golden rule

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna be lonely
Let it all go to waste
I don't wanna be lonely
Like some playboy in outer space

Make a scene with all the hipsters
Stay out late and never leave
Let it all ride double zero
Is that so hard to believe?
I could even go soul-searching
Try to find my inner-child
Spend my money on some new wheels
Sit back and watch the girls go wild

[Chorus]

Like some playboy in outer space

I could be a Casanova
If I could get out on my own
Get some darlings on the sofa
Make them dinner, make them moan
Lose a few friends in the meanwhile
Win a weekend at the Sands
Take a real chance on losing you
Could you ever understand?

Dada,"Why am I so angry?
Why am I so mad?
Is it my new girlfriend?
Maybe mom and dad

How did I get so pissed off?
So many people have it worse
Is it something in my past life?
Some kind of new age voodoo curse?

[Chorus]
And I'd love to be happy
I forget how it feels
Driving towards somewhere
Instead of spinning my wheels
Spinning my wheels
Spinning my wheels

Where did I get all this tension?
I'm shaking like a leaf
If it's not one thing, it's another
That is my belief

Lost, freaked out and sorry
You know I'm miserable too
My violets are blood red
And my roses are blue

They go 'round, and around, and
Around, and around, and around, and
Around, and around, and around, and
Around, and around, and around, and
Around, and around

And I'd love to be happy
I'd love to find glad
But something inside me
Just wants to stay mad

And I need to start smiling
I forget how that feels
Driving toward somewhere

Hello muddah, hello faddah
Here I am at camp Grenada
Camp is very entertaining
And they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining

I went hiking with Joe Spivey
He developed poison ivy
You remember Leonard Skinner
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner

All the counselors hate the waiters
And the lake has alligators
And the head coach wants no sissies
So he reads to us from something called Ulysses

Now I don't want this should scare ya
But my bunkmate has malaria
You remember Jeffery Hardy
They're about to organize a searching party

Take me home, oh muddah, faddah
Take me home, I hate Grenada
Don't leave me out
In the forest where I might get eaten by a bear

Take me home, I promise I will
Not make noise, or mess the house with other boys
Oh please don't make me stay
I've been here one whole day

Dearest fadduh, darling muddah
How's my precious little bruddah
Let me come home if you miss me
I would even let Aunt Bertha hug and kiss me

Wait a minute, it's stopped hailing
Guys are swimming, guys are sailing
Playing baseball, gee that's bettah

And let me dance along, until the lights are on

You leave me once again home alone
The fridge is full but my heart is achin'
You think I can make it on my own
Just a kiss and you are gone

Another night like a million before
Another party where I'm not invited
As always you'll heat the dance floor
In front of your turntables going mad

Why don't you keep me close to you
I'm not anymore the kid you knew
Why should I stay deep in the blue
I want to move my body too

(Chorus)
Daddy DJ, please take me to the party
And let me dance along, until the lights are on
Daddy DJ, please take me to the party
And let the music play, until the break of day

We've been aside since I meant to be
A part of you that was just awaking
My life with you is a fantasy
I am your prince and you are my king

You say your thing drives sometimes you insane
You think you're no good father and so you're ashamed
But all I want is to share your pain
Clubbin' the night along and having fun

Why don't you keep me close to you
I'm not anymore the kid you knew
I want to feel this part of you
I want to move my body too

I want to share my world with you

It was a day like any other one
I went home like all the other men
Felt cold and deep inside blue
Put music in my ears so I can break through

Around the corner I came across a friend
Was it fate? He took me to his pad
We climbed the stairs to reach the third floor
We rang the bell

You opened up the door I felt that I could die for you
In your eyes I saw more than life could ever take me through

You're the girl in red, please take my hand
I want to share my world with you
You're my girl in red, my candy maid
The only one I feel so true

You're the girl in red
You've let me in, I took a step inside
You smiled at me, I never felt so shy
Your bro' sent you back in your place
I wanted to do nothing but to slap his face

I left your house, it was about three
I couldn't help dreaming of you with me
How tricky love can be at some time

Daddy DJ,"Part 1 

The sun is going down 
Day slowly fades 
Another week has gone 
Slipped away 

Tension's flowing out from you 
Like from a spring 
You free your mind , you free your soul 
The calm sinks in 

You got to let your body talk 

Part 2 

Grab your phone, call some friends 
Ask if they are free to go out 
The whole night 

Step in the shower, have a light dinner 
Dress yourself a way in which you'll feel all right 
Not too tight 

Down in the subway, you watch the people there 
Heading toward the spot where they'll find a rest 
Or romance 

You jump off the train, you cross a traffic jam 
You pass through the club doors where the music is living 
The people are flying, the DJ's ripping 
You got to let your body talk",Let Your Body Talk
Daddy DJ,"Verse 1 
You were born 
Under a July silver moon 
How could I have imagine 
You will be here that soon 

Just a call 
Your daddy`s voice on the line 
Telling me you just arrived 
Feelings rushed, so I wrote them down 

Chorus 

Little Baby Girl, Candy Pearl 
My song is for you 
Count on me as you`ll grow up 
I will always be here for you 

Little Baby Girl, Candy Pearl 
May your life be sweet and true 
I wish you all the best to come 
My lucky star`s on you 

My Little Baby Girl 

Verse 2 
Watch out ! 
Life`s a tricky thing sometimes 
You will love and you will hate 
And often you will fight 

Stay still ! Hold on ! 
Storms will pass if you remain strong 
Just know I will be by your side 
So keep the faith, enjoy the ride",Little Baby Girl
Daddy DJ,"Verse 1 
Thinking of what we lived together 
Of all the things I gave 
You said our love would last forever 
And by the time you left me I was like your slave 

The love I gave you, had driven me so blind 
I was just a doll you played with like a child 
And now that you`re gone, now that you broke our affair 
Don`t count on me to look for you everywhere 

Chorus 
You see 
Without you Baby, I feel so happy 
You see 
And for the first time in my life, I feel like I can be me 

Verse 2 
I trashed my memories of you 
Deep in a distant past 
I moved along exactly as one do 
When blues is tracking you down , you better run fast 

I tried to gather the ruins of my life 
To get the pieces you cut and torn apart 
So if you call me and if I`m not here 
Don`t leave no message nor your number 
`Cause you`re cleared

Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our (my) people's plans
I'll be here for my baby, for my baby I'll be here (near)
So many things I need to tell you, things you need to hear

It was a day like no other
Clocks (hanging off)
It was said they dropped the bomb
And I walked out the door
Feeling lonely, as a ray
Thinking of what was once
So I go in search of people
(Song of) the inhabitants
The air is filled with chemicals
So this is the aftermath
Walking over rubble
Which was once (cause's calf)
Down to the center
Which used to be central

So this is the aftermath

For once, there's someone for he, for she.
For once, there's someone for he, for me.

Jhoole Lal – A saint from Sindh who as a child was always found on a swing reciting the name of God. Shahbaaz Qalander (Red Falcon) another Sufi Fakir renowned for amazing poetry in love for God.

Mera vird hai dam dam Ali Ali – My worship and upon my breath is the name of Ali.
Saqi Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with the beloved Qalander
Jhoole Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with Jhoole Laal who is intoxicated with Qalander
Aakhi Ja Malanga Akhi Ja Malanga – Keep repeating his name you follower of Ali
Tu Ali Ali Ali Akhi Ja Malanga – You Ali !!! Keep saying his name.


These lyrics mirror exactly the name of the Qawwal – to be in intoxication “Mast”.

Lo de ella y lo mío es cosa de pana 
No hay compromiso porque ella es malvada 
Se nota en su cara que la mente trama 
Shaky shaky shaky hasta por la mañana 

Por dentro tiene ella la música 
Y cada video que sube con su movimiento 
Tiene a medio mundo envuelto con una soltura única 
Reduplica deseos que a muchas llena de celo 
A otras les causa desvelo 
Fácil tu mente desubica 
Shaky shaky matadora 
En busca de una encerrona 
Famosita en su Instagram, búscale frikitona 
Provocadora bailando de forma tentadora 
Que no demora y me pregona la demoledora y terremoto, dile Chencho

Tus ojos me hablaron y me lo piden a lo sádico 
Rústicos con ganas de hacer momentos épicos 
Sexo sin palabras con un deseo errático 
Crearon humedad al ver tu movimiento pélvico 
Labia antipoética pa' no verme antipático 
Provocando que no entraras ni en miedo ni en pánico 
Tu lengua de elástico que pida a grito un sátiro 
Que te rompa la ropa y te lo haga pornográfico

Criado en el caserío 
Viendo la pobreza, fumándose 
El hogar hasta el filtro 
Viendo la muerte de sus amigos 
Interrumpiendo en frió 
A los 18 le dieron dos tiros 
Tuvo en intensivo pero el poder 
De Cristo lo mantuvo vivo 
Le dio un talento 
Pa' que triunfe en su destino 
Ya es un joven
Ya es un chico 
Que hace disco, que vendetodas 
Sus prendas pa de oro y platino 
El cangri, a muchos productores 
Se les sube el ego, y sus cantantes creyeron que 
Yankee estaba muerto 
'Y el zorro viejo durmiendo 
Y en su cuarto escriben 
Deje que todos se confiaran 
Y a todos cogí durmiendo 
Y le di un palo de fanáticos a todos lo cantantes 
En el 2001, con Nicky y con todos

Suelen envidiarme

Conozco a mi quieren tirarme 
Se que mi nobre es grande 
Y que tu quires ranquiarte 
Pero este zorro la fama nunca va regalarte 
Espero que peguen y mantengan 
A sus familias 
Y que el publico ya no le suben Finlandia cochina
Ni lo bajen de tarima por sus rimas
What the fuck, Daddy Yankee mi nombre
Son grandes ligas, es el Cangri
Son años de experiencia en esta ciencia
Tumbando los reyes que quieren la corona en mi tierra
Cualquiera, en estos tiempos quiere ser rapero
Y son pocos los que queman al lápiz le sacan fuego
Líricas full, en cinco segundos voy a zumbarte un peine lleno
De letras a lo boing volando tus sesos
Traspasando huesos, dejándolos tiesos
Tanto así que me quieren filmar en mi tan grueso

Ya estamos en el siglo 21
Bien algarete este mundo
Los niños son como adultos
Cualquiera es dueño de un punto
Ya nadie brega los puños
Solo con una cortada mata el asunto
Como mi socio el difunto
Le metía a cualquiera se metía solo en donde fuera
Le gustaban las pepas, le trepaba el super héroe
Y se sentía como el dios de la guerra
Siempre terco envuelto, en palitelco
Decían que era a fuego, otros que era un puerco
Y esto fue una discusión
Y como el era potron amenazo
A un chamaquito y no le metió
Y el otro sanano por miedo busco un cañon
Lo cetio, lo hirió fácil le dio
Subestimo a su enemigo
Como la primera potencia mundial
En el mundo estados unidos
Vino un loco religioso pero astuto
Con un plan perfecto y un pequeño grupo
En nombre de allah lo juro dale un golpe duro
Y sin miedo a morir le dieron al corazón de el mundo
Utilizando 2 aviones
Parecían 2 proyectiles
Cayendo aquellas 2 torres
Dijeron que la tercera guerra mundial a empezado
Se equivocaron el Armageddon no a comenzado
Otros creyeron que los profetizo nostradamus

La señora gobernadora
La primera mujer que en Puerto Rico aquí ha hecho historia
Muchos dijeron que un gobierno corrupto le entregaron
Que fueron muchos los millones que ellos nos robaron
Otros dicen que por Puerto Rico no va hacer nada
Si todavía no arregla los problemas en su casa
Otros dicen que estos son iguales
Que sin dirección están todos los lideres mundiales
Esta ola de maldad no la para nadie
Señales que ya estamos en los tiempos finales
La sangre corre los residenciales
Municipales matan estatales
Los niños crecen con amor a los metales
Y sin amor una mentira a su niño al safakon
Y el amor son es el mas grande poder
Pero fatal cuando se entrega a quien no debe de ser
He visto a los hombres mas mas hábil y poderosos caer
Por la mano hermosa si tu le as dudado a una mujer
Cayo Tami, cayo sansón
Cayo el rey Salomo
Socrates, Adan, también Luis Bigoro
Cayo mi socio con dinero y poder el el mando
Por una gata que se presto pa el tirarle un tranbo

Lo brincaron le dieron fuego ya tu sabe'

Tu no puedes confiar en nadie tu lo sabes

Luego todo el mundo esta matando
Que es lo que se puede hacer en este mundo
Nosotros estamos en el infierno socio a ultima hora
Estamo' en el fuego, esto pa mi si que es el infierno, uh yo')

Entonces tu me dices que lo que hizo Cristo fue en vano
Lo escupieron, lo empujaron lo crucificaron
Para salvarnos si lo aceptamos
Y tu dices que la biblia no nos esta hablando claro
Este es el infierno ardiente, es el crujir de diente
Y te juro que existe vida después de la muerte
Las madres lloran porque este tiempo esta difícil
Pues claro si estamos viviendo el apocalipsis

Un pueblo hora pa' que cristo baje de las nubes
La calle es dura y sobrevive el mas listo

Dicen
Que corazón huh
¿De qué estás hecho?
You know

Si las miradas matarán to el tiempo usará una gavana 
Un cura me acompañará siguiéndome en una caravana 
Si fuera por mis enemigos a la mesa me traerían una víbora 
De carne y vinagre de bebida
Me crucificarán en un acto crudo homicida
Pero se equivocan me levanta mi Dios con salud y vida
Si por el gobierno fuera los raperos no existieran
Nos lanzarán al calabozo y con la pena de muerte nos dieran
Está el que pisotea y el que ayuda al ser humano
Existe el buen amigo que es leal como un hermano
La sangre pesa más que el agua pero mídela bien
Existe sangre sucia fíjate Caín y Abel

Porque hay corazones con envidia
Corazones con ira
Corazones con furia
Situaciones de millones corazones
Con miedo
Corazones sinceros
Corazones guerreros
Corazones traicioneros

Soy de la capital del crimen y en el aire se percibe 
Un espíritu de muerte que devora lo que vive, 
Si fuera por mi reuniría a todos los caseríos 
Proponiendo una tregua en nombre de los que se han ido (sin miedo!)
Yo les diría mi gente yo solo aquí soy un valiente 
Que les pide que no derramen ya la sangre inocente 
Arreglen como hombres y no se fallen mutuamente, 
Pero se que es un sueño perdido como ver a los 3 partidos
Unidos luchando por el bien de Puerto Rico
No ven que es mediocre la educación en los residenciales 
Necesitan más maestros necesitan materiales, 
Para crear mas líderes y menos criminales 
(Hay corazones allí con problemas personales)
Si por mi fuera le daría para atrás al tiempo 
Sanarías las heridas que marcaron todo su cuerpo, 
Paraba las manos de aquel centurión con su lanza 
También en el acto me tendrían que dar matanza 
Lo bajaría de la cruz estando moribundo 
Pero tuvo que morir para salvar al mundo

Porque hay corazones con envidia
Corazones con ira
Corazones con furia
Situaciones de millones corazones
Con miedo
Corazones sinceros
Corazones guerreros
Corazones traicioneros

Es que en el mundo hay corazones que se creen sabios en su propia opinión
Pero cabe su fin porque andan en caminos de perdición,
Hay corazones que no perdonan a sus hermanos
Pero tu sabes que así mismo dios no los perdonara por sus pecados, 
Hay corazones que ayudan sin pedir nada a cambio 
Y por su nobleza encuentran el progreso a diario, 
Hay corazones traicioneros que le gusta engañar a los corazones sinceros 
Pero más vale el segundo que el dinero del mundo entero,
Y existe aquel corazón maligno que nos atormenta como ángeles caidos 
Pero hay un corazón mas poderoso que nos protege 
Que jamás y nunca será vencido
Y el que lo busque y lo encuentre para siempre será bendecido 
Refúgiate en salud y vida

Jugando con mis nieto en una casa de un millón
Duro como coco sin necesidad de bastón (aja!)
Y usted pela'o orinándose en un colchón
Tampoco yo me creo ser la octava maravilla
Ni que soy de hierro, intocable, y con sangre amarilla
No prego no tener la super babilla pero

Son capaces de mandar pero no se saben valer

Todas estas voces siguen jugando con mi mente 
No me dejan dormir tranquilo, estar tranquilo 
Ya no se si es la misma voz de Dios 
O la voz del Diablo jugando conmigo, burlándose 
'toy bien aborrecido qué pasó, pa'?

Sigo algare 
No me importa cuanto enemigo me salen 
Sigo hasta que me cazen 
Saquen rifle, vengan y disparen 
Espero que no fallen 
Porque preso no existe en la calle 
Tu ser la sangre de los enemigos cuando caen 
Corazón del Cangri 
Envuelto en cripi, dale el pali 
Me le meto al party 
Un muerto más se cae, papi 
No tengo panas, ni hermano, ni hermana 
Yo solo doy cara 
Mi hermano es un peine de treinta balas para los guasa 
Mi rebeldía empezó en mi casa 
Sufrían en mi casa 
Y por eso yo me fui de mi casa 
La calle me llama 
Mi padre de mi abusaba 
Como a mi me maltrataron así yo maltrataba 

La conciencia me dice ""Quítate de la calle."" 
Mi corazón de killer dice ""Tira pa' lante."" 
Ya estoy tan loco que no me importa lo que me pase 
Son dos caminos y una sola decisión tu haces 
La conciencia me dice ""Quítate de la calle."" 
Mi corazón de killer dice ""Tira pa' lante."" 
Ya estoy tan loco que no me importa lo que me pase 
Son dos caminos y una sola decisión tu haces 

Sigo algare 
La conciencia dice que enganche los guantes 
Tienes que cuidarte 
Ya son muchos los que quieren darte 
Solo Dios lo sabe, cuanto tiempo tienes pa' salvarte 
Para tu entregarte 
Para que vueles alto como un ángel 
Y el corazón lo siento 
Frío y sin sentimiento 
Desde mi nacimiento 
Tenía el sello puesto 
De que yo iba a ser un duro en esto 
Y las drogas y las pistolas me tienen envuelto 
Dime Dios, Señor yo no escogí este camino 
Me hubiera puesto un buen padre 
Quizá mejor hubiera sido 
Si no, 
QUizá pudiera haber sido aquel chamaquito 
Jugando con to' los niños y 
No jugando con perico 
Ahora vivo en miles guerras 
Ahora vivo en balacera 
Le cogí el gusto a las perras 
Ahora mato to' tus tierras 
Que quieren hacerme daño 
Que quieren sacarme del medio 
Es culpa del Diablo que siempre se para en el medio 
Pero fuerte es tu sangre 
Tu eres el Hijo del Padre 
Espíritu Santo, por favor mándame aquel ángel 
Para que a mi me cuide 
Para yo ya quitarme 
Y ver mi familia crecer 
Verlos adelante 
Amén 

La conciencia me dice ""Quítate de la calle."" 
Mi corazón de killer dice ""Tira pa' lante.""

Visto como quiera, campeo a mi manera 
Dinero en los bolsillos,(el campeón del pueblo) comida en la nevera (hasta me copian un refrán)
Visto como quiera, campeo a mi manera (y asi quieres ser líder)
Desde los 4 puntos cardinales de mi isla entera 

Visto como quiera(filoteao') Campeo a mi manera (bien guillao') 
Dinero en los bolsillos, comida en la nevera (Ta mordio pa')
Visto como quiera(filoteao') Campeo a mi manera (bien guillao') 
Desde los 4 puntos cardinales de mi isla entera

Mi ética es de calle ""a"" 
Eso la calle ""b"" 
Los que hablan mierda como tu 
Son de la calle ""c"" 
Los que me tiran donde estan viviendo 
Cuesta abajo intersección con la cayendo 

Esfuérzate chamaco voy a ti a llegar la meta 
Búscate un combo de líder que te suene las cornetas 
Se tragaran los pitos y las panderetas 
Por que es como ver luchar un tiburón contra un pez beta 
Busca el cubo y la bayeta y un paquete servilleta 
Y sigue ganando te respeto acicalando la bragueta 
esto es sencillo lo mas del bonetillo 
Le falta cojones pa llenar mis calzoncillos 

Visto como quiera, campeo a mi manera 
Dinero en los bolsillos,comida en la nevera 
Visto como quiera, campeo a mi manera 
Desde los 4 puntos cardinales de mi isla entera",Campeo a Mi Manera
Daddy Yankee,"Yo ma', si te calientas conmigo
Yo te hago que la presión te suba
De que vale que estés con él si siempre vives en dudas
Si cuando te beso en el cuello empiezas a sudar
Así que decídete ya

Ven vamonos y sal ya de esa confusión
Perdámonos termina ya lo que empezó

Ven vamonos y sal ya de esa confusión
Perdámonos termina ya lo que empezó

Amor prohibido, besos prohibidos
Tamos compartiendo el mismo aire prohibido
A veces yo pienso que no tiene sentido
Pero cada vez que te veo todo cobra sentido

Para ti no tengo un escatimo en el dinero
Me encanta cuando vamos a las Bahamas de crucero
Pero el tiempo que tenemos se nos hace pasajero
El pasado nos hizo prisioneros

Soy el amante, el que siempre te responde
Soy el amante, el que vive escondido cuando sea
Llega no importa donde

Sacarte de la mente, que con el estarás bien
Conmigo te sientes libre y por eso le eres infiel

Ven vamonos y sal ya de esa confusión
Perdámonos termina ya lo que empezó

Ven vamonos y sal ya de esa confusión
Perdámonos termina ya lo que empezó

Esto es seguro y es peligro
Esto es dulzura y es castigo
Esto se ha vuelto una perdición
Lo que yo empiezo lo termino
Aunque haya fuego en el camino
Como quiera voy de misión

Avanza y vamo' a la villa, ya saque la silla
Mas piña colada viendo como el
Sol tu piel la maquilla
Mi primera dama, no sabe el panorama
Que aquí tu papi se guilla

Huele a sexo, no hay regreso
Una vez que yo me pierda dentro de ti
Soy tu amigo, tu consuelo
Pero nada cambiara cuando salga de aquí

Soy el amante, el que siempre te responde
Soy el amante, el que vive escondido cuando sea
Llega no importa donde

Ven vamonos y sal ya de esa confusión
Perdámonos termina ya lo que empezó

Ven vamonos y sal ya de esa confusión
Perdámonos termina ya lo que empezó

Amor prohibido, besos prohibidos
A veces yo pienso que no tiene sentido
Pero cada vez que te veo cobra sentido

Muy fuerte socio, sin ir al gym
Repartiendo reggaeton de Puerto Rico a Begín

Me meto cuatro pepas pa' romper la discoteca
Yo busco una Lobita con el cuerpo de Atleta
Y como bailas tu así es que me calienta
Pues son sus besos que me saben a Menta
Ando con la real ""El Mago"" por si inventan
Con Kendo Kaponi, Gringo y mi punto 40
Los mato con el cangri el dueño de la Imprenta
Somos los durakos así que paganos la renta
Hemos aprendido a jugar con fuego
Quieren fuego, fuego, fuego caliente les metemos
Sientan la intensidad pa' enviarlos hasta el cielo
Les metemos, le hacemos canto los cesos

Los Lobos!

Abracadabra y dobla el lomo
Te encanta la forma en que yo te sobo

Masacre Musical control de la discoteca
Shorty mano arriba le gusta mi flow de ronco
Quiere más swing tranquila yo se lo pongo
Yo si la perreo, pa' que sienta el tronco
Y me hago el loco, pitcher como Randy Johnson
Un piquete fuerte, homie what you think?
Me creo Will Smith, me dicen el Fresh Prince
Pero se confunde, y te meto el clip
Y cuando ves el flash de la cámara click
El capitán del equipo, young Derek Jeter
Queda con la tolta Alex Rodríguez
A mi no me tocan, me voy por encima

Y yo estoy tan cabrón que de meterme a la cabina 
El Micro y el Protools se trancan
Ella me dice demonio dame duro en la pista
Pa virarme los ojos como el exorcista
Dale rico y con odio, bájala mas lento
Yo llego a la disco me paro en la esquina
Y parece que estoy en el centro
El del momento, tu gato ha visto con cuantos yo entro
Bien fácil que seria mañana sacarlo por noticiero

Sabes que este viaje regresa de día

Ya dímelo, sé que la pasión te sube sube
Pídetelo, no lo piensas más destruye tuye
No baby no, mira como lo sacude cude
Persíguelo, dame más arriba hasta que sude sude

No digas nada amor
Solo la luna sabrá el secreto entre tu y yo
Ni yo tampoco amor
Solo la luna sabrá el secreto entre tu y yo

Deja que tu cuerpo entra en calor
Que a mí me pone fuera de control
Averigua quien tiene el sabor
Aguanta que la noche es de los dos

Yo sé que tú quieres
Yo te llevo al cielo
Seguro que la noche es de los dos
Yo no estoy jugando

No es por darme el guille
Pero siempre gano la partida
Soy mito en navidad
Te doy lo que tú pidas

Soy el sueño de los hombres
Que jamás en tu vida haz visto un chica
Tan sexy y atrevida como yo
Un cuerpo y unas curvas tan calientes como yo
Tan linda muñequita en el ambiente como yo

Oh baby, tú puedes hablar
Pero más más dice lo que puedas hacer

Ya dímelo, sé que la pasión te sube sube

No hay razones pa' volver si no existen
Porque la mentira siempre sale 

Tu no puedes,seguir jugando con mi esperanza 
Hay algo peor que no tener nada 
Y el que alguien te deje en la nada 
Vas si hoy sin rumbo 

La verdad que ya no puedo lidiar con la situación 
Llevo demasiado tiempo no hay una contestación 
Yo me puse en tus zapatos pa'entender tu posición 
Dejando el orgullo libre, y el amor en la prisión 

Tu no puedes,seguir jugando con mi esperanza 
Hay algo peor que no tener nada 
Y el que alguien te deje en a nada 
Vas si hoy sin rumbo 

Esto que construimos,nadie lo va a arruinar 
(nadie bebe) 
Si tu y yo decidimos,por siempre perdurar 
Si el amor toco la puerta 
Solo dale una respuesta 

Esto que construimos,nadie lo va a arruinar 
(nadie bebe)si tu y decidimos,por siempre perdurar 
Si el amor toco la puerta 
Solo dale una respuesta 

Siempre es lo mismo,tu me llevas al cielo 
Me cortas el vuelo,me recojas del suelo 
Y me tiras de nuevo,y yo sigo llamándote 
Parece que vivo engañándome 
Ya entiendo,que en el proceso 
No sanas las heridas, la mente no olvida 
Todas caídas,promesas incumplidas 
Pero sigo esperándote (yeah) 
A mi manera amándote 
Aveces tenemos que derrumbar,para reconstruirnos 
El pasado hay que borrarlo no se puede revivirlo 
Lo que sientas que tengas el mundo en tus 
Hombros,una flor puede renacer de los escombros 

Tu no puedes,seguir jugando con mi esperanza 
Hay algo peor que no tener nada 
Y el que alguien te deje en a nada 
Vas si hoy sin rumbo

Daddy Yankee,"Es Sábado y anda maquilla'
Y con sus amigas se perdió
Cansada de que le estén peleando
Y por eso es que ella se rebeló

Porque si tu no la atiendes
Ella buscará otra cita la-la
Y nosotros que andamos cazando
En la calle entonamos un siendo peliculón-lón-lón

Porque si tu no la atiendes
Ella buscará otra cita la la
Y nosotros que andamos cazando
En la calle entonamos un siendo peliculón-lón-lón

Tu eras aburrido como un Lunes
Y yo la motivo como un Sábado
Ronca como un trueno cuando yo soy el relámpago
Baja la voz, tu la tenias con el mismo pantalón
Y yo la convertí en una modelo de catalogo

Un día en Japón, otro día en las Isla Galápagos
La subí de nivel y tu bajaste con el apagón
Olvídalo, conmigo le diste en el hígado
El Panamera esta perdió pero el mio guialo

No es mi culpa si tu te envuelves yo la penetro como DY
En la jugada de la cama volvemos y le damos replay (aja)
Subelo, bájalo, haz lo que tu quieras pa' que sienta mal
La conexión, terminamos la diversión y nos vamos de compra

Tu solita la marca la nombra
Ahora tus amigas te envidian hasta la sombra
Ella se porta mal, para mi eso esta bien
Los dos estamos ganando yep yep (Daddy yo)

Porque si tu no la atiendes
Ella buscará otra cita la la
Y nosotros que andamos cazando
En la calle entonamos un siendo peliculón-lón-lón

Porque si tu no la atiendes
Ella buscará otra cita la la
Y nosotros que andamos cazando
En la calle entonamos un siendo peliculón-lón-lón

No me eches la culpa si yo
Tengo mas gatitas que tu
Por en cima se le nota el flow
Que quiere que le de capicú

Se tranca el juego
Perdiste lo dejaste pa' luego
Ella busca alguien que la atienda
Que la comprenda y la saque sin peros

Yo le doy jangueo, partyseo baby con mucho botelleo
No la galdeo, no saco la sigo
Tampoco lo hacemos yo la baqueo

Sin bocone'o nunca le he frontea'o
No sabe que tengo el banco vira'o
Andamos cazando pelicula'o
En primera fila espacio reservao

Si nota un cambio es que no te ha llama'o
Cuando la textea nunca ha contesta'o
Es que te ha picha'o, te fuiste en foul
Sigue tu ruta que tu eres un queda'o

Ella te advirtió y tu la has ignora'o
Lo tuyo paso tu tiempo se agota'o
Yo supe darle lo que tu no le has da'o
No me eches la culpa que te haya deja'o

Porque si tu no la atiendes
Ella buscará otra cita la la
Y nosotros que andamos cazando
En la calle entonamos un siendo peliculón-lón-lón

Porque si tu no la atiendes
Ella buscará otra cita la la
Y nosotros que andamos cazando
En la calle entonamos un siendo peliculón-lón-lón

Et j'te donne le son dompte le son
Sans donner d'leçon, flingue le son
C'est pour mes loups dans l'fond
Je pousse pas je rap sans forcer au fond j'm'en bas
Je dois élever ma fille, mais le rap a besoin de moins
Je pousse mes consones pour mes saloperies de voyelles
Si le rap c'est tendance levez vos strings pucelle
Je suis de l'école des tordus des mordus t'entend
Mic branché je suis de l'école des macros d'argent
J'ai déjà rappé pour pas trop d'argent mais entre toi et moi
Je préfère rapper pour beaucoup d'argent
Sujet tabou sensation extrême née pour mourir libre
Doigt en l'air pour le système
Monte le son du système suis ma voie dans le système
Dad connaît le système si tu critiques c'est que t aime
Ce que j'aime les bonnes choses pas les putes qui te causes
Après trois séries de verres te postillonnent la rue la cause

Mais toi t'en a pas pour deux ans
Après six et quatre albums je les revoie me glissant
Je viens de monter une écurie aide moi si t'as le temps
J'ai du respect pour les catholiques pas pour le pape
Je rap pour ce putain de public pas pour le rap
Ce milieu de crapule qui sent l'esbrouff à plein nez
C'est pas les groupies ou les disques d'or qui me feront planer
Au bandit plein de tchach je préfère le maçon
Style d'homme silencieux qui fait le monde avec sa transpiration
Les choses les plus simples sont souvent mon inspiration
J'aime quand les hommes sont des hommes à toute leur respiration
Certain m'y encourage d'autre me foute la rage
J'ai toujours sourit sous les coup v'la ce qui les décourage
Je suis le même à toute les pages
La simplicité ouvre la porte de toutes les cages
Toi tu dis blah blah blah blah blah
Moi je fais quoi quoi quoi
Et j'te donne le son dompte le son
Sans donner d'leçon, flingue le son
C'est pour mes loups dans l'fond
Tu vois, moi j'aime les gens et j ai rien à prouver
Tu peux creuser sous ma terre y'a que des racines à trouver
J'impose le respect parce que je donne un respect
Avec moi reste paix ou je te pisse à la raie
C'est pour mes petits loups dans les quartiers
C'est même pour les jeunes et les bouzeux dans le monde entier
C'est pour les frères sur le chantier
Ceux qui la bac au cul on ressortit le bep pour le btp
C'est pour les frais et les complètements Peter
Si t'as pas de respect tu peux raccrocher complet
J'ai du respect pour les respectueux pas pour les dangereux
Y aura toujours plus dangereux si tu veux jouer dans le feu
C'est pas du rap de rue ni de bandit
C'est le rap d'un homme qui te parle comme un ami
En faisant n'importe quoi on reste n'importe qui
Fais ce que t'as à faire et peu importe vie

Now there are many a day I sit and I think.
About all that fucking crazy shit.
And all them times we should called it quits.
But instead we just keep ramblin’ on and on.

You just an old drunken, iron-luggin' fool, Jim. 
You just an old drunken, Irish-fightin' fool. 
And you singing every step along the way to the grave
Them old drunken iron-luggin' blues.

Well I see you now, Jimmy, 10 floors up.
Lugging number 9s until 5:00 o’clock.
When the day is though, you head down the block.
To the nearest bar, and you order up a tall glass of booze.

While you’re sitting there, Jimmy, withering away.
Drinking that booze till the break of day.
I’ll be somewhere so very far away.
But not so far where I can’t find my way back home.

Because Lowell is where the family’s at.
It’s the place you know you’re gonna always head back.
Once or twice, maybe three time a year.
Don’t shed no tear for me, sweet lady, I’m home today.

So won’t you raise your glasses to that man. 
Let’s take this time, we’re gonna make a stand.
I know he’s right here, listening.
He’s just sittin’ at the bar, drinking Beam… Jim Beam!

You just an old drunken, iron-luggin' fool, Jim. 
You just an old drunken, Irish-fightin' fool. 
And you singin’ every step along the way to the grave
Them old drunken iron-luggin' blues.
Yeah, I'm talking about them old.
Them old.
Them dunken iron.

Daemon Chili,"I come from the great city of Lowell.
I got the Boott Mill Flavor kickin’ in my soul.
From Arthur’s Paradise Diner.
There ain’t no breakfast sandwich finer.

Well I wake up in the morning with the sunny shine.
I got a Boott Mill Sandwich weighing heavy on my mind.
That’s when I head out the door.
Cross the street, and I’m home.

I remember the days when I was a younger man.
Skippin’ school was the only plan.
That’s why I never understood.
And I never-ever done what I should.

Everybody call it “Arthur’s By The Sea.” 
I guess it’s ‘cause of all them ole canals round here.
Well call it what you will.
It’s the home of the one and the only Boott Mill.

Well Dottie say, “I take your order now, please.”
I say, “Gimmie a sausage Boott and make it extra cheese.”
‘Cause I like it like that, and when you’re young,you swear you never gonna get fat.

Well the first time I saw a Boott I was awfully suspicious.
But Arthur hooked it up and it was mighty delicious.
I remember the days when triple-meat Bootts were the craze.

Grab a bacon Boott to go and then you head on out the door.
You come back tomorrow for just one more.
I eat ‘em two at a time, Lord knows, it’s a victimless crime.

Now the people they come from all around.
For the sandwich that put this map on the town.
Now before you hit the road, I suggest that you head on down.
Before you hit the road, I suggest you head on down, sweet lady.
And get yourself some Boott Mill Flavor before you head out of town!",The Boott Mill Flavor

She got a face carved in stone

Then she’ll leave you all alone,

She gonna leave you for another man
But you don’t understand,
Why she’ll treat you so unkind
Because you need that devil woman,
And you just can’t seem to get her out your mind

You know I’d have you as my queen
And we’d roll around all night long,

My life has been so full of sin,
Ever since you been gone 

I wish I had me all the gold in the world
You know I’d buy you just about anything
And we’d be together, happy forever,

I had an aching split in my head

Daemon Chili,"Now we’ve all heard the story of Helen of Troy,
Kidnapped by Paris, such a foolish boy.
But the Mycenaean King was quick to apprehend,
Calling down an oath to solemnly defend.

Upon the great blue sea,
A thousand ships are sailing unto thee.
And I do, I do, oh I do decree:
When all is said and done, you will surely weep.
You’ll surely weep.

Helen was her name and a Spartan she became,
Queen to Menelaus upon which he laid his claim.
He looked her dead in the eye and tied her to his hip,
He said, “If you ever leave me, I’ll launch a thousand ships.”

Upon the great blue sea,
If you should ever run away from me.
And I do, I do, oh I do decree:
No one will have you if not but for me.
If not but for me.


He was destined from his birth to bring about the fall of Troy,
The young Prince Paris devised a wicked ploy.
He sailed across the ocean and stole Helen from Greece.
He said, “This will be the last day I ever know of peace.”

Upon the great blue sea,
No matter what they say this love was meant to be.
And I do, I do, oh I do decree:
It’s better to have loved and lost than never to receive. 
Never to receive.

Now once upon a time traveling through a foreign land,
I spied a pretty girl, and she took me by the hand.
She led me to the cliffs, and I could hear the ocean roar.
She revealed to me the secrets of old forgotten lore.
She sat by my side, and she spoke to me in rhyme,
Reading from the pages deep within her mind.
And I will remember this day for the rest of my life,
Oh my sweet bride-to-be, now become my darling wife.

Upon the great blue sea,
T’was there I asked her to marry me.
She said, “I do, I do, I do decree:”
She said, “I will marry you upon the great blue sea.”

Daemon Chili,"Now I'll tell you a tale of a life gone wrong
About a man who never gonna find his way
He roamed from town to town, made his bed upon the ground
And in the end you know he lost his way

Lost his way
In the end you know he lost his way
Yes, he lost his way
In the end you know he lost his way

Just a little biddy boy, no more than 5 years old
First time I ran away from my home 
Spent the whole night outside, so cold I nearly died
And in the morning I was all alone 

I was all alone
In the morning he was all alone
Yes, I was all alone
In the morning he was all alone

I met a pretty girl when I was living on the road
She told me she’s never-ever leave 
I believed all them lies, and now her I do despise
And there was nowhere else that I would rather be

But on my way
He was wishing he was on his way 
Yeah, I was on my way
On his way back home

Well I’m old and fat and grey, and I’m walking with a cane 
My heart’s a-growing weaker every day 
I’m thinking about my life and all my mistakes
And why I never made my way back home 

My way back home
He never made his way back home
Oh my way back home
He should have made his way back home",Lost
Daemon Chili,"Now on the day I was born from my mama's belly torn, an angry sea did roar.
Old Poseidon knew, full-well, that a captain had been born, a captain brave as hell. 
I got bones made of coral, salt water in my veins, and a tidal wave of hope.
And when I stole Poseidon's trident there was nothing he could do except curse my world in storm.
  
Here I am, once again, 
At the mercy of the sea.
All my life, all my light,
You just keep on coming back to me.

I spent nearly all my days on this old, wooden boat drifting to-and-fro about the sea. 
And I’ve seen so much heartache I don’t care to remember and that’s why I can’t forget. 
I’ve wrestled 20 ft. swells. They tried to take me back to Hell, but not a one has prevailed.
And how that sweet little girl with the green-brown eyes, oh how she can take me there at will. 

Here I am, once again, 
At the mercy of the sea.
All my life, all my light,
You just keep on coming back to me.

Like any other sailor man that’s ever been to port, a shot of booze and a whole lot of love. 
I found myself in Philly on December, 28th, nearly 4 long years ago. 
T’was a night I remember, to never-soon forget, as the first time I ever held your hand.
I’ve made love to countless mermaids and all the Sirens too, and it’s strange how none compare to you.  

Here I am, once again, 
At the mercy of the sea.
All my life, all my light,
You just keep on coming back to me.",Mercy of the Sea

Daevid Allen,"I met a man a wise old man
The day I lost my pride
He told me he belonged to me
But from me he would hide
But that I would not hear his voice
Until I learned to sing
Now every time I sing I know that I belong to him

Singing Oh why
Singing Oh why

He told me he would teach me everything I tried to know
He made me see that you and me are dreamers in a show
And when the days were darkest then
He lit them with his moon
And then we crossed the rainbow bridge
And we came back too soon

Singing Oh why
Singing Oh why

He showed me where he was Atman
That man I could not see
He pointed to the sky until
A ladder I could see
I climbed for many lives to find the secret golden
Flower
But then I woke and found I'd slept for less than half an
Hour

Where is your wise man?
How is the wise man?
Who is this wise man?
Who is this wise man?

He brought us all together then
When I was all alone

To watch you slowly die
So watch me walking out the door""

Got a little bar work
He went to the buttery

Then he wrote a letter
Said, ""I want to see you""

In the pouring rain
On Olympic to her door

He came in on a Sunday

Walking in slow motion
Like he'd just been hit

And for a short while time seems to stand still
Ain't nothing like peace of mind when secluded
I'd rather that
Than being fitted and suited

But when you're rich you got problems and different glitches

But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

Tried to forget until I hit the bottom

Daft Punk,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Face to Face/Short Circuit
Daft Punk,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide",One More Time/Aerodynamic

Beyond dreams
Beyond life
You will find your song
Before sounds to be found

Close your eyes and rise
Higher still endless thrill
To the lend of love beyond love
Come alive and you'll find forever watching you alive

You are the night you are the ocean
You are the light behind the cloud
You are the end and the beginning

A world with time is not allowed
There's no such thing as complication
To find a way we'll lost control
Remember love's our only mission
This is the journey of the soul

The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
You hold your promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams",Beyond

Daft Punk,"Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine",Fragments of Time

Daft Punk,"When I was fifteen, sixteen when I started really to play the guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because the dream was so big
I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town, I was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became I musician
I thought ""well I may have a bit of a chance""
Because all I every wanted to do is music but not only play music
But compose music

At that time, in Germany, in 1969-70, they already had discotheques
So I would take my car and go to a discotheque and sing maybe 30 minutes
I think I had about 7-8 songs. I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that help me for about almost 2 years to survive
In the beginning, I wanted to do a album with the sound of the 50s,
The sound of the 60s, of the 70s and then have a sound of the future
And I said: ""Wait a second
I know the synthesizer, why don't I use the synthesizer
Which is the sound of the future""
And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click
So we put a click on the 24 track which was then synch to the moog modular
I knew that it could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much impact it would be

My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio

You want to free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct,
You can do whatever you want
So nobody told me what to do, and there was no preconception of what to do",Giorgio by Moroder

Daft Punk,"I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
Let's run with it because it's all we can take
One thing I'd never see, the same way around
I don't believe it and it slips from the ground
I want to take you to that place near the rush
But no one gives us any time anymore
You used me once [?]
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kissin' in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

Listen to you brother, and listen to me
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend

Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
I saw my memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs the scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars
Hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore

Listen to you brother, and listen to me
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again

It's all I do when I'm with you

Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see

A tourist in a dream
A visitor it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss, suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?

A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Hold on
If love is the answer you hold

Touch, sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real
I need something more",Touch
