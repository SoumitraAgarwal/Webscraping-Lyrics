Ray Price,"Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms, sweet darling, and stay?
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh why, do you want to do me this way?

How long do you think I can wait
When you know you're always late?",Always Late [*]
Ray Price,"My world is like a river as dark as it is deep
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories
Sweet memories
Sweet memories, hmm

She slipped into the silence of my dreams last night
Wondering from room to room turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
And I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories
Sweet memories
Sweet memories, hmm",Sweet Memories
Ray Price,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me
Ray Price,"Everybody loves somebody, sometime
Everybody falls in love, somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody, someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
""My someplace is here""

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I've found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody, sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

Everybody loves somebody, sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you",Everybody Loves Somebody
Ray Price,"We've been sweethearts for so long
Now you say we're through
The love we shared is just a memory
Well I had built a ship of dreams
And planned them all for you
Now I guess what is to be will be.

So I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue
I'll sail my ship alone
Tho' all the sails are torn
And when it starts to sink then I'll blame you.

I gave a message to the wind
To take back home to you
Hoping you would hear my S-O-S
Hoping that you would come back home
My darling if you knew
Just how much my heart was in distress.

So I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue
I'll sail my ship alone
Tho' all the sails are torn
And when it starts to sink then I'll blame you",I'll Sail My Ship Alone [*]
Ray Price,"The old hometown looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa

And down the road I look
And there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they've all come to meet me, arms a-reached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green, green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

And down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At these four gray walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
But there's a guard and there's that sad old padre
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak

And again I'll touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green, green grass of home
",Green Green Grass of Home
Ray Price,"I said goodbye to you this morning with only these words to explain
I said I've found someone I love better but I still hear your voice call my name
I thought I heard you calling my name funny I still feel this way
Your voice seemed so close but I knew that by now you were many miles away

I walk through the streets of the city people passing by think it's so strange
I'm talking but there's no one beside me I thought I heard you calling my name
I thought I heard you",I Thought I Heard You Calling My Name
Ray Price,"So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
Just gather round me cause misery loves a company
I've just left my home friends where I couldn't sleep
For missin' a woman that I couldn't keep

She just walked out and left me for somebody else
Now her memory keeps hauntin' me when I'm by myself
So break out the bottle bring on the crowd

Tell funny stories turn the jukebox up loud
Come on sit at my table where the drinks are on me
Just gather round me cause misery loves company

Now I'm not the first one who's lost everything
To a false hearted woman with a false hearted dream
But this is the first time I've suffered myself

Help me get over this love 
I'll get over next love all by myself
So break out the bottle",Misery Loves Company

Ray Price,"The sun just went behind a cloud
There's darkness all around me now
For I've just destroyed the world I'm livin' in
I broke her heart so many times
That now at last I've broken mine
And I've just destroyed the world I'm livin' in

What made me think that I could go on hurting her
I should have known there'd have to be an end
But fools in love are taught by fate,
They never learn till it's too late
And I've just destroyed the world I'm livin' in
[Repeat]",I've Just Destroyed the World
Ray Price,"Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on

Take these chains from my heart and set me free

Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new let me find a new love too

Take these chains from my heart and set me free

Give my heart just a word of sympathy be
As fair to my heart as you can be
Then if you no longer care for the love that's beating there

Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

","If You're Ever Lonely, Darling"
Ray Price,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have

If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times 
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied",Always on My Mind
Ray Price,"The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
No-one could change my mind but Mama tried
One and only rebel child
From a family, meek and mild
My Mama seemed to know what lay in store  
Despite my Sunday learning
Towards the bad, I kept turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

And I turned twenty-one in prion doing life without parole
No-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried

Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my Mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes.
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried",Mama Tried

Ray Price,"We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street

A place where even squares can have a ball

And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all

Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus

Ray Price,"Living on the road my friend,
Was gonna keep you free and clean.
Now you wear your skin like iron,
Your breath as hard as kerosene.
You weren't your mama's only boy,
But her favorite one it seems.
She began to cry when you said goodbye,
And sank into your dreams.

Pancho was a bandit boy,
His horse was fast as polished steel.
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel.
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico,
Nobody heard his dying words,
Ah but that's the way it goes.

All the Federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose.

Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to.
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth.
The day they laid poor Pancho low,
Lefty split for Ohio.
Where he got the bread to go,
There ain't nobody knows.

All the Federales say
We could have had him any day.
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose.

The poets tell how Pancho fell,
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold,
And so the story ends we're told.
Pancho needs your prayers it's true,
But save a few for Lefty too.
He only did what he had to do,
And now he's growing old.

All the Federales say
We could have had him any day.
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose.

A few gray Federales say
We could have had him any day
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose.",Pancho and Lefty

Ray Price,"Tonight in a barroom I'm sitting apart from the laughter and cheer
The scenes of my life past before me while watching the bubbles in my beer
A vision of someone who loved me brings along silent tear to my eye
I know that my life's been a failure just watching the bubbles in my beer

I'm seeing the road that I've traveled a road paved with heartaches and tears
I'm seeing the past that I've wasted while watching the bubbles in my beer
I think of the heart that I've broken and the golden chances that have passed me by
The dreams I've once made now are over as empty as the bubbles in my beer",Bubbles in My Beer
Ray Price,"A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabaretes and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights

Lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
The God who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights
Oh it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights

Lights that say forget her love in a different athmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights",City Lights [Take 3]

The best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day
To make it better as it goes

Ray Saporita,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what you're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one that I'd never switch

Ray Scott,"There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean 
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine
 
There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine

Ray Scott,"

You can lay right here beside me, like there ain?t nothing wrong,

Kill the light and say goodnight and turn the TV off,

Act as if I don?t know what it is that you can't find the words to say,

Aw baby you can leave or you can stay,

You?re gone either way


We can share the bed and share the rent but this house ain?t a home,

And if I?m gonna be lonely I?d just assume be alone,

How can you say you love me when you can?t even look me in the face,

Stay right here and disappear without a trace,

You?re gone either way


I don?t need the hurt from hangin? on to someone who?s got one foot out the door

And I can?t waste another minute of my love if you don?t love me anymore,

No, no, no


Naw, don?t need the hurt from hangin? on to someone who?s got one foot out the door,

I can?t waste another minute of my love if you don?t love me anymore


Don?t know why you sit here with me, we both know the truth,

You just worry ?bout what leavin? me would make people think of you,

It don?t matter what your mamma or your daddy or your preacher?s got to say,

Girl you can hit that door or waste another day,

What kind of difference would it make,

You?re gone either way,

Girl you?re gone either way,

So just get on.


",Gone Either Way
Ray Scott,"My poor Mom was in labor 12 hours 
And I was born around 6:00 AM
For the time it took her to bring me in this world, 
You'd've thought the girl was gonna have twins
I'd be a day older if that doctor hadn't told her 
I'd be better off if I came late
She said fine and that gave him plenty of time 
To get in 18 holes that day

[Chorus]
Yeah time, time, everything takes time
From grabbin' hold of life to turnin' it loose
And in the time that went by while I sang you those lines
We all lost a minute or two

There's a 15 year old ridin' shotgun down the road, 
He can't wait to get behind the wheel
And a grandma in the kitchen washin' dishes 
And wishin' she still knew how 16 feels
Every year we get older, all the months seem shorter, 
Kinda like weeks, weeks seem like days
Yeah, the hours fly by when you're havin' a good time, 
But they don't stand still when you ain't

[Chorus]

Time only moves forward every minute leanin' towards that day
Our hair is gone or gray
We all make it and we use it, we waste it and abuse it
While the clock just laughs in our face

[Chorus]

Yeah time, time, we got nothin' but time
And there ain't a dad-gum thing about it we can do
And in the time that went by while I sang you those lines
We lost another minute or two
So, let's not lose another minute or two",Time
Ray Scott,"She said good-bye and it's like she fell right off this earth
Six long nights, I ain't seen hide nor hair of her
And this old Laz-E-Boy, is feelin' like my only friend
There's sunshine shinin' on the world outside, but there ain't none shinin' in

[Chorus]
Startin' now, somehow
I've gotta leave her in my past
Walk this floor right out that door
Before these walls start talkin' back

And I bet the neighbors think either I've skipped town or I've bought the farm
I got my shades pulled down and there's a week's worth of papers in my yard
Hey, what was that, did I just hear somebody call my name
Oh, Lord knows I'm just a few thoughts shy of bein' certified insane

[Chorus: x2]",Walls
Ray Sherman,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Ray Sherman,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,

Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo

What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!

Ray Sherman,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Ray Sherman,"I'm thru with love,
I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.

Ray Smith,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee

And if you took the petals
And you took them all apart

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Ray Stevens,"In seclusion for what seemed like the longest time. 
It occurred to me I'm not the way I want to be. 
Separated from the one I belong to. 
Made a hole inside my heart. 
Wide enough to tear apart.

and I'll throw in a hug or two for all the love I made you miss. 
Won't you, gimme a smile {gimme a smile} and I'll give you my soul. 
And I'll tell you a hundred ""I love you's"" everyday we're growing older.

Lost the treasure I never knew I had. 
Failed in all I tried, had no feeling left inside.

I once knew and my arms surrounding you.

Ray Stevens,"Well, a strange thing happened the other night
You won't believe it, but I swear it's true
Harry the hairy ape made his escape from the city zoo
& under cover of darkness he made his way
To the middle of the municipal park
& he hid in the bushes & waited for somebody to come
Walkin' along by hi'self in the dark
Then along come somebody not suspectin' nothin'
Harry jump out of the bushes all of a sudden
Beat on his chest (sound effect of this action)
Jump up & down & he say:
Wooo-hoo-hee-hee-hoo-hoo...
Which is Harry-Ape talk for ""Boo, I betcha I scared you, ha ha!""

Waaa!  Scared that poor cat so bad his eyes bugged out, his hair turned white!
He ran off through the municipal park, screamin', hollerin', diggin' up the lawn,
  tearin' up the shrub & knock down the ""Keep off the grass"" sign, run through the
  hurricane fence, fell into the municipal park swimming pool & drowned hi'self!  Woo
  hoo!

Well, Harry thought this was the funniest thing that he had ever seen
& he laughed ""Ha ha,"" jumped back in the bushes & got ready to do it again
The next guy to come along was the near-sighted local DJ
Just boppin' down the sidewalk on his way to work with a box of records on his arm
  that he was gonna play
So here he come, not suspectin' nothin'
Harry jump out of the bushes all of a sudden
Beat on his chest (sound effect of this action)
Jump up & down & he say:
Wooo-hoo-hee-hee-hoo-hoo...
Which is Harry-Ape talk for ""Smile, you're on candid camera!""

Man, that DJ was so near-sighted he thought Harry was a rock 'n' roll singer!
So he gave him the old glad hand, smiled, slapped him on the back, sayin',
""Don't worry, baby, I'm gonna play the record 'cause you're too cool, too cool, too
cool!"" & he said bye, bopped on off down the sidewalk; every 4 or 5 steps he'd stop &
turn around,
  doin' a little boogaloo-shing-a-ling!
Well, this really shook Harry up, I mean it blew his whole bit, you know, ruined his
whole day So he run back to his cage as fast as he can go, jump up on his little swing,
put both hands
  over his eyes & didn't look for 3 hours & 45 minutes.  But that's not the end of the
  story
Here's what happened:

The DJ played Harry's record (What record?) Shut up!
It was a hit and he became a star
Got him some tight britches, got him a manager
Went on a promotion tour, combed his hair back & took up playin' the guitar
& every Sunday afternoon you can go see Harry at the zoo
& the girls will scream & he'll sit on his swing & pick & sing his hit record for you

Ray Stevens,"Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still,

But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning round.

Well on his way, head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning round.

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning round.

Oh, oh, oh
Round 'n round 'n round
'n round 'n round

And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Ray Stevens,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound

And I said I didn't like the way he got things done

The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me

Ray Stevens,"(intro: Arabian flute)

Let me tell you about Ahab the Arab
The sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just drippin' off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hand
He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And, every evenin', about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde, and ride

[Spoken] Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he
would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils,
swingingest grade ""A"" number one US choice dancer in
the sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had
a thing goin', you know, and they'd been carryin' on
for some time now behind the sultan's back and you
could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the
dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert
air and he'd say (imitate Arabic speech and finish with ""Sold! American)
which is Arabic for, ""Stop, Clyde!"" and Clyde'd say, (imitate camel
sound), which is camel for, ""What the heck did he say anyway?""

Well, he brought that camel to a screechin' halt (verbal screeching sound)
In the rear of Fatima's tent
Jumped off Clyde, snuck around the corner
And into the tent he went.
There he saw Fatima layin' on a zebra skin rug
With
[Spoken in falsetto and possibly with female backups] ""Rings on her fingers and
bells on her toes and a bone in her nose ho, ho.""

[Spoken]   There she was, friends, lyin' there in all her radiant
beauty, eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate,
bowl of chittlin's, two bananas, three Hershey bars,
sipping on a RC co-cola listenin' to her transistor,
watchin' the Grand Ole Opry on the tube, readin' a Mad
magazine while she sung, ""Does your chewing gum lose
it's flavor?"" Yeah, Ahab walked up to her and he say,
(imitate Arabic speech), which is Arabic for ""Let's twist
again like we did last summer, baby.!!""  Ha, ha, ha!!
You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug,
give him one of the sly looks,

She said (suggestive giggles, then outright laughter) ""Crazy, crazy, crazy baby!""

This widow had a grown-up daughter
Who had hair of red

This made my dad my son-in-law
And really changed my life

I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle, though it made me very sad

And he became my grandchild, for he was my daughter's son

And he only had just one thought on his brain
Every evening about midnight he'd sneak off alone
And call the same lady on a pay telephone

'It's me again, Margaret
Hello, is this Margaret?
You don't know me, Margaret, but I know you.'

Well, this upset the lady and it gave her the blues
So she called up the police, said 'What shall I do?'
The chief of detectives came round to her home
And eavesdropped upon them on her upstairs phone

'It's me again, Margaret
Hello, is this Margaret?
Margaret, I know it's you, Margaret
Are you naked?

Well, they called up Ma Bell and they traced him on down
To a funky old phone booth on the outskirts of town
It was there that the vice squad with their field glasses read
The lips of that amorous man as he said

'It's me again, Margaret
Hello? Is this is this Margaret?
I know it's you, Margaret
I bet you can't guess what I'm doing '

Well, they cuffed him and dragged him to the station downtown
And they allowed him one phone call 'fore the jailer came round
He wet his chapped lips and he cleared his young throat
Then he dialed the telephone and softly he spoke

'It's me again, Margaret
They got me, Margaret
You ain't going to miss me, Margaret, I know that
But I'll miss you

And when I get out, Margaret
I'm going to come over there with an egg beater
And a live chicken, and some peach preserves
We'll have a good old time, Marga

Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Lived the king of the Royal Mountie Fuzz
Sergeant Preston was his name
King his dog's name was

He had a big red coat and a big black boots
And a whistle on a chain
All of the crooks ran for cover
'Cause he always got his man

He said, ""I own King, I own you great husky""
And that great husky said, ""Aooo, ohh""
And he said, ""Must all y'all huskies,"" all them huskies say
""Aooo, ohh""

Killed off all five Eskimos
And a made his getaway

""He won't get past"", says Sergeant Preston
""I got my trusty dog""
""I'll track him down and a bring him back
He'll have to pay the cost""

Well, for thirty days, thirty nights
They followed the tracks in snow
And the weather was howling, weather was cold
Lord, it must be forty below zero

All of a sudden King that great wonder dog
Stopped dead in his tracks, gave out a mighty sniff
Start sniffing all 'round there 'cause he knew, he knew
He knew that Dirty Dan was behind the next snowdrift

And Sergeant Preston said
""I own King, I own you great husky""
And that great husky said, ""Aooo ohh""
Sergeant Preston said, ""Get him, boy
This place is too sick of him""

Says, ""Tail him, that big dog
Just tear through that snow [Incomprehensible]""
Them ears back at, tail stacking straight up
And there just shakin' his head side to side
And breathing fire, he said, ""Aooo ohh""

Well, they brought that villain to justice
He didn't even put up a fight
When he saw that big dog charging at him
He almost died of fright

And Sergeant Preston of the Yukon
Is proud 'cause he's done it again
He got his man, you can hear him say
""Who needs Rin Tin Tin""

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Ray Thomas,"I waited so long, for you to come along,
Hoping and praying, my love would bear a son,
Now I see that love, it shines within your eyes.
We're gonna take our journey, Adam and I.

We'll ignore all boarders, for our spirit must stay free,
Free as the wind that blows, there's so much for you to see,
We'll ride on a moonbeam, and never pass one by,
We're gonna take our journey, Adam and I.

When we reach the land of the setting sun,
You'll be overjoyed, you'll see the sights,
So reach and take your father's hand
And may the Lord have mercy on our flight,
Adam and I, Adam and I, Adam and I, and I.

The river of life flows swiftly, into the sea of time,
Our lives were made for living, my joy is in your smile,
We'll talk to the heron, and he can teach us how to fly,
We're gonna take our journey, Adam and I.

Our Lord is in his heaven, He watches us below,
His seed was made for sowing, and we reap what we sow,
But he's a man of love, divine he's on high,
We're gonna take our journey, Adam and I.
Adam and I, Adam and I, Adam and I,
My son and I.

Ray Thomas,"Hey, hey mama life is a lonely time,
For a man who drinks his whiskey by the jar,
Now I do believe the life I lead
Won't get me very far
I was once told the streets were paved in gold,
Now I know them for what they are.

Hey, hey mama life has a sweeter sound,
For a man who lives his life for his dream,
Yet he must be aware there are those who care 
And those who would bring him down,
Separate trust from your cut and thrust,
The truth can still be found.

For the crossroads of your life
Will lead you almost anywhere,
You'll see tomorrow,
Your castles in the air
They were never really there.

Take the pride from a man
You're left without a meaning,
Take the wings from a bird, how can it fly,
Give him hope, give him trust and a little understanding,
Give him back his pride, you'll be satisfied.

Ray Thomas,"High above my head, there's a silver lining
In the sky, I tell you no lie.
I know that we can make it
I know that we're gonna make it
That's what I said
Cause we've got a silver lining above our heads.

High above the storm clouds
There's a new horizon, feast your eyes
Come on and feast your eyes
The beauty will astound you
The love there will surround you, open your eyes
The Lord put the silver lining into our skies

I want you to see things clearly
I hope you can feel the truth,
I know there's a hope for all mankind
Living under one roof.

I look around in wonder
While the world is living under

But we weren't sent to change it
To change or rearrange it
Still we can dream,
And dreams were meant for living
If you know what I mean.

Ray Thomas,"You can't buy a dream
Then expect your schemes
To appear brand new
Like the way you do
It's not hard to find
Deep inside your mind
Which road will take you home

Now you know that rain
Never falls in vain
For the seed must grow
It's glory shows in the summer sun
While our world is young
They reach to touch the sky

I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
How I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
How I wish we could fly

Then we'd see far more clearly
Maybe then we'd know
The best way we should go
Man just has to grow and grow and grow

All the air we breathe
And the warmth we need
It's given to us free
Like you loving me
Throughout our days
In so many ways
Helps me reach to touch my sky

But I can't explain
Self inflicted pain
When there's room for all 
To play life's game
And as we know
Our love must grow
Or we'll never touch the sky

I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
How I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
Oh how I wish we could fly

Ray Thomas,"Somewhere the sun is always shining,
Somewhere the breeze blows in another brand new day,
So let us gather up our tears
We'll save them for a rainy day.

Come on let's fill our world with laughter,
Let's put the sunshine into everybody's heart,
Then peace will last for ever after
Oh what a lovely start.

It gives you hope for a brand new day,
Have faith in love it will show the way,
Happiness, who could ask for anything more,
So realise there's no need to hide,
Show yourself to the world outside,
Don't you know that the world is an open door,
Don't you know that love's the key to open any door.

Ray Thomas,"Let's play our song again,
Make me remember when
We both chased our rainbows through the rain,
Our lives belong within this song
That's something we cannot change,
So whatever you do and wherever you go 
The memories will always remain
Play it again, Oh play it again, for me
It maybe for the last time,
Please play it again, just for me,
It maybe for the last time.

Love's a simple melody,
Two souls in harmony,
Never seem to cast a shadow in the sun,
Our days were filled with laughter
While our nights were filled with love,
Sweet river flow make my head feel high
When I hear that haunting refrain
Play it again, Oh play it again, for me
It maybe for the last time,
Please play it again, for me,
For the last time.

If happiness lies between you tears and my sighs
Angry words won't ring true
Remember times we once knew
We lay in the sun
Joined together as one in love
When the song's over, we'll just say good-bye,
There'll be no-one left singing, no-one to cry,
I'll just be a solo man.

Ray Thomas,"The world's like a big carousel
Turning in space with the whole human race hanging on
But the sounds that are played on that penny arcade
Turn me on

Then I need a little romance
If you play me that song
Then you'll get me to dance
I can dance
Sing me a slow song and maybe then I'll take a chance

Ray Thomas,"A simple man had the strangest dream
He stood in a garden of flowers
That overlooked the sea
And there sailing by
Were his truth and his lies going home

While all around the sweetest sounds
Filled the air with love
They made his senses pound
He saw with open mind
His life turn with the tide to go home

Memories of youth had passed before
He and he alone could count the score
For he was free he was free
This was his last dream

Such melodies are made to sing
The mellow sounds within a thousand violins
Caught upon the breeze
They play in harmony sweet harmony

At last he knew his act was through
With no applause and no encores
Though the house was full
So bring the curtain down
Lay him in the ground
For he's gone home

Memories of youth had passed before
He and he alone could count the score
Now he is free he is free
This was his last dream",The Last Dream
Ray Thomas,"On and on they journey southward
To the land of warmer summers
On the way they shed their feathers
For the poet's hand to write love letters

Flying high in straight formation
Seeking out their destination
Over seas and windswept forest
Frost and snow they're soon forgotten

Trees are bare snowflakes are falling
You can hear their leaders calling
Follow me fly strong my brother
Be strong of heart and help each other home

And here I am I'm just a man
And there you are among the stars flying high
Searching for a new tomorrow
I wish I could follow

Nearer still to new horizons
Chill winds blow so far behind them
Endless days and sleepless nights
A borrowed gift navigates their flight

Still and pure this morning air
So tired now but almost there
The mysteries of nature's calling
Some will climb while others return back home",Migration

Quelle saison est la plus chouette
Pour rêver d'amour
Ne dites pas qu'la meilleure date
C'est mars ou fin septembre

C'est celle que chantent les chattes
A la mi-Août
C'est tellement plus romantique
A la mi-Août
On fera les quatre cents coups
A la mi-Août
Tous les cœurs sont en pique-nique

Chantez d'un air badin :

J'ai passé mon bac
Comme j'étais pas une lumière
J'avais plutôt l'trac
Le prof d'histoire me demande
Quand donc est né l'shäh d'Perse ?

Lisse, lisse 
Moi les cheveux
Je t'offrirai un bout de pain d'épice
Puisque puisque 
Puisque tu le veux
C'est pas toujours que l'on peut se payer
Du plaisir à bon marché
Sur ce manège alors profitons-en
Car le bonheur n'a qu'un temps.

Ray Ventura,"Qu'est-c' qu'on attend pour être heureux ?
Qu'est-c' qu'on attend pour fair' la fête ?
Y a des violettes
Tant qu'on en veut
Y a des raisins, des roug's, des blancs, des bleus,
Les papillons s'en vont par deux
Et le mill'-pattes met ses chaussettes,
Les alouettes
S'font des aveux,

Qu'est-c' qu'on attend pour être heureux ?

Quand le bonheur passe près de vous,
Il faut savoir en profiter
Quand pour soi, on a tous les atouts,

Ouvrent les yeux,
Et la radio chant' un p'tit air radieux,
Le ciel a mis son complet bleu
Et le rosier met sa rosette
C'est notre fête
Puisqu'on est deux.

Ray Ventura,"On a tous même apparence
Un nez deux yeux et deux oreilles
Malgré de p'tites différences
Au fond l'on est bien tous pareils...

On a son p'tit cœur qui bat
Comme tout l'monde
On soupire souvent tout bas
Comme tout l'monde
Par l'amour on est mordu
Comme tout l'monde
Puis un beau jour on voit qu'on est cocu
Comme tout l'monde

On a les mêmes coutumes
Les mêmes désirs, les mêmes goûts
On met les mêmes costumes
Et même les mêmes dessous

On a un beau pyjama
Comme tout l'monde
Des caleçons en zenana
Comme tout l'monde
On a des chemises coquettes
Comme tout l'monde
Et puis aussi des trous à ses chaussettes
Comme tout l'monde

On est pareil en toutes choses
Pour tout c'qu'on dit, pour tout c'qu'on fait
Voilà pourquoi les mêmes causes
Produisent les mêmes effets

Nous payons notre proprio
Comme tout l'monde
Nous réglons le gaz et l'eau
Comme tout l'monde
On paie cash le pot-au-feu
Comme tout l'monde
Y a les impôts que l'on paie quand on peut
Comme tout l'monde

Nous sommes tous unanimes
Pour rester jeunes et pas grossir
On suit les mêmes régimes
Pour mieux réussir à mincir

On grignote tristement
Comme tout l'monde
Deux radis et un cure-dent
Comme tout l'monde
On a des crampes d'estomac
Comme tout l'monde
Alors en douce on s'envoie tout l'foie gras
Comme tout l'monde

Sitôt que l'on est malade
Aux mêmes soins on est soumis
Chez soi l'on se barricade
Par crainte des épidémies

On prend des tad d'précautions
Comme tout l'monde
Des potions, des infusions
Comme tout l'monde
On s'envoie de la quintonine
Comme tout l'monde
Finalement on attrape la scarlatine
Comme tout l'monde

Depuis la p'tite enfance
On est poli et bien élevé
D'ailleurs paraît que c'est en France
Qu'les gens sont les plus réservés

On minaude et l'on plastronne
Comme tout l'monde
On dit: j'vous en prie, baronne
Comme tout l'monde
On s'exprime qu'à mi-voix
Comme tout l'monde
Et l'on crie : M...tnce! En se pinçant les doigts
Comme tout l'monde

L'dimanche quand on va aux courses
On lit chacun les mêmes journaux
Et quand on risque sa bourse
Souvent on a l'même tuyau

On n'en parle que tou bas
Comme tout l'monde
Et même on n'en parle pas
Comme tout l'monde
On prend des p'tits airs en d'ssous
Comme tout l'monde
Et finalement on est refait  de ses cent sous
Comme tout l'monde

Chaque fois qu'des amants s'fâchent
Toujours c'est pour les mêmes raisons
Et quand un jour on se lâche
Toujours c'est la même chanson

On l'oublie presque aussitôt
Comme tout l'monde
On déchire ses photos
Comme tout l'monde
On s'écrie : fini l'martyre
Comme tout l'monde
Au bout de huit jours on la supplie d'revenir
Comme tout l'monde

Puisque nous sommes identiques
On devrait avoir les mêmes idées
Pourtant dans la politique
On ne peut jamais s'accorder

On a des principes à nous
Comme tout l'monde
On discute souvent l'coup
Comme tout l'monde
On s'appelle : Vendu!... Voyou
Comme tout l'monde
Mais dans le fond croyez-moi, on s'en fout
Comme tout l'monde",Comme Tout le Monde
Ray Ventura,"Viens ma chérie ne me sois pas rebelle
Belle belle 
Fleur de printemps
Tu es parmi les autres jouvencelles
Celle celle 
Que j'aime tant
Je ne pourrai pas t'offrir des bijoux
La fortune ou le Pérou
Mais je t'invite et selon mes moyens
Je ne te refuse rien.

Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois
Ca fait tourner la tête
Comme si on avait la gueule de bois
Et si tu te casses une gambette
On te fera mettre une belle jambe de bois
Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois

Tu me défends d'effleurer ton corsage
Sage, sage
Et plein de pudeur
Pourtant ma main dans ce doux badinage
Nage nage
Dans le bonheur
Si tu voulais nous ferions tous les deux
Un vrai couple d'amoureux
Tu serais ma petite vache à lait
Je serait ton cochonnet.

Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois
Ca fait tourner la tête
Comme si on avait la gueule de bois
Et si tu te casses une gambette
On te fera mettre une belle jambe de bois
Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois

Là sur mon front doucement ta main glisse
Lisse, lisse 
Moi les cheveux
Je t'offrirai un bout de pain d'épice
Puisque puisque 
Puisque tu le veux
C'est pas toujours que l'on peut se payer
Du plaisir à bon marché
Sur ce manège alors profitons-en
Car le bonheur n'a qu'un temps.

Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois
Ca fait tourner la tête
Comme si on avait la gueule de bois
Et si tu te casses une gambette
On te fera mettre une belle jambe de bois
Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux

Ray Ventura,"Un matin vous ouvrez la fenêtre
L'air vous semble soudain plus léger
C'est comme un frisson qui vous pénètre
Il y a quelque chose de changé

Tiens! tiens! tiens!
Déjà les feuilles poussent

Ça sent le romarin
Dans les jardins les lilas se trémoussent
Et les petites pommes ont déjà le pépin
Tiens! tiens! tiens!

Les paons font les pantins
On voit les chats s'pourlécher pour les chattes
Et les escargots galoper à fond de train

Y a pas d'erreur
Il se passe quelque chose
Tiens! tiens! tiens!
On joue d'la mandoline
Tiens! tiens! tiens!
L'air s'emplit de refrains
Y a des chansons sur les lèvres des copines
Et des p'tits boutons sur le nez des copains
Tiens! tiens! tiens!
C'est le printemps qui vient

Tiens! tiens! tiens!
Les rues semblent en fête
Tiens! tiens! tiens!
Tout le monde est gamin
Les charcutiers ont des airs de poète
Et tous les coiffeurs ont du poil dans la main
Tiens! tiens! tiens!
Soupirent les douairières
Tiens! tiens! tiens!
S'écrient les pharmaciens
Même les pompiers ont le feu au derrière
Les rouquins roucoulent et les bègues ont l'béguin
Les vieux gandins
Ont toutes les audaces
Mais il faut bien
Que vieillesse se passe
Tiens! tiens! tiens!
La gaieté me transporte
Tiens! tiens! tiens!
Je me sens aérien
Mais v'là soudain que l'on frappe à ma porte
C'est pour la facture des grands magasins
Tiens! tiens! tiens!
C'est le printemps qui vient","Tiens, Tiens, Tiens"

Ray Ventura,"C'était la plus belle fille du Brésil
Coquette ? Oui ... Honnête ? Non
Si fraîche que dans toute la ville de Bahia
On l'appelait la belle Maria
Chacun voulait l'avoir entre ses bras

Ay ay ay Maria
Maria de Bahia
Elle avait le teint comme du satin la belle Maria
Et tous les cœurs cabriolaient
Quand elle montrait ses mollets
Couleur de café au lait
Ay ay ay Maria
Maria de Bahia
Qui menait le bal au carnaval? c'était Maria
Et tous les garçons de là-bas
Quand elle dansait la Samba
Frémissaient du haut en bas
Les tambourins l'électrisaient
L'boum boum disait :
T'as bien raison d'tam t'amuser
Ay ay ay Maria
Maria de Bahia,
Les hommes se battaient pour inviter la belle Maria
Quand on l'avait trop embrassée
Elle allait se confesser
Et puis elle recommençait.

Ay ay ay Maria
Maria de Bahia,
C'est à cause de ça qu'un beau jour sa vertu vacilla
Elle aima un Caballero
Qui dansait le boléro
A Rio de Janeiro
Ay ay ay Maria
Maria de Bahia
Vous n'en doutez pas le cinéma se l'appropria
Elle tourna le scénario
D'un grand imprésario
Qui se trouvait à Rio
Puis un beau jour elle est revenue
Dans la mélasse la tête basse et les pieds nus

Avec le dadais qui l'attendait elle se maria
Et depuis ce jour il n'y a
Pas de femme à Bahia
Plus fidèle que Maria.",Maria de Bahia
Ray Ventura,"Tu veux que je te chante une belle chanson,
Mais je ne connais pas la musique
Je peux, si tu le veux prendre quelques leçons,
Et suivre les concerts symphoniques
Mais je trouve ça bien inutile
Fatiguant et difficile,

Je vais faire un effort et je vais chanter:

Sur deux notes
Je te dis que je t'aime
Sur trois notes
Je te donne mon cœur
Sur quatre notes
Je développe le thème
Et sur toute la gamme
Je chante mon bonheur
Sur deux notes
Je vais mettre ""Caresses""
Sur trois notes
""Un amoureux frisson""
Sur quatre notes
Pourquoi pas ""Nos ivreses""?
Et sur toute la gamme
J'ai fini ma chanson.

Quoi ! tu trouves qu'elle est trop vite faite ?
Ben vois-tu j'suis déçu
J'en connais beaucoup plus bêtes
Qui ont plu
Si tu veux que je te le prouve
Écoute-moi sans t'fâcher !
Faut chercher jusqu 'à c'qu'on y trouve un sens caché.

Les deux notes
C'est ta vie et la mienne
Les trois notes
C'est nous et notre amour
Les quatre notes
Sont nos mains qui se tiennent
Et puis toute la gamme

Et combien elle est faite pour nous !

Ray Warleigh,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

And seal it with a kiss

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Ray Wilson,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss

One, two, three, four

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really wanna go
And we'll walk in the sun
But till then tramps like us

Should I try to run away?
If I could I would escape you
I won’t argue anymore, 
I have lost the will to be
Hope you don’t think I’m ungrateful? 

Why, why are you laughing?
Is it something that I said?

I don’t like this place at all,
Makes me wonder what I’m here for
Someone take this pain away
Dying to see another day

Close the curtains lock the door,
Left my note upon the stair
In the hope you wouldn’t read it
Fake emotions in my head,
Everything I’ve seen and read
Can’t begin to find a reason

Fat man starts to fall
Here in a hostile place

Ring out from a bruised postcard
In the shooting yard
Looking through the tears
Out of the black slate time

But never reach an end
Fall in a long stray town
As the ice comes round
River starts to bend

Makes me vulnerable sometimes

How could you leave me
On the very edge of suicide
Suicide...

He leaves you traces I can see
He takes the things you gave to me
And even in the coldest place
I'm just an empty space

Walking in your footsteps
I used to walk by your side
How could you leave me
On the very edge of suicide
I'm lost without you
But well I know you go your own way
You never needed me no matter what you say

Walking in your footsteps

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"So, I come down from Oklahoma with a pistol in my boot
A pair of dice, a deck of cards, a Bible in my suit
I come her as the 'cause of tears, I'm just a crying shame
Seven stud or eternal blood, I'm lookin' for a game

I double crossed the State of Texas and they give me a little time
I taught myself to double cut the cards and hold scriptures in my mind
I learned to love the tumblin' dice and to believe the word
Tombstones or rolling bones, beats anything I ever heard

Patience is a virtue that I don't possess
And I can't deny that Heaven lies beneath a cotton dress
How small a part of time we share 'till we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings

I have walked through God's green pastures beneath these rich blue skies
I have seen the fall of man and the kingdom hidden from their eyes
I have heard the roar of thunder and I've felt the lightening bolt
And when I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take along Samuel Colt

Every night I kiss the cards and I hold them to my breast
And when I see the King of Hearts I know that I am blessed
And though my eyes are blind sometimes, I know there's something there
So when the times at hand and I kill a man, I, I say a little prayer

So I come down from Oklahoma with a pistol in my boot
A pair of dice, a deck of cards, a Bible in my suit
How small a part of time we share till we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings

How small a part of time we share till we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"Last night I went down to the railroad tracks
To watch that train roll by
99 cars screaming into the dark
I heard the lonesome whistle cry

With her name on my arm and the rain coming down
I kissed her like it was the first time
I took her down to the railroad tracks
And her red, red lips touched mine

She said, ""I wanna rock & roll
Wanna hoochie coo
Shake that thing
Baby, love me do""

The woman's got a walk to make a man cry
Throw back his head and howl
Ruby red lips, liquid hips
More than the law will allow

If I told her once, I told her twice
I must have told her a thousand times
I got a red hot mind and a cold black heart
I am the jealous kind

Where the woman just laughed and said, ""Sweet Daddy
You know you are the only one
You're my smooth lover boy, my heartache and joy
Come on let's have some fun""

I wanna rock & roll
Wanna hoochie coo
Shake that thing
Baby, love me do

It was early last night, I went downtown
To a place called Johnny's Last Stand
Through the blues and the smoke, I saw her on the dance floor
She's with another man

The dead man's name was Louie Dupree
I pushed the little button on my knife
I walked up and I said, ""Well hello boys and girls
Have you enjoyed your life?""

It's time to rock & roll
Time to hoochie coo
Time to shake that thing
Baby, love me do

Drawn by a fast left hand when I was lost
I did not choose a heart, a rose or a cross

And tells me that this life is just a game
Whom the gods wish to destroy, first they drive insane

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"I had a dream last night I was cast into Hell by a jealous God
The Devil walked up and said, ""You don't need no lightning rod
It hardly ever rains down here, I can't recall the last storm
You ain't gonna need that leather jacket, it gets kinda warm
But there's one way in there's no way out
It looks like you're here to stay
The place is a mess, it's overcrowded, more are coming in everyday""

I said, ""Oh man, wait a minute there's gotta be something wrong
I ain't a bad guy, just write these little songs
I always pay my union dues, I don't stay in the passing lane""
And he said, ""What about all that whiskey and the cocaine""
I said, ""Well, yeah, but that's no reason to throw me in Hell
'Cause I didn't use the cocaine to get high
I just liked the way it smelled""

He said, ""Come on over here son, let me show you around
Over there's where we put the preachers, I never liked those clowns
They're always blaming me for everything wrong under the sun
It ain't that harder to do what's right, it's just maybe not as much fun
Then they walk around thinking they're better than me and you
And then they get caught in a motel room
Doing what they said not to do""

""Now the murderers and the rapists they go in this fiery lake
As well as most of the politician and the cops on the take
And all the mothers who wait till they get to K-Mart to spank their kids
And instead of showing what to do what's right
They just hit 'em for what they did
And all the daddy's who run off and abandon their daughters and sons
Oh, anybody who hurts a child is gonna burn until it's done""

""Everybody is down here"", I said
""Who's up in Heaven with God and the Son""
Oh, some saints and mystics and students of metaphysics one O one
People who care and share and love and try to do what's right
Beautiful old souls who read a little stories to their babies every night
What you won't find up in Heaven are
Christian Coalition Right Wing Conservatives

Now I said, ""I've made some mistakes, but I'm not as bad as those guys
How can God do this to me or can't He sympathize
He said, ""You're wrong about God being cruel and mean
Oh, God is the most loving thing that's never been seen""
I said, ""Hotshot tell me this which religion is the truest""
He said, ""There all about the same
Buddha was not a Christian, but Jesus woulda made a good buddist""

Well, I thought about my future, I didn't seem to have much of one
I looked around to leave but there was no place to run
I said, ""I don't suppose I could go back and try living again
You know like reincarnation, I hear that's the way it's always been""
""I can't answer that"", he said
""You're gonna have to wait for that response
But it's not any more unusual to be born twice than it is to be born once""

Well, it looked like I was gonna be stuck here as far as I could tell
I thought I might as well suck up, you know what the hell
I said you, ""You know that song that Charlie Daniels did
About how you went down to Georgia and played fiddle against that kid""
He said, ""Yeah it broke my heart but you know what are you gonna do
I said, ""To tell you the truth
I thought your solo was the better of the two""

Well, then I woke up and I was lying in my bed
I ran upstairs and kissed my little boy on his sleeping head
I took this dream as a sign from God, so I thought I'd better pray
I said, ""Don't ever speak to me directly and thanks anyway""
Now so much has changed about me
Besides me just giving up red meat
Some get spiritual, 'cause they see the light
And some, 'cause they feel the heat",Conversation With the Devil
Ray Wylie Hubbard,"After all these years of our running wild
I believe I'll take off my colors for a while
And just kick back and sing some blues
Instead of living them like I do
After all these years of our running wild

After all these years of our running wild
I believe I'll take off for South Texas for a while
And look up some of my old friend
And try to make amends

After all these years of our running wild
And I suppose I fall somewhere in between
A lost soul and a romantic who believes
That if we live in forgiveness
We die in our dreams

After all these years of our running wild
I believe I'll take off my old leathers for a while
And with this life I live
Turn it over and forgive

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"Y' understand I was not lookin' whereby to fall in love
I'd come downtown to check out a band at The Continental Club
A Mamie Van Doren-lookin' woman come in the door
She was untamed youth rebellion and truth and so much more
I don't know if she had seen the light, she seemed at home in the dark
Her eyes met mine and it was like the time they split the atom apart

She could have had any biker in the bar but she come up to me
She said ""You're done sleeping around, from now on you're with me""

Y' understand I did not know if this was my last or my lucky day
She said ""You wanna go for a joy ride or you wanna stay here and pray""
I thought about my choices and I guess I could have said no
But it was just a band I'd come to see, so I mumbled

""Let's go""
She had an old Camaro--naugahyde tuck and roll
She said ""You can't live down in Texas if you don't have a lot of soul""

The stereo was blasting ""Mendocino"" by Doug Sahm
She said ""Fasten your seatbelt, you're with me from now on""

Understand I was not sleeping at the next day's sunrise
Me and this joy ride angel were up all night it's no surprise
When we got to her house she said ""Go on and take off your shoes.
I don't smoke afterwards I prefer to listen to blues""
""I know you're an old roots rocker and that's a compliment
When she said ""Do you want to hear some Slim Harpo,"" I knew she was heaven sent

In her fine presence is where I want to be
I'm done sleeping around, from now on she's with me",Joyride
Ray Wylie Hubbard,"I got on my cowboy boots, jeans and Hawaiian shirt
Mirrored sunglasses and a mobile phone
I guess I look like some Port Aransas dope dealer who?s out on bail
Just trying to get home
But I ain?t in jail, and I got me a guitar and I got a little band that
hotter than a rocket
Sometimes we?re sloppy, we?re always loud
Tonight we?re just ornery and locked in the pocket

So screw you, we?re from Texas
Screw you, we?re from Texas
Screw you, we?re from Texas
We?re from Texas, baby, so screw you

Now I love the US and the other states, ahh they?re ok.
Texas is the place I want to be and I don?t care if I ever go to Delaware
anyway
Cuz we got studs and Green Hall and Antones and John T?s Country Store
We got Willie and Jackie and Jack, Robert Earle, Pat Core, Charlie and me
and so many more

So screw you, we?re from Texas
Screw you, we?re from Texas
Screw you, we?re from Texas
We?re from Texas, baby, so screw you

Sing it with me
So screw you, we?re from Texas
Screw you, we?re from Texas
Screw you, we?re from Texas
We?re from Texas, so screw you

Now Texas has gotten a bad reputation because of what happened in Dallas
and Waco 
And our corporations they are corrupt, and the politicians are swindlers
and loco
But when it comes to music my friend I believe these words are as true as
St. John the Revelator?s
Our Mr. Vaughan was the best that there ever was and no band was cooler
than the 13th Floor Elevators

So screw you, we?re from Texas
Screw you, we?re from Texas
Screw you, we?re from Texas
We?re from Texas, screw you

Screw you, we?re from Texas

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"Strap them kids in
Give 'em a little bit of vodka in a cherry coke
We're going to Oklahoma to the family reunion for the first time in years
It's up at uncle Slayton's cause he's getting on in years
You know he no longer travels but he's still pretty spry
He's not much on talking and he's just too mean to die
And they'll be comin' down from Kansas
and from west Arkansas
It'll be one great big old party like you never saw

Uncle Slayton's got his Texan pride
Back in the thickets with his Asian bride
He's got a Airstream trailer and a Holstein cow
He still makes whiskey 'cause he still knows how
He plats that Choctaw bingo every Friday night
You know he had to leave Texas but he won't say why
He owns a quarter section up by Lake Eufala
Caught a great big ol' blue cat on a driftin' jug line
Sells his hardwood timber to the shipping mill
Cooks that crystal meth because the shine don't sell
He cooks that crystal meth because the shine don't sell
You know he likes his money he don't mind the smell

My cousin Roscoe Slayton's oldest boy from his second marriage up in Illinois
He was raised in East St. Louis by his momma's people
Where they do things different
Thought he'd just come on down
He was going to Dallas Texas in a semi truck called from that big McDonald's
You know the one they built up on that great big ol' bridge
Across the Will Rogers Turnpike
Took the Big Cabin exit stopped and bought a couple of cartons of cigarettes
At that Indian Smoke Shop with the big neon smoke rings
In the Cherokee Nation hit Muskogee late that night
Somebody ran a stoplight at the Shawnee Bypass
Roscoe tried to miss 'em but he didn't quite

Bob and Mae come up from little town
Way down by lake Texoma where he coaches football
They were two A champions now for two years running
But he says they won't be this year no they won't be this year
And he stopped off in Tushka at that ""Pop's Knife and Gun"" place
Bought a SKS rifle and a couple a full cases of that steel core ammo
With the berdan primers from some East bloc nation that no longer needs 'em
And a Desert Eagle that's one great big ol' pistol
I mean .50 caliber made by badass Hebrews
And some surplus tracers for that old BAR of Slayton's
Soon as it gets dark we're gonna have us a time
We're gonna have us a time

Ruth Ann and Lynn come down from Baxter Springs
That's one hell raisin' town way up in Southeastern Kansas
Got a biker bar next to the lingerie store
That's got them Rolling Stones lips up there where everyone can see 'em
And they burn all night you know they burn all night you know they burn all night

Ruth Ann and Lynn they wear them cut off britches and those skinny little halters
And they're second cousins to me
Man I don't care I want to get between 'em
With a great big ol' hard on like a old bois d' arc fence post
You could hang a pipe rail gait from
Do some twisted sisters 'til the cows come home
And we'd be havin' us a time

Uncle Slayton's got his Texan pride
Back in the thickets with his Asian bride
He's cut that corner pasture into acre lots`
He sells 'em owner financed
Strictly to them that's got no kind of credit 'Cause he knows they're slackers
When they miss that payment
Then he takes it back
He plays that Choctaw Bingo every Friday night
Drinks that Johnny Walker at that Club 69
We're gonna strap them kids in give 'em a little bit o' Benadryl
And a cherry coke we're goin' to Oklahoma Gonna have us a time",Choctaw Bingo
Ray Wylie Hubbard,"I pulled into the alley behind the liquor store 
Turned out the lights, left the motor runnin' opened up the door, 
I flashed a grin and said, Jack this is gonna be a piece of cake, 
Later tonight we'll head down to the Last Stand, split up the take. 

Sittin' there in the darkness, I take a drink of wine, 
Feel'n high and fast and loose, so right 
Wait for the rush to hit me and it feels so fine. 
Then I think of somethin' never realized, 
If I get shot tonight, I ain't never been baptized. 

Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight

I came runnin' back, blinded by sweat, blood and tears. 
I said, Jack the cat had a gun, hah, let's get outa here.
I didn't say nothin' as we drove away. 
I kept askin' myself how'd I ever get so mean I couldn't pray? 

Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 

Now there ain't nothin' I like better than drivin' on hard concrete, 
I'd rather hold a steerin' wheel in my hands than a woman at my feet. 
Ever since I was a little kid I was always rowdy and loud, 
Now here I am 34 still runnin' around with the wrong crowd. 

Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 

We had such plans for when we got to Mexico
After a high-speed chase we got caught south of San Angelo,
Well the judge he asked, why'd you want to go and rob a liquor store?
I said, well your honor it's hard to live in Dallas when you're white-trash and poor.

Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight, Dallas after midnight

Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight, Dallas after midnight

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"There's a tattoo on my shoulder
There's a story under my skin
Put there to remind me
Of the shape you left me in

I took the Ford 'cause it was rainin'
I went down Chipper Wall road
I put it out from the window
Like a thousand fools before

I've got a heart that's torn in two
So everyone can see
I'm nothin' without you
My heart's been torn in two

She kinda looks like Tempest Storm
And she can dance like little Egypt

Snake Farm – well it pretty much is
Snake Farm – it's a reptile house
Snake Farm – Uuuggghhhhh......

She got a tattoo down her arm
It's of a python eatin' a little mouse 
Wearin' a sailor hat that says snake farm

She says it's got it's charms

She still plays their records at the snake farm

Well the devil's drinking whiskey he asked me for a match
He lit up a Salem and said my friends call me scratch.

You're just assembled from boxcars and put together like tinker toys

He's mumbling that the world at large is just an elaborate scam

The way of the fallen is hard
The way of the fallen is hard

There's tears in the devils eyes, I ask what's the matter

Then he took off his shoes and said ?Perhaps I should mention?

   Heaven In The Rain

Al : Hey, what's the matter?
Girl : My car has stalled and I'm afraid all alone out here in the storm.
Al :  Yes It's raining pretty hard. I tell you what.. Get in my car and
I'll take you home. Ok.
Girl :  Oh thank goodness you came along.
Al :  Ah, It's my pleasure. Tell me this, how far do you live?
Girl : Not far. About two miles up the road  
Al :  Oh ok. ain't no problem. 
Girl  : Oh thanks.
Al :  Mmm, sho? ain?t no problem. 
   No there ain?t no problem at all
   Fine as she is, I?d drive her all the way to California
   And all points west of that If that?s where she wanna go
   This girl is fine. I sure wish the fellows  could see me  now. 
   Ooohhh. Ooh, wouldn?t believe it. Ain't nobody gonna believe me when
I tell them this.
   I sure hope she invites me in for a cup of coffee or something hot.

Picture an angel in a centerfold,
Soaking wet, but still in her clothes
She said "" I'm sure glad you came along,"" 
"" My Mercedes is sick and I'll  need a ride home ""

I found 
Heaven in the rain
Two miles from nowhere
An angel let me in
God sent her
Never thought I'd find in my lifetime

Al :  Oh baby
   You know this is like a dream.
   Just think we met one year ago.
   Fell in love. 
   And I've been here ever since

It's been a year and a day my friend
Since we fell in love and she invited me in
Now if you think this story's hard to believe
Just imagine how it feels to me

I found 
Heaven in the rain
Two miles from nowhere
An angel let me in
God sent her
I Never thought I'd find in my lifetime

I've got an address
My heart calls home
There's no zip code and no telephone
My house is here
Right here in her arms
I'm staying close I can't leave her alone

I found

Al : I love you so much. And I'll never ever gonna leave you.
 I'll be with you forever

"Ray, Goodman & Brown","You know, I've never been good at doing numbers,
But losing your love has taught me that, 
When there's two and you take away one,
You're left with something that's worth less than nothing.

Never let it be said I didn't try to rescue your heart
But how can you save a love that is thru before it could start.
We were more than the sum of all our pearls we were infinity
But now that you're gone, can't figure it out
Don't add up to me

I'm in love minus one
And that probably is
Even less than love
Ending before it had begun
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
Minus one.

You know, I could count all the days that's added up to a lifetime with you
But most times I live in a dream that you're coming back,
But somewhere in my heart I know it's not true.

If I could I'd stop time and wait until you love me again
I just can't believe, forever so long
I'll hold on till then

I'm in love minus one
And that probably is
Even less than love
Ending before it had begun
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

What do we do
Do we run or see it through

It just keeps gettin' better
And you hide your little love letters
Around the house for me
And it's plain to see
That you'll always be all I'll ever need

Wove into one
And left us tangled up in love

Don't analyse falling, don't try being wise, falling
Forget all your plans, they're out of your hands
You're falling, falling, falling

Blindly you go falling, the last one to know you're falling, you suddenly see
There's no way to fight falling, no rescue in sight, you're falling
You let love inside and hope she'll abide, you're falling, falling, falling

The world that you face is some other planet in space
You taste something new every moment
It thrills you, fills you, you're falling

I have to defend falling, 'cause if you should end falling
I hope you'll be free to spend time with me

But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing

would ever make me feel this way

get love to lead the way

I'd go anywhere
I would go there

feel her love is mine

For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see

Shine until tomorrow, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be

Si vous avez des ennuis
N'en rêvez donc pas la nuit
Et pour savoir l'avenir
N'allez pas voir les fakirs
Un ami m'a dit : Mon vieux
Ne sois pas superstitieux
T'en fais pas si par hasard
Tu as le cafard :

REFRAIN

T'as qu'à Ra Boum Dié !
Ça ne peut s'expliquer
Mais ce refrain charmant
Vaut tous les talismans
T'as qu'à Ra-boum ça y est !
C'est le bonheur complet
Et tout va s'arranger
T'as qu'à Ra Boum Dié !

Un jeune homme épris d'amour
Se consumait tous les jours
Pour une brune aux yeux noirs
Dont il rêvait tous les soirs
Il lui dit : Mam'zell' vraiment
J'ai pour vous du sentiment
Elle répondit sans peur
Si tu veux mon coeur :

Dans un asil' d'aliénés
Un fou se mit à pêcher
Devant les autres idiots
Tout au fond d'un lavabo
Le Directeur dit : combien
En avez-vous pris c'matin ?
Mon cher c'est vous le premier
Quand au procédé :

Un cheval de bois vicieux
Tapait du pied c'est curieux
Pour la vache aux yeux jolis
Qui tournait, tournait d'vant lui
Il lui dit son grand amour

Faut pas être en bois !

Avant de chanter ici
J'étais vraiment indécis
Je me demandais anxieux
Ce qui vous plairait le mieux
J'hésitais entre Prosper
Valentine ou bien Werther
La Marquise ou La Tosca
Ou ce refrain là :

Hier à l'Académie
Pierr' Benoit et Valéry
Adoptaient sans discuter
Le mot nouveau ""Raboumer""
Bordeaux qui dormait d'un oeil
Fit un bond dans son fauteuil
Raboumer ? Qu'est-c' que c'est qu'ça ?

Raymond Scott,"The night was filled with sweet surrender
I had a million things to say
We shared the moon in all it's splender
You pressed your lips to mine, and by the way
 
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am living for you alone?
Did I remember to say ""I'm lost without you""
And just how mad about you I've grown?
You were in my arms and that was all I knew
We were alone, we two, what did I say to you?
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forever more you are mine?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Stars in the sky are all free and they shine for me,
So does the moon in the blue,
All this is mine and heaven too.

You give me your arms and your arms are like angel wings,
Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

I own each summer day, each mountain capped with snow,
The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me,
You bring a love so divine, all this is mine

I was the kind of man to play the field
Never new that love was real
?
Never the truth it's always a lie
In front of man well she was like shy
Now his back is turned it's a different story
Partying till light hit the sky
Coming home at half past five
Yes she has an alibi
It's her friend Patsy
I don't want no girl to think I'm out for a fool
Better you take it nice and cool
Don't you treat I man like the mule of a donkey
I don't want no girl to think I'm out for a clown
Wheeling up town and down town
The word is that you'd run around
Your with everybody

Jackie is the kind of girl
Who loves to fly around the world
Flying from New York straight on to Paris
Driving in a Mercedes Benz
Living life and making ends
Lots of people lots of friend
That's what makes her happy
I don't want to be the one to stand in her way
I miss her nights and I miss her days
But she's the girl that loves to play cat and mouse games
Now then I'm afraid I'll have to say goodbye(ME)
I did my best and yes I've tried
She left me for that other guy
But life goes on baby

Glad it was the day when sunshine
Came into my life and made it brighter

Cause I got to lay you down

Was like an angel if you know what I mean
I wasn't staid by this Nubian Queen
See I'm a player, a honey hound
My feet are normally on solid ground
A thief of hearts, I've stolen many crowns
Now I'm the victim of the turn around

All I really wanted was to hit and run
How she did me I could swear she was the one
Never thought I'd be the one to feel so used
Now I'm standing here girl and I'm so confused

How she did me I could swear she was the one

You know your messed up,
Oh, so how you gonna get yourself otta this kid just a second,

I'm not trying to swoop down on you like a hawk,
I just don't want to see mapped out on chalk,
I know what your thinking I see all your thoughts this glory your after I already saw,
But all that you fight for will add up to naught,
Disaster runs faster your gonna get caught,
People will tell you what you wanna hear,
Just means their clever,
And don't face their fear,
I hope what I'm telling you comes across clear cause this is your life,
There's no second chance here,
I don't think I'm perfect or anything near made some mistakes of my own through the years,
That you don't learn from that is my biggest fear,
Don't make me a feeler,
It's too much to bear

Stains of all my childhood sorrows on the walls of my mind,
Are there any bright tomorrows,
Pain is all I seem to find,
How did I ever get to be here oh the truth cuts like a knife,
Pappa used to tell me about karma that's the story of my life
Sure you believe that I won't understand,
Turn to your friends cause you think that they can,
Remember I wasn't born as a grown man,
These problems been here ever since I began,
You ain't wearing diapers I can't hold your hand,
You've fallin' just let me show you how to land,
If your friends really loved you then it would be grand
Then why ain't they here when you sinking in sand,
Cause been where you wanna go that ain't no joke,
You only hurting your self with all that stuff you smoke,
Shots where you wanna shoot,
Tokes where you wanna toke,
Done my drunk drivin' in it my license revoked,
Did my shop lifting,
Hid stuff in my coat,
Suddenly found myself being a ? skank ho,
It only takes a pebble to start rocking the boat
When trouble comes guess who put the knife to my throat

Back from darkness that began with a kiss
Then He moved on up to be living in bliss

'Cause I should have been dead
But I stand here instead I'm alive

Through grace, the gift of God
Caused my hope to revive
I did the deeds I thought the thoughts
I made mistakes causing others to hurt
I am the guilty one, so death should have come
To me not Your only Son
You died for me now I'll live for You
One hundred percent of my life I'll give you
A fresh start a brand new hope I received
Life to the full be a heavenly preview
Should have been me, should have been me
Should have been my hands hammered to
The cross on that day
Thank you I pray that you gave up Your life for free
When it should have been me

Shouldn't it be me who died in total separation
Shouldn't it be me who took the blame eternally
Shouldn't it be me who walked alone into the darkness
Shouldn't it be me who died so why do I go free

Never before have I witness such love
A presence so huge money just can't buy
The gift of life through another One's death
I think of the cross I break down and cry
Why was there no other plan that was easier
No other way to be saved from my failure
Only the death of our Lord was sufficient
I owe so much I praise my Savior
You died for me now I'll live for You
One hundred percent of my life I'll give you
A fresh start a brand new hope I received
Life to the full be a heavenly preview

We've got somethin' to discuss
We're not the way we should be

Sometimes it blows my mind to think
We could've took the time
To make sure we've made it right
Before before we part ways

Would you ever forgive me
For the problems that I've caused you?
Forgive me 'coz I'm sayin' that I'm sorry
And I offer you my apology

Would you, a could you forgive me
For the problems that I've caused you?
Forgive me 'coz I'm sayin' that I'm sorry
And I offer you my apology

One never knows what a nights got in store.
Two never knew that the mac' would be bac' but true met Raze
And the deck wuz stacked

Mookie dropped the track got the people strait trippen'
If I'm wrong somebody I need to be forgiven
Reconcile my style for the old school
Wild if it offends me man forgive me

Would you ever forgive me for the problems
That I've caused you forgive me 'cause
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry and I offer you my apology
Would you a could you forgive me for the problems
That I've caused you forgive me 'cause I'm sayin' that I'm sorry
And I offer you my apology

The door flies open and enters a man
He carries a vision he carries a plan
But at the same time and the same dope rhyme
He slips and stubbles and falls and uh

Not afraid to admit it he was the one
Who was wrong now one day older and a few
Books wiser he now believed that days
Would get brighter not I've got one question
And it comes from the bottom of my broken heart

Would you ever forgive me for the problems
That I've caused you forgive me 'cause
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry and I offer you my apology
Would you a could you forgive me for the problems
That I've caused you forgive me 'cause I'm sayin' that I'm sorry

It feels as if a tank just fucking tore apart my insides

Across this empty space
I'd rather be slammed by two
Than to take anymore
So what's the use
So what's the use
(so what's the use?)

I never said I'd take you down there
Never said I'd see it through
Yet shit just happens
I'll never know what fucking hell has put me through
I guess that I deserve the beating
The kind that's not intentional
Why must I do only things that please me

I fucking close my eyes
Eat at my rotten corpse
I feel the evil force
Crumble and decay
I break down in dismay
Worst of this monstrosity

Dream will I forget

Erase then smear with shit
I flee from nothing there
Possessed by if I care
Attempt to run away
Manage to burn and pray
I fall in endless pit
And loving every bit
Further that I go
Smashed down on ten foot spikes
Escape this hell I know
Shoved deeper with her might
I bleed cold in despair
Wake me up or I'll lose my mind

yet she doesn't fucking care

Terrified to close my eyes

Hurt by the stone
Suffocate my mind

I can't handle it
Die, go away
Why must this happen all at once?

Peel away my skin
Ready to say goodbye
Pounding at me all at once
Feels as if...if I had a gun

I know I'd reach the end of forever
Deserve the hell I'm in
I know I got what's coming to me

He's so fine, he can't be beat

Go to see him when the sun goes down
Ain't no finer boy in town
You're my guy, just what the doctor ordered
So sweet, you make my mouth water

I want candy, I want candy

Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make you mine,
Then I'll have candy all the time

Razor,"You made the trip to catch the band
We better do the best we can
We're glad you came to trash and see
Our raw attack of pure energy
Iron Hammer, in your face
Wall of metal shakes the place
Total volume, full scale attack
Once you're here ain't going back
Now the power's in your hands
A message for all metal fans
I know this sounds a little cliche
But I don't give a damn anyway!
So let this be a lesson to you
Though we leave we're never through

The underground will always survive
I pledge: to keep it alive
I promise: metal will thrive
I swear: myself to the cause
I'll teach: all the metal laws",Iron Hammer

Looking to the darkness, putting up a fight
Iron chains surround you, you try to make a run
Someone near has found you, and now you see the sun
Bright lights, now you can see where you are
Far, out in the universe

Now, you, try to escape from this spot
Hot, ready or not
Take this torch
Feel the white hot metal, feel it burn your skin
Experience the torture, pay for all your sins
Taken to the stairwell, taken to a cell
Scorches all your body, taste the wrath of hell",Take This Torch

Welts all over my chest
Discipline, discipline
Baby, your pain is the best

Inflict me with bruises and watch as I scream with delight
Humiliate me, I last for your violence tonight
Kiss me, then hit me, then tease me, then boss me around
My body is aching with lust so we'd better get down

Hurts good.

Back at your apartment you turn out your lights
Light a few red candles, I'm gonna spend the night
You tie me to your bed with rope, you've got some heavy chains
I'm getting ready for some love that's painfully insane

My clothes are gone, the candle wax is dripping on my chest
Your fingernails into my flesh, you put me to the test
I love the fire in your eyes, I wanna be your slave
Tomorrow I'll be feeling all the pressure that you gave",Discipline

Don't wanna hear your name

Fed up with your butthead friends and hat your smart-ass smile
Fed up with the goofs I see all throughout downtown Guelph
Fed up with small city life, it makes me wanna Ralph

I say things in anger
You take 'em all to heart

You feel the current headin' straight through your veins
I love to see it when it touches the brain
And you cry

I deal experiments in decibel death
I pump the power with the flick of the switch

Razor,"""Good evening sports fans and welcome to what should
Prove to be the best game of the year.
Hello everyone, I'm johnny bigmouth, welcoming you to
The final game of the world championship.

We're expecting to see one helluva game tonight,
There's no love lost between these two teams.
Each drawing endless amounts of penalties:
We've had fights, cheap shots, name calling - everything we could ask for...

So now, we take you live and play... the game"".
You gave it your all, you gave all you've got
You reached for the limit, you pushed till you dropped
You scratched and you clawed, you spilled out your guts

You gave them your oath and you signed it in blood
Bent over backwards, your body is sore
You gave them your life but they still wanted more
You carry the load, you dig deep inside

Blood, sweat and tears till the day that you die
The game... betrayed
This is how you get repaid
They're playing with your mind, they're playing with your head

How do you like your meal when you're being force fed
This is how you get repaid... the game
You crash and you burn, you've stood at the top
You faced all the pressure and took the cheap shots

Your body keeps dying, wealth is the gain
You fought all the battles and played through the pain
You scratch at the scabs, you swear when you bleed
You laughed at the stitches and lost your front teeth

Go through the therapy, break all your bones
Then comes the trade, you buy/sell your home
""Oh my... what a hit! did you see that? unbelievable...
That's gotta hurt. The abuse this boy takes night after night,

And he's still putting on quite a show for the fans.
This guy is worth every penny he makes... I tell ya... that's gotta hurt...""
You talk of the glories and memories gone past
A brilliant career though it could never last

You're down and you're bitter, your rings are in hock
There's pins in your knees and you limp when you walk
You take all the pills, make the pain go away
You've lost all your wealth but your agent's ok

Your children have left you, your wife did the same
Look what it got you, but man he could sure play the game",The Game

Razorlight,"There's a full moon over this ancient town
A clock faced the color of the sky
And every street that we walk down
Belongs to the house where my father died

Where prisoners march in luck step with each other
Reavers test the limit of their reign
Dragging their dead weight from the other
While I claim my place, center stage

I've been thrown by the thrashing of his going
Chained to his unseen stride
I've walked in luck step without knowing
My indifference, my only disguise

Now it comes through me like an injection
Anonymous pain throbbing real inside
And every pulse in my body
Belongs to the house where my father died

Won't catch his spirit in a candle
On or alive in it's guttering glow
And death comes through these streets like a scandal
Bent up and beaten, oh, a bitter body blow

And in bars and shaded back rooms
Those who can't cope just get high
But every place this drink takes me to
Belongs to the house, where my father died

And there's a full moon over this ancient town
Head lights numb the banner of the sky
Rain rages the steadings and the open ground
And I'm a child fighting shadows with tears in my eyes

And the valley cannons and thunder
Trees blow beneath the bruising of the sky
Like centuries shield the lake from my wonder
And I'm as helpless as a child hiding from life

Razorlight,"If lust and longing were all we knew
And love was kissing on the roofing view
Of the office workers and their camera phones
My heart would pump to let you know
That you could take this song, if it's any good at all

Hide it somewhere when your new love calls
And if he asks if you hear his music playing
Tell him it's the rattling of old bolts and chains
That held your heart in but now you're starting
To forget you ever knew me and you won't let me in

If lust and longing were all we knew
And you were someone special, and I was too
For would you take this song, put it on your wall
Hide it somewhere when your lover calls
If he asks if that's music playing
Tell him that the rattling of old bolts and chains

How it went old so quickly but that was long ago
When you could fall in love with every one you know
And consume the songs like DNA
Cut me open and tell me what they'd say

Pierce my skin with your own elbow
Stake Sebastian can tell you what he knows about that
And how it feels, oh ohh, let me in

She says, break the rules now
Talk like you've got nothing to lose
Don't dance with nobody else
And he's drunk at the wheel again
Ooh, must've be somewhere with a monster smile
It's way too tight

Let me tell you what I know
She's got to leave this alone
Ohh, find a way out of here
She can still make it home

Now we both know longing, how it gets under your skin
But then I saw you making eyes at him
When you can take me over, take it all
Close that distance, smash that door
Beat me up or take my car
One last time before you crawl

But when your lover calls
Under the bed when his bullet falls
If he asks if that's music playing
Tell them that the rattling of old bolts and chains

In the night when you watch it fall
You gotta do now
Is let me in, let me in, let me in

She fixing stubs onto her belly
She walks like she's got nothing to lose
Still she just can't look at no one else

While in the basement there is blood on his knees
Turning to see what she would feel
When everybody has gone home
Let me tell you what I know

We could just leave this alone, ohh
And find a way out of here
He could just make it, her [Incomprehensible] in their tongue
And she's in a basement crime
She can't give this much of a fuck again

So she'll go to another with dodgy heels on
Dance with him to the beat of this song
Teach him up not be this much at his hopes
And then just another number on a generation kill
Dance, dance, too much time to kill

And if I see her, I'll tell her you said, hi",Monster Boots

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

My life began to change
Now I don't know what to control
But all that I could say was

Era la musica that made me run to you
Era la musica that made my dreams come true
Era la musica, as we danced the night away
Era la musica that made me love you

So exciting
How did I find someone like you?
Someone that made me feel
That love was really enough so true

It was incredible
The way that this came to be
He took my hand and then began
To take a hold of me

How enchanting as we're dancing
My life began to change
Now I don't know what to control
But all that I could say was

Era la musica that made me run to you
Era la musica that made my dreams come true
Era la musica, as we danced the night away
Era la musica that made me love you

It was the music that made me love you
The way you move takes my breath away
The way you dance girl is like no other
Was it the music that made me stay?

Stay with me girl, I?ll show you where we can go
Far away to a place only love goes
Yo no se lo que me esta pasando
A ti te sigo amando

How enchanting as we're dancing
My life began to change
Now I know what to control
But all that I could say was

Era la musica that made me run to you
Era la musica that made my dreams come true
Era la musica, as we danced the night away

You really are a waste of space
I got to shake you off now

You're like a super glue

So what if I had another plan
I'm through with you and that's a fact
I don't need to understand you
I'm not in the mood for chapter two

I don't wanna be your bleeding Juliet
I don't have to be your Romeo
Doesn't matter what you do (that it just play fair)

Shut up you're news is so out of date

No confundiré el amor con la pasión
No quiero saber de engaños que me hacen sentir desilusionada
Luego de entregarme abandonada

No estaré loca pérdida por un hombre
Que no tiene nada para darme solo un duro corazón
Money money, si no hay money money no?
No tendrás ni mi número de teléfono

Pague con lágrimas el dolor
Y en mí, solo el pobre corazón
Y hoy se, que no quiero hablar de amor
Sin hacerme llorar, anyway

Ya no quiero llorar, ya no quiero llorar
Ya no quiero llorar, ya no quiero llorar
Ya no quiero llorar, ya no quiero llorar?
Y esta noche la sacare para bailarte

Como la música vuela
Llevamos en mis sentimientos en un viaje
Y tú sientes como mi corazón se congela
Y se pone fríamente calculado cuando tu?

Siente como la música vuela
Llevamos en mis sentimientos en un viaje
Y tú sientes como mi corazón se congela
Y se pone fríamente calculado cuando tu?

Quieres hacerme llorar
Y ya no voy a llorar
Quieres hacerme llorar
Y ya no voy a llorar, any way

Esta noche tomare tu corazón
Busco sacarlo de la oscura prisión
Luego de bailar contigo yo te haré sentir
Tanto amor? que olvidaras la pena y yo?

Ten cuidado digo que te quiero
Que me muero por tenerte a mi lado
Bailando este reggaeton
Honey honey dance until we see the moon
Bailemos con la música de luny tunes

Que pague con lágrimas el dolor
Y en mí, solo el pobre corazón
Baila y solo abre tu corazón
Y yo no te haré llorar, anyway

With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there

That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain
You washed away the best of me
You don't care

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn

If you think you can walk right through my door

Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

Never open
Nothing matters
When you're broken

Always ending, always over
Back and forth, up and down, like a roller coaster
I am breaking that habit today

Sorry doesn't cut it babe
Take the hit and walk away
Cause I'm gone

Doesn't matter what you do
It's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth

A backpackin' popstar with a skater pass
Girls love it when I sing but I love to rap
They get their eyes on this money like they wear a patch
I don't tell 'em that I'm broke where's the fun in that?
We at college playing shows, get a ton of ass
Dudes say I make songs for the culo
Girls ask me what the hell the mad at you for
Same reason they was mad at Menudo
I get girls and rap nerds watch Naruto
These girls are pretty fast no kissing
Still come at your Johnson if you only get some clit in
Music's your dream - no patience

Head of my class I'm beating on the freshmen
I use money but I am not the next man attracted to this metal
Like we tryna kill an X-man
Emo my lyrics are feeding off depression
Caused by the last decade of recession
School loans are starting to be a bitch
So I just quit school and I'm starting to get rich or
Die tryin', turn into a giant

Used to never claim that I rap, so I'm try it out
Flow somethings new, beats borrowed
And I can guarantee a million fans follow
An outcast with rage against machines
Transform art to slave for companies
Homeboy Green, been pavin' out the dream
Since I hang from trees and scraped my dungarees

Funny style niggas never down with me 
Type that go to the bathroom, sit down and pee 
I'll empty your house, back of your cribs, smacking your kids 
Bullets going through your leather, cracking your ribs 
Don't even hit me on my hip if I ain't give you a call 
And I ain't got a home phone number, I live on the road 
Now I'm getting bigger checks, conference calls with bigger 'xecs 
Bigger bracelets with bigger begets,

Letting the spit fly, seeing sparks whiz by 
Putting a MASH on niggas like Klinger and Horgi

Should be the head Cat in the Broadway play, you pussy 
Fuck with Sheek, Ouija board spell ""Death"" 
You can talk that beef shit, I hope that deep shit 
Be as deep as you inside the fucking cement 
Or you can deep sea dive, with no scuba gear 
I'll drown you with your snorkel on, bitch, breathe out of there

Baking hot, and you can sled ride down my wrist, neck, and hand

And I don't give a fuck about that 380 that y'all share 
Between the 10 y'all with the same 8 bullets from last year 
When I bust I use snubs, denim flee in the spot 
The hand I write with need a oven glove, my shit so hot 
I want the most, Roley only work when it's next to my post 
Fuck a present gimme a yacht master, regular bezzy 
Then I'm good when I'm in the hood and I'm on the block 
You got a gut feeling about shit, nigga, that means you shot, what 

If you hoped we wouldn't make it, fuck you 
Talk with a heart full of hatred, fuck you 
And you said we wouldn't cake it, fuck you 
Only my man's blood is sacred, cocksucker, fuck you 
 
I'll tell you in your face, fuck you 
Pull it off my waist, hit you up, fuck you 
And watch you die on the street, fuck you 
Whoever feel sad at the funeral, fuck them too",Fuck You
Re-Up Gang,"It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

The war is on, yo
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Mack's milk, blast the year
That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back
Niggas want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops living gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind
Sipping on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Raining) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay these
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship
Meat heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit nigga, what??

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggas to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though, the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats cats and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-ville
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

Word up dun
Peace to Philly, VA, these days
Word up y'all, word up
The sun moon and stars fly cars, word up y'all

No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life, street life
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know, someone I don't know
Rainy Dayz, getting through those rainy dayz
I lost him to the street life, the street life, whoa",Rainy Dayz

A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so

Like an old coat that is tattered and torn
Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn 
Betrayed by a maid in her teens
Oh, this maid that I loved she was handsome
And I tried all I knew, her to please 
But I never could please her one quarter so well 
As the man on the flying trapeze!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
He'd play with a miss like a cat with a mouse
His eyes would undress ev'ry maid in the house
Perhaps he is better described as a louse
But still people came just the same
He'd smile on the bar to the people below
And one night he smiled on my love
She blew him a kiss and she hollered ""Bravo""! 
As he hung by his nose up above!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease

His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks 
While she spent her time the with the circuses freaks
The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
Alas and alack and Alaska
I went to this fellow the blackguard and said 
I'll see that you get your deserts
His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer  
He sneered once again and said ""Nortz"" Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night to his tent he invited her in 
Filled her with compliments and kisses and gin
That started her off on the road to ruin 
She made the supreme sacrifice
But even tho' I loved her I said ""Take my name  
I'll gladly forgive and forget!""
She rustled her bustle and then without shame she said
""Maybe later , not yet""!  Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night I as usual went to her dear home
Found there her father and mother alone 
I asked for my love and soon t'was made known
To my horror that she'd run away
Without any trousseau she fled in the night 
With him with the greatest of ease
From two stories high he had lowered her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze!
 
He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
Some months after that I went into the hall 
To my surprise I found there on the wall
A bill in red letters which did my heart gall 
That she was appearing with him
He'd taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights 
To help him to live at his ease
He'd made her assume a masculine name 
And now she goes on the trapeze!
 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease
You'd think her a man on the flying trapeze
Her actions are graceful, all girls she does please 
And that's what's become of my love

Gun claps erupt from the back alley way
The heat in the streets stress a nigga every day
Cops raid blocks like scenes from Red Dawn
The American Dream in the ghetto is more gall
I knew this kid cold out of luck
No loot or nothing, you know that other fuck-up
Well, if I ain't got, I'ma take
I got a burner in your face, son, ain't no escape
from the mental prison that I'm in
I want to break out but I'm committin mad sins
We got the city under siege, how
Gang-land style, juveniles running wild
Niggaz come, niggaz go, niggaz die
My man could've been a ball-player but he gettin' high
It's dangerous out here, son
'cause yo, the average motherfucker's living under the gun

[ Verse 2 - Larry-O ]

Coke is a commodity and so is the gun
It's time to cultivate a plan that's guaranteed to hit
Flips some cook-up, stack a 100 thou and quit

Niggaz' joints are too mean and hoes are too thick
So now I gotta locate my click
And rise to the top till the cream turn thick

It's like everytime I look up my neck be on the chopping block

Beef throughout the street be like a everyday thing
A warzone with gunfire sounds
We gunnin each other down like motherfucking killer clowns
Living conditions is out of order
A shorty slaughtered her daughter 'cause she couldn't support her
Yo, niggaz be making big bets
Clowns with short paper get killed for big debts
And little shorties on cellular phones

Sinking to the depths while I'm masking what's inside
A bittersweet existence and I cause my own demise

The eyes of one who understands what it mean
To be free, freedom comes when you can let it go
But I guess you wouldn't know

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Mind reflects the meaning to things that are jumbled
Resting on the first, making time to rehearse
Intricate persona, controlled animation
Visually impaired, clinging to pain immersed

Mentally scarred, cosmetics dripping down
Life in forward motion, exist in reverse
Instable at the seams, trying to conform
Trapped in a maze while sin is at its worst

And I wonder what your gonna do, when your
Disguise comes crashing down and yourself
Comes shining through, are you gonna hide your face?
Or let it rest in the hands of grace, grace

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play

I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

It's such a shame, the game you play
Congratulations, you're invited to the masquerade
I'd like to know what lies behind the mask you've made

Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade
Don't hide your face in the masquerade
Don't play the game, it's a masquerade

Independent of all wisdom, secondary senses shaken
In time I arrive battered, beaten and scarred
Sensitivity charred from character barred

So hard to say goodbye to yesterday's dreamin'
Still pullin' weeds from seeds of yesterday's schemin'
Elusive representation of putting mercy to test
Confessed in midnight sessions of my desires suppressed

Countless starve upon the streets
Children crying out in pain
Children dying who is to blame

Does no one listen to their calls
Victims of the endless war
Pools of blood, flood city streets
Another victim, lies lifeless at my feet

He was stabbed to death
When he did not confess
He swore he was innocent
Now he's a bloody mess

Caught in the crossfire, bullet to the head
Rushed her to the hospital, D.O.A. dead

In the name of God almighty
They sent their child to die
Martyr with no fear of death
A promised paradise

Slaughtered without reason
Bound in agony

Das Bundeskriminalamt hat jÃ¼ngst seine neuste Statistik Ã¼ber sexuellen Missbrauch in Deutschland veröffentlicht. Aus dieser geht hervor, dass es sich bei einem Drittel der knapp 250 000 erfassten Fälle um sexuelle Gewalt gegen Kinde handelt. Laut BKA dÃ¼rfte die Dunkelziffer aber deutlich höher liegen. Es wird vermutet, dass jedes Jahr Ã¼ber 200 000 Kinder unter 14 Jahren sexuell missbraucht werden.

In search of sin
It drags me down
But I won't give in

I need your touch
I'm standing strong
But all alone
Is not strong enough
You gave me faith
You called my name
You felt my fear
You healed my shame
Won't you come to me
Won't you come to me

It drags me up
From deep below
To higher ground
Surrender now
You can't succeed
A kiss of faith
Will rip you up
You can't believe

So you could see
I gave you love
You set me free
Won't you come to me
Won't you come to me

To overcome

Reamonn,"She wakes up cold
Reaching for his arms
But there's no one there

She feels so old
She falls apart
As she fights back tears

And then she curls up small
And feels like she's alone here in Hell
And then she starts to scream

I deserve more
She's running out of time
She's running out of time

Oh tonight
Is just another night
Just like any other night

And then she climbs inside
And orders him to drive
Drive anywhere

He said
Hey you there's no need to cry
He began to stare

And then she curls up small
And feels like she's alone here in Hell
And then she'd start to scream

I deserve love
I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time

Oh tonight
Is just another night
Just like any other night

In these worn down streets
Blinded by the neon lights
She feels turned away

She stands up straight
And takes some air
It's just another bad day

And then she screams out loud
You've made a mess of your life
You won't make a mess of mine

Oh tonight
Is just another night
Just like any other night

Oh tonight
Is just another night
Just like any other night

And then she screams out loud
As she's racing through the crowd
She screams at the top of her voice
I'm taking back what's mine

Oh tonight
Is just another night
In just another life

Sweet the hands that
Laid me to the ground
Sweet the voice that
Makes the sweetest sound

And I won't go down
I won't go down
On my knees
There's just you and me
We are the only ones


I've heard of love that
Inside she makes you strong
In your arms is where I
I Feel I belong

And it's only
If you want it
I'll be gone
There's just you and me
We are the only ones

It's a brand new day
We'll take it as it comes
There's nothing left to say
Cause it's all been said and done

And if the lights go out
We'll be the burning sun

We'll make it through the night

At cigarettes and coffee cups
But most of time we make it out
We'll make it through this

Lying here on carpet stone
I feel I've let your safety zone
But how can I feel so alone
If I'm here with you..

Promises I made to keep
Let's find the words before we sleep
There's nothing left for you and me
Nothing left to hide

And when the ceilings come crashing through
Be standing there me and you
The ceilings come crashing through
Then they'll see
You and me, you and me

Every word on every page
They speak to me of better days
Of how we used to wanna fight
For everything we thought was right
And what we believe

I know we cared of everything
Some times we're holding on by strings
But what we have where we deserved
That's you and me against the world
That's what I believe

And promises are made to keep
Let's find the words before we sleep
There's nothing left by for and me
Nothing left to hide

At the deep blue sky

No there's no place to hide

Disappear from this world

See that you're surprised

Reamonn,"[Verse 1]:
She never took the train alone, 
She hated being on her own,
She always took me by the hand,
And say she needs me.

She never wanted love to fail, 
She always hoped that it was real 
She?d look me in the eyes, 
And say believe me.

But then the night becomes the day, 
And there?s nothing left to say,
If there?s nothing left to say, 
Then something?s wrong...

[Chorus]:
Oh tonight, 
You killed me with your smile, 
So beautiful and wild, 
So beautiful...

Oh tonight, 
You killed me with your smile, 
So beautiful and wild, 
So beautiful and wild.

[Verse 2]:
And as the hands would turn with time, 
She?d always say that she was my mine,
She?d turn and lend a smile, 
To say that she?s gone...

But in a whisper she?d arrive, 
And dance into my life,
Like a music melody, 
Like a lovers song!

[Chorus]:
Oh tonight, 
You killed me with your smile, 
So beautiful and wild, 
So beautiful and wild.

Oh tonight, 
You killed me with your smile, 
So beautiful and wild, 
So beautiful and wild.

[Bridge]:
Through the darkest night, 
Comes the brightest light,
And the light that shines is deep inside...
It?s who you are...!

[Chorus]:
Oh tonight, 
You killed me with your smile, 
So beautiful and wild, 
So beautiful...

Oh tonight, 
You killed me with your smile, 
So beautiful and wild, 
So beautiful and wild.

So beautiful and wild ...
So beautiful and wild...

Shine above your head
See the love
That you once had
Don't ever let go

See the dreams
That you hold inside
See the hope

Don't ever let go â?? oh no
And if you wish upon it
With open eyes
The world will sing to you
Yeah if you really want it
Then hold on tight
You've got everything to loose
See the world
Through a child's eyes
Never give up
Or let it slip by
Don't ever let go
Oh no â?? don't ever let go
When fortunes open wide
And if you wish upon it

We need the love of those who forgive us

Reamonn,"We both dressed as we thought fit
What do you wear to goodbyes?
The tome would come for us both to sit
And near each other's lies

I don't feel like I've been holding back
Breaking up is hard on us both
I feel so empty as you walk away
These words have no meaning
There's nothing to say

So Goodbye
Goodbye
These words have no meaning
When your heart set on leaving
Goodbye
Goodbye
Now there's nothing worth keeping
Nothing left to believe in
And when think the fighting is over
Then come the sleepless nights
Of wanting to hold her
Goodbye

I can barely remember the love
But I can still hear the fights
Standing in the hallway
Screaming the top of your voice
You know you were right

I don't feel like I've been holding back
It cuts like a knife but it still feels like life

So Goodbye, Goodbye
These words have no meaning 
When your heart set on leaving
Goodbye, Goodbye
Now there's nothing worth keeping
Nothing left to believe in
And when think the fighting is over
Then come the sleepless nights
Of wanting to hold her

Goodbye
You said it wouldn't hurt
But now say it's not getting better
We tried
So hard to make it work
I thought that I'd be with you forever

Goodbye, Goodbye
These words have no meaning
When your heart set on leaving

Goodbye, Goodbye
Thought this might be worth saving
But I must be mistaken

Goodbye, Goodbye
Now I'm ready to let you

I see you leaving
I start believing

I finally think the fight is over
No more sleepless nights
Of wanting to hold her
Goodbye

Did you think I couldn't tell
You've been with someone else
You were only kidding yourself

When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out till I got to know her
So I drived away as she got over
And I became just like her so don't be surprised to find
The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight 
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight",Angel in Your Arms
Reba McEntire,"Oh I know it's hard for you to say it's over
Well it's twice as hard for me to let you go
Out there I hope you find a softer shoulder
But before you leave there's something you should know

[Chorus]
I was glad to give my everything to you
Yeah we almost made our every dream come true
And though we didn't have the chance to see it through
I was glad to give my everything to you

Oh you say you need a little room for breathing
Somehow I guess you know I'd understand
And though you're hurting me 
I still can't help in believing
I'd be glad if I could do it all again

[Chorus]

Oh I was glad to give my everything to you",I Was Glad to Give My Everything to You
Reba McEntire,"I see you now, I think of then
And dwell upon the happiness of way back when
Cause since you said goodbye
The feelings just won't die
And I still long to hold you now and then

A million years have come and gone
And I was sure by now I'd make it on my own
But seeing you today
Took my breath away
And I still long to hold you now and then

Suddenly I felt myself wondering
If you might want to try it again
And though I wanted so much to hold you
You smiled and shook my hand

So I'll exist on dreams again
On days when we were lovers and not just friends
And even if I find another love in time
I still long to hold you now and then

Oh, I still long to hold you now and then",(I Still Long to Hold You) Now and Then
Reba McEntire,"My daddy is a rancher
He's wrangled cattle dang near all his life
He also liked to rodeo
He traveled around with four kids and a wife

Well his old ranch is rocky
But his ropes sail smooth for several years
He worked real hard
And roped real good
And tried to get his ranch out in the clear

He didn't want us kids to rodeo
He wanted more out of life for us
Maybe banking, or a lawyer
Or maybe even driving some old bus

Well that's when we took up singing
And his pride grew greater day by day
And I know his eyes grew misty
The night I sang up on the Opry stage

[Chorus]
Now his ranch is so much bigger
The the days when he first started
The grass grows now where none used to be
His roping got him started
Cattle prices made it better
And he's trying to get his ranch out in the clear

Five years ago September, he bought more steers and hung up all his
Ropes
But he often tells the stories about the rodeos he won and cowboy jokes
Well it's funny that the first big roping that he won some thirty years
Ago
Was the same day that I sang on the stage of the Grand Old Opry show

[Chorus]

Now he's feeding cattle
Toting hay
And branding the Y.O.
And his hired hand's there to help him
And she also cooks their meals when they get home
They built their ranch together
And listening to the kids sing through the years

Well they worked real hard 
And roped real good and now they got their ranch 
Out in the clear
Because when a family works together
They finally get their ranch out in the clear
Out in the clear",Daddy
Reba McEntire,"Well I can wash out forty four pairs of socks
And have 'em on the line
You know I can starch and iron two dozen shirts

Throw it in the skillet, do my shopping, and be back before it melts in the pan

And if you come to me all hexed up you know I'm gonna break the spell

And if it's loving you want, I can kiss you and give you the shivering

That keeps us together
It's gotta be a feeling from the heart

It must last forever
Or I won't let the fire start

I don't have time for a part time love affair
I can't pretend it's love when it's not really there
So don't you lead me on if you don't really care
It's gotta be real

You helped me see how love can still be right

And you mentioned it's an early flight

I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart
Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love
In his runaway heart

He's a fast rushing river I can't get across
Like an ocean of sadness, o'er which I am tossed
He never slows down, he's always ready to fly
And when I get next to you it's just hello
Hello and goodbye

[Chorus]

No rope can hold down
He's not fit to be tied
Like the wildest of horses
Nobody can ride

And the means to his end
So I'm giving up trying
Cause I'm just chasing, chasing the wind

Reba McEntire,"So you like Sunday picnics
And yelling at the umpire at a baseball game
Window shopping, popcorn popping
Wading through the puddle in a Summer rain
And I'll bet you're kind to children and
Someday you'd like to be a mother too
And do you got a feeling when you're with me the way I do

Well that makes two of us
We're like birds of a feather

True love brings together
A precious few of us
That makes two of us

So you believe in wishes
While blowing out the candles on a birthday cake
Gentle hugs and lightning bugs
Staying up all night to watch the morning break
We've got so much in common
Given half a chance I'm sure you'll agree
One way to sum up forever is, you and me

And I wouldn't have to worry she might find a little stand of my hair.

Look at the one who's love would be true
You might be surprised
At the love that's shining in her eyes
Look at the one who's so easily found

Or just my heart playing tricks on me
I fall so easily

Leave you looking for another place to run

Silver Eagle
100,000 miles beneath your wings
Flying down that broken line
No one's gonna know the way I feel

One more lost and lonely stranger by the highway
Tell me that I'll never see his face again
You're the only one who's ever going my way
Don't you know the state I'm in

[Chorus: x2]",Silver Eagle
Reba McEntire,"I thought love was meant to last forever
Isn't that how love's supposed to be
Now it seems the good times are all over
It's so funny I guess the joke's on me

Every day I sit alone and wonder
Why I fell in love so easily
And then woke up to find that all he left behind
Are tattered dreams and broken pieces in my memory

[Chorus]
So tell me what's so good about goodbye
What's so good about watching good love die
He's the kind you can't forget 
So I won't even try
Tell me what's so good
I gave him all I could
Tell me what's so good about goodbye

I don't think I'll ever love another
I didn't know that goodbye could hurt so bad
I know I'll always find he's somewhere in my mind
Still believe the worst of him's the best I'll ever have

[Chorus]",Tell Me What's So Good About Goodbye
Reba McEntire,"This song is Mary and I's theme song! 
It epitomizes our friendship through and through!

I know sometimes I'm like a child
I disappoint you so
And how you keep forgiving me
I'll never never know
When I stumble and I fall
And need love desperately
You are always there for me

[Chorus]
Like an oak in the wind
Like an old familiar friend
Like a harbor in a wild and raging sea
Darlin' you are always there for me

When I take your love for granted
Like I often do
It's not that I don't need you so
It's not I don't love you 
It's just that I'm a fool sometimes
Just too blind to see
That you are always there for me

[Chorus: x2]",You Are Always There for Me

Well I thought I had seen good looking men in my time
That was before I met you
And I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you

[Chorus]
Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed
And I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you

Well I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you
And I said that nobody could ever hold me
But that was before I met you

It's sad but true
He wanted my arms around him 
Oh without a doubt
He wanted my warm red lips
Soft on his mouth
He loved all of me
Except for one small part
He wanted everything
Everything but my heart

Too much has happened to my feelings
It's gonna be rough not having him around
Until time has done some healing

If there is no mistake

Is more than I can stand
But this hurt would be much worse
If I heard it secondhand
If there's no hope at all
If my world must fall
I want to hear it from you

So tell me now

You may be holding me but can't you see it's not over if I'm not over you

You're telling me the same sweet things he told me
And in your eyes I see that same sweet glow
And did you say you'd never leave me lonely
Well that's what he said

How my heart feels about you.

And I'd teach the robin a new song or two.
Then I'd fight forever
And hand it to you.
Oh, I wish there was more I could do.

And you may change your mind someday
And when you've missed this life we've known

And I could swear a stranger's laying by my side
And I could swear a long dark valley lies between us
And there ain't no way to cross the great divide
The great divide ain't in Colorado it's the distance that we've somehow grown apart
The great divide oh that river's sorrow
We can't rebuild the bridge we burned between our hearts

Now Lord knows we're both tryin' hard at crossin' over
But pride runs as deep as it is wide
And the love that once could conquer any mountain
Has reached the edge of the great divide
The great divide...
The great divide ain't in Colorado",Great Divide

Have I got a deal for you
A heart that's almost like brand new
And I'll let it go so cheap

We sat and watched the children play
If it was the heat or the noise
He didn't have too much to say

Then with a move of his eyes
A move that could have made the wind stand still
He took my hand in his and said the words
That I never will forget

[Chorus]
He said have you ever cheated on me
Has there been someone else
Is there someone you love more than me
Someone you can't forget
If his memory is opened again
Let it be chased away by time
He said have you ever cheated on me
I said only in my mind

How can I tell him
The time we spent together 
Was time between friends
There's just somethings I can talk about with you
That I can't just talk with him
How can I tell you
That somewhere in the cards it was meant for us to be
Why am I blushing in front of you now
Is it you or the heat

But along with the roses came the thorns

And that's why red roses just won't work now
Cause you've done too much
To talk things out
You could tell me you love me
But that's the one thing I'll always doubt
Red roses just won't work now

Gone for good's the trust I had
You let me done the garden path

I wish I was guessing but I know that I'm right
She walked in the place with a smile on her face
And I wondered why she was alone

Every man watched her as she swayed on by
The way she was looking every woman could cry
Then I saw her sit down with a lawyer 
And I knew what was going on

[Chorus]
She's single again
Hold on to your man
She'll make us worry and cry
And bring us broken lives
And heartaches that never end

She's making her move
She's got nothing to lose
Oh look out
She's single again

Is this number 4
Is this number 5
How many husbands has she buried alive
She uses the favors that the good Lord gave her
With the devil's desire

Well I bet she's thinking 
She's on top of the world
And I've seen her working
So I'm warning you girls

But that don't mean anything

Well you're only bad crime
Was you used all the right lines
To make a girl like me
Feel like I was one of a kind

You had me believing
What I had you were needing
But I guess there was something missing
That you needed to find

Who says you need a reason
For getting up and leaving

Cause I know she holds you tight

It fills up the house
With words that can't be set free
So who'll break the curse
And say the first word
Well I don't know
We're not talking you see

It's another silent night
It's a cold war of who's wrong or right
Nobody's winning this unspoken fight

Love is never easy
Dreams are always hard to hold
Love is never easy
But it's more precious than gold
More precious than gold
More precious than gold

Until the day that it ends
Love can just be for lovers
Love can be for friends

And don't be afraid to fall

You'll know it's worth it all

Saying words we'll both regret
And you scream you we're leaving
And you cursed the day we met

And broken dishes thrown around the floor
So loud it made us stop
It was the sound of a teardrop

[Chorus]
When I heard her crying
Thought she was tucked away in bed
I heard her crying
Wish we could take back what we said
I didn't think she was old enough to know
Oh Lord we must have hurt her so
When she begged you not to go
I heard her crying

Well I'd have given anything
For time to erase
When I turned around and saw
Those little tears roll down her face

Oh my heart nearly broke in two
When she said 
Mommy what did I do
To make you and daddy mad
Oh I'm sorry I was bad

I looked at you and you looked at me
And we felt each other's shame
Kneeling down to hold our child
Said she was not to blame
Now sometimes when we're angry
And say things that aren't true
We still love each other 
And baby we love you

Oh, sweet sounds of freedom
Ringing through the air
Sending out a message to us all
We don't have a curtain
Made of iron or stone
We are not divided by a wall

There are books that tell us
What makes this whole world turn
And how Heaven holds the star wars
But there's no explanation
Lord it's still a mystery
How a song can touch your heart
So come on, tell me

Reba McEntire,"All my life I've looked at love as a fairy tale
A woman a man never never land and a storybook ending
Leading roles and my heros upon the silver screen
I played em all but always came up empty
But one of these days I'll be in a movie with 'em

Cause I believe that fantasy
Is one step from reality 
For those of us who dream of love
And I believe cause I want to
There's some one man for someone who believes in love
To not give up 
Even though you've heard so many say

I'm lookin' for a yellow brick road
That'll carry me to his door

Oh one that's never been told before

And I have searched the oceans of many a man's eyes
But I have yet to feel like more than some deserted island
I know a relationship will come for me in time
And I can't wait to see his face on my horizon
Cause one of these days he'll sail into my life

Cause I believe that fantasy
Is one step from reality 
For those of us who dream of love
And I believe cause I want to

A lover's quarrel
Angry words spoken in haste
Deep in the night
It went out of control
And with tears streaming down my face

Swearing that we were through
Now I'm sitting in a bar
Thinking I've gone too far
Wondering what I'm gonna do
Thinking about calling you

[Chorus]
To my left blue collar
To my right a high dollar man
Across the bar a smooth bartender
Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand
Well they buy me drinks
Light my cigarette
They're all wondering which one I'm gonna choose
Oh my hand's on my glass
My second margarita
And my mind is on you
My mind is on you

Well I ran away
In a moment of weakness
I couldn't hold my own
I should stay
Because being together 
Means more than who was right or wrong
And sitting in a room full of lonely faces
You're the only one I see
If you only knew
I was thinking of you
Would you come and rescue me
Maybe I should call and see

[Chorus]

(My third margarita)

I should of known I could never get along
Outside of your love
It's last call
And I'm out of cigarettes

Honey there ain't no such thing
As me not being true
So believe your heart and not your ears
Your heart knows what is true
There's no such thing
As me not loving you

Well a love like yours and mine
Has got to deal with the jealous kind
But I don't mind there's nothing I can do

And held each other close all through the years
But I've met someone before you
And my heart just couldn't wait
So no matter how much I adore you
I've got to stand behind the promise that I made

Where were you
When I could have loved you
Where were you
When I gave my heart away
All my life I've been dreaming of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late

I won't say that I'm sorry that I met you
I can't have you but I never will forget you

Where were you
When I could have loved you
Where were you
When I gave my heart away
All my life I've been dreaming of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late

Where were you
When I could have loved you
Where were you
When I gave my heart away
All my life I've been dreaming of you
You came along one promise too late
You came along one promise too late",One Promise Too Late
Reba McEntire,"Now and then I open up a trunk full of old souvenirs
Thumb through a scrapbook holding back the tears
I keep wishing we could do it once more
Just the way we did before

Take me back to Sycamore Park
Put the radio dial on the golden oldies
Hey lay a blanket down and hold me
We can stay all night 
By the light of the moon above 
So take me back, back to love

Ever since you took me to the big city
Looking for the start
Living in the fast lane
Is tearing us apart
Sometimes don't you want to trade it all in
For a little way back when

Well I remember sneaking out the back
Mama thought I was asleep
Watching for your headlights
Creeping down the street
Trying to steal a kiss
Just anyway we can
Back where it all began",Take Me Back
Reba McEntire,"Riding up in Oklahoma
People call us blind
'Cause we believe in God and love
And old fashioned things
We still draw the line between wrong and right
And when a woman takes a husband it's for life

We met on a road from Tulsa
Travelers in the night
Well I knew we belong together
It just felt so right
There's something about this gal you ought to know
She's gonna love you 
Till it snows in Mexico

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you
Till it snows in Mexico
Or till the Rio Grande freezes over
Cause darling when God made our love
He threw away the mold
And I'm gonna love you
Till it snows in Mexico

If you should ever leave me
Heaven forbid
But you don't have to worry none
About me ?
You know exactly where I'll go
I'll be waiting for the snow in Mexico

Reba McEntire,"The kid down the street mowes the grass every week
The neighbor next door fixed the roof where it leaked
Job's going fine and the bills are all paid
And everyone thinks that I'm doing OK

There's a guy down at work
He's asked me out once or twice
I haven't said yes
But I'm thinking I might
And on my way home I thought I saw you walk by
If only I could get you out of my mind

What in the world am I gonna do about you
Oh your memory keeps coming back
From out of the blue
Oh well I try
And I try
But I still can't believe that we're through
So tell me what in the world am I gonna do about you
What am I gonna do about you

I went to the store
But it wasn't much fun
It doesn't take long when you're shopping for one
Standing in line I thought I saw you walk in
And that's when it started all over again

What in the world am I gonna do about you
Oh your memory keeps coming back
From out of the blue
Oh well I try

Ever since you strolled into the room
Believe me that it's not my intention

So if you're up for taking a chance on love
I can't see a better time than this

[Chorus]
So baby why not tonight
This could be the start of something right
Hey you can take it easy
We can take it so slow
We can take it anywhere that you'd like to go
So baby why not tonight
The stars are out and I'm sure they'll agree
Oh it's a perfect night for falling in love
So why not fall in love with me

Oh maybe we could go out for some dinner
And later on how we could do the town
Ya know I consider myself a winner
Just to have a boy like you around

Then if you're up for doing some dancing
Yeah I know a place they dance until the dawn
Anything you like will be alright

Oh don't touch me there

Oh these arms
You can wrap around me gently
And your fingers
You can run them through my hair
But there's one place that's off bounds
From the last time love came 'round
When it comes to my heart
Don't touch me there

Last time I gave my heart so sweetly it broke
He broke it so completely
And even now it's more then I can bear
Now someday I know I'll try again

That I'd find another to take the place of you

When somebody makes me feel the way you did
They say he's out there
They tell me someday I'll forget
I'll believe it when I feel it

This one hurts the worst
His love flowed like a river
Now I'm dying of thirst
If loving him too much is why
I lost him in the end
Then I hope I can live long enough
To make that same mistake again

Well they say that love can be so strong that it's the choking kind
I never thought I'd see the day when love would be a crime
Mistakes can cost a lot and it
Sometimes we lose to win

Each time duty calls you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart

When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know its not too late 'cause you'll always have a place to go
When whoever's in New England's through with you

I hear the winter time up north can last forever
I've been told its beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear

I packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again there's just one thing you outta know
When the icy winds blow through you remember that its me
Who feels the cold most of all

But until I met you
I hardly used them at all
I should say no

Honey you will be the first one
To watch this angel fall

So you can take the wings off me
Lay them down so carefully
Hold me close tonight you'll see

I want peace on earth for Christmas
In a world where there's not one hungry child

Conquers fear and hate
All I'm asking for is a little more love

And he climbs up on his sleigh
And calls out to his reindeer
Off they fly away
Oh tonight he'll make a million dreams appear
While he wishes that his own dreams would come true this year

You know there's a reason we are all here in front of Grandma and

And if Trevor and E.P. would quit fighting long enough and be real quiet
This little song might help ya understand

Long ago in a stable there was a baby being born
His parents were Joseph and Mary
And Joseph's big ole heart was torn
Cause he couldn't find a decent place for Mary to have her child
But Mary said it just seemed just right and she blessed it with her

Cause what made it special was the baby in her arms
God sent Him down to give the world a second chance for you and I
That's why we have Christmas at this time each year
It's the baby's birthday party that brings us so much cheer

Now kids the presents that all of you exchange on Christmas
Represents the gifts that baby Jesus received the night he was born
He got all his presents from three wise men
Who followed a star
And walked a long long way to the stable
So everytime you tear open one of your presents
Think about that baby and say
Happy birthday Jesus
I'll open this one for you

Cause what made it special was the baby in her arms
God sent Him down to give the world a second chance for you and I
That's why we have Christmas at this time each year

Called up the stairs for us to hurry

The rest of the gang by noon
We spent the day watching football and breaking in toys
Helping out in the kitchen 
Catching up on old news

When the dinner bell rang

Before anyone else could utter a word
Oh the little one bowed her head

So you've got to let your love shine through
Your eyes, your smile
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside
Your heart, you'll find
Somebody wants to be a part of your life
And if you just believe
And say that's what you're gonna do
One day love will find it's way to you
Oh yes it will
One day love will find it's way to you
Don't you think you're the only one
Oh somewhere in the world
There's a lonely heart looking for someone
You've got to let your love shine through
Your eyes, your smile
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside
Your heart, you'll find
Somebody wants to be a part of your life
Cause your eyes, your smile
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside

Reba McEntire,"I know that you've seen love walk out the door once or twice.  
I know that  you've seen it all, waiting by the telephone, 
You didn't get the call.  Well baby let me tell ya, you're looking 
At me with suspicious eyes, but they'll never be confirmed.  

If there was someone else I wouldn't be here now. 
Cause you're the only one I want my arms around.   
And I'm telling you the truth and now I'll tell ya why.  
If there was someone else I'd be with him tonight.

No time for doubts, I'm gonna turn your heart around.

Reba McEntire,"She looks at the clock, it's a quarter past nine.  
She hears his car as he pulls in the drive.  
Dinner's still waiting from hours before.  
She knows he's been drinking when he walks through the door.  
In anger he strikes out and she starts to cry.  
How much more can she take, how much more can
She lie.  

And she fell down the stairs again.  
But it hasn't happened since she don't know when.  
Was it in spring when she packed up the kids, or
Maybe in winter with his job on the skids.  
Oh but just like before she'll have to 
Pretend that she fell down the stairs again.  

A short time ago, she started 
A job, serving chicken fried steak and corn on the cob.  
She started out shy, but she ended up sure, 
That a ticket to anywhere could be the cure.  
But he couldn't handle her change for the better.  
She tried to leave him , but he wouldn't let her.  
He says he's sorry, he'd never mean it.  
He swears it won't happen again.  But she's so confused, 
She wants to believe it. She just wants this nightmare to end.  

And she fell down the stair again. 
But it hasn't happened since she don't know when.

Reba McEntire,"You take the records, I'll take the stereo.  
You get the TV, and I'll take the radio.  
I'll keep the dishes, and you the pots and pans.  
You'll need a  new car more than me, so I'll take the second hand.  
We'll each keep our own friends, divide the rest in two.  
The older kids seem to understand,
Still there's one thing left to do. 
It's over in the corner, 
Our little one sits and cries.  
And behind that swell of tears 
She's asking with her eyes. 

What you gonna do about me, 
What you gonna do about me.  
Is it daddy on the weekend, mama rest of the week.  
Will I have to make new friends, live on a 
Different street.  
Who's gonna be the one who tucks me into sleep. 
Oh what  you gonna do, what you gonna do about me.  

I gave her a hug, she pushed me away.  
I said in time you'll understand, 
And maybe we both will someday.  
I  wiped her tears, and said ""It won't be so bad."", 
She said ""Will you still be my mommy, will he still be my dad?""

Reba McEntire,"Sometimes you treat me so cruel. 
I don't think I can take it.
Sometimes you hurt me so bad, I just want to die.
But in a moment like this.
With a tender touch and a lover's kiss,
You put all of my
pain aside and I say to you with my eyes,

[Chorus]
Do right by me and make it last forever.
Tonight I need to be here in your arms.
Where the  hurting ends and the love begins.
Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong. 

It feels so good to be so close like we were when
we started oh back when the troubles were few
and the loving was blind.
Funny how people so close 
Know the things to
say that can hurt the most.
Baby why can't we just be kind and capture this moment in time.

[Chorus]",Do Right by Me
Reba McEntire,"Do you hold her all night long?
Do you sing her our love song? 
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak?

Do you promise her the moon?
Does she think loves coming soon? 
Does she know each move is made from memory?
Oh darlin'

Everytime you touch her (Every time) 
Everytime you touch her think of me.

When she reaches out for you ,
the same way my arms do,
does she know the truth your love belongs to me? Oh baby 
Do you wonder in the dark if she sees into your heart?
Do you close your eyes so she will never see?

Oh baby!
Everytime you touch her ,
(Every time) 
Everytime you touch her.

I can wish you love,

Reba McEntire,"When I heard that familiar voice,
My heart stopped dead in it's tracks.
Across the room I could see him there,
A ghost from my past.
But he's too caught up to notice me.
She must be his new love.
I never dreamed that it would hurt this much,
It's just

I know how he feels.
How warm his touch is.
Oh how he feels.
How soft his kiss is.
And it cuts right down to the bone
Cause I let him go.
I know how he cares.
How strong his love can be,
When he believes it's real.
Oh I've been there.
I know how he feels.

As long as I kept him out of site,
I kept from going out of my mind.
Tried to believe that leaving him was some how justified.
But tonight there's no denying what a love like his is worth
He once looked at me the way he's looking at her.
What a lucky girl.",I Know How He Feels
Reba McEntire,"You sure know what you're doing holding me this way.
And I'll go where you lead me 
Anywhere you say. 
You've got me where you want me.
So darling please be kind.
Before you take it all, and I 
make that final fall.

You've got to keep in mind I'm
a new fool at an old game.
A kid out of school, trying to find my way.
But I don't know the rules, teach me how to play.
I'm just a new fool at an old game.

Maybe I'm a dreamer, or maybe I'm naive.
But when you say you love me I start to believe
That coal can turn to diamonds.
And this night will never end.
But if it isn't so,  and I cry when you go.

You've got to understand that

With the tears that fill my life does it show.
So listen to my heart beat once again.
Because of you I hope this feeling never ends.

Silly me.
I fell in love again.
We started out as friends.
You'd think I would have learned from the hurt before.
Foolish me.
Should I have closed the door.
Promised, even swore
To never love this way.
Oh foolish me
 
They say that love's a chance you take.
You know I've had my share.

You so  long that I know every move you make
Every breath you take.
Lord I feel it so strong.
Sometimes I don't know where I end, 
And where you begin.

Oh you make me so happy,
Feeling like this 
There's so much ahead

To keep it so good

A love to last, past Saturday night.
And I'd  like to know it's more than love at first sight.

Can't seem to find somebody, someone to care.
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere.

I do all my Sunday dreaming, and all my scheming. 
Every minute, every hour, every day 
And I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of 
Lover Who will show me the way.

To keep me warm when Monday's and Tuesday's grow cold.  
And I need a love for all my life to have
And to hold.

If I were only lonely
Then maybe I'd know what to do

Out of the corner of my eye.

Cause you're the one I dream about,
When I fall asleep at night. 
And you're the one I think about 
When he turns out the light

How I wish that he was you tonight.

Just won't be still.

That one of my musical influences was bob wills music.
When I was in college we used to
Sneak down to the Oklahoma and Texas border and go to dances.
And it didn't get any better than dancing to bob wills music.

And listened to her own heart beat

Am I the only one who cares what I do
Cause if I'm the only one then who can I turn to
Oh moon can you tell me that it's not just me and you

That's all I always say
It's just excuses
So I can do things my own way

I know I will be saved
No my world won't crumble 
I'll make it through the hardest days

Than to never know you're wrong

Reba McEntire,"Tell me why do you put up with my foolish ways
You never take to heart the crazy things I say
Oh I know you could walk out on me any day
There must be a darn good reason why you'd even want to stay

[Chorus]
You must really love me
How can it be true
There are things you'll take from me
I won't even take from you
Every time I fall apart
You always pull me through
You must really love me
As much as I love you
You must really love me
As much as I love you

I appreciate the honesty you've shown to me
And the way you tell your friends that you belong to me
And when you hold me tight it always sets me free
Oh this must be the way that true love was meant to be

Reba McEntire,"Red sun a-rising, over the hill
I've had enough of this desert to last from now until
I'm tired of living day-to-day and hand-to-mouth
This could be the day I finally find my way out

[Chorus]
I'm gonna climb that mountain high
I'm gonna see what's on the other side
I'm gonna kiss this town good-bye
I'm gonna climb that mountain

How I arrived here, heaven only knows
Seems more like the kind of place the devil would've chose
To spend my life here, is more than I can do
I know somewhere down the road my dream will come true

If I stay here forever
What will I have to show
But if I make it over
Then everyone will know
I'm gonna climb that mountain high

Reba McEntire,"He says he loves her, what can you say to that
He's made up his mind and there ain't nothin' you can do
And as you swallow hard, maybe you drive all night
Tryin' to figure out where the whole thing started goin' wrong
And in the silence something begins to unravel
You never knew him like you'll be knowing him now

[Chorus]
Fallin' out of love and back into your life
Pullin' your heart out from under the knife
Closin' the door on all those dreams you used to know
Fallin' out of love and back on your feet
Turnin' away from that dead end street
Finding out that nothing feels as good as letting go

That's when he called you up out of the blue one day
And you know he thinks he's talkin' to the girl you used to be
So when you tell him he's just a memory
Ain't it funny how his voice cracks when you're sayin' goodbye
And in the silence something begins to unravel
He never knew you like he'll be knowing you now

[Chorus]

Oh and nothing feels as good as letting go
He said he loved her",Fallin' Out of Love
Reba McEntire,"I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin
Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood

She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
When she started to speak
She looked at a pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heel shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin' Mama what do I do
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy
And they'll be nice to you

She said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out
Well it's up to you
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly
What my Mama's been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I don't know when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame you know
I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

It wasn't very long after a benevolent man
Took me off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite

I charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
In an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrite
That would call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had

But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ear

She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Your Mama's gonna help you uptown

I guess she did",Fancy
Reba McEntire,"What a surprise
Never thought I'd hear from you
Whatever made you call

Things that I never thought would come from you

Now you tell me
That you love me desperately
Why did you wait so long to say those words to me
Oh you made me crazy
I don't know what to do
Now you tell me
Not that's there's somebody new

I think you should know
There's someone here with me
O bet he can tell you must be someone dear to me

Rumor has it you love her too
Talk is cheap but the price is high when it's true
Rumor has it she has you

And people here will gossip when there's nothing else to say
I wouldn't have believed my ears but I see it in your eyes
The stories going 'round this town aren't lies

Reba McEntire,"That old picture with my arm around you
Tore it to pieces this morning at two
Score one for me
I took your portrait off the living room wall
Then I started on the ones in the hall
Had a bonfire
I decided it was time to forget
So I got rid of every picture you left

[Chorus:]
But what do I do with this picture of you in my mind
I close my eyes and I still see you saying goodbye
I know I'd be okay if I could just throw away
This picture

I walk alone down a crowded street
And see your face in everybody I meet

And she's been sitting in the lobby since nine

And time can move so slow

She says she's expecting company

Reba McEntire,"Bobby pleaded guilty to the charges that they read
As they led him from the courtroom, a young voice turned his head
A little boy, dressed in blue, was standing at the rail
He said ""I hope they kill you, I hope you go to hell""
They put Bobby in a jail with forty other men
They all knew what he had done, they were glad to take him in
They'd all seen the headlines about Bobby and his wife
How they loved each other, and how he took her life
Day after day, he sat alone
Night after night, they'd hear him sing his song (he'd sing)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around
I am not afraid of what people say or do
The only thing I fear is being here...without you

The little boy dressed up in blue grew up to be a man
When he fell in love himself, he came to understand
How it was that Bobby took the life they both adored
Cause Bobby couldn't stand to see her suffer anymore
He took out the papers from the trunk beneath his bed
And all the years just disappeared as through his tears he read
The stories of the accident that robbed his mama's mind
And the man who held her in his arms and chose to cut the line
And the one about the man who sits alone
Year after year, singing his song (he'd sing)

[Chorus]

The young man drove his car up, and parked outside the gate
They led him to a cold gray room, the guard told him to wait
When the guard brought Bobby in, the young man finally knew
He still missed his mama, but he'd missed his daddy too
And when the guard left the two of them alone
He took Bobby in his arms, and the young man sang the song

Daddy, I'll take care of you, I'll never let you down
No harm will ever come to you as long as I'm around
You have taught me not to fear what people say or do

I know I should tell him

Should I ruin my life or my pride

But not to me",He Wants to Get Married
Reba McEntire,"Looking back over the years
Of All the things I've always meant to say
But words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all of the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answering

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

[Chorus]
Cause the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

[Chorus]",The Heart Won't Lie
Reba McEntire,"It's your call, It's her
Would you rather take it in the other room
She's hangin' on and so am I
Yeah, I know all about it don't act so surprised

It's time to end this game you're playin'
She's not the only one who's waitin' on the line

It's your call
It's up to you
And I won't try to stop you if you go
But if you stay tell her goodbye
I can't take another minute
I can't stand another night

Of wondering if I even matter
It's something only you can answer
Here's the phone, It's your call

There's no easy way out this time
Cause I won't live this way
She called here to talk to you
With a message that I can't take

Oh, I've got to know if I still matter
It's somethin' only you can answer
Here's the phone, It's your call",It's Your Call
Reba McEntire,"I guess it finally dawned on me you're gone
Well maybe I can make it on my own
I don't stay up wonderin' if you'll call
And some nights I don't dream of you at all

Your memory's still hurtin' deep inside
That's something I'm still learnin' how to hide
Though this heart of mine has lost an ache or two
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

[Chorus]
Lookin' down the line sometimes
I think I see a change
But then I think again and think of you
Here and there I've turned a stone
But the mountain hasn't moved
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

I'm still afraid of turning out the light
And it takes all my strength to face the night
Cause that's the time I face the bitter truth
I've only turned a lighter shade of blue

[Chorus]",Lighter Shade of Blue
Reba McEntire,"The stars are way out of reach, they all said
Those are crazy schemes that fill your fool head
But it was clear from the moment we met
We could prove them wrong

All my life I heard that same old story
Dare to dream and you'll just be sorry
I might have given up my shot at glory
But then you came along

[Chorus]
We're not expecting this to go down easy
We're not expecting any sweet dreams
Sure thing
But with a little luck
Could be we'll be
Winding up the way we planned
Heading for our promised land
Holding one last good hand

Something's calling us I know you hear it
Day by day I feel us growing near it
But once you find a kindred spirit
There's nothing you can do

Oh, baby I'm not saying we won't ever stumble
Some days will be rough and tumble
You and I know that life's a gamble
But I'll
Bet mine on you

[Chorus]",One Last Good Hand
Reba McEntire,"People love to talk
And Lord I've heard it all
A rumor's not a stranger in this town
Now me, I pay no mind
But it's hittin' home this time
Now I've been told you've gone and let me down

[Chorus]
I need to hear it straight from you
Is it rumor or truth
It would break my heart in two
But if it's gonna be bad news
I need to hear it straight from you
I need to hear it straight from you

They all know her name
You didn't spare me any shame
I wonder did you even try to hide
I think that you owe me
Just a little honesty
And even though you told me with your eyes

[Chorus]",Straight from You
Reba McEntire,"You talked me into moving in and giving you my key
You said you'd be a mess now if it hadn't been for me
You said I stole your heart away by looking in your eyes
I wonder now how many times you sold that pack of lies

If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back
Take it back

You told me I was everything you wanted and more
Then tell me what you're doing now sneaking out the back door
You're bringing home flowers and a bottle of Chablis
You forgot I don't drink wine I know that bottle's not for me

Oh, you must think I'm blind
And I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice
All the nights I spend alone

Well, I'm not one for sitting 'round in some ole pity pool
You think you got a ticket and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder but your playing days are through
At least they are with me cause babe, I got no use for you

Tonight laying on the street
Babe, your bag is packed
So, take it back",Take It Back
Reba McEntire,"On a cool gray morning, I watched with my own eyes
As he headed out the driveway and finally out of my life
Oh I knew he'd soon be miles from my mind
So why should tears start fallin' after all this time

[Chorus]
How can a memory last this long
Will he ever go away
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today
Will he ever go away

Shouldn't I start living my life for myself
Shouldn't it be easy to fall in love with someone else
Oh why should it be his touch I feel in the dark
And will his voice always echo through my heart

[Chorus]",Will He Ever Go Away
Reba McEntire,"I've been to Colorado
Where the mountains touch the sky
And I've done other things in life

To lift my spirits high
But nothin' that I've ever tried to do
Has taken me as high as lovin' you

'cause you lift me up up up
Up to heaven
When you gently lay me down
You lift me up up up
Up to heaven
Yes you make my world go round

I never try to get away
On daydreams anymore
Love's taken me to places
That I've never been before

But if it's not heaven
When you're holdin' me
Then it's the way that heaven oughta be
'cause you lift me up",(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven
Reba McEntire,"Thought we could make it on our own
Looks like we didn't get too far
Love has found its way back home
Guess time just couldn't change 
The way we are

That old feeling comes so easy
When your body's close to mine
I think our crazy hearts have finally made their
Always one more time

[Chorus]
Don't say good night, say good morning
We can make it this time if we try
Don't say good night, say good morning
And in the morning
Never say goodbye

The night's ours and we're alone
I know I've wasted too much time
Chasing rainbows that I could never run out
I've come back to make you mine

Don't let the morning come too early
Don't leave me here to face the day
Take me in your arms and never let me go
And don't let the feelings slip away

Reba McEntire,"No need talking
I can't see it
Someone set your heart on fire
Now she's gone and all she left is hurt
Lots of burning sweet desire

[Chorus]
So let me ease the fever and erase the pain
Let me make a believer out of you again
Hold me close and let me love the tears away
Let me ease the fever and erase the pain

Let your tears fall on my shoulder
Let your arms around me tight
Yesterday is gone forever
Let's make tomorrow start tonight

Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you

For my broken heart

Clocks still tickin', life goes on
Radio still plays a song
As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place
And it takes all the strength I've got
To stumble to the coffee pot
The first of many lonely mornings I've got to face
You call to see if I'm ok
Look out the window and I just say

Last night I prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you

Reba McEntire,"The greatest man I never knew lived just down the hall,
and ev'ry day we said hello but never touched at all.
He was in his paper. I was in my room.
How was I to know he thought I hung the moon?

The greatest man I never knew came home late ev'ry night,
He never had to much to say. Too much was on his mind.
I never really knew him, oh and now it seems so sad.
Ev'rything he gave to us took all he had.

Then the days turned into years, and the mem'ries to black and white.
He grew cold like an old winter wind blowing across my life.

Meeting some friends
Sharing some laughs
Not thinking of anything else
Then one of them leaned over my shoulder
And all at once the party was over

And suddenly it all came back to me
Then all the walls around my heart
Came crashing at my feet

How could they know
What it would do

It's a miracle from heaven
That it fills me through and through
Like a feeling that surrounds us
Touching me touching you
When you wrap your love around me it's not hard to understand
Why there's nothing like the love between and woman and a man

Well the father's love is quiet
But it's there for all to see

You're not in love with me,so why can't I forget,
I'm just your used to be?
It's wrong and yet,
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing to do,
For I'm a puppet, and I just can't seem to break the string,
I say I'll let you go, but then my heart says no,
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.
 
I told this heart of mine our love would never be,
But then I hear your voice and something stirs inside of me,
Somehow I can't dismiss the mem'ry of your kiss, 
Guess my heart has a mind of its own. 

No matter what I do,
No matter what I say, mo matter how I try, 
I just can't turn the other way,
When I'm with someone new, I always think of you;
Guess my heart has a mind of its own.  

You're not in love with me,so why can't I forget,
I'm just your used to be?

Quarter moon walking though the Milky Way

It's the right time of the night for making love

No use talking when the shadows fall
Night bird's calling and he says it all

I always kiss my baby

I never hurt my baby

That dog she stole my baby
She rock and rolled my baby
Swept him away from me by storm
She came on like lightning
Stole all my thunder
Took my sunshine away
She came on like lightning
Stole all my thunder
Took my sweet sunshine away

I learned a lover's lesson
No time for second guessing
When I fall under some man's spell
I don't care if he's taken
It won't be my heart breaking
Some other fool be crying well

Waiting for a brand new owner

On a GI bill and daydreams
But she tried until they told her
He was never coming home

Bought by the high school teacher
Sold it to a baptist preacher
Who couldn't pay his taxes
Cause his flock had gone astray
So the banker fenced the yard in
Planted trees and half a garden
The man from Dallas kept it up
Till he moved away

You and I we built the playroom
For the baby that came too soon
Spent money that we didn't have
Trying to make this place our own

After all these years of trying
Honey we'll just bought this house

Reba McEntire,"When you've climbed the highest mountain
When a cloud holds the sunshine in
Suddenly there's a valley
Where the Earth knows peace with men

When a star hides the distant rainbow
And you think you can't find a friend
Suddenly there's a valley
Where friendships never end

Touched only by the season
Swept clean by the ? rain
Surveyed by every bluebird
And kissed by the falling rain

When you think there's no bright tomorrow
And you feel you can't try again
Suddenly there's a valley
Where hope and love begin

We waltzed together and knew 
That we never be changing partners again

So while the music's playing
Let's hold each other tight
You're heart and mine
In three quarter mine
And we'll waltz in love tonight

The troubles of our busy life
Are dancing in our heads
We barely hear the radio
Till the waltz begins to play
And there's no concealing

Just sweeps our hearts away

Live in this town
And I had to run into him
When I saw him there
On that busy street
Those feelings came back again

There was no where to run
No where to hide
He walked up to me
Looked in my eyes

And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him
Still

He said how've you been
It's great to see you again
You're really a sight for sore eyes
I said I can't complain
Oh, I'm doin' fine
We talked
As the people rushed by

We laughed about old times
And all we went through
That's when he hugged me
And said I've missed you

And still
My world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him
Still

That's when she walked up to him
He said this is my wife
I gave my best smile
But I was dying inside
He said we gotta go now
It's getting late
It was so good to see you
And then they walked away

And still
My world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him

And hard to hold

At that open door
You got what you wanted
And you still want more
Well look at me

She's checking out every man in the room right now.
Don't go telling her about right or wrong.

To find some lasting comfort in the arms of a lovers fire.
Driven by a desperate hunger.
To the dark of the neon light.

She hears him say, hey, can I buy you a drink.
And sees the pale white circle where he wears his ring.
She knows she's dealing her a dangerous hand.
The consequences of a one night stand.

With only one desire.
To find some lasting comfort in the arms of a lovers fire.

I wish that I could tell you
But you're askin' me things that I don't know
I wish that I could tell you

Words that I would say
Sound as empty as the way you feel inside
While the silence in between
Tells me everything that you deny

I don't know how to help you
I wish that I could tell you
How to tell me goodbye

I don't know how you leave it all behind
I wish that I could tell you
Is it true a heart heals itself with time
I wish that I could tell you

How do you choose?
Do you hurt 'em with the truth or with a lie?
Where do you go to find the courage
You know I could never find?

I don't know how to help you
I wish that I could tell you
How to tell me goodbye

Where do you turn, where do you go?
When you've finally reached the end of the road?
How do you say it, I just don't know

Keeping all those hearts up in the air
Don't you know in time you're bound to stumble

A dollar a wrinkle and less then a nickel a dream

The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

When I add up all the countless nights I cried myself to sleep
And all the broken promises you somehow failed to keep
He can't blame me

He's the one who left me too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison
I tried to make a home
My love slowly died but the fire inside still burned
And the arms of a stranger was the only place left to turn

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in my needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

Bought a beat up camper truck
Turned her pink slip in to personnel
And tore her time card up

Would the stars really keep you up
On a clear desert night

With a front seat full of road maps
To help her lose her way

Looks like I picked the wrong night. 
Not to fall in love with you. 

I briefly resisted but my heart insisted. 
It was gonna be giving in. 
Hard as I was trying there was no denying.
Which one of us would win.

And right then I knew.

You told me your story and I thought about mine
You said when you lost her you lost everything
It all started having a familiar ring

So I asked you to take me some place quiet
We wound up at the river for the rest of the night
Somewhere around the break of day
I could hear it coming from a mile away

So don't say that word
Not the one we both heard too much
You may think you do but you don't
It's just the fear of being alone

Reckless hearts can clear a path
Wider than a hurricane's aftermath
We've both traveled down that road
Where in the name of love anything goes
Like a child in the night
With no one to hold you
And tell you everything's gonna be all right

But that's no reason to jump the gun

So let me bite my tongue and remind myself",The Fear of Being Alone

Reba McEntire,"Well back in 1876 an ol' boy named Bell
Invented a contraption that we know so well
By the 1950's they were in everybody's home
There's a crazy little thing they call the telephone
Now there's one on every corner, in the back of every bar
You can get one in your briefcase, on a plane or in your car

So tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

There's no problem gettin' to me
Baby you can dial direct
I got call forwarding, call waiting
You can even call collect

When the service man he told me that my phone was workin' fine
And I've come to the conclusion the trouble isn't with my line
I'm sure the operator will be glad to put you through
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

So tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

There better been a flood, a landslide of mud
A fire that burns up the wires
And thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud
A natural disaster I know nothin' about

Tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

Tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you",Why Haven't I Heard from You
Reba McEntire,"Love is a powerful word
A little word that oughta mean something
Love better mean what it says
Say what you mean or it doesn't mean nothing
Love is a dangerous door to open
If you don't feel it when its spoken

[Chorus]
Sometimes I said it when I really didn't mean it
Just to throw away a promise I knew wasn't true
It meant a little less to me every time I did it
But I never said I love you from the heart
Til I said it to you

You made me tell you the truth
And that truth was a total revelation
I see I have it in me

Now I can speak without any hesitation
I love you comes so freely
For the first time I believe me

Yours right besides it on this document
Too many lawyers, too many angry words
So much we didn't say, so much we never heard
Do you remember
When I was all that you were living for
Back before the war

[Chorus]
Back before the broken vows
The shattered trust, this empty house
When nothing really mattered but us
Back before we climbed too high
My dreams were yours, your dreams were mine
back before we fell so out of touch
Back before the war

Children's laughter trailing down the hall
Tiny footsteps, God how I miss it all
It's not as simple as who's right and who's to blame
How could we fly so high to be shot down in flames
Do you remember
When you were all that I was living for
Back before the war

[Chorus]

Stacks of paper, I guess this is where we sign
Strange how your signature so closely matches mine
I never dreamed our love would ever come to this
Avoiding each other's eyes still craving your tenderness

When love was all that we were living for
Back before the war

Reba McEntire,"A soft summer evening
Another time, another place
He brought her red roses
On their very first date
She got carried away by the things that he said
Time would erase them
But she would never forget

And the roses heard it all
The rose in her hair, the rose in her hand
The roses in the paper on the wall
There's a story to tell if roses could talk

Somewhere close to midnight
Another time, another place
She lays in the darkness
With tears on her face
While he talks in his sleep
Confessing his love
And calls out a name she's never heard of

And the roses heard it all
The rose in the vase that set by their bed
The roses in the paper on the wall
There's a story to tell if roses could talk

She never told him
She never let him see her cry
Only the roses know
What she kept deep down inside

The years took their toll
And the angels took her away
Now there's family and friends
At a cold winter's grave
He kneels down and whispers
?You're the only love I have known?
As he lays a rose on a cold marble stone

But the roses heard it all
The rose from her garden, the rose in her bible
The roses in the paper on the wall
What a story they'd tell if roses could talk

So cry no more on the shore a dream
Will take us out to sea
Forevermore, forevermore

Close your eyes and dream
And you can be with me
Neath the waves, through the caves of hours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone

Close the window, calm the lights
And it will be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
And learn how to pretend

Repetido ya, lo antiguo pasara
Fue amor, amantes why dolor
Con el viento al volar
Abrazame, oh abrazame

Sin mirar vuelve a vivir, ambos sonando asi
Sin importarnos mas deja ya, regresa a vivir
Empieza a disfrutar, solo yo, sola tu

As the light turned green he changed the subject fast.
He started talkin' 'bout football as the drove right past.

Seventeen years old she was out with her friends.
They started drinkin' at some party 'til she was three sheets to the wind.
Her momma always told her she could call no matter what.

And give yourself a little time to think.

Her every breath is weaker than the last.
And lately when she sleeps she talks about the past.
Her husband knows she's tired of holdin' on.
She looks at him and says I want to go home.

Reba McEntire,"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start that you
Would love me more than her
If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

Feels like I'm living in a world gone mad
Look around, all around it's just the same
People just rush everywhere

No time to ever take the time to care
We're the ones, we're the losers in this game
So where is the tenderness we sacrifice for progress
And where is the love we need, you know it makes me wonder

What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand?
(Reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice?
(Sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things

What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart?

What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark?
(Tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow

Somehow it's all up to us, gotta take this world
Make it a world of love, gotta do it now
Gotta find a way to make a change somehow
There's gotta be a way for us to make it better

What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand?
(Reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice?

What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark?

Here in our hearts, oh, the answer is there
If we only would look inside them
We can make it better, we can make it better
If we try together

What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand?

The doctor gave me thirty days
But I must have had my mama's will
And Gods amazing grace

I guess I'll keep on livin'
Even if this loves to die for

You're walking out and I'm not trying
To change your mind cause I was born to be

A victim of circumstance
The one who ought a give up,but she's just
Too hard headed!

Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter

I don't believe in self pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me

I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
And though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I want to be

To hold your hand like I used to, I'm through with you
You're a heck of a singer and powerful man but you surround yourself
With people who demand so little of you

You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along right with you, you said
""I need you"", then you changed the words and added harmony
Then you sang the song you had written for me to someone new

Oh, but nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel things are right
When I know they're wrong, nobody sings a love song quite like you

Sing your song sweet music man, travel the world
With a six piece band that does for you what you tell 'em to
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun came back on you

Sing your song sad music man, makin' your living
Doing one night stands, they're through with you
They don't need you, you're still a heck of a singer but a broken man
But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to

Oh, and nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along and nobody else
Can make me feel things are right when they're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you

Talkin' talk never miss a beat,

When will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong
So wrong
And turn on the light and pick up the phone and just call
And lay pride aside
If I had any sense left at all

Voices call that only I can hear
Who would have thought love was somethin' I would fear
Almost hold, almost smell, almost taste

Reba McEntire,"Moving Oleta was the hardest thing he'd done
The nurses saw an old woman cryin'
But he saw the love of his life
She don't know where she is
But she knows this isn't home
Love is a hard, hard road

He met her in the summer of '37 
in a brush arbor down on the Rush Creek shore
He loved her black hair and the mischief in her smile
But she won him with her eyes

All the years and children gone, 
he still sees her the same
Love is a hard, hard road

He woke up each morning and drove into town
He stayed all day till her dinner came
Then he took her to a room, leaned on her wheelchair like a walker
Covered her with a quilt she'd made
Only God and a couple of nurses helped the old man shoulder the load
Love is a hard, hard road

He said ""They tell me this is all that's left, 
Say this hell on Earth is best, 
I lost all those reasons and I still don't understand""
He cursed his body old and weak
Tears of failure burned his cheeks
He said ""Oh, don't you know I prayed to die before this day""
Love is a hard, hard road

There's a shadow much darker than the valley of death
When you fear the reaper night not come today
The line 'em up in Laz-E-Boys out in the sunroom
The TV keeps the quiet away

When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup
He jokes about his love life
And tells her he's about ready to give up
That's when she says I've been there before
But keep on looking because maybe who your looking for is

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
Its that blue eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one
Maybe he could fall in love with

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
The moment they both missed until that day
When he saws his future in her eyes
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waitin' on

Reba McEntire,"My daddy is a rancher
He's wrangled cattle dang near all his life
He also liked to rodeo
He traveled around with four kids and a wife

Well his old ranch is rocky
But his ropes sail smooth for several years
He worked real hard
And roped real good
And tried to get his ranch out in the clear

He didn't want us kids to rodeo
He wanted more out of life for us
Maybe banking, or a lawyer
Or maybe even driving some old bus

Well that's when we took up singing
And his pride grew greater day by day
And I know his eyes grew misty
The night I sang up on the Opry stage

Now his ranch is so much bigger
The the days when he first started
The grass grows now where none used to be
His roping got him started
Cattle prices made it better
And he's trying to get his ranch out in the clear

Five years ago September, he bought more steers and hung up all his
Ropes
But he often tells the stories about the rodeos he won and cowboy jokes
Well it's funny that the first big roping that he won some thirty years
Ago
Was the same day that I sang on the stage of the Grand Old Opry show

[Chorus]

Now he's feeding cattle
Toting hay
And branding the Y.O.
And his hired hand's there to help him
And she also cooks their meals when they get home
They built their ranch together
And listening to the kids sing through the years

Well they worked real hard and roped real good and now they got their ranch

But nobody seems to notice
The saddest crime of all

There's a guy who just got taken
And it cuts him like a knife

But it kills you just the same
It's murder when a true love dies
Right before your very eyes

And as soon as one is over
Another one will start
Every second someone breaks
Every second someone breaks a heart

If you've got someone who loves you
Be careful all the time
Do you know where your love is tonight
Cause there's always someone trying
To find the perfect crime
And you never know just when
They'll strike

And you better watch your man

Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation

We can ride it together, 
Making love with each other 

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever

We can ride it together,
Making love with each other,

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, 
From one lover to another",Islands in the Stream [Live]
Reba McEntire,"When our check bounces at the store
And the whole world seems at war
You bring me peace of mind once more

And the stack of bills just won't wait
Ooo, you take the worries away
With just a little love

And affection
You bring a touch of perfection
To a world that's sometimes crazy

You make me see why the good Lord made me
And you can do miracles

When our old car won't run
And all my dreams come undone
You'll make it right won't ya hun

But she didn't blow out the birthday lights
Jamie and her momma had another big fight
She locked herself in her room

She climbed up on her windowsill
Sat and stared at the cars on the street
And listened to her own heart beat
And whispered to the moon

Am I the only one who cares what I do
Cause if I'm the only one then who can I turn to
Oh moon can you tell me that it's not just me and you
Or am I the only one who cares what I do

The moon said Jamie can't you hear yourself
You're acting like there ain't nobody else
Come on girl take a big ole breath
You know what you gotta do

There's one more thing before I go
A woman's been standing at the window below
Searching for the words to let you know
How much she loves you too

And you're not the only one who cares what you do
And I'm not the only one that you can turn to
Now Jamie please believe me
It's not just me and you

I heard your voice and I knew
The sky turned a new shade of blue

And watch him watch Big Bird a while

Beside a one eyed teddy bear

And whisper kiss mommy goodbye

Just about to go 'round again

Like I have all the answers
I hope, I have the ones you need
I've never really done this, now I know what scared is

Sometimes, I'll protect you from everything that's wrong
Other times, I'll let you just find out on your own
But that's when you'll be growin'
And the whole time I'll be knowin'

You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
You're gonna cry but know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair but if you hang in there

You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me
You're gonna be

I'm afraid you'll have to suffer through some of my mistakes
Lord, knows I'll be trying, oh, to give you what it takes
What it takes to know the difference between getting by and livin'

?Cause anything worth doing is worth doing all the way
Just know you'll have to live with all the choices that you make
So make sure you're always givin' way more than you're takin'

You're gonna fly with every dream you chase
You're gonna cry, but know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair, but if you just hang in there

You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good

Reba McEntire,"I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin
Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood

She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
When she started to speak
She looked at a pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heel shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin' Mama what do I do
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy
And they'll be nice to you

She said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out
Well it's up to you
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly 
What my Mama's been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I don't know when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame you know
I might have been born just plain white trash 
But Fancy was my name

Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

It wasn't very long after a benevolent man
Took me off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite

I charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
In an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites
That would call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had

But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ear

She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Your Mama's gonna move you up town

It's toys and clothes in backpacks
Is everybody in okay?
Let's go see dad
Same time in the same spot
Corner of the same old parking lot
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad
We trade a couple words and looks
And kids again
Every other weekend

Every other weekend
Very few exceptions
I pick up the love we made in both my arms
It's movies on the sofa
Grilled cheese and cut the crust off
But that's not the way mom makes it, Daddy breaks my heart
I miss everything we used to have with her again
Every other weekend

I can't tell her I love her
I can't tell him I love him
Cause there's too many questions and ears in the car
So, I don't tell him I miss him
I don't tell her I need her
She's over me that's where we are
He's over me that's where we are
We're as close as we might ever be again
Every other weekend

Every other Saturday
First thing in the morning
I turn the TV on to make the quiet go away
I know why but I don't know why
We ever let this happen
Fallin' for forever was a big mistake
There's so much not to do and all day not do it in
Every other weekend

Every other Sunday
I empty out my backseat
While my children hug their mother in the parking lot
We don't touch, we don't talk much
Maybe goodbye to each other
As she drives away with every piece of heart I've got
I re-convince myself we did the right thing
Every other weekend

I can't tell her I love her
I can't tell him I love him
Cause there's too many questions and ears in the car
So, I don't tell him I miss him
I don't tell her I need her

they headed south but not for sun
On their skin where the storms had been

fixing windows and shigles and doors
and the tide never felt so good before

and it's beautiful
Everyday People lifting up the world

Doctor said ""Good News we caught it soon enough, we can clear this up""
But she's 30 and single with two kids to raise
times are tough these days
So her friends made some calls and the word spread around
How her bills got paid she don't know how

Laugh through the tears as a family moves in

We've seen it for a while
But there are no regrets between us
We can leave here with a smile
We have to talk about it
What we've always known
The hardest part about today
Is tonight we'll be alone
Alone

We were just two hearts
Bound for different roads
Oh why they didn't lead us to forever
We may never know
Oh I will carry you with me
I will hold on to our memories
Don't let the dreams we didn't find
Make you feel like giving up
Keep holding on and
Don't lose your faith in love

Life's gonna move on
And the pages start to turn
We'll be stronger people now
From the lessons that we've learned
This one's gonna hurt
It's a little deeper break
But just know I'm praying for you
As I watch you walk away

We were just two hearts
Bound for different roads
Oh why they didn't lead us to forever
We may never know
Oh I will carry you with me
I will hold on to our memories
Don't let the dreams we didn't find
Make you feel like giving up
Keep holding on and
Don't lose your faith in love

It can hold you, it can save you
From anything or anyone
Heaven knows who's waiting for you
When two hearts come undone

Oh I will carry you with me
I will hold on to our memories
Don't let the dreams we didn't find
Make you feel like giving up
Keep holding on and
Don't lose your faith
Oh never ever lose your faith

Don't ever lose your faith",Faith in Love

When your lost and looking for a way home
Your way home to me
I'll come out and find you
When the world around you starts a moving
Moving
And you should wonder if I still love you
Love you
If you feel a darkness coming
Rising inside
I'll make a light to guide you back home

And after all the sky is falling down
And after all the waters washed away
My love's the only promise that remains

Thinking
Nothings ever really sacred

And you're afraid you might believe it
Believe in me
And I'll give you a reason
Cause the world around us keeps on moving
Moving
And there's no doubt that
I still love you

She can whisper a prayer: ""Thank God, he's alive""

But she can't save him

She can make his coffee, in the cold light of day
She can make his excuses, tell the boss he'll be late
She can wave at the neighbors, then kiss him goodbye
And not say a word 'bout what happened last night
But she can't save him

Sometimes she dreams that he's caught in a stream
And the water keeps pulling him down
She reaches for him, as he pulls her in
She wakes just before she drowns

She can remember the man that he was
And still shed a tear for what he's become

Is just not the same late at night
He knows the danger
But he does what he does
He calls it duty
But I call it love
So here I am
While he's gone
To some foreign land

And I cry
'Cause I'm all alone
And the nights get so cold and long
And I try not to think he won't come home
But I'm sleeping with the telephone

The yellow ribbon on my neighbor's gate
Always reminds me that someone's awake
Just like me
I hear the sirens
And I watch the news
He laughs and leaves with his gun
And his blue uniform
And I pray God keeps him safe from harm

And I cry
'Cause I'm all alone
And the nights get so cold and long
And I try not to think he won't come home
But I'm sleeping with the telephone

I loose him in my darkest dreams
And my blood runs cold and my heart skips a beat
So I get up, I can't take anymore
Sometimes I hate how much I love him
But everyday I love him more

To save the best for last

I guess nothin' stays the same

Come On baby, take a look outside, it's a big blue sky


We didn't listen when they tried to tell us we were to young to know

They tried to slow us down but, we always found another way to go.

Before you know it we were waving goodbye, driving away

off into the big blue sky

We went out lookin for the best jobs kids like us could get

We got hired and fired, and worn out tired but we never quit.

To dumb to worry or wonder why

we were chasing our lives off into the big blue sky.


Chorus

I guess we were just

nothin but a big blue sky


We've had earthquakes, twisters, hurricanes, tidlewaves and hail down n our heads

We've been knocke down, sucked in

spun round, shaken up, thrown away

and left for dead

but somehow we always made it out alive

on the other side of the Big Blue Sky



Chorus

Maybe we were just crazy enough

to try and out run the rain

The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through anything.

you'll never see how good it can be

until you spread your wings and fly

baby take look at our lives it's nothing but a

Big Blue Sky


It's nothin but a big blue sky


Baby lookin back

everthing they said

Like how we wouldn't last how far we'd never get,

It's a great big lie

ain't nothin over head

nothin but a big blue sky


Chorus

Maybe we were just crazy enough

to try and out run the rain

The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through anything.

you'll never see how good it can be

until you spread your wings and fly

baby look at our lives

Take a look at our lives

Yeah look at our lives

It's nothin but a Big blue Sky


Nothin but a big blue sky


It's a big blue sky

There is nothing I've ever tried to hide.
So when you leave me not knowin' where you're goin'
I start thinkin' that we're lookin' we're lookin' at goodbye.

How about a strong shot of honesty
Don't you owe that to me

If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you

If you think you can do better than this then I guess we're done

Consider me the past.
Consider me a smile in an old photograph

Mama stood on the front porch ringin' her hands
Watched the tail lights fadin' on his black tranzam
With her precious little baby taking off inside
Staring at him with stars in her eyes
She tried to tell her but the girl might as well have been deaf
She wasn't gonna listen to a word she said

Don't go down Maggie Creek Road
With a boy lookin' like that
He'll tell ya thangs that you wanna hear
And they'll be no turnin' back
There's an oak tree down by the lake
In the shade where the wild flowers grow
What'll happen only heaven knows
So don't go down Maggie Creek Road
(at the end)........don't go down....... Maggie Creek Road)

Verse 2
Was a still black night as dark is cold
Nobody heard her when she said no
She kicked and screamed and got free somehow
Tore her dress on the door when he pushed her out
She walked 13 miles on the gravel road
With tears in her eyes 20 years ago

Don't go down Maggie Creek Road
With a boy lookin' like that
He'll tell ya thangs that you wanna hear
And they'll be no turnin' back

Verse 3
Somehow mama's always know
Cause they shoulda been home an hour ago
When she pulled up it was just going down
She turned her headlights off didn't make a sound
She heard her baby crying no but he wouldn't stop
Her heart went cold and her blood ran hot
With a pistol in her hand she opened his door
You don't wanna see mama go to war

Don't go down Maggie Creek Road
With a boy lookin' like that

Would I tell you that life is great?

Really lookin' up

Would I be too proud
To show my heart?
Well, to tell the truth
It's not that hard

In a bed of Kleenex
Stuffin' chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend cussin' my ex
He broke my heart
Felt like the world had ended
I cried myself to sleep
Thinkin' I can't get over him

Strange, talk about luck I woke up
And, the sun was shining
Strange, I ought a be in bed with my head
In the pillow cryin' over us
But I ain't, ain't love

Got half a mind to spend my whole paycheck
On one of those dresses
Those strapless black ones
That are so famous for teaching lessons
Dropped by his place
Picked up the rest of my things
He'll tell me I look good
I'll laugh and say yeah I will in time

Reba McEntire,"Met an old man yesterday
Next to me on a westbound plane
He said ""I was married sixty years
I swear it feels like she's still here.""
Then he took out a picture

Staring at that black and white
The tears filled up in his eyes
I said ""You were a lucky man.""
He said ""I feel like I still am.""

When he told me her name
I heard myself say

I wanna be Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be
Somebody's Chelsea

He made me laugh when he talked about
Their first date and her father's doubts
He said ""Even as her hair turned gray,
She still took my breath away.""
And that it never changed with time
That's when I closed my eyes

I wanna be Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl

I hugged him and said ""I'll never forget
How you showed me what it means""

Well I can summon up my courage. Take on the whole world. Turn around and break down just like a little girl. And I come out swingin' when my back's against the wall.

And my Mama always told me better walk before you crawl. I need a man who can love all the women I am.

I'm a mother of lost causes. A sister of the road. I give my heart to a song, but I never sell my soul. I'm good at keeping it together when the edges start to fray.

When I'm sewing up the loose ends of everyday. I need a man who can love all the women I am.

Sometimes I'm hard to handle. Burn hotter than a candle, but I melt in the right hands. Boy you love without condition. It ain't always easy livin' with all the women I am.

I'm a daughter of the red dirt, Okie dust still in my bones. But I can light up New York City with my red hair and rhinestones. I'll still be my Mama's baby when my babies fly away. My moods change like the weather, but my faith it stays the same.

I need a man who can stand all the women I am. I need a man who can love all the women I am.

Sometimes I'm hard to handle. Burn hotter than a candle, but I melt in the right hands. Boy you love without condition. It ain't always easy livin' with all the women I am.

Hey I'm a realist. I'm a dreamer. I'm a silver linin' seeker. I'm a devil or an angel who come running when you need her.

Cause I need a man who can love all the women I am. Ohh I want a man who can love all the women I am. Hey you're a man who can love all the women I am. You're the man I needed all along. You can handle me baby. All the women I am. Yeah you're the man. All the women I am.",All the Women I Am

To keep the first tear from falling down

And all she could say was ""yes ma'am""

In Love Land
She said, ""mama, I really love this man""

Seemed like a lifetime, driving from Vegas to Oklahoma
""If you're allowed a number of mistakes in life,"" she said
""Maybe I filled my quarter""
They called in a reception, saying you did the right thing

""Who needs to walk down the aisle?""
As she showed off her wedding ring
They walked away hand in hand

Since the days of Thomas Edison
Still only God gives life
In spite of modern medicine
The doctors' voices whispered
""We did all that we could do
But your baby wasn't strong enough
To make it the whole nine months""
And as their world broke in two
He said, ""I'll carry you through
To Love Land""

She said, ""for the longest time I've blamed myself
Thought I was paying for my mistakes""
But they tried again, now they're watching him
Blow three candles out
He's daddy's little man
She said, ""only God could've planned the steps I've taken
That led me to where I am
Love Land
Love, Love Land
Anywhere you hold my hand is Love Land
Ooh, Love Land""",Love Land
Reba McEntire,"You're gonna hurt sometimes, leave you to be
By the side of the road with the dirt and debris
Your name in the dust on your face
And you can't shake it off
You're gonna learn some things you don't wanna learn
When the taste of the fruit leaves a bite and a burn
You're taking your heart and your phone
And you're turning them off

But still you're gonna love somebody
Don't you wanna love somebody?
You ain't alive 'til you love somebody
Everybody wants to love somebody

Don't say that you're done
'Cause you're never done
Go on, go on, go on
And love somebody

You're gonna find someday the thicker the wall
The higher the fence, the harder the fall
When you're tryin' to sleep but you can't
'Cause it keeps spinning 'round
You're gonna go somewhere that you've never thought
You'd ever go again, there's no way to stop
And there's no way to know that you're lost
Until you're finally found

That's why you're gonna love somebody
Don't you wanna love somebody?
You ain't alive 'til you love somebody
Everybody wants to love somebody

You can damn and doubt it
You can cry about it
But you can't live without it

That's why you gotta love somebody
Don't you wanna love somebody?
You ain't alive 'til you love somebody
Everybody wants to love somebody",Love Somebody

Reba McEntire,"She was flagging down the waiter
She was feeling 'bout as faded as the flowers from that wallpaper
Nobody'd even asked for her ID when she walked in there
Don't know how long she'd been there
She was fixing up her hair and fumbling though her purse
She was tired of feeling lonely
She was tired of feeling old
She was hating the idea of going home alone

So she got drunk last night
Drunk enough to call
That number in her phone that she would never call
Without the alcohol
But she needed an excuse
To let herself get used and so that's why

She got drunk the way she'd never
The way she hadn't in forever
But she needed to feel better, and wanted, and beautiful
Even if he didn't love her
And it had been a long time over
She had to make one more mistake
And she couldn't do that sober

So she got drunk last night
Drunk enough to call
That number in her phone that she would never call
Without the alcohol
But she needed an excuse
To let herself get used and so that's why
Oh, she got drunk last night (drunk last night)

Yeah she needed an excuse
To let herself get used and so that's why

Reba McEntire,"It wasn't when you walked out, wasn't when you said goodbye
It wasn't when I sat down and had myself a real good cry
Oh, it wasn't when I tore your picture from the frame
Threw it in the fire and sent it up in flames
I still felt the same

Oh, but then tonight, I met someone
We went out and we had fun
He made me laugh, we danced all night
And I didn't see your face when I was looking in his eyes
That's when I knew
I was over you

I was staying busy, trying to keep you off my mind
Baby, but your memory, it put up a real good fight
Oh, I went out with friends to have a drink or two
They tried to cheer me up, there was nothing they could do
I was missing you

But then tonight, there with him
It felt so good to feel good again
He took my hand and I didn't mind
And I didn't try to stop him when he kissed me goodnight
That's when I knew
I was over

Crying in my pillow
Praying that you'd come home
Waiting for the phone to ring
Wondering where it went wrong
Wishing I could move on
Thought I'd never feel this way
I thought I'd never see this day

Oh, but then tonight, I met someone
We went out and we had fun
He made me laugh and we danced all night
And I didn't see your face 'cause I was looking in his eyes
That's when I knew
I was over you
I was over you",That's When I Knew
Reba McEntire,"Ain't one the loneliest number
It takes two to make it right
Just three little words I shoulda told ya
Before you left last night

Sometimes you don't love somebody until they don't love you
Sometimes you don't love somebody until they don't love you
Oh you're lookin' so good with your bags packed
On the front steps waitin' on a yellow cab
And my heart keeps screaming 'come back, come back, come back

Well I was a-okay taking you for granted
Shoulda make a beeline for your door
If you could see all the broken pieces
You would redeem my heart for sure

Sometimes you don't love somebody until they don't love you
Sometimes you don't love somebody until they don't love you
Oh you're lookin' so good with your bags packed
On the front steps waitin' on a yellow cab
And my heart keeps screaming 'come back, come back, come back

Don't pay attention to your heart until it's bleeding
Don't know what you have until you can't keep it
Don't know what you want till you need it
Don't know that it's love until it's leavin'
Oh, when you left I shoulda come runnin'
You were right about everything
I was up to no good and you knew it
And now I'm down here on my knees

Sometimes you don't love somebody until they don't love you
Sometimes you don't love somebody until they don't love you
Oh you're lookin' so good with your bags packed
On the front steps waitin' on a yellow cab
And my heart keeps screaming 'come back, come back, come back

It's a little too late baby I know
That I treated your heart like a yoyo
Give me one more chance baby don't go, don't go, don't go

Two hearts that fit perfectly
He gives me love-more then enough

There was somebody else making me strong
There is no doubt
I'd be nothing without

They're always there when
I'm feeling down, always around, lifting me up
I love how they know me, forgive me, and show me

I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Am I too late to make amends?

Rebecca Ferguson,"Second guessing, never learn my lessons,
Always chasing after, what somebody else had stole,
When you took your chances, I wasn’t burnt to ashes,
And your broken promises have left you out in the cold,
With each lie that you told, lie that you told,

I learn a little more, learn a little more,
And it was brighter before, brighter,
Your love don’t shine anymore,
You went and turned a diamond to a stone,
I should have known to leave you well alone,
Instead I chose to lay you in my heart,
My eyes don’t shine quite like they did before
Like a diamond to a stone.

So now I’m walking with my eyes wide open,
But I fell off the track, but now I’m back in control,
So I saw through you, the crystal waters are so blue,
And my smile is back again it had been away for so long,
'Cause with each lie that you told, lie that you told,

I learn a little more, learn a little more,
And it was brighter before, brighter,
Your love don’t shine anymore,
You went and turned a diamond to a stone,
I should have known to leave you well alone,
Instead I chose to lay you in my heart,
My eyes don’t shine quite like they did before
Like a diamond to a stone.

The harder I try the easier it is to walk, walk away,
The harder I try the easier it is to walk away,

You went and turned a diamond to a stone,
I should have known to leave you well alone,
Instead I chose to lay you in my heart,
My eyes don’t shine quite like they did before

The shattered glass

I've seen it all before, that's why I'm asking.

Will you still be here tomorrow
Or will you leave in the dead of the night?
So your waves don't crash around me,
I'm staying one step ahead of the tide.
Will you leave me lost in my shadows
Or will you pull me into your light?
Teach me how to be loved

Never did, I never did

Maybe I'm mad, maybe I'm all cried out
Maybe I'm scared, but I'm coming 'round
No I never never said I was superwoman

Droping the mask, uncovering my soul,
Loving my scars, letting go of control
Seeing beauty through the ashes everywhere I go
One minute I'm strong the next I don't know

And I loose my shit every now and then
I break down big then I start again
Never, never, never said I was superwoman,
I never said I never said it
Never ever said I was more than coping
I never did, I never did

Maybe I'm mad, maybe I'm all cried out
Maybe I'm scared, but I'm coming 'round
No I never never said I was more than human

And I wish I could fly
Take me away, take me away
Just fly
Up and escape sometimes
I wish I was strong
Stronger than this aching
It's breaking me down

And I never ever said I was superwoman
I never said, I never said it
Never ever said I was more than coping
I never did, I never did

And maybe I'm bad, I'm all cried out
And maybe I get scared
But I'll be coming 'round and 'round, 'round, 'round
All cried out
And no I never ever said oh ohh
No no I never never said I was superwoman

I'm not superwoman",Superwoman
Rebecca Hansen,"I have a maker
He formed my heart
Before even time began
My life was in his hand

He knows my name
He knows my every thought
He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call
I have a Father
He calls me his own
He'll never leave me
No matter where I go

He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call",He Knows My Name
Rebecca Hansen,"The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hopeless sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldier's feet
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us knows where
The stones been rolled away
And now his body isn't there
So we both ran toward the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell
Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same
But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried
Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into his eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I'd ever had
Just melted into peace
He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
Has alive yes Has alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heavens gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive
Hallelujah He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive He's alive

This kind of do or die don't happen overnight

More then just a little in love
I'm more than just a little

It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony

About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh
