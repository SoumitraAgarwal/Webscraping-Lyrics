Ringo Starr,"Nobody loved her, it was easy to see
That made it easy for me
The boys never fought over her company
That made it easy for me

Love so bright could only blind us
How could reason hope to find us
Hiding in the milky way
Without a star to shine the way?

Sand castles fell from the tears in our eyes
That made it easier to see
Now the dream's over and I realize
That makes it easy for me
",Easy for Me
Ringo Starr,"Two broken hearts lonely looking like 
Houses where nobody lives.
Two people each having so much pride inside,
Neither sides forgives.
 
The angry words spoken in haste,
Such a waste of two lives.
It's my belief, pride is the chief cause and the decline
In the numbers of husbands and wives.

Houses where nobody lives.
Two people each having so much pride inside,
Neither sides forgives.
 
The angry words spoken in haste,
Such a waste of two lives.
It's my belief, pride is the chief cause and the decline
In the numbers of husbands and wives.
 
A woman and a man, a man and a woman,
Some can and some can't, and some can't.
 
The angry words spoken in haste,
Such a waste of two lives.

Ringo Starr,"I was sitting at the bar, talking to a lady friend,
Sipping on a glass of wine and making time, - you know what I mean.
Then my favorite record played and I turned to watch the crowd,
But one dancin' lady made me spill my wine.
She looked so wild and she looked so free and she moved so temptingly,
All the boys had just one question on their minds;

Can she do it like she dances?
Can she do it like she dances?
Oh, the way she move, I'd like to rendezvous her,
Find if she can really do it like she dances.

(Oo, oo, oo)

As she moved around the floor I kept movin' 'round the bar,
Almost got into a fight to keep her in sight.
When the dance was finally through, found myself exhausted too,
And I knew that I'd be wondering all night:

Can she do it like she dances?
Can she do it like she dances?
Oh, the way she move, I'd like to rendezvous,
And find if she can really do it like she dances.

Some girls get off by putting on a show,
But when you get them home the show is over.
Well, on the dance floor there's no move they don't know,
But you get her alone and her body turns to stone.

So I finished up my drink and was heading for the door,
When I saw that lady giving me the eye.
Well, we danced the night away and I'm seeing her today
And I hope that I will find out by on by

Can she do it like she dances?
I said, can she do it like she dances?
(Can she do it like she dances?)
Oh, the way she move, I'd like to rendezvous,
And find if she can really do it like she dances.

Can she do it like she dances?
I wanna know if she can do it,
I wanna know if she can do it,
I wanna know if she can do it just like she dances.

Oh, come on, baby, dance with me one time,
Dance with me two times,

And I've been down two times,
But now I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love.

I've been here so very long,
I've lost all my directions.

I thought I had found perfection.
But a strong wind came into my life,
It surely took me by surprise,
I can't seem to control these tears flowing from my eyes.

Ringo Starr,"Me and billy were a couple of kids,
Nobody knew about the things that we did.
Sharing our toys and riding our bikes,
We thought it would last for the rest of our lives.
 
But we gave it all up,
We gave it all up,
We gave it all up for school.
 
Then my fam'ly had to move out of town,
Made some new friends and started hangin' around.
Started stealing like the rest of the guys,
My friend got caught, I saw the fears in his eyes.
 
So I gave it all up,
I gave it all up,
I gave it all up for love.
 
She was eighteen and I topped her by one,
She said she's heard about the bad things I've done.
But she loved me and she just didn't care,
But one night she needed me and I wasn't there.
 
So she gave me right up, (gave me right up)
She gave me right up, (gave me right up)
She gave me right up for love.
 
As I look back and wonder,
Have I wasted my time?
Will I ever learn the meaning of life,
Will I learn it in time.
 
So I sit here with a couple of beers,
Wondering how I've lasted all of these years.
You're beside me and it's feeling so right,
How I'd like to thank you for the rest of my life.

I made the teacher want to dance

of a lonely night
You feel (felt) the walls come closing in like the victim of
a one-way fight

I don't remember many yesterdays, I left a lot of things undone
Now I'm back and I'm here to say I'm looking after number one
Oh! Don't go where the road don't go
Oh, Don't go where the road don't go

Seeing people on the freeway takes me back to where it all begun
I was riding on a big wheel, I was walking in a midnight sun
I did a lot of favors then and asked for nothing in return
Now those friends have all disappeared, I guess there's still so much
to learn

[Chorus:] 
Oh! Don't go where the road don't go 
Oh, Don't go where the road don't go
Oh, Don't go where the road don't go
'cause you'll never run, you'll never outrun the gun

When I said it don't come easy

With lipstick and powder
Thought I heard you mention my name
Can't you talk any louder?

Don't come any closer
Don't come any nearer
My vision of you

Oh I just want to hear girls talk

Got a loaded imagination
Bein' fired by girls talk
It's a more or less situation
Inspired by girls talk

But I can't say
The words you want to hear
I suppose you're gonna have to
Play it by ear, right here

And now, girls talk
And they want to know how girls talk
And they say it's not allowed, girls talk
If they say that it's so
Don't they think that I'd know by now?

Got the word up on everyone's lipstick
That you're getting faded
You may not be an old-fashioned girl
But you're gonna get dated

""Was it really murder?""
""Were you just pretending?""
""Lately I've heard...""
""You are the living end""

Girls talk
And they want to know how girls talk
And they say it's not allowed, girls talk
And they think they know how girls talk

I suppose you're gonna have to
Play it by ear, I hear

And she really, really needs me,
Why can't I see she wants to see me be me, my love,
Everyday, my love,
And I love her in every way, my love,
Every day, my love,
And I love her in every way.

It's still kind of broken.

Now my heart is open.

Lips like strawberry wine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine

You're all ribbons and curls, ooh, what a girl
Eyes that sparkle and shine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine

You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
Ooh, when we kissed I could not stop

You walked out of my dreams and into my arms
Now you're my angel divine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine

You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
Ooh, when we kissed I could not stop

Ringo Starr,"Well Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25.
Speed jive. Don't want to stay alive when you're 25.
And Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
And Freddie's got spots from ripping off the stars from his face.
Funky little boat race.
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile deliquent wrecks.
I need T.V. when I got T-Rex.
Oh brother, you guessed, I'm a dude now.

[Chorus]
All the young dudes.
Carry the news.
Bugaloo dudes. Carry the news.

Well Jimmy looks sweet 'cause he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule; it's a real mean team.
But, we can love. Yes, we can love.
And my brother's back home with his Beatles and his Stones.
We never got off with that revolution stuff.
What a drag. Too many snags.
Well, I drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine.
Gonna raise some cat to bed.
Oh man, is this concerete all around
Or is it all in my head.
Brother, I'm a dude now.

Ringo Starr,"She wears a long fur coat of mink 
Even in the summer time 
Everybody knows from the coy little wink 
The girl's got a lot on her mind 

She's got big thoughts, big dreams 
And a big brown Mercedes sedan 
What I think this girl, 
She really wants is to be in love with a man 

[Chorus] 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
But without love it ain't much 

She saw him standing in the section marked 
If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie 
She threw him bread and said make me scream 
In the dark what could he say 

Boys with small talk and small minds 
Really don't impress me in bed 
She said I need a man's man baby 
Diamonds and furs 
Love would only conquer my head 

[Chorus]
 
They made haste in the brown sedan 
They drove to fifty five Secret street 
They made love and by the seventh wave 
She knew she had a problem 
She thought real love is real scary 
Money only pays the rent 
Love is forever that's all your life 
Love is heaven sent it's glamorous

Ringo Starr,"When I was young it seemed
That life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees

Well they'd be singing so happily
Joyfully, oh playfully watching me
But then they sent me away
To teach me how to be sensible,

Logical, oh responsible, practical
And they showed me a world
Where I could be so dependable
Clinical, oh intellectual, cynical.

There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please,

Please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am
Oh watch what you say

Or they'll be calling you a radical,
A liberal, oh fanatical, criminal
Oh won't you sign up your name
We'd like to feel you're acceptable

Respectable, presentable & vegetable!
But at night when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man

Won't you please,
Please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am",Logical Song
Ringo Starr,"He had white horses
And ladies by the score
All dressed in satin
And waiting by the door

Oooh, what a lucky man he was
White lace and feathers
They made up his bed
A gold covered mattress

On which he was laid
He went to fight wars
For his country and his king
Of his honor and his glory

The people would sing
A bullet had found him
His blood ran as he cried
No money could save him
So he laid down and he died",Lucky Man

Why should you care
if you're feeling good

Take the long way home,
take the long way home
But there are times that you feel
you're part of the scenery

All the greenery is coming down boy
And then your wife seems to think
you're part of the furniture
Oh it's peculiar, she used to be so nice

When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
take the long way home

You never see what you want to see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home,
take the long way home

And when you're up on stage,
it's so unbelievable
Unforgettable - how they adore you
But then your wife seems to think

you're losing your sanity
Oh, calamity, is there no way out
Well does it feel that your life's
become a catastrophe

Oh it has to be for you to grow boy
And when you look through the years
and see what you could have been
Oh what you might have been -

if you'd had more time
So when the day comes
to settle down
Well who's to blame

You took the long way home

A kiss on the spine, we do things we never do
Swallow the pride and joy of the ivory tower

We'll dance on the roof, make love on a bed of flower

She tried to tell me
What I never wanted to hear
It don't matter if the sun does shine
It's always clouded know that you're not mine
For one foolish moment
Won't you forgive me dear.

So I cried so hard
I was trippin' on my own tears.

Why you can't that I'm dying?
I'm not a saint, but god I'm trying, trying.

It don't matter
If you're wrong or wright
When you're walking the floor
And you're up all the night
I'll wait for you
If it takes a millions years.

I was trippin' on my own tears",Trippin' on My Own Tears
Ringo Starr,"What love wants to be
Is a song that lasts forever
The perfect melody
When two hearts sing together
The moon can't shine, without the sun
On my own I'm only one
Now I have a reason to believe
What love wants to be
You are that to me.

What love wants to be
Is deeper than an ocean
Green eyes like the see
Reflecting true devotion
When the night is still, the stars that shine
Say yet again that you are mine
No need to keep on searching endlessly
What love wants to be
You are that to me.

After the band is gone
We will keep dancing on
Like every night, is Saturday night.

What love wants to be
We've heard it through the ages
But no one ever told me that is free
What love wants to be
You are that to me
What love wants to be.

You are that to me.",What Love Wants to Be
Ringo Starr,"A young man strumming his guitar
In the corner of a bar
Singing 'bout a broken heart
For hours and hours
By closing time I face the fact
That if I had a gift like that
I know that I could win her back
But there's some things I can't do
So now it's up to you.

Write one for me
Put the perfect words together
Write one for me
The melody to last forever
I don't have the song, so if you please
Tell her she's a right one for me.

It does no good for you to play
A pretty song like Yesterday
'cause that's not what I need to say
To get her to love me
I'm too scared to tell her so
So if you'd be my Cyrano
And send to her a tune I know
That she would send her mind
So take a little time and

Write one for me

If I could have a poem, I would send one
But I don't have a pen, I can't depend on
I can't come up with a single line
So would you write the song
And tell her what's is my mine, all mine.

Since the world was at war
We all felt her pain
But never complained
We all loved her more

Entombed in cement
And hung from the hanging tree
God save the Queen

Use her detergent
Scrubbing the palace floor
And all of your sins are
As big as the Windsors

Sometimes I think it's easy
Sometimes I think it's bad
I've got to remember some days when I feel sad
Nothing lasts for ever, and everything must pass
As long as I keep going, If get off my ass

I listen to my music, I listen to my soul
The place that I come from
Well it's still rock and roll

I've got things to do and things to say
I've got love to help me every day
I've got bridges that I've got to cross
I've got to get the things that I have lost
I've got to make it real and make it sound
Why not? Why not? Why not?

Why not check in on the merchandise?
Why not always something in your size?
Why not? Who says that it's not allowed?
Why not do it if you want to now?
Why not? I promise you will be surprised
Why not? Why not? Why not?

Why not?

Then I got a job, in a factory

I always followed my heart, and I never missed a beat

With George & Paul, and my friend John

Now, the Rock Island line is a railroad line
And it runs down into New Orleasn
And just outside of New Orleans is a big toll gate
And all the trains that go through the toll gate
Why, they gotta pay the man some money
Less of course, they got certain things on board
Then they okay, then they don't ever have to pay the man nothin'
And right now, we see a train
She's comin' on down the line
And when she got up here to the toll gate
The-a depot, he shout down to the driver
He want to know what he got on board
So he say a, what you got on board there, boy
And the driver, he sing right on back
Down to the depot agent
Tell him what he got on board
The got a way of singing

I got sheep, I got cows
I got horses, I got pigs
I got all livestock

Just get 'em on through
So the train go through the toll gate
And as it go through
It got up a little bit of steam
And a, a little bit of speed

Talk about hospitals,

And plotting the managers and fast open cars
Racing the agents, chasing the ancients to the corner stores
To pick out the potions

I like the others to believe we were born
To bleed at the borders, to sleep with the storm
I must confess I've laid down a stronger man,
I dare not go

There is nothing I can take
There is nothing I can do

I know what I've lost, on this quiet night
Still felt your grasp upon me, as a border flight
And I watched you there in the window, wondered how long you'd stay
Waving your arms at the jungle, as it tore us both away
Wish I could just turn myself around
Follow my heart back to you on the ground

L'acqua mi fa un po' male 
La birra mi gonfia un po' 
Vado avanti tristemente a champagne e bon-bon 
Ahi maria, mi manca il tuo amor

Il mio caimano nero 
Piangendo mi confidò 
Che non approvava il progetto del metrò 
Ahi Maria, da te tornerò 

L'himalaia era lontano 
L'ascensore lì non c'è 
Ma il vecchio saggio indiano ha predetto che 
Ahi Maria, ritorni da me 

Sebbene ho più soldi in tasca
E donne ne ho troppe ormai 
Sebbene il tuo cane fuori non porto più 
Ahi Maria, chi mi manca sei tu 

E quando tramonta il sol 
Una canzone d'amor 
Da Baja a Salvador 
Oh Maria canterò 
Ahi Maria, por ti cantarè

C'era una donna a Baja 
S'ubriacava di noia e sakè 
Sotto una vecchia sequoia 
Ballava il samba e cantava per me

Un presentatore alla radio 
In un armadio provava il suo show 
Teneva un quiz a puntate 
E chiuso tutta l'estate restò

Il caimano distratto 
Imitava il gatto e faceva bau bau 
Perchè studiava le lingue 
E voleva alle cinque il suo tè 

Mi disse un vecchio fachiro 
Tu non sei un emiro in gilet 
Mi consigliò senza imbroglio 
Di non bere petrolio alle tre

E il pelo cortato e il cuore caliente

Quando sparava era fermo 
La mano sicura puntava al cuore 
Rubava ma solo per dare 
La roba del ricco al povero nero

Ma ogni peone ama solo sombrero

Forse cercava un amigo 
Una birra un mantello o chissà che altra cosa

Sombrero cantava e cercava una sposa 
Sembra che erano in dieci 
Quel giorno a seguire nella pampa sombrero 
Un colpo di fuoco nel cuore 
Spezzò la vita del caballero 
Che amava soffriva rideva moriva

Fue lo que prometiste, el día en que nos conocimos
Ok, no estaba convencido
Mas tuve que aceptarlo, por culpa del destino

Pero pasaba el tiempo y la verdad te fui queriendo
Y comencé a encontrarte en cada sueño, en mis deseos
Poco después cuenta me di que odiaba ser tu amigo
Y ya no sé si alejar mi amor o te lo digo

Cómo fui a enamorarme así de ti
Yo siempre supe que no eras para mí
Yo juraba poder controlar mis sentimientos

Yo juraba que nada me lastimaba
Pero ahora, muero por ti

Está bien, ya no te digo nada
Solo te pido ahora que no cruces la mirada
Ok, dijiste preocupada
Que nunca ibas hacer algo que a mí me lastimara

Y te volví a encontrar en cada sueño en mis deseos

Mirando llover tras de la ventana
Hablando de todo sin pensar en nada
Suplicando al tiempo que se congelara

Me acuerdo de ti, tan enamorada
Después de subir al cielo sin alas
Me volví un adicto a tu piel dorada
Siempre a donde iba solo de tu amor hablaba

¿Y ahora que le digo a tu almohada?
Al lado izquierdo que hay en mi cama
¿Ahora como callo este silencio?
Que no hace mas que hablarme de tus besos

¿Y ahora que le digo a mi alma?
Si lo único que sabe es amarte a ti
Solo a ti

Lo único que queda es seguir
Soñando que despierto junto a ti

Me acuerdo de ti, cuando despertabas
Cuando eras feliz, como me besabas
Y aunque no te veo, vas a donde valla
Aunque quiero todo, no te pido nada

¿Y ahora que le digo a tu almohada?
Al lado izquierdo que hay en mi cama
¿Ahora como callo este silencio?
Que no hace mas que hablarme de tus besos

¿Y ahora que le digo a mi alma?

Me dejas besando el suelo

Normalmente tardo años en llegar

Me entregue contigo

Prometías que jamás te irías
Me decías que eras solo mía

Y un día vi
Que no solo me decías eso a mí
Que tus labios eran míos y de otros mil
Que tenía razón mi corazón, esas noches que dudo de ti
Tengo que aceptar que yo lo presentí
Pero fue terrible cuando descubrí
Que con todo el mundo siempre eres así
Tan linda, entregada y tan fácil

No te culpo, no
Eso es algo que se trae por vocación

No lo grite, solamente lo pensé con tantas fuerzas

Y adiviné que soñabas como niña y eras una gran mujer
Pero lejos me quede cuando creí que solamente te querría
Me falto imaginación pues hoy te amo

Deep in my heart is a burning fire...

I can't let it go
Alone in the night I know I must fight for my home

Time has changed the seasons
And I will go on with no reason
I feel my life slipping away
These streets are getting colder
And I am growing older
Tomorrow seems so far away

What's become of us friend, we were one till the end
Now I'm alone in the streetlight gleam
This town knew our names, but nothing's the same
The places I played have forgotten the dream

I can't let it go
Alone in the night I know I must fight for my home

Time has changed the seasons
And I will go on with no reason
I feel my life slipping away
These streets are getting colder
And I am growing older
Tomorrow seems so far away

Clutching a sword made of steel
The ones you call friends they all left you for dead Alone on the
Battlefield many were at your command Renegade
Souls on your command Holding each life in your hand
Living for all and for one Shining into the night you
Are riding Through the darkness and light you are
Flying with the wind in your hair The flight of the
Warrior Drunk with revenge from winch on one can
Hide Into their midst you will run A face from the
Grave is the last thing they'll see And die with your
Name on their tongue many were at your command

I wanna speak that I hear though

Screaming wings fill the silvery sky
Rising on pillars of flame

And we ride thundering into the sky
And we ride
On wings of eagles we fly

I sense my enemy and fire is the warning I send
A dance of death swirling miles above the rain
While mortals sleep angels swear to defend
I salute you my friend
Unafraid to the end

Heat seekers flash headed straight for your heart
One finds the mark and a fireball rocks the clouds
Men and machines sweet and deadly we are
We rule the wind on titanium wings
Plunging back from the chase
One more champion erased
I am the last and the plaster of my art
Until I am challenged again

Ripcordz,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Ripley Blues,"Gonna sit right down in my easy chair
Pull out a deck of cards, play some solitaire
Break out a bottle, wash me a glass
To keep me company 'til the feelings pass
Everybody needs someting to do
Me, I'll just sit here and think about you
It might seem hopeless, but it ain't that bad yet
It's just the blues as blues can get... 

I need to call somebody, someone I can trust
I need the number for lovers' anonymous
I'll tell 'em my story, hope they understand

Maybe they can explain it to me
'Cause I don't think I can
I'll take your picture down from my wall
Try to remember the thrill of it all
I know it's over, but it ain't over yet
It's just the blues as blues can get... 

Why fight the feeling when I can't fight back the tears
I stare at the ceiling and wish that you were here
I'm going crazy, but I ain't crazy yet
It's just the blues as blues can get",Blues as Blues Can Get
Rise,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine
Rise & Fall,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you get's me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

I can feel you breathe
Washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

Caught up in the touch

Rise Against,"It's all the same thing
Now that it ever was
Except now you've strayed too far
Need you to stop digging your hole
And follow the path we light
Don't need an invitation to be reconciled
'Cause these home fires are burning
Stare into your empty eyes and wonder...

How could something so right turn out so wrong?
You spent your time making excuse
For the ways of life that you are choosing
How could something so right turn out so wrong?
Not sure exactly where I am
The more we organize
We suck out this life that serves as the fuel behind

You want to take the passion in my veins
And put it down in black and white
You've got your foot directly on the gas
I watch you burn out so fast
Now I can see just what you've become

And how could something so right turn out so wrong?
I don't have a backup plan
This is all that I am
And how could something so right turn out so wrong?
Not sure exactly where I am

Rise Against,"Aside from the name that holds us together
Now I think we'd fall apart
It's the years we'll pretend we've forgotten
What separates our hearts

And I don't remember the way this was
But the pictures prove I knew you once

And where is the source of our mistakes?
I'm afraid one day we'll drift so far
We'll wake up not knowing where we are
These words accomplish nothing if I'm gone",3 Day Weekend
Rise Against,"As I watch your life go up in flames,
You'll swear up and down you'd like to change
But when the sun sinks slowly into the sky,
Now you're right
Where you started again with nothing to say,
Without an argument or case
And when it's said and done and done and said,
And now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes, inside your eyes

When will you stop and realize,
The worth and value of your life?
As you suffocate yourself within this mindless,
Nine to five wake up! there's more!
And your life is nobody's but yours
And now its said and done and done and said,
And now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes

You're running circles around my slow pace
You've reached the finish line only to realize there was no race
I'm sick of being stepped on for the things I choose
I give and take and now I've taken all I could

And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could (now I've taken, now I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could (now I've taken, now I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could",401 Kill
Rise Against,"Now's the time
To rearrange your life
Live for something
Outside of your own mind
We all dream
The same dream every night
To burn the world that you call civilized

Alive and well
I live to be alive
I live to always strive
For something more
Alive and well
I'll never understand
The who, what, why or when
Of you tonight...

We face the stares of judgment
And almost everyday
The shaking heads
Of disapproval say
""Pray for you to give me something then find out that there was nothing left""

Recite the words inside (your heart)
Realize that this is nothing
Without your voice
I'm not giving up
And I'll blame the worst on you
I know what's wrong

Alive and well
I live to be alive
I live to always strive
For something more
Alive and well
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
And I don't need to explain
Myself to you",Alive and Well
Rise Against,"I'm not fucking blind to the way
That you talk around the truth
Not just what you say
But what you do

Played this tug of war way too fucking long
Like every time
Again I've lost
You've won

You took advantage of the trust that I gave
Took my forgiveness
Rubbed it back in my face
Reaching for words but there's nothing to say
I'm left to wonder
Will this ever be the same?

This rage
Burning through my veins
Regret consumes my mind
Cutting deeply like a razor blade

Will I live to see another day
Without questioning your motives?
With constant doubt

You took advantage of the trust that I gave
Took my forgiveness
Rubbed it back in my face
Reaching for words
But there's nothing to say
I'm left to wonder
Will this ever be the same?

And as we sit back waiting
For these scars to heal
Try to convince ourselves
That this
That this isn't real

Will you allow me forget your past?
Or will you always hang it over my head?",The Art of Losing
Rise Against,"In the face of change
Is when she turned to me and said
""I'm not sure anymore??

And there amidst the waves
And the cloudless skies
That blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore

Have you ever been a part of something
That you thought would never end?
And then of course it did

Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin?
And then something had to give

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now that is all this is

With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
Always something in this everchanging life
And it probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by
The same arguments are always on our mind
We've killed this slowly fading light

Now something has kept me here too long and you can't leave me if I'm already gone

Make the same mistakes we're always hanging on
Break the promises we're always leaning on
All this time spent waking up
Mow I keep this line open to get this call from you as you speak the words
That keep me coming back to you now this time it's all different

Now something has kept me here too long and now I'm gone...",Everchanging
Rise Against,"Wait
I'm not listening to you now
I wasn't listening to you then
I know that nothing will be the same again

There's only so much I can handle
Only so much I can take
Before my knees start to buckle
And my arms start to shake

Have we been here before?
Will we be here again?
I don't know how much of me you expect standing here right now
I beg for you to let go
I dread the day you finally do
I fight for your attention

Too little too late
Or too much too soon
And how will this plague the time
We share from here on out?
And how long will this taint
All these words spilling from my mouth?

Have we been here before?
Will we be here again?
I don't know how much more of me
You expect standing here right now
Have we been here before?
Will we be here again?",Faint Resemblance
Rise Against,"Buried words
Under lights
Soundtrack to this stagnant life
This meaning lost in translation
Message sucked out of his hands again

This could be my great awakening
But how would I know
'Cause it's all noise to me
Are these words falling on deaf ears?
Staring at the empty stares
Realize that he no longer cares about the wrong or right
The downward spiral begins tonight

And this could be my great awakening
But how would I know 'cause it's all noise to me
Are these words falling on deaf ears?
This could be my great awakening
But how would I know 'cause it's all noise to me
(Nothing I can do will make you hear)",Great Awakening
Rise Against,"Fighting back the impulse
Turn my head and close my eyes
Spending these nights awake and cold and paralyzed
Wonder how we got this far and
Never realized the common thread that binds our lives
And I know you hurt
But I can help you if you can...

Take my hand
And we'll live inside the dreams we left behind
Take my hand
As we move from this place to a better life
Take my hand
(If you take my hand)

Fighting back the feeling that you always could deny
Anything but everything we know is just a lie
As I cremate this memory and watch the darkened ashes rise
And beneath the smoke
I'll stand and ask you if you can

Take my hand
And I'll promise not to ever let it go
Take my hand
'Cause this hope is greater than you'll ever know
(Take my hand)

And this is all I'll ever ask of you to show
Fight back the urges
Turn my head and close my eyes
And will I wake tomorrow still alive

I'm still dreaming
I'm still waiting
I'm still sure
(I'm still sure)
You're still living in a life
That isn't yours
(That isn't yours)
And this is part of me
I hope you never see
This is my life inside your heart

Take my hand
And I'll promise not to ever let it go
Take my hand
'Cause this hope is greater than you'll ever know
(Take my hand)
And this is all I'll ever ask of you to show",My Life Inside Your Heart
Rise Against,"You talk about the way things were
But I can't hear what you're saying
A time when life was not this hard
Blessed by the innocence

Is the best yet to come?
Or did it pass by long ago?
Are we holding on to a thread
Of something already dead?

I'm not your reason to stand up straight
Shoulders back chest out and eyes raised
Stepping back, I hesitate
I can't let myself be taken

The reception fades, the signals breaking up
And am I moving on or am I giving up?
If you walk away from this with anything
Live your life today",Reception Fades
Rise Against,"All these days
I'll forever cherish
In the confines of my heart
The faces of ten years ago
Like fingerprints on my heart

How can I breathe
When fear chokes my every breath?
How can I balance
Six inches from death?
Now the momentum we've created
Comes to a screeching halt
This angel comes crashing down
On her hands and knees she crawls

How can I breathe
When fear chokes my every breath?
How many of your lies
Will I be fed?

The remains of summer memories
Spent so far away
Free from the fear or jealousy
That plagues our lives today
Now that promises we're broken
Enemies were made
We spend our precious time pointing fingers
Trying to place the blame

The remains of what's left
Of our past

I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip


The postcard says wish you were here
But I'd rather I was there, holding
On to the simple things before they disappear, that's what I meant

But that was then, and this is now
I'll make it up to you somehow

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
But the daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip

Our destination, a feint smile,
Another station, another mile,
Another day gone, I swear that I will
Be there before dawn, so be there I will

She got down on hands and knees, one ear against the ground,
Holding her breath to hear something, anything at all

The dirt whispered, ""Child, I'm coming home.""

In a prayer for dawn

Bound for glory on this street

Is a better seat on a crashing...
Plain to see, but hard to breathe

And now it's morning in the streets of Amerika
But we don't go outside anymore
The radio blasts hysteria
While the television's sideways on the floor

Under moonlit skies and surveillance
As we cheer from the stands in the stadiums
On a jumbotron we all sing along to escape
Once we were the lighthouse
To the world's most desperate ships
But what we became was a towering flame
Leading the moth right into it
Now we are waking up to the phone lines cut

'Cause it's morning in the streets of Amerika
And we don't go outside anymore
The radio blasts hysteria
While the television's sideways on the floor

With a teleprompter in our faces
Yeah, we don't even know what we're saying
Car that's slowly crashing
And we can't look away
Parading to the edge of the cliff now
We're trying to figure out how to get down
While the night is fast approaching
Would we even recognize our former lives in this artificial light?

Well, Abe said, ""Where d'you want this killin' done?""
God said, ""Out on Highway 61""

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know""
Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man, I got to run""
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61""

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
""I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son""
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done""
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now, the roving gambler he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61""",Highway 61 Revisited
Rita Chiarelli,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee
Rita Coolidge,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Now ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

It's so strange sometimes",Ain't That Peculiar
Rita Coolidge,"Like a bird on the wire, 
like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
and by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
he said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
she cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh like a bird on the wire,
like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.",Bird on a Wire
Rita Coolidge,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, Julie baby, you're my flame

Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy-o don't you dare

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever
Rita Coolidge,"She's a little bit of the sunshine
Just before the rain
A little like this quiet night
Before the cold winds came
She's a little bit like the weather
I never know when she's gonna change
She's a part of my heart
And a whole lot of my pain

[Chorus:]
Whiskey, whiskey my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Milk of mercy please be kind
Drive this feeling from my mind

Don't you know, somehow her smile
Can make the day begin
She'd take away this mask of grey
And let the sun shine in
Now I find I've been blinded
By the cold and wintery wind
She disguised behind her eyes
Oh what a fool I've been

[Chorus x 2]","Whiskey, Whiskey"
Rita Coolidge,"You ask me if I'm happy now
That's good as any joke I've heard
It seems that since I've seen you last
I done forgot the meaning of the words
If happiness is empty rooms
And drinkin' in the afternoon
Well I suppose I'm happy as a clam
But if it's got a thing to do
With smilin' of forgettin' you
Well I don't guess that I could say I am

Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper
He's been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from comin' through
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come true
That's the way that I've been feelin' since the day I started falling

From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool
Learnin' hard to live with losin' you
You wonder if I'm better off
With freedom now to do the things I choose
With all my times my own and
I got nothin' left but sleepin' time to lose
There's no one here to carry on
If I stay out the whole night long
or give a tankerous damn if I don't call
I'm livin' like I wanted to
And doin' things I want to do
And nothin' means a thing to me at all

I am truly hypnotized--with a love

Whisper to me through the trees
You're the one I always dream of
You're the only one I see

Whoa, slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer holds the answer
Only you can set me free

Never see your face in sunlight
Moonlight sends you straight to me
You never even got my name right
You were so easy to me

A flannel for my face
Pyjamas, a hairbrush
New shoes and a case

Past the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
Billboards and the buildings
Memories of it still
Keep calling and calling
But forget it all
I know I will

Tempted but the truth is discovered

Now that you have gone
There's no other

The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding
I'm wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion
It's no story I could tell
At my bedside empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer
I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction
I wish that it would stop
I bought a novel, some perfume
A fortune all for you
But it's not my conscience
That hates to be untrue

Good God, I might as well forget you
You ain't never comin' true
Seems like ever since I met you
I've been gettin' over you

I don't crave no conversation
I don't need no sympathy
All I want now is my baby
And my baby wantin' me

So take me any way you want me
I'll take you any way I can

With someone who wants some too
Maybe I can learn to love him

Rita D,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak

I would be, caught in the undertow

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.

Essa falta de emoção e de sensação

Quem foi que disse que eu devo me cuidar?
Tem certas coisas que a gente não consegue controlar
Comer um fruto que é proibido
Você não acha irresistível?
Nesse fruto está escondido o paraíso, o paraíso

Eu sei que o fruto é proibido
Mas eu caio em tentação
Acho que não!

Rita Lee,"Abri a janela
Um som diferente entrou
Meus olhos mudaram, eu sei
Ou foi o sol que mudou, babe

O som das nuvens
A conversa do vento
A voz dos astros
A história do tempo

O som das estrelas
A música do luar
Contando em segredo, eu sei
Contando todo o meu medo, babe

O som das flores
O murmúrio do céu
Me deram um toque
Quem tem ouvidos que ouça

Você é uma criança do universo
E tem tanto o direito de estar aqui
Quanto as árvores e as estrelas
Mesmo que isto não esteja claro para você
Não há dúvidas
Que o universo segue o rumo
Que todos nós escolhemos",O Toque
Rita Lee,"Quem falou que não pode ser? 
Não, não, não 
Eu não sei por quê

Não, não, não 
Eu não sei o quê 
É absurdo 
Eu não sou mudo 
Quem falou que não pediu pra nascer 
Não, não, não 
Eu sinto muito 
Vai ficar pra outra vez 
Não é possível ser pirata em paz 
Que o transatlântico vem logo atrás 
Eu sei que ele está perseguindo 
O meu tesouro escondido 
Mar não, não 
Enquanto isso eu continuo no mar 
A ver navios pra poder navegar 
A nau dos desesperados 
Navio fantasma e seus piratas pirados 
Não, oh!

Vai ficar pra outra vez!",Pirataria
Rita Lee,"Da minha janela vejo uma luz
Brilhando no céu da terra
É azul, é azul
Não é avião, não é estrela
Aquela é a luz de um disco voador
Disco voador
Trazendo do céu um segredo
Olhando pra mim com um pouco de medo
Querendo pular a janela
Ligar a vitrola e entrar dentro dela

Rita Lee,"Quem é que pode ser gigante nesse mundo tão pequeno? 
Como é que faz pra gente ser feliz e rico ao mesmo tempo? 
Eu não sei, mas eu vou tentar
Todo remédio que me cura tem uma contra indicação
O que faz bem pra alma pode fazer mal pro coração
De quem tem pressa de chegar
Ai quem me dera um dia 
Ficar de papo pro ar
Tirando um som de uma viola 
E quanto mais a gente ganha mais a gente vai perder
Porque essa vida tá ficando um osso duro de roer
E então, acho bom lembrar
Que o passarinho na gaiola não esquece de cantar
Que uma criança nunca briga se ela aprende a brincar e amar
Como tem que ser
Ai quem me dera um dia
Ficar de papo pro ar
Tirando um som de uma viola 
Ai, ai",Modinha

Meu sangue é de gasolina, correndo não tenho mágoa
Meu peito é de sal de fruta, fervendo num copo d'água",2001

O sol fraco se sentiu
E a ciência decidiu
Levar a terra e a lua
Com Júpiter ao nosso lado
Pra orbitar outra estrela
De ciclo mais prolongado

Brilhante lâmpada atômica

Uma vez aproximado
Era um sol improvisado)

Assim, na longa viagem
De anos trezentos mil

Em nossa vida real
Não durava mais que um pio)

O dia seria quente
Com Júpiter quase rente
E a noite seria dia
Onde a lua reluzia

Além de desempregado fui baleado no ventre
Pra lá de desesperado aviso aos meliantes
Quem não está no meu lado que saia da minha frente

Com generais e soldados armados até os dentes
Vou destruir o senado, vou depor o presidente

Eu vou trancar os tarados nas celas dos delinquentes
Criar mil planos cruzados e dez moedas correntes
Vou torturar aleijados, vou alijar indigentes
Não vai mais ter feriado, nem vai mais ter quem me aguente

Depois de tudo acabado ainda faço o seguinte
Misturo funk com fado, junto D2 com Da Vinci

Vou fuzilar bem dotados, viúva, cego e doentes
Jogar no mar viciados, poetas e diferentes
Deportar deputados, reenforcar Tiradentes

Não creia ser eu quem pensas que sou
Acredito na alegria que não sinto

Estou por trás do teu grande medo
Quando a vida não tem explicação
Te seduzo à tentação de um desejo
Para gozar na tua insatisfação

Mas se quiseres tuas contas acertar
Pra ficar livre de minha maldade
Cobra de mim o que me tens a pagar
E eu te darei o fim da eternidade

Mas se meu poderoso veneno
For antídoto pra felicidade
Com os deuses eu te condeno
A morrer preso a tua falsa liberdade

Não me cobre ser existente
Cobra de mim que sou serpente",Cobra

Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

Sees the sun going down

See the world spinning round

They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Kiss baby, kiss me baby, kiss me
Pena que você não me kiss
Não me suicidei por um triz
Ai de mim que sou assim! 

Quando eu me sinto um pouco rejeitada
Me dá um nó na garganta
Choro até secar a alma de toda mágoa
Depois eu passo pra outra
Como mutante
No fundo sempre sozinho
Seguindo o meu caminho
Ai de mim que sou romântica! 

Kiss baby, kiss me baby, kiss me
Pena que você não me kiss
Não me suicidei por um triz
Ai de mim que sou assim!",Mutante
Rita Lee,"Passo o dia inteiro imaginando meu bem
Na cama, no chuveiro, no trampo, sempre tão blasé
É uma neurose,
Uma overdose,
Sou dependente do amor!
Meus amigos dizem que essa coisa vicia
Andaram até jurando que era anorexia
É uma neurose,
Uma overdose,
Sou dependente do amor!

Cada vez mais doido varrido
Roqueiro brasileiro,
Sempre teve cara de bandido!

Vou botar fogo nesse asilo,
Respeite minha caducagem
Porque essa vida é muito louca
E loucura pouca é bobagem

Nunca fui de muito papo
E sei que meu negócio é farra
Pego na guitarra e não largo até Pompéia gritar:

Muda o disco!

Juventude transviada para mim é conto de fada!
E quanto mais o rock rola mais a gente gosta,
Quanto mais dinheiro em jogo mais a gente aposta
Quanto mais o tempo passa mais eu quero me divertir

Me sentir,

Forasteiro,

Dá licença mas eu vou sair do sério

Eu sei que agora
Eu vou é cuidar mais de mim!

Como vai, tudo bem
Apesar, contudo, todavia, mas, porém
As águas vão rolar
Não vou chorar

É sinal que amei demais
Mas enquanto estou viva
Cheia de graça
Talvez ainda faça
Um monte de gente feliz!",Saúde

Some are dead and some are living

There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Rita Lee,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds

Pra nesse estado continuar
Nunca sensatos nem condizentes
Mas parecemos supercontentes
Nossos neurônios são esquisitos
Por isso estamos sempre aflitos
Vamos incertos
Pelo caminho
Nos comportando estranhos no ninho
Quando a solução se encontra, um maluco é do contra
Mas se vai por lado errado, um maluco vai do lado

Malucos, a nossa vida é dar bandeira
Ligando a luz da cabeceira,se a água pinga na torneira
Malucos, a nossa luta é abstrata
Já que afundamos a fragata,
Mas temos medo de barata

Nós, os malucos, temos um lema
Tudo na vida é um problema
Mas nunca tente nos acalmar
Pois um maluco pode surtar
Os nossos planos são absurdos
Tipo gritar no ouvido dos surdos
Mas todo mundo que é genial
Nunca é descrito como normal
Quando o papo se esgota,
Um maluco é poliglota
Mas se todo mundo grita,
Um maluco se irrita

Malucos, somos iguais a diferença
E todos temos uma crença
Seguir a lei jamais compensa
Malucos, somos a mola desse mundo,
Mas nunca iremos muito a fundo
Nesse dilema tão profundo

Malucos, a nossa vida é dar bandeira,
Ligando a luz da cabeceira,se a água pinga na torneira

Já mandei no megafone
Pra toda gente escutar

Paira em qualquer lugar

De toda cidade
Já berrei no microfone
A todo volume no ar
Palavra que se espalha
Pluma no vendaval
Vi no gibi, foi por aí, li num poema
Que a vida vale a pena
Li no jornal, vi na TV, foi pela antena
Que a vida vale a pena
No futebol, no carnaval, na batucada
Vida que vale a pena",Ja Te Falei

Rita Lee,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There´s a land that I heard of, once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream 
Really do come true
Someday I´ll wish upon a star
And make up where the clouds are far 
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That´s where you´ll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh, 
Why cant´t I",Over the Rainbow

On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street

I wear them to hide my tears from you
Behind the smoke I'm so red eye
And I'm tired of you asking why
I said I've been lying to you
And I've been lying to me too

My heart has been through hell and back
I've only dressed in pretty and black
Middle finger when it comes to love
Act like I don't really give a fuck
Cause I've been lying to you
I said I've been lying to me too

I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too
I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too

I don't always say what I want to say
I tattoo myself to show my pain
Don't lead in a crowded space even though we're both face to face
Cause I've been lying to you
Said I've been lying to me too

Hurry up and wake for the spotlight
Looks like another whisky night
What's inside they never expose
They only see what the camera shows
Cause I've been lying to you
Said I've been lying to me too, noo

Tryin' to make everyone happy, that ain't me
Walking around, wearing a smile, but deep down I'm really fucked up, this ain't me
I don't wanna quit, tryin' to hang with this
And figure out who the hell I am
I don't mean to make you run away
But I don't wanna forget to be me

The truth is I don't wanna lose you
But I don't wanna lose me too

But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run
No risk so I think I'm all in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump

And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch

Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Rita Springer,"There is a blood
That cost a life
That paid my way
Death its price
When it flowed
Down from the cross
My sins were gone
My sins forgot

There is a grave
That tried to hide
This precious blood
That gave me life
In three days
He breathed again
And rose to stand in my defense

So I come to tell you He's alive
To tell you that He dries every tear that falls
So I come to tell you that He saves
To shout and to proclaim that He's coming back for you
This life, this price, this blood, this one

Oh, there is a Blood
Oh, and it sights the blind
It heals the sick
The lonely, finds
Oh, it has the Power
To free the bound
As chains they fall
Upon the ground

So pour it out and
To cleanse my soul
And let its liquid Glory flow
Because it lives
To make me whole
I owe my life
I owe my all

So I come to tell you He's alive
To tell you that He dries every tear that falls
So I come to tell you that He saves
To shout and to proclaim that he is coming back for you

The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters, just the right sound
That could make you hear, make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind

Oh I could say I need you but then you'd realize
That I want you just like a thousand other guys
Who'd say they loved you With all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes

To think that they don't mean much any more.
Fine times have gone and left my sad home,
Friends who once cared just walk out my door.

Love has no pride when I call out your name.
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame.
I'd give anything to see you again.

I've been alone too many nights
To think that you could come back again.
But I've heard you talk: ""She's crazy to stay.""
But this love hurts me so, I don't care what you say.

[Chorus]

If I could buy your love, I'd truly try my friend.
And if I could pray, my prayer would never end.
But if you want me to beg, I'll fall down on my knees;
Asking for you to come back
I'd be pleading for you to come back
Beggin for you to come back to me.

You think the words you're saying
Are really going through my head
I'm gonna take you home
And give you all I can
I'll prove to you, baby
That really I'm a man

Hold on--I know I'm feeling ready
Hold on--I know I'm rockin' steady
Hold on--Guess I've made it with you woman
Hold on--I've got you giving me love

Something that you give me
Keeps me hangin' on
No use me stayin'
There's nothing to be done
I'm gonna take you home
And give you all I can
I'll prove to you woman

Ritchie Blackmore,"You came along for a weekend
But you only stayed for one night
You pulled off your hair
You took out your teeth
Oh I almost died of fright
You'd better do something for your own sake
Yes it's a shame
Ah you know you're a living wreck

You said you were a virgin
Full of promise and mystery
But I know that you
Would bring me down
'cause everyone calls you big G

Ritchie Blackmore,"Really hate running really hate the game
Looking at them all I want to be unborn again
Their suit is getting tighter although they're getting thin
The flies are crawling on their face and trying to get in
People say that we're to blame I say
No no no it's just the game
Must we let them fool us no no no
Have we got our freedom no no no
Is it getting better no no no
Do we love each other no no no
Must we wait forever no no no

Heads are getting stronger bodies getting weak
Looking at them all it feels good to be a freak
Their hands are getting closer they're reaching out so far
The greenies gonna get them make them serve stars
Tell them how it is and they say
No no no we know it all
The washing's getting dirty the air is getting thin
It's all in such a mess that no one knows where to begin
They talk about creating but all they do is kill
They say we're gonna mend it but they never will
Poison in the rain but they say
No no no we ain't to blame

For change and change becoming

Of courtly wiles and pleasure
As the star of morn
Shines brightly for the king...

Pray thee lift the veil
From those who came before us
Merriment will prevail

Ritchie Blackmore,"I stood out here once before
With my head held in my hands
For all that I had known of this place
I could never understand...

On the hills the fires burned at midnight
Superstition plagued the air
Sparks fly as the fires burn at midnight
The stars are out and magic is here...

I wished on the seven sisters
Bring to me wisdom of age
All that's locked within the book of secrets
I longed for the knowledge of the sage...

On the hills the fires burned at midnigth
Superstition plagued the air
Sparks fly as the fires burn at midnight
Stars are out and magic is here
The stars are out and magic is here...

So, the sisters smiled to themselves
And they whispered as they shone
And it was from that very instant
I knew I would never be alone...

While on the hills
The fires burned at midnight
Superstition plagued the air
Sparks fly as the fires burn at midnight
Stars are out and magic is here
The stars are out and magic is here...

Many stars were long forgotten
Many faded and became ghosts
Still my sisters glittered down from heaven
Always there when I neede them most...

And on the hills the fires burned at nidnight
Superstition plagued the air
Sparks fly as the fires burn at midnight
Stars are out and magic is here
The stars are out magic is here...

I stood out here once before

Ritchie Blackmore,"There have been many tales
Tainted by truth twisted by time...
Some choose to forget
Yet it still
Weaves webs in their minds...

And it seems like she's been here forever
Her branches as black as the seas
She's been through it all
By the luck of the draw
She became the old hanging tree...

She asked for nothing
Except maybe
A little rain...
They used her strength
To help them steal lives away...

And she witnessed the sadness and sorrow
To this day she still doesn't know why
But her heart broke
When they came with the rope
To declare her the old hanging tree...

Life stranger than fiction
Can make you want to cry
Roots could never stop her
From reaching for the sky...

Life stranger than fiction
Can make you want to cry
Roots could never stop her
From reaching for the sky...

Those years have all past
Lucky for us lucky for her...
Now, children play at her feet
And in her arms she cradles birds...

And it seems she's been here forever
These days are the best that she's seen
Still somewhere in the back
Of her mind is the time
She was known as the old hanging tree...

Yes somewhere in the back
Of her mind is the time
She was known as the old hanging tree...

The bells are a ringing
On Mid Winter's Night
The moon sets all alone
And once again I try to sleep before the morning light

Too soon the sun will come a-calling over the hills in our little town
Too soon the snow will start falling over the worls without a sound
While in my room dreams are a-fleeting
I close my eyes one more time
All too quickly the dawn is breaking and I must leave the night behind.

Ritchie Blackmore,"A timeless and forgotten place,
The moon and sun in endless chase
Each in quiet surrender
while the other reigns the sky
The midnight hour begins to laugh
A summer evening's epitaph
The winds are getting crazy
As the storm begins to rise
As the storm begins to rise

Wild were the winds that came
In the thunder and the rain
Nothing ever could contain
The rising of the storm

In the wings of ebony
Darkened waves fill the trees
Wild winds of warning
Echo through the air

Follow the storm now, I've got to get out of here
Follow the storm as you take to the sky
Follow the storm now it's all so crystal clear,
Follow the storm as the storm begins to rise

She seems to come from everywhere
Welcome to the dragon's lair
Fingers running through your hair
She asks you out to play

For all of nature's sorcery
The most bewitching entity
Hell can have no fury
Like the rising of the storm

Follow the storm now, I've got to get out of here

Ritchie Blackmore,"3 black crows were sitting on a fence
Watching the world pass them by
Laughing at humanity and its pretense
Wondering where next to fly

Like the winds of a hurricane
And they spread their wings as if to declare
""Onward, let freedom ring!""

They would never understand if they ever heard
Gemini, Capricorn, rising in the east
Dancing through the witchwood we began to sing

In between dark and light in the underworld
Wrapped around your finger like a string of pearls
Smiling face, empty hand, 7 golden rings
Dancing through the starlight we began to sing

Ahh, still I hear the whisper ""Cartouche""
Caramel colored leaves spiral in the air
Diving right into the ground 'round the winding stair
Stories carved out of wood, jester and the king

Don't stay away too long this time
We'll raise a glass, maybe two
And we'll be thinking of you
Until our paths cross again, maybe next time

Let's remember the moments that leave us all too soon
We'll smile at the pictures still lingering in our minds
When you're reminiscing, then all you need is time...

Pressed flowers and dreams we had, our fingerprint on time

Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you happened to call

And here I sit
My hand on the telephone
Hearing a voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
Where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest

Ten years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
Oh and you brought me something
We both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms

And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing
With leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You are always so good with words
And at keeping things vague

Because I need some of that vagueness now

And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

In the middle ran a stream so blue...
A maiden fair, in despair, once had met her true love there and she told him...
She would say...
""Promise me , when you see, a white rose you'll think of me
I love you so,
Never let go, 
I will be your ghost of a rose""

Her eyes believed in mysteries
She would lay amongst the leaves of amber
Her spirit wild, heart of a child, yet gentle still and quiet and mild and he loved her...
When she would say...
""Promise me , when you see, a white rose you'll think of me
I love you so,
Never let go, 
I will be your ghost of a rose""

Dancing to the setting sun as he watched her
And ever more he thought he saw
A glimpse of her upon the moors forever

Never let go,

Ritchie Blackmore,"I stood upon the Ivory Tower 
As far as I could see
The winds that grew from out of the trees were calling out to me
Curtains blew in the Ivory Tower
Willows start to bend
The ravens flew to escape the fury as the storm descends

I followed fortune 'round the tower
Searching in vain
For through the mist 'round the old stone tower I only found rain
And though the cold, cold Ivory Tower was stony through and through
I laid and dreamed on a feather bed, my dream was of you
My dream was of you.

All time waiting
As the sun doth set in the haze
All time waiting
Every hour feels like a day, oh.

Ritchie Blackmore,"Merrily we sailed along
Though the waves were plenty strong
Down the twisting river Rhine
Following a song
Legend's faded storyline
Tried to warn us all
Oh, they called her ""Loreley""
Careful or you'll fall.

Oh, the stories we were told
Quite a vision to behold
Mysteries of the seas in her eyes of gold
Laying on the silver stone, such a lonely sight
Barnacles become a throne, my poor Loreley

And the winds would cry, and many men would die
And all the waves would bow down to the Loreley

You would not believe your eyes, how a voice could hypnotize
Promises are only lies from Loreley
In a shade of mossy green, seashell in her hand
She was born the river queen, ne'er to grace the land

Oh, the song of Loreley
Charms the moon right from the sky
She will get inside your mind, loveley Loreley
When she cries ""Be with me until the end of time""
You know you will ever be with your Loreley",Loreley

I told the coachman, ""Just drive me on, 
It's the same old destination 
But a different world to sing upon."" 
So he threw back his head and he counted. 
I jumped out about five to nine. 
And I waved at the stage door-keeper 
Said, ""Mister, get me to the stage on time."" 
Oh, but the rain wasn't made of water 
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun 
So I slipped behind a rainbow 
And waited till the show had done. 

I packed my ammunition. 
Inside the crowd was shouting, ""Encore"", 
But I had a most funny feeling 
It wasn't me they were shouting for. 
So when the tall dark lady smiled at me 
I said, ""Oh, baby let us go for a ride."" 
And we came upon two drinks or four 
And popped them oh so neatly inside. 

Oh, but the rain wasn't made of water 
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun 
So we slipped behind a rainbow 
And lay there until we had done.

Or you can drive me to the airplane

Ritchie Blackmore,"I wandered down the pathway, through the misty moor
Like I knew he did a thousand times before
Voices seem to echo ""come talk with me a while
Just around the corner, just another mile""

I had heard the stories, her legend served her well
A mystic's myth or fable, truth or fairytale
A raggle-taggle gypsy , with a toothless smile
Said ""sit with me my darling, let's talk a little while""

And the road goes on, seeming ever longer on the way to
Mandalay
And the road goes on, forever will I wander on the way to

Some things don't go as they're planned
Where are we going from here

Spinning in circles with riddles in rhyme
We lose our way, trying to find
Searching to find our way home
Trying to find our way home

As the day dies, with tears in our eyes
There's too few hellos and too many goodbyes
Silence answers our cries where are we going from here

I've traveled round the world
Always on the search for something new
But what does it matter
When all the roads I've crossed
Always seem to lead back to you…

Old familiar faces
Everyone you meet
Following the ways of the land
Cobblestones and lanterns
Lining every street
Calling me to come home again

Dancing in the moonlight
Singing in the rain
Oh it's good to be back home again
Laughing in the sunlight
Running down the lane
Oh it's good to be back home again

When you play with fire
Sometimes you get burned
It happens when you take a chance or two
But time is never wasted
When you've lived and learned
And in time it all comes back to you…

And when I got weary
I'd sit a while and rest
Memories invading my mind
All those things I'd treasured
The ones I'd loved the best
Were the things that I'd left behind…

Whispering a haunting tune
To the night

Fire in her stare
In the woods without a sound
No one cared

Through the darkened fields entranced
Music made her poor heart dance
Thinking of a lost romance
Long ago
Feeling lonely, feeling sad
She cried it the moonlight
Driven by a world gone mad
She took fight

Feel no hurt, there's nothing gained
Only love will then remain""

",All Because of You
Ritchie Blackmore,"Be mine tonight,
We'll travel through all our memories,
In our own little space in time,
You've always been mine

Through the years,
I feel your love beside me
Through the laughter and the tears,
You've conquered all my fears

So many stories,
So many treasures,
So much our lives have shared
We've done it all and we've done it together,
You know I've always cared

In this heart,
There'll never be another,
You have made my life complete,
Our love is like a dream

Take my hand,
Nothing can come between us,
We were always meant to be,
Forever, you and me

In my eyes,
Your face is always before me,
Our souls are now as one
We've only just begun",Be Mine Tonight
Ritchie Blackmore,"Solitaire with a song in her heart
But what a sad song to sing
Turned her back on all that she knew
In the hopes of a golden ring

And the rains come down
And the stars fell from the sky
Oh, how dark the night
It always seems those castles and dreams
Fade with the morning light

Such a sad story
That time loves to tell
Copper coins shine for the sun
From the floor of the wishing well

And the rains come down
And the stars fell from the sky
Oh, how dark the night
It always seems those castles and dreams
Fade with the morning light

So the jewel of jeopardy
Shines with each dangerous step
So unsure of what we've become
What we have and what we have left",Castles and Dreams
Ritchie Blackmore,"I still remember
I thought of you the other day
How worlds of change led us astray
Colors seem to fade to gray
In the wake of yesterday...

You looked into my eyes
You had me hypnotized and
I can still remember you...

I had a dream of you and I
A thousand stars lit up the sky
I touched your hand and you were gone
But memories of you live on...

You looked into my eyes
You had me hypnotized and
I can still remember you...
Those moments spent together promising forever and
I can still remember you

Do you ever think of me
And get lost in the memory
When you do, I hope you smile
And hold that memory a while...

You looked into my eyes
You had me hypnotized and
I can still remember you...
Those moments spent together promising forever and
I can still remember you
Still remember you
Still remember you
Still remember you
Still remember you
Still remember you
Still remember you
Still remember you
Still remember you
Still remember you
Still remember you
",I Still Remember
Ritchie Blackmore,"October reminds me of my home
The cold nights I would wait all alone
Watching leaves turning from green to gold
The waiting feels like eternity
When waiting for love to come to me
Someone to have, someone to hold
Then once in a million years
A shining white knight will appear
Fairy tales are coming true
I promise my heart only to you
A castle stands upon a hill
Our eyes meet and time is standing still
Your smile warmed me like the first summer sun
There's color where once was black and white
There's moonbeams where there was only night
I knew then and there you were the one",Once in a Million Years [#]
Ritchie Blackmore,"I took a walk along the shore
To clear my mind about the day,
I saw a man I'd seen before
As I approached, he slipped away...

I knew his face from years ago,
His smile stays with me ever more
His eyes, they guide me through the haze
And give me shelter from the storm...

As I walk I can feel him,
Always watching over me...
His voice surrounds me,
My Spirit of the Sea...

He went away so long ago,
On a maiden voyage far away
A young man then I did not know,
His life was taken that same day...

And it was almost like he knew
He wouldn't see me anymore
He looked so deeply in my eyes, and said
""Wait for me along the shore...""

And so I come most every day,
To watch the waves rise and fall,
And as I sit here on the sand,
This ocean makes me feel so small...

But I feel my lover by my side,
And he makes me follow my own heart
We'll be together some sweet day
When that day comes we'll never part...

When that day comes we'll never part...
Wait for me along the shore...",Spirit of the Sea
Ritchie Blackmore,"They say that it's always darkest right before the dawn
They say that I must be strong just to carry on
But they don't know that I would wait my whole lifetime through
Because you know, my love, that I'd be waiting just for you...

There you stood, amazing shining for the whole world to see
And I knew an angel had been sent to watch over me...

So I'll be here waiting, hoping, dreaming, loving you
Because I know, my love, that you do love me too

They say that it's always darkest right before the dawn

Ritchie Blackmore,"Whoa

I get the same old dream, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in!

Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you've been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Oh, whoa, oh
Since you've been gone

So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you've been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Oh, whoa, oh
Since you've been gone

If you will come back
Baby you know
You'll never do wrong

Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you've been gone
You cast the spell, so break it

Ritchie Blackmore,"I have often told you stories
About the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand
And sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me love me
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old

When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thougt my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
Yes, I can hear the sound
Of a windmill goin' 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune",Soldier of Fortune
Ritchie Blackmore,"High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air
Oh I see his face

Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
Don't know why
Now where do we go?

Hot wind, moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky
Oh, I see his face!

Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, far?
When do we leave?
Hey, I believe, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
Too many die
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But we don't know why
Ooh, now where do we go

All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound, as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand
Oh, I see his face!

Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed

In heat and rain
With the whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly

But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many die
Just to see him fly

Look at my flesh and bone
Now, look, look, look, look
Look at his tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there, on the horizon
And I'm coming home, coming home, coming home

Time is standing still
He gave back my will
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Going home
I'm going home

My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
A place called home
A place called home

Take me back

Rites of Spring,"Caught in time so far away from where our hearts really wanted to be 
Reaching out to find a way to get back to where we'd been 
And if summer left you dry with nothing left to try 
This Time...... Caught at a distance from myself and there was no one there to know 

What could I do? 
I have learned sometimes a need can run too deep and we throw away the things 
We most wanted to keep and inside we lie over and over again 
This Time...... 

If you don't know you'd better learn to believe me 
When I say I'm going to build a wall around this town Around these hearts and hands.",Spring

Rittz,"Cocaine in my nostril here
White lines chopped in the cloudy mirror
Heart beat telling me to slow it down
I ain't listening I can hear it loud and clear
My ribcage is clutchy and I'm born this way
Still tryin' to score liquor for a drip
Dripping throwing I did too much
Having a panic attack, I feel short of breath
I shut the bathroom door and wet my face
Hoping that the water might cool me off
Tryin' to throw up in the toilet to get it out my system
My nose starting pouring blood
And that made it worse the blood stained my shirt
I'm contemplating wake my parents off
Telling the truth I'm overdose on the coke
But make them go away I'm just paranoid
I went back in the room and I shut the door
Got some sand next and the dress and drawers
Here I go again mix it up and down 
As it sound on my heart like a tug of wolves
As I heard as I lay in bed 
Please God let me live pride myself don't do drugs no more
Close my eyes and realize that I wasn't sure
I calmed down let it score more
Like God damn!

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord might sow too deep
But if I before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul too take
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen,
Let me see another day again.

Holes in the gloves of a homeless man
Freeze in the dead as a coaster man
Wanna come bigger with an open hand
With a man said he probably slow again
But more holes in the clothes that dispose the skin
Sick with and the old gaze small and slim
Hoping that somebody watch by and sees and freeze
Let me throw him a coat to winter
It's unbearable he hasn't ate in days
Digging through the trash and found a burger that's halfway eaten 
And a pack with some mayonnaise
Big and all ain't nobody gave 'em chains
It just lays waste but under underpass
Last year he and almost froze to death
But this winter's much colder
The homeless shelter's too full
Now there's no food left
The come rescue me and no breath 
Can't get in the second wind there's no fallen rise
Praying out loud please God I apologize
With anything I done wrong 
He can't feel his fingers his legs are numb
But everybody guess is at home warm inside
He's up under the bridge about to freeze to death
And said God I don't want to die
But dear Lord!

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord might sow too deep
But if I before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul too take
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen,
Let me see another day again.

Life for her is so promising
Pack it up a home coming queen
Dreamed of becoming a doctor one day
She's smart too her grades were astonishing
Her boyfriend gave her a promise ring
It was a prime example of puppy love
They get as if it was a touch and a hit
Every time you saw one it was coupled off
Either one never drank that much for one night
They got an invite to drink with friends
It started off with a bigger night
Would change the course of life and have tragic end
And then 10 shots led us said they had to leave
Her friends say stay, are you OK to drive?
One of the dudes tried to take her keys
She said , please you're tripping I'm OK I'm fine
She got behind the wheel her boyfriend was trashed
On the highway going way too fast
Hit a sharp corner on the band and crashed
And her boyfriends head went through the windshield
Her neck half open and her ribs are broken
And her boyfriend's gone in the car he died
She hanging on waiting or the jaws of life
To get her out then she start and shut her eyes
And said, God why?

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord might sow too deep
But if I before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul too take
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen,
Let me see another day again.",Amen
Rittz,"Have you ever been to outer space
Tour bus living like a balisaur 
Over no counter space
Evaluate the life but the future's hard to calculate
Can't stop but you gotta look at everybody putting on a smiley face
Have you seen a sunshine in the cloudy day 
You light the over cash you really hope with that
Could you light the darkness that comforts you
Like a compass do
Buzzer 'em like you just flew up the zoo
Higher than a middle school kid up on glue
Sucking really on mouth from dark alone
Fix faith the rub sticks we start the fight
Knowing that the real shit is coming soon
You could wind a song or two I heard it backwards
Wishing close my eyes and saw the blackbirds
Eating on a dead raccoon
Starting to think I'm bad when I was scared to say bad words
And for the internet making up Facebook passwords
I see Casper slow in my room 
When I pray I guess she come down and bring f words
People kill deal for the ant lords
I didn't really wanna pet one
I didn't really wanna let one live
Or some futuristic shit like the Jetsons
Yes man floating on my home boy, step on
Fitting to my pops all that 'cause a lecture
Take a step and I drip in the death of my headphone
Singing on the floor in the restroom get some

Looking at the world with my eye lids shut
We give it all to live but when we die then what
My eyes electrifying like the lightning struck
I look up in the sky and hope that I get up
In heaven, heaven

Hey pass me the squigy (Somebody do up)
I'm sick in New Port doing coke (In my bus)
In New Port doing coke but (You are so far)
You done brought 2 hoes backstage (That shit ain't goal)
You told me 3 hoes was deal
'Cause they were (headbanging)
Or you could be certain that the meat curve (Was hanging)
Hey let me get another shot of jack (Fuck yeah!)
What?! oh you drank it all (Fuck yeah!)
Fuck it where's the canadian mist
Now I'm on some plastic bottle drinking shit
And my tour manager's looking for somewhere to sink his dick (Brooklyn)
Represent, represent sent, trap call myth , represent ,represent sent
The bottle ain't girl for queen queen
Somebody ways to swim badadduuu duduuu
And I mean that from the bottom of my nuts
3 more shots I moonshine I do fine

I'm grateful to be alive, God bless the souls that came in with I'm so lucky
To have a good family that loves me
Please let my girl know how much I love her
Sorry that we're both so unhealthy
I feel so guilty
Every time I pray I feel like I ask her to help me
I don't pray with the hopes to get wealthy
I just want success I know it sounds selfish
I thought I'm gonna screw her
I finally had the chance to fix it
I signed a record deal all these years
I wish I was more optimistic ,
I'm really just scared
What if they don't like what they hear
What if I don't make a career out of music
What am I supposed to do then
I'm always getting jobs
I hate to see my face in the mirror
And I wrote about everything so many times 
I don't have inspiration to spare
I barely even hear
I've been down on the road 
And I feel like I've been gone all year
Even when I'm home there's so much pressure to be here
It's hard to feel like I'm all there
So many wish they could rest for a living 
So complain about us it's unfair
Some days I feel like I've been living in a dream
Other times feeling like a nightmare
And I need some of my peers
'Cause I have a bunch of songs to write
And I feel like my future depends on this
Gotta rid myself of mirror plus these hand chips
Gotta get some confidence up in my paymentship
And I wanna disappoint the fans who listenin'
'Cause they expectin' something incredible in the end
But that pain I'm nothing as I regain to get my strive back
I'ma went with them when I was a kid
When I was a kid my dad just play the guitar
Me and my brother would pretend that we was in a band
Musicians in my family dream to be stars
Only to condensate something that you didn't attend my music
Must've been playing the chosen one
So I'ma go tripping and go behind this sniper rock
Amen, song never came

In the spot coming from my Gucci lenses
Plus tour buses scoops and Benzes
I ain't used to this I came through the trenches
Now my cousin fill up on boots and end em
Said I can't pronounce multiple bank accounts
Now I get my homies and my hemmys down
Shit I used to get a hundred bucks a show
Now I get a couple grand to come and stand around
And drink shots of crown but never snitched to real
One too many gotta catch some air
Rooftop parties bars everywhere 
But success don't rest out of hair corvair
Big rozay hoe's day when I come and show them
This the me I get 'em tipsy freeze
Be going both ways pussy lickers skills that go showcase
Late night bunch of hoes at my doorway

It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over , baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober

Two fucker take a break to take a shot
Restaurant closed so we go in
Have my Iphone out making homemade porn
And she screaming oh Lord, like she born again
One of us going down on snorkeling
Walk by my hotel room door and 
I'm sure you hear us bone and probably came the moment
And fuck a maid keeping knocking reorienting
She give me oral then I told her you're a 10
Blind 'cause you really bout eaten a half
But a head game is the greatest I had
It's a damn shame that I'm singing the last
Bet it was a blast she was making the splash
And I got one more favor to ask
Can I put a lil' bit cocaine on your ass
I took a sniff and I told the bitch slider ass

Feeling like a motherfucker breaking down record my tool
The nervous nigga with a flat on glove
Hella body with a bounce this is pimpin' hoe
Pow, vroom! shake with a fine grim
And both out to shine like a barn bill
I'm too cool don't I walk like I got it all down to a science fiction
Kinda like domino's pizza
And don't get too comfortable in the morning, 
Money always feel better than sex to me
The trick if I pick it up and ask for free
Motherfucker flamboyant
When I walked on the snow baby
And the sound of shy day fills the room with jamma bitch which fills my pocket
I like to wiggle wiggle it more I'm a hussler
Walk around pimpin' I don't touch 'em
I thought you knew that pimps don't go to jail
For pimpin', they go for mispimpin'
So don't do that,
And understand God made pimps so a hoe can have a man
A trip won't understand

Stepping out, looking like I'm in a fashion show
Came into this industry and now you're witnessing me blow up
Like seeing a tank of gas explode
And I'm, I'm high like a flight I'm sitting back of coach
By the window sipping Jack and Cokes
'Bout to pack a bowl but we ain't tryna bake a casserole
Looking at the globe from up high, shots fired
Like Kennedy was riding by the Grassy Knoll
I ain't rich but I got a little cash to blow
And haters saying that I'm changing
I be looking at them laughing like they cracked a joke
They wasn't with me when I traveled down this gravel road
GC, I could never have my pass revoked
So step up and you a dead duck
Get your head bust, looking like a chef just cracked a yolk
Speakers in the Cadi' rattling the patio
When the industry was only rocking platinum gold
I was dope back then, but you had the whole
Shit locked until I came in and cracked the code
And I don't, I don't really mean to brag and boast
But then again, my fans look at me as the G.O.A.T
She said she listen to my music in the bath and soak
Now that's a rap to quote, hop in my 'Lac and float

Take a puff and it's up and away we go
Put some pimp shit on my radio and bounce, bounce, ah
Let the bass vibrate my chest, take it to the Midwest
Run it back to the south, and bounce, out

Up at Kalamazoo, balling out up in the mall
We don't bounce 'til we spend a couple thousand on shoes
I'm repping clientele, how can I lose, you out of the loop

'Til I blew, producing woohs and oohs and ahs
I'm the truth, but you confuse the use of pride
I refuse to lose, been booed and crucified
Disapprove the movement, crews get brutalized
Or these pooches choose to bite, get euthanized
I'm the new, the who, but soon gets neutralized
Twenty twos are huge, my shoes are supersized
I don't cruise, my music boom, it's stupid loud
Bumping 8 Ball & MJG, from the outside looking in
I'm sitting on top of the world, but then again I kind of been lately
Cause I pull up in my Cadillac, my speakers got that rattle back
I'm flashin metal when I was attacked by
A couple pretty bitches that was begging me to pick em up
And take em in and fuck em from the back side
But I ain't got no time to fuck around, I'm tryna buckle down
And focus on my money, so I stack my
Paper to the ceiling, I'm feeling like a billion
I'm filling up my cup with that crown and bounce out

Take a puff and it's up and away we go
Put some pimp shit on my radio and bounce, bounce, ah
Let the bass vibrate my chest, take it to the Midwest
Run it back to the south, and bounce, out

Smoking wood, then I'm gone
So far that you can't even see me through the eyes of a telescope
Diamonds on my body, split a pill while jottin' down my feelins'
Acting like it was the realest shit I ever wrote
Mental telepathy is part of the recipe
That let me know that you want it
I'm giving it to you how you like it
Biology of a pimp, it be in the DNA
To know what you thinking
I'm speaking to you like a psychic
Lil mama know she lovin it so don't try to fight it
I can make your life so appealing by the way I write it
Make it so she the only shawty I know
On Forgiatos, don't hit no potholes
I roll up one and light it
On the passenger side of a ride
Like a player, I'm a be up in the cut talking the big shit
Strange Music, we be the misfits
Come and twist Rittz, tisk tisk, cause you gon get your shit split
Middle of the map and nigga finna snap
And let em know the area continue to kill em forever, we on
Better be strong to live in the city I come from
And if you ain't fucking with it then let it be known
And we can either talk about it or be about it
Me I'd rather sit back and blow an ounce
When I hear something like this up on the radio
All a nigga can do is just bounce

Take a puff and it's up and away we go
Put some pimp shit on my radio and bounce, bounce, ah
Let the bass vibrate my chest, take it to the Midwest
Run it back to the south, and bounce, out",Bounce
Rittz,"You've been sleeping on me, and it's your loss
The shit I hear you listen to the type of music that I'm bored of
Some of you dumber than a doorknob
'Blowjob Betty' I be in my super-sport bumping Short Dawg
Gold scum even if I could afford a sports car
Funny all a sudden it's popular to support us
Ridin' across the country in my tour bus
Throwing up the North still repping orange feeling Norcross
Still burn steel burn steal one a pure 'ts'all
Pop a pill when I feel like a war prod'uct
Cli-N-Tel we don't chill with these morons
Strapped but my steel it concealed from the warthogs
Been infatu' will got the skill of a war hog
Signed a record deal pop a cork off
Of some Champagne with my lady she was down when I was broke
So I would never go and leave her for a stripper or a pornstar
Fuck a judge an escort car
He magazine will cover me a company been doing a poor job
I been going hard in Atlanta since the nineties
Motherfucker now you finally wanna try and win a war? Nah
I ain't got no friends only chicks to get
The say my crew riding for checks to bricks
To break you wris' the 'ffect of this
And they expected nothing less but decks of this
What you expected bitch? Cause this

The spotlight is on me I'm ready to go for the gold
I waited my life for this moment I'm 'bout to explode
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I waited my life for this moment I'm 'bout to explode

My goal is so close to focus this journey been like a roller coaster
Been broke and rose back when I was broke and hopeless
And hoes would look at me like I was gross repulsive
Now they showing up at shows with posters posing naked
And posting pictures that got me mixed with emotions
Right about to pass tryna live in the moment
Say ain't been passed with happiness what the missing component
(I'm) 'bout to murder competition opponent
The foes get exposed they talk shit--of disposed of 'em
Find the king in the thrown throwing stones at his army
A Holy Ghost is on me it's like I'm so explosive
Missile to my flow and undergo hypnosis
Snakes crawling all around me seeing boas cobra
People let 'em at the gangsters to Longe de Você
Both impose a threat to me but I believe in destiny
And God has been the remedy the road is chosen with it
The word on my shoulder was scoliosis but (I'm)
Electrified I'm like a jolt of voltage
Diamonds on my necklace shinning like a bowl of goldfish
And I'm telling Rittz cause I know 'bout that dole of go-gets
Sick of penny-pinching like I'm tryna host some roasters
Busting through the wall I was broken holes in
And I was meant to be the centerpiece
I'm sick of playing second base to anyone today
Is kinda blow explode in this

The spotlight is on me I'm ready to go for the gold

In my old school bumpin' that ""Kiss of Life"" beneath the city lights
Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed
'Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight
This dream difficult for me to visualize
And that was real when they said the limit is the sky
But my feets on solid ground, no more stalling now
On the road to get it 'cause, when it rain, it pour
But now the storm finally calming down
Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining
My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds
I ain't got a bunch of money 'cause it cost to grind
Silly beats being burnt up with my stomach growlin'
In the darkest island, got the heart to fight
I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant
Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling
I'll be up in Neiman Marcus smiling
Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe
You could say that you played in the major league
Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave
I feel wet from the sweat on my famous tee
I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf
'Cause runaways for me is unknown
So I lit up my J, from a kid up was straight
Crown Royal, now I'm in my zone

This ain't no ordinary, dog
I was sick of being poor and said enough
Right up 85 North, I never was
Working, breaking down doors and barriers
Still representing Georgia, I'm feeling the support
Spread the word 'cause the more, the merrier
Nobody blowing off the torch I carry
Got annoyed from every time they point and stare and judge
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde
And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts
Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down
In case you wanna come and duke it out
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce
And we just blew an ounce
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist
I got the backseat bass and the lobster bisk
And took a shot of whiskey to the dome
Made a toast to the homies that are gone
Two for the fans and the love they shown

(I'm in my zone) I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone

My calendar at this caliber's for the life of a bachelor
I'm burning through cannabis canister after canister
Um, so many cameras, they flashing, I never glance at 'em
Lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer
I'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer
Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on 'er
I'm a modern day Galileo who lives in Atlanta
The capital of the ratchets, aristocrats and traffickers
A practitioner, practice until I master it
Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate
Anything less to describe me is just inaccurate
You're a student of classes in which I am a graduate
Immaculate vernacular, Bat-mobile look like Dracula
Giving these boys the blues while telling these hoes to saddle up
You catching feelings, I think you squarer than Madison, I'm
I'm in my zone, ain't no way I'll ever snap out of it

Around the holidays, they were pistol carrying
In the spare, getting paper was imperative

Foot rubber's got her head in the merch guys lap
Head banging like she listening to Korn
Hit the hotel
Bought out all the rooms smoking out the whole floor
Fans in the lobby standing by the brochures
Knocking on the door empty-handed uninvited
So I'm geeked up letting all the people know it

Let's go back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday

Remember Valentine's Day twenty-ten
She was so upset 'cause I had to go to work
We ain't got to spend much time together lately 
'Cause the rap was finally taking off, I had to put it first
My boss said one of us can take off early
I was like ""me please"" 'cause I wanted to surprise her
So I drove to her job, turned my lights off in the parking lot 'cause she was getting off at five
My stomach giddied out when she came outside
She was walking with a guy, laughing and something didn't seem right
And when she noticed me she looked like she was busted doing something
Tryna kiss me, I said ""who the fuck is he, mucka?
Feeling was killing me, I couldn't even knee
I felt like she was hiding shit, I couldn't let it go
I asked her one more time is there something going on between you and him?
She looked at me and told me ""I don't know!""
You don't know
What the fuck you mean
You've been cheating on me, shit
Bet that her and him would kiss, crying
Telling me that all I do is spend my time writing, working nights, neglecting her
She don't love me like she did
Well the last 5 years were for nothing
Yeah we struggled but we loved each other now it's coming to a sudden end
Fighting, tryna move my furniture up out of momma's crib
Pack my shit, kiss our dog on the head then I left and I felt like
Death

One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time

Stayin' the the basement of my mum and dads
Staring at her facebook every pictures that she posts every comment
Tryna' see if she gone' call me back on an over lonely heart
My mama said it's gonna' pass playing 80's music back to back, Johnny Hates Jazz Shattered Dreams
How am I supposed to live without you when I've been loving you so long, she already sending kisses
I wonder if she's started fucking him or not I bet you
I sent her texts saying I miss you she don't write back 
I know I shouldn't but at night I like to ride past
The house I used to call ours yeah my name's
Still on the bills scared to switch 'em thinking there's a slight chance
She's just going through a faze we'll get back together soon but it's two a.m.
I wonder where her car is and how the dog is I wish I could go inside and pet him
I never thought you would do me wrong bitch
I need to calm down, sadness turn to anger Xanax putting me into a deep depression
All I can do is wait now, shit I almost had a break down
Up at Tree Sound, we was mixing Wishin'
White Jesus just dropped everything I dreamed about when
I was younger is coming true while I'm in this position
It's like my life is finally supposed to be the shit but isn't chewing on the barrel of my pistol
Never visioned that this bitch would do me like this

True Love
True Love is counted by the health, well-being
And happiness to another person to a greater degree than your own health and well-being and happiness
When you care for your saying of words, thoughts and actions
that’s specifically how you figure out a person, your love

A soulmate
A soulmate is a person who’s perfectly suited to another person’s temperament
A person who strongly resembles another person in their attitude and belief
A close friend who completely understands them
A person who has the same beliefs and opinions as another person

A douchebag
A douchebag is someone where you [?] at the end of a song
Just rinse the douchebag nozzle in warm water after using it
Let the douchebag dry completely, use twice a day
One day

Online gettin' turned on by a bunch of male groupies
That said they gonna shoot me or do something to me
When they see me them imaginary bullets go through me
Ask anyone who know me in the rap game say that I'm cool but you should watch how you pursue me
I find it confusing these dudes click on my dick so hard
Its like they grew a coochie homie you canoeing
Up shit creek, a thick beef stew was brewing
You talk about it so much I wish that you would use your toolie
On yourself blow your brains out, plus you suck at rappin'
If I was you I would do tattooing you stupid
Thinkin' I'ma argue with you online
So you could try to get views boo-hooing
Talking shit about me and all I do is keep it cool with motherfuckers
(Now I'm starting to feel the) hugest mood swing
[?] Why would you include me
Cause it takes a while to text you back
So many rappers sittin' there trashing
They expect I'm gonna let them have
A feature for free and get so mad because I'm busy and can't do it
Really that's what all this 'bout?
I feel like I got so many enemies I cannot keep count
Even homies I grew up with are mad I blew up and wanna knock me down
But I'm like Rocky Balboa can't count me out
And I ain't dumb I've been around tommy guns before
But I'm not the one to be gunnin' for
And this is karma you started it shut the fuck up country boy

I'm tryin' hard not to write them a reply, but can't

On every record I'm guessing that they ain't musically inclined
They made the kind of statements
Oh, you saying Switch Lanes sound the same
As Heaven and Living the Dream and I could name
A bunch more Crown Royal, call 911
You can tell the difference between the flow on blow and wishin'
My Interview didn't you listen? I always switch it up
I'm thinking that these drones are slow
And they can't break down rhyme schemes
Heated cause they can't out rhyme me
And I ain't ever changing to try to get signed
And I ain't animating like say I'm Tech N9ne
But If you get me on a feature it's a straight up crime scene
It seems like every year that pass I gotta' remind you
I came through on my debut like make room
Its still the total opposite of shit from my sophomore
And still ain't got a sponsor from Monster
Jumping off the stage to hit a guy that flipped me off at my concert
They call me every name in the book
From white Tech to fat Yelawolf, see a friend jealous look
When they shaking my hand like I can't tell what's good
Cause I can't go and put people on just because
Man I wish that I was rich as you was thinking I was
Homies catching feelings acting like a bitch with a grudge
They liked it better when I was broke and depressed with a job
I tour three times a year if you mean what you said
And when you see me in your city tell me face to face
Cause you ain't real just another screen naming lame
Get out your black face paint and pray cause

These streets can be misleading, and this one thing I know
Don't come around here flexin', I suggest you slow your roll

From ninety-four to two thousand and five, I was up in Eagle Point then
A lot of people wasn't born here
Moving in and out, never know who the neighbor next door is
Drug dealers tryna build clientele
So they telling everybody they got it, that shit was short-lived
Jack boys get work, kick your door in
Talk to you on the phone, pistol-whip your girlfriend
Hit a lick for four grand, now they got some cash to fly
In high school, used lame kids to practice on
I made 'em empty out their pockets
Other kids dreaming of being astronauts
We were scheming to make a profit
The gun that's underneath the mattress drawn
Make it a chance of living half as long
A lot of homies from the past is gone
You wanna play games? Better train for the triathlon
'Cause ain't no games round here, ho
We ain't in no dorm room playing beer pong
Homies never made it into the millennium
Never forget 'em should've tattooed tears for 'em
Adam got a life sentence, he in Dooly State Prison
Send him money, if he need me then I'm here for him
We done smoked so much weed, smoking weed ain't shit
Doing any hard drugs we could get our hands on
Man Darren, he was clean, started fucking with that meth again
It wouldn't be GC without Mexicans
Claiming turf, gang signs spray painted on the picket fence
They gotta represent what set they in
Back in the day it was Breckinridge, Crescent Lake
Sweetwater, Saratoga, and The Falls just to name a few
So watch the lane you choose, and who you bragging to
'Cause you gon' end up getting robbed in the North

These streets can be misleading, and this one thing I know
Don't come around here flexin', I suggest you slow your roll
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold
They gon' get you for your diamonds and gold
Everybody want some diamonds and gold
And I'm dying for your diamonds and gold

I know in Georgia, shit ain't peachy, so fuck what you've been told
'Cause when this shit get greezy, we've been known to go for broke
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold
They gon' get you for your diamonds and gold
Everybody want some diamonds and gold
And I'm dying for your diamonds and gold
Woah

We got a young nigga playing with that dope again
I'm in the kitchen on that Adderall, focusing
I'm on the road, doing shows, with some hoes again
I hit the gas a couple times, then I hold it in
I'm in the street with the heat on the seat
In case I bump into police or I run into my foes again
'Cause I hear them niggas tripping 'bout the flavor that I'm kicking
And I'm down to start messing with the gold, you see
I been breaking down pounds on them Lortab 10's
On a bar and a half, and I'm going back in
If you ever see a foreign car sliding on rims
Up 85 North [?] that's him
Just drive, I see him, I see him, I see him
All black tint, nigga riding Nigerian
All white paint, we gon' call it Siberian
Loud pack on him, he ain't no librarian
Up from Mexico City, that's that Norcross area
Whole lot of killers gon' need a pole bearer
Drinking on brown, got you feeling barbaric
Still got a trap spot right on Harrington
Still got a trap spot, trappin' on Jimmy
I'ma dump the whole clip til it run empty
And my license expired, tell Rittz to come get me
We the only ones got a key to this city
My lawyer's suppressing the evidence
I had some dope in my residence
I had some guns in my residence
I would not tell on no Mexican, I would not tell on no Mexican!
They can indict it, I'll fight it, I swear to that
Shorty don't like me, I'm piping, I'm arrogant
Gambino boss on the North and I carry it
We got Mariah, you buying, I'm selling it
Tell 'em Rittz

These streets can be misleading, and this one thing I know
Don't come around here flexin', I suggest you slow your roll
Tryna show off all your diamonds and gold
They gon' get you for your diamonds and gold

Woah",Diamonds and Gold
Rittz,"Yeah
Nobody fucking with us
Rittz up in this bitch, when I spit I'm a warrior
Still got that Crown Royal in my cup, 'bout to pour it up
Biggest independent in the game, if you lame we're ignorin' ya
Everytime I get with Tech on a track it's historical
You better warn these hoes, I said

Watch out for your spot, here I come, I'm warning ya
They say that I'm hot, really I was just warming up
Haters wanna see me flop, I’m outperforming 'em
Everywhere we go people point at us
They wanna join us 'cause we making noise
We was born with the formula
Strange Music got the formula
Tech Nina got the formula

From Atlanta to the MO
From the second that I connected with Tech I set the precedents
Get in a beef I said it's effortless
Rappers stressing us, so what's or who it do
You know who coming neck to neck with us
Nobody, I'm just resurrecting Keith Sweat for the heck of it
Sometimes I hate my aggression it gets the best of me
Like I was possessing I needed exorcism
'Till they hear me out here rushin' up the field like Emmitt Smith
Cocky like a boxing champ
Do excuse me 'cause my mind is kinda like a lava lamp
Savage like the Macho Man
Go induce a level on the side of my Versace lens
Swinging like I should be singing in a Mariachi band
Hola Que Pasa? Wait
You should really watch the way you stepping to me
Fuck around and now you lost a leg
And now you look like Drake in his Degrassi days
Crippled, lame as fuck, and it ain't tough for me to spot a rotting egg
Had to SWAT you, homie I'm a dragon I'm colossal
You a cartoon drawer, motherfucker I'm Picasso
I just need a Xannie bar, couple shots inside my nostril
When I'm Michael coming harder than Lamar inside a brothel
Fuck a rapper, I would rather be compared to Aristotle, where the bottle?
Simply miss another Caribou, where the Lou
Pussy fronting with a gun they scared of you, scared of who
Somebody better go and let them know that what they better do is

Watch out for your spot if I come, I'm warning ya

Pop pop pop pop pop pop, off at the mouth
How I do it so fluid spewing never soft as a mouse
Sick as sewage, I grew it too, it’s coolest talk at the house
Missou is the truest, you is foolish, flossin' about
Bickin' it back and I’m bein' a better one, somethin' better was never done
If you wanna win this cheddarrun you really better go get a gun
Yes I’m packin' the potion that’s never lackin' promotion
Have you stackin' and toastin' 'cause now you rappin' and grossin'
People set in they sin, 'bout the bread I’m makin'
That I made and never gave it yo where the heck is they been?
Said the label ain't charitable, gonna be checkin' they chin
The second they grin you really want it step and say when
But I’m in Monaco, on a boat, puffin' that chronicle
Dishonorable when they hate the snake and bat logo upon the coat
So if they wanna mope and leave us you can bet I'mma vote
Gassin' like conoco and killin' 'em off is comical
You should prolly think about it for you get up and you doubt it 'bout the pen game, definitely insane
I will become the in thing, music will then change
Take your family and friends brain, now they within Strange
The formula
Rittz got it to a T that’s why we gettin' the sound spread around now
With Tecca N9na right beside 'em you know it be goin' down diggy-down diggy-down-down!

Yes sir
Kali put the rocket in the pocket and the feet upon the dresser
At first, So Dope she wanna off the God, I'm guessin' I'm a blesser
Johnny and Donnie, we gettin' money, no illuminati
We show at the party, you feel like a lesser anybody
Oddity, how did he make killa commodity?
Finally had half of the vicinity so part of me
I feel like we're picking on other rappers and labels
They ain't sitting at the table with us, table with us
Maybe they devisionless cause they lacking in paper and we pay bills
What happened to some cray deals
Snake and a bat we be lackin' in that, we be gauge strapped
Say it whack and ain't about nothing', they be frontin' frontin'
Taking 'em back to putting paper in people's hands
So fecal won't equal, I'm making all the people dance
I know there'll be a lot of handgrabbing 'em, man battling
Even if they pants saggin' they be damn faggots
I'mma stay in crease khakis with a tan jacket
They can stand back and say I'm going ham sandwich
Bringing the same same mainstream game to the Strange team game 'cause the people really boring 'em
And the Choppers be kinda hard to understand when they speaking like a foreigner, maybe it's the formula

Rittz,"Welcome to the Jonny Valiant show
I'm about to blow
Independent with a hundred thousand albums sold
Rappers used to crowd around me funny now they don't
No one's in my lane, my competition going adios
No magician but I dissipate 'em in a cloud of smoke
Revvin' they engine up and I'm a thousand miles down the road
You ain't ever heard of me, fuck it now you know
It's hard to take you serious, and I ain't out of jokes
Most of the shit you rap about is unaccountable
Saying nothing, making noise with your mouth like you're out of road
Never seen an ounce of blow, flexin' like you Al Capone
So we can seek to sneak the brownie a la mode
Pocket full of bread, I ain't counting sour dough
Cheating on her from above, funny how the roles
Got reversed, when it was him, they never said, Look out below
Never tried to lend a hand, I was down and out and broke
With no balance in my bank account, and just a couple 'O's
Now we feast, I'll beat my [?] while we toastin' Crown and Coke
Weird where the talent go, now it's like there's no one left
Someone said you blowing up, they trolling on the social network
I murk my flows, I choke 'em out and never broke a sweat
You knock one out the box, now watch it 'cause a domino effect
You're not a monster so these ghosts or goblins don't oppose a threat
I ain't scared of no one, seen a hater and I told him that

If you don't start shit, there won't be none
'Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
'Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story

Go ahead and sound the horn, like every boring rapper does
I wish the dude behind the booth would pull the power cord
Just quit and do some shit you're good at
Your stage show is hard for me to look at
Like the unibrow on Al B. sure
The difference between our music's night and day
I'm getting busy but you shitty like a giant pile of cow manure
So watch that mouth of yours
I never thought I'd see the day it'd be okay to let these rappers dress like Shalamar
They wanna dance, suck a dick, fuck these kids, knock 'em off they balance boards
Beat 'em down and settle out at court
Ugly as fuck but these sluts pulling down they drawers
White bitches love me like an Abercrombie outfit stores
Sick and never found the cure, sipping on the Crown I poured
Wild and rowdy bumping Scotty ATL and (?) boy
Some dummy said I wasn't hungry since I made it and I'm famous
Bitch, I'm starving like the Army was in Valley Forge
Was dope enough to get a deal back in two thousand and four
I was born a killer, tried to warn 'em, better tell them boys

If you don't start shit, there won't be none
'Cause I don't really need no reason
To be the one responsible for your extinction
'Cause when it comes to competition, I don't see none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story
It's a goddamn ghost story

I'm just really being honest y'all
I'm just sick of being modest all the time
When all these artists talk like they the hottest and y'all
They don't get away with murder
They just rhyming words together, ain't no substance to their monologue
They go on stage and spray the crowd with water
Rapping over top they vocals to this track
In fact, they sounding awful dog
We ain't playing volleyball, I ain't going back and forth
If you diss me and then piss me off, then I might smack you for it
Run up in the studio while you were on like everything
It's coolio, I jack you for your laps up in your mackie board
You think I'm playing, you mistaken
Shit, you faker than the movie Taken
You ain't got no skills you only act the part
Come and get a battle scar, thicker shit that's caviar
You fictional like Battlestar Galactica and Avatar
I'm on another planet and these rappers I'm on Saturn, Mars
Venus, Jesus, we the C-N-T and we just laugh at y'all
An open casket, I just killed a Kato track
If you feel it, play it back
Really, I'm just stating facts that

If you don't start shit, there won't be none

Rittz,"Yeah
Sometimes I just get fucking pissed off
I just get sick of all this bullshit

Shit's sad growing up in the gutter
But I met a lot of kids, want to be like I am
It's weird, people see you on the come up
Then you happy with some money but I'm mean and I'm pissed
My girlfriend knows that I love her
But I mentally abuse her and I treat her like shit
We both suicidal, she a cutter
All I do is self-loath, what's the reason I live?
Bunch of empty liquor bottles in the cupboard
Lying to each other like next week we'll quit
Get drunk, make a straw outta dollar
But it's okay, it's only cocaine, not meth
My family looking at me like a fuck up
And they're right, and I don't want to disappoint my twin
I pray one day I'll recover
But it's like I'm tryin' to schedule an appointment with the devil
Lord knows I don't wanna die
So I'm begging, praying help me please
I lie like [?] in the summer
With anxiety and I ain't got no self-esteem
Lot of people are going wanna tell me shut up
Cause they got it way worse, I'm a selfish piece of shit
Make a motherfucker wonder, what it's gonna take for me to change mentally
Bags underneath my eyes cause I live too fast
Grey hairs on my beard
Feelin' like I can't breathe if I don't take a pill so I'm always on a Xan
Drink a bottle every night, I feel them doing damage to my liver
I ain't ever been this fat and disgusting
I don't wanna rap, I wanna nap on my love-seat
I ain't sayin' this to get no pity, I'm just feelin' shitty
Lookin' like a piece of metal rusting, and trust me

And I don't really like
The person I've become
This isn't who I thought I would turn into when I was young
But now I'm grown and they say I'm

I don't know, maybe I'm a hater
I'm supposed to write a rap, but I hate rap now
Stop breathin' when I'm sleeping then I wake up
Still in my clothes, can't remember how I passed out
Lately I'm an angry drunk am I'm afraid I
Might have been a dick, best friend's gettin' cussed out
But, fucker then I guess I found a liter
What I done, 'nother hungover day bummed out
Ooh shit I ain't no exaggerator
Nose bleedin', trying to act like I ain't sniff shit
People think they're motivating me to take up a different lifestyle
Fuck them and their Fitbit
They just wanna help but don't appreciate uh
Cause they love me, and they don't wanna see me die young
Every day I'm dissapointin' my creator
I've been strugglin' to get up out the hole I dug
Lately I've been switchin' over to the vapor
Chain smokin' newports [?] my lungs
I can see my future and it's [?]
Girl cryin' to the operator, calling 9-1-1
I tour, blessed to be an entertainer
Been spendin' months away from home, there's nothing I find fun
Signed a record deal, I love the record label
Three albums later, underrated when it's my time come
Couldn't afford the tour bus, so I went and bought a van
There's some money selling records, so I got to tour again
I don't wanna bore the fans, so I bought a couple lights
Plus some background singers, but I can't afford a band
Jealous of these rich rappers and the money that they make
I was up outside of Chili's having lunch and a lame
Started rooting for his team on the screen
When I see happy people wanna punch them in the face
I'm ashamed cause

I don't really like
The person I've become
This isn't who I thought I would turn into when I was young

Rittz,"Ain't I so smooth
I know that you like the way I move
When the clock strikes two
I'm gon' have you inside of the groove
Inside of the groove

Tatted up with my jewelry on, my shoes looking so brand new
Stunting like mom and pop, matching all my clothes
Being broke 'cause I know can't do
And I so can't lose
My team stay winnin' we can have any girl we can choose
We in the ATL but
We be partying like we in Cancun
Double shots of the Avion with no lime to chase
'Bout to bite the slate clean and ride the wave
I gotta diamond bracelet, designer shades
Suede retro nines, look behind the drapes
When neighbors sleep we was geeked up wide awake
We making money when the clock strikes two
And the kids say Rittz I wish I was like you, ooh

Ain't I so smooth
I know that you like the way I move
When the clock strikes two
I'm gon' have you inside of the groove

Pullin' up in my slab
I'm the man with the bag
I don't rap, I trap
But I look like I rap
Me and good dudes cool
Me and fake dudes ain't
I play by the rules
A fuck boy I ain't
I ain't with that old sucker shit
Gettin' money is all that I'm familiar with
Diamond clusters all on my fist
Rolex watch cost 46, thousand
Used to be broke, now I'm a cash cow
I'm the plug, got the juug and my pack loud
Hella love in my hood smokin' Black n' Mild
Bitch motherfucker I'm smooth

I know that you like the way I move
When the clock strikes two
I'm gon' have you inside of the groove

I made a bunch of mil, I'm about to celebrate
I prolly should be rockin' somethin' tailor made
They wishin' I would stop but I accelerate
I got a bottle with some molly in the cellophane
Some purple liquid in my cup, no Welch's grape
I got a couple more notches in my belt to make
I gave that bitch my number
I ain't sittin' around waitin' for my cell to ring
And that's a lost cause
Our squad
Messin' up the room leavin' drawers, bras
Layin' on the floor, leaving' bars, straws
Layin' on the table by the vase, y'all
Lookin' at me like you seen a star
When I pull up in my car everybody like whooo
Rittz up in this bitch and I'm like true

Ain't I so smooth

Rittz,"Dear Lord
Please forgive me
I'm so ashamed of everything that I've done
I'm trying to be a better person, God
I need your help

Who the fuck gon' pick me up when I fall?
Waiting on my Xanax to dissolve
Eat a bar just to go on stage
Just a bottle was a problem that I just can’t solve
On the slumerican made tour last fall
Everything snowballed, lookin' back and I’m appalled
Hit an all time low, had a two month binge
On that Blow, and I know you heard that song
But this real life
Ever wake up from a drunk night like you pissed people off?
That was me the whole tour
When I got home, I was so embarrassed
Had me feelin' like I need to call - Wolf
And say sorry for bein' so obnoxious
And constantly actin' like a junky, a Jay
On his bus doin' bumps, in my bunk
In the dark, from my heart, and the A

God bless my soul
Demons following me everywhere I go
That temptation in my face I can't control
Trying to chase them down this straight and narrow road
Here I go
Just say no

But I can’t, goin' up to fans
About to damn near beg for drugs
Tellin' them I can get 'em into backstage
If they get me some, my self-respect was gone
I stayed up all night with Ounce and Big Henry
Then go and get a room about two P.M
Eating Xanax in the afternoon
Cause I’m panicking from the Coke
My heart, don’t know what mood it’s in
I Face Time with my girl in my room
And when I finally fall asleep I make her watch
It’s a daily routine, I tell her I can’t breathe
And to keep an eye on me, just in case I stop
Look at my face in shock
My nose was so inflamed and swollen
So much abuse to it that it got infected
It’s five times it’s normal size
Plus, I blew my knee out
Drunk, tryin' to slap box a wrestler
Up at Whistler center, about to hit the E.R
It’s hard to explain yourself
Why your nose is the size of Gonzo's
The doc knows you’re a cocaine addict
You can only blame yourself
Here I am in the hospital bed
But instead of regret, I’m thinking about the cocaine I left
On the bus, I officially flushed
I told my girl I'm okay, I’ll be home in two days to rest
I got home, but really all the damage was done
Couldn’t go out into public without being nervous
And my dick didn’t work for like a month
Couldn’t bend my knee up in physical therapy
But as far as Coke and the urge, I was done
Didn’t learn shit, cause I did the same thing on the next tour run

God bless my soul
Demons following me everywhere I go
That temptation in my face I can't control
Trying to chase them down this straight and narrow road
Here I go
Just say no

No
No
NO
Yeah
Fuck it, give me some
I'll do a little bit
Yeah
Fuck",Just say No
Rittz,"Mom and dad split up when she was just a kid
She lost all her trust, her trust in relationships, the unfaithfulness
It was a shame
Both of them cheated, leaving her a non-believer in falling in love
She was jaded since day one, looking for someone to blame
She never really had shit, she don't give a fuck about how much you got
She don't care if it's a little or a lot, no matter what she bought
She was lied to so many times by guys in disguise, trying to be something they not
I kept it real so I'm hoping that she'll let me get a shot
I told her I ain't gon' try to fill her head up with fairytales
And I know that she was scared as hell
You let your guard down so you gotta wear a shell
'Cause every male that ever said it was gonna be forever bailed
Her pops left out the door so fast like a jetpack was on his back
Got abused by her step-dad, the only way to get attention was a sex act
Momma never taught her to respect herself
She had to learn on her own, had a lot of obstacles, and barriers that herd her along
Beneath the surface was a girl in search of true love, she's a queen that deserves to be crowned
And I can recall the first time I seen her, I was in awe
It was like I had a crystal ball, it was her and I
And I ain't tryna say you about to have the perfect life because I heard goodbye girl

'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate

We both used to be heavy into drugs, until we finally got each other clean
Used to fuck on a hand-me down twin bed, now we make love on a California King
Had to share a car, working double shifts, Christmas came around, couldn't buy each other gifts
Summertime couldn't turn on the A/C, fan's blowin in our face while we eating frozen fish
Had to go and pretend like we had our own place
Saving up to stay up in a cheap motel
Now we got a two car garage, three cars, a big house, paying bills we don't need no help
65 inch T.V., she don't care about no money, she just love me, and I feel the same for her
Told her she don't gotta work, kick your feet up
She's just about to get the life she deserve

'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate

'Cause even when the times got hard we were always laughing
Even if we were single, nobody else is gonna have us
We're both so crazy, ten years in never lost attraction
And there's gotta be a god 'cause he crossed our paths
When we were lost and had it with the dating game
I pulled a David Blaine inside the bed, never lost the magic
Got her dripping like I took her white water rafting
And I know there's gonna be some people that'll hear the song and trash it
I don't really give a fuck what they say
As a rapper you really ain't supposed to act like you in love
Fuck 'em they don't even gotta hit play
Fuck touring, fuck music, fuck money, fuck the internet, and anything that gets in the way
Even her friends and family members' opinions don't matter
'Cause it's only me and you at the end of the day, and just know that

I'll run through flames to rescue you
There's nothing I would rather do
Than be next to you

'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
'Cause I'm gon' be your knight in shining armor
And everything will be okay
And you can find me right beside my woman
She's the one, she's my soulmate",KISA

I'm a modern day Van Gogh
Lucini falling from the sky
Cooling high like I'm capped low
My music beating so loud
No wonder why my last dam blow
Them rockford fosgates knocking my drop
Might rock that lamp post
Got powder all in my beard
I ain't been eating no french toast
I finally got a little bread
Went from a Kimbo Slice to a French loaf
Success done went to my head
I'm just spending more on my dress code
The Clintel is my team
I play point and I'm the head coach
It's Rittz, bitch

I wanted to throw in the towel
I came so far that I can't quit
I have to say it feels great to finally see a hundred K on my bank slip
These hoes, they wanna strip down
But I got prior engagements
My lady's laying on the bed my leg in her ear, my hand on her anklet
She loved me when I was a bum
But I got a deal, I'm still letting it sink in
It's Monday morning, I'm home and I feel liberated like Vig and Dre did
It's cool to rep for your town
Still, at the end of the day you gotta think rich
Still cruising on Crews road, gold flexin' my candy paint drip
Like yeah
People walk up on me in the liquor store they wanna take a pic
I can hear their argument up in the aisle right beside me
Saying, is it really him and I promise you it is
I got time to shoot the shit
Even if they gonna talk on me to death
Told me he got Jonny Valiant and it never left the deck
Til he got Next to Nothing, so yo when's that new shit coming

Rittz,"Go 'head and roll the red carpet out
'Cause everywhere I walk on a martyr route
Just when you thought the game was garbage and watered down
I came to be the saviour seen 'em wading in the water
Started preying on 'em sort of like a shark or a crocodile
Uh I got bars like I was brought up with slaughterhouse
But say my name and you'll get sawed up and shot up, BLAOW
I got a quarter ounce of soft and a lot of crown
And a bitch to wanna' party, grab my card and I'll chop it out
Her heart was beating uncontrollably she dialed 911
And told the operator sorry I pocket dialed
I told her to walk it out but now she's calming down enjoying it
Annoying bitch keep trying to blow me with cotton mouth
I told her gag on it started making her cry
That turned me on that's why I came before her make up could dry
I want the bitch to leave can't find a way to say it polite
I told her there's an Uber waiting started waving goodbye
That never happened what happened why rappers say this a lot
But ya'll don't mind like it's okay to get away with the crime
But it ain't shit to me 'cause breaking them off is just like a day at the office
And I don't mean the local paper supply get it?
Dwight, Jim
My pen's
Lightning
I've been vibrant
Fight for a sizable time spent
I get bent 'til my eyes squint
I'm in [?] steak with scrambled eggs on the side
When fans be coming up to catch a flick 'cause I'm one of the best there is
Bitches looking impressed from all the freshness that I exhibit
People say I rap too fast then play this track and reference it
And then forgive yourself for ever questioning my excellence
When it comes to self expression I'm a specialist
I pack a weapon for protection I ain't wrestling
They actin' deaf like they don't hear me though
They characters, they imitate like Jake the Snake and Rey Mysterio
Serial killer leave you dead, and left like, cheerio
Talk so much online it's like I watch you dig your burial
Pop up on you when I'm on the road you looking shocked
Like you forgot that I was real like what you thought this was, the Jerry show?
Your reign on the top was temporary though
I'm shining on them like a diamond from Sierra Leone
On a high note they can't compare me to they baritone
Watch your mouth I got the knockout power of a Larry Holmes
Industry
[?] Switching the delivery
Just to see how many people dissing me, kiss the ring
Seem like yesterday they used to push with the soliciting
Get you [?] so bad [?]
It's like I had a skin disease
Probably see me in your city Mr. Freeze, slicker G's
[?] Got the bullet steady whistling
Got the pistol whizzing by your head
Used to flex like you was tough, what the fuck you got muscular dystrophy?
You don't want me as an enemy, Rodney Dangerfield of rap
I get no respect, I'm 'bout to take what they don't give to me
Drink so much my liver need a detox
And me it probably be thought that I was about to blow with no [?]
A big reality check and then I came to welcome, please stop
Funny seven years later I would be on and I'll be here for eons
My name up in the neon light
Clintel crew, Rittz up in this BIATCH

It's funny everybody wanna' envy me, they wanna' envy me, envy me

Rittz,"Fake smile on my face, feeling suicidal, safety off of my gun
Can't tell it was real or a cry for help but I feel like if I don't make one
I'ma follow through, my girl gonna follow suit 'cause she tries every time I'm gone
Last tour, she done slit her wrists and this time she done OD'd, blacked out, and broke her arm
Feel bad, lyin' to her bout the coke I done
The doc said if I keep drinking Coke and Crown, I won't make it to see thirty-eight
Then I'm wasted again on the floor in the hotel room
With puke stains on the drapes and the carpet
Gotta call at eight o'clock in the morning
So my boy took the keys to my car and drove it through the front door of an Exxon
Cops came and, locked him up, they said they had a warrant
Now I'm spending all my tour money on his lawyer
Lord if, this is you sending us a warning
I hear it loud and clear and please God I swear
I won't ignore it anymore
This type of torment is torture, but show us a way
On my knees and I'm screaming to God and I heard him say

He told me when it rains it pours
And I can hear the pouring rain
It feels just like a hurricane just came right outside my window
Woah-oh
But one day when the rain is gone
The thunder from the storm rolls on
I woke up and I seen the sun and it shine right inside my window
And it feels like
Euphoria

Some kids are saying that they in to me
They told me everything I rap about
Feel like it happened to him identically
That he was listening to misery loves company
And Wishin, Rittz I feel just like you
Im tryna rap and I'm flunkin' school
The only thing I really care about in this world
Is my girl and she been fucking with another dude
And I was hoping maybe you would tell me what to do
I'm tryna make it with the scraps that I have
Working fast for the stack of some cash
But its like I'm losing the enthusiasm I have
Trying to master the craft as a rapper
All I hear is laughter just got in a scrap with my dad
He hit me in the eye and he blackened it bad
All I ever wanted from him was a pat on the back
And I bet if I was dead he'd be glad
Hit him back so relax, this is how life works
When you feel like you sitting at the bottom; You not
To get better, shit gets worse first
Gotta reverse the negative eye
Keep praying to God and don't believe in a made up curse
Told him that I prayed to the Lord
And he said these words

He told me when it rains it pours
And I can hear the pouring rain
It feels just like a hurricane just came right outside my window
Woah-oh
But one day when the rain is gone

We keep pourin' up
A big enormous cup
Of Crown Royal
Puff another joint and trust
You’re gonna hoist me up
When the devil wanna stick a
Pitchfork in us
Or wanna burn us in a furnace till we boil up
Beggin' The Lord above
To show remorse for us
We was born in a metamorphosis
Formed in something far less unfortunate
We absorbed enough pain to push the rush
Through our veins like a sting from a scorpion
We ashamed 'cause we can’t afford the stuff
We wanna buy had to find some form of love
Or find a formula, of course sure enough
You in a rut now
Layin’ on the floor in cuffs
They say the storm is comin'
But the lightning never struck
A chord with us

Rittz,"First time I ever set eyes on you it was love at first sight
You was so young, your mom told me that she got a son, and you were the love of her life
As time went on, me and you bonded
I fathered you, I was so proud to be a dad
We were so broke, I promised you that one day I would get rid of the problems we had
I hope you accept my apology
All the fights and the drunk nights that you saw in the past
You never chose sides, we were so sad
But when it came to happiness you're all we really had, you're an angel
So happy-go-lucky, such a good soul, words can't express
You had a gift of making people fall in love with you
You affected every single person you met
And we ain't have much, we spoiled you to death
Anything you wanted you can have, I still laugh
Think about the holiday when you snuck 
And ate a whole cheesecake we ain't even get mad that's your favorite
We was so stressed out, we were about to lose the house that we stayed in
I was trying to be a rapper, we could've moved in my parents basement but couldn't bring you
Really you're the one that made me quit trying to rap
So I went and got a job so that we could get a house, I'd do anything for you
You, me, and your mom moved with your grandma
It was us three stuck in a little room
Finally had a place to play outside, I would love to see you run, like a dream coming true
I was riding in my car to some tracks one day, played this beat, started thinking of you and now I'm

Looking in my rear view
Wishing I was near you
It's quiet here without ya
And I've been thinking about ya
Feeling of nostalgia

I hated my job, I loved coming home
I would lay in bed with you for hours on end
Me and your mom were obsessed with you
Cause you were momma's baby boy, and daddy's best friend
But daddy ain't been, home a lot lately
To play with, I tried to set you down and explain
That I got a new job, that I wanted all my life, and that everything might possibly change
That I'ma have to go out of town for some months but when I'm home, I'ma be around every day
And when I'm gone I'ma need you to look out for your mom, keep her company while daddy's away
Your momma sends pics of you and her in bed
I would feel bad thinking that you thought I left
But I was saving bread so we could finally have our own place
Live a life that we should've always had
And I did that
Now you're spoiled even more cause instead of being cramped now you got your own room
Your mom quit her job, and you and her could chill every day
For the most part, I'd be home too
And life is looking bright, used to see it so blue
We finally were content, had a daily routine
I made a bunch of songs with your name in them
I would come into your room, hugging you and I would sing
You were always treated like a king
Cause you were everything that mattered to us and I would hate to see your cute face crying
Cause you knew that I was leaving for a tour
Always hated when I go and grab that red suitcase out the closet
You'd look at me and say you promise, you stayed by your mom when I'm gone
I'll be back in a couple of months, give me kisses I'll be missing you a ton
Homesick every time I'm

Looking in my rear view
Wishing I was near you
It's quiet here without ya
And I've been thinking about ya
Feeling of nostalgia

You grew up so fast, but you always had a baby face so it's hard for me to tell
You were sick on and off
We were just rough-housing on the bed, good to see you getting well
I had to go to Omaha for a show, but your mom called me up and told me that you slipped and fell
But you were limping, we figured that you twisted something and had to give it time to tell
I got home and you were breathing funny and your hip was big as hell
Your momma said that she began to see it swell
This morning, this isn't normal, we took him to the doctor
We thought he might of broke his hip bone and it would heal
It's crazy how life change in an instant
The doctor walked in with his x-rays
Said he thought he broke his hip, but he didn't
He got bad news and there ain't no way to fix it, what is it?
He said the x-rays showed bone cancer was spreading through his legs in a crazy position
The amputation, the chemo, wasn't a option
He probably ain't gon make it to Christmas, I blacked out
Cause Christmas is like three weeks away
When I left he was okay, now your telling me he's gonna die?
He said he's strong so he's gonna fight
Eventually you're gonna have to put him down whenever y'all decide
Please God, not a dog, we're in shock, not our son, he's the only thing we got, we was done
It'd be different if we knew that he was suffering for months, but he's limping
How the fuck is it that nothing can be done?
Tried to comfort him as much as we could
Drug his mattress - down the stairs to the center of the living room
Me and his mom laid with him every night
Petting him while he was crying, you could tell the pain was getting to him
And me and her in disbelief, all we did was cry, all we did was scream
Struggling to try, we'd take him outside, but he could barely walk
And every day it seems, it's spreading even more
The medicine we fed him isn't doing anything and we just can't accept it that our boy
The most important thing is dying right in front of us
Like how much do we let him suffer til we go and make the choice
We were laying on the floor almost twenty days
He ain't eating anymore, he can't move his legs
It's December 21st, I think it's time for us to let him go so we can send him to a better place
It's been several weeks, me and your mom still grieving feeling like we in denial
I go in your bedroom every day, smell the air
Start to cry for a while, then I smile thinking bout ya

Looking in my rear view
Wishing I was near you
We're crying here without ya
We're dying here without ya

Thinking what on earth
Could make somebody run up in a school or a church
And take innocent lives away based on a person's race
Little school kids stripped of their vertebrae's
Fake rumors start to circulate
They beat his ass on camera, cause they heard he's gay
The YouTube views almost over 30k
The internet got us so shallow that we impersonate
Celebs' thinking that we all should be one
And not that we failed

Glad to see my homie's made it back from Iraq
But his limbs are torn up, his friends got blown up

They been through so much, disposed to death in combat
How the fuck you come back and adapt?
My homie just got Hodgkin's Lymphoma
I'm praying every day hoping he gonna beat it
Strong motherfucker on the phone with me
Telling me jokes while he's going through his chemo treatment
And he didn't put one sob story on his timeline
Instagram or Facebook ain't always real life
People staring at their phones so much that they forget to look up and see the skyline
Thinking that they Einstein cause they wrote a clever post

My lyrics are merely mirrors to the tears in my eyes

I’ve done my best to share my life
My privacy's been sacrificed
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
I've put my soul in every word
I've shared my pain until it hurts
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
Ah yeah

Woke up and I checked Worldstar this morning
A cop just shot and killed a black kid
It was all recorded
Just like the incident they put up two days before it
It's become so normal that it sickens me
I know that I'm probably going to piss some people off listening
Because I'm white and I'm talking about some shit we generally don't go through
But still I can't ignore it
There's so many people with power that won't go forward
The problem ain't gonna solve itself
Half of the cases are unreported until it's caught on someone's cell
And this is not a diss to all law enforcement
We call on them to help out when there is a threat
But I guess it's because I'm white, if I was black I'd be scared to death
When David Banner asked us
""Where were all the white rappers at when Mike Brown got gunned down?""
I couldn't think of any answers
I felt ashamed and afraid of the future
With no contribution or any helping hand to lend
I went to Kansas City
Shooting videos for my last album
And I could feel the tension
Another time of my life that I felt I was guilty for the color of my skin tone
Three months later, I was back in Missouri
On tour the same night that the verdict was read
I was in shock, on Twitter venting
Then one of my fans tweeted that Mike Brown deserved it
I said, man, you dumb as fuck
Imagine you went to the store for blunts
And tried to run out the door with a pack
And the cops didn't bother arresting you
Or give you a lecture
But instead they just murdered you dead, man this shit ain't right

I’ve done my best to share my life
My privacy's been sacrificed
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
I've put my soul in every word
I've shared my pain until it hurts
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
Ah yeah

We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal
They are endowed by their creator
With certain unalienable rights
And among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
That to secure these rights
Governments are instituted among men
Deriving their powers from the consent of the governed
All men are born free and equal
And have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights
Among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties
That of acquiring, possessing, and protecting their property
And find that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness

Rittz,"Yeah
When the rest of the world go to sleep, I
I be getting drunk, probably on some kind of drug
Tripping looking at the street light
Tryna write a rap, wanna lay that beat
But its hard, I'm on a speed high
C-N-T my crew, we cool
But we grew up in the street life
In other words, we gon' sting 'em when they swinging at the bee hive
Rewind, ain't nobody reach out
Back when I was coming up, now they hit me and get mad if I don't reply
Where were you when I was cleaning out the deep fry?
Didn't wanna swing by
Hoes saying he's fine, yeah right
Saying that I wanna fuck, she lying, she trying
I can tell by her face that her pussy smell like a sea lion
Only thing she gonna get is denied
Couple grand inside my Levi's
T9 put me on, and he always wear red
But I swear if somebody disrespect him, I'ma check him
He don't gotta give a green light
Listening to Big Mike, rap music used to be tight
Some of it still is, but a lot of it is street hype
Back when I was praying I would make it
This ain't what I thought it'd be like, despite -
All the fake shit, I'm really happy to achieve my -
Childhood dreams and a ton of shit's sweet
Every now and then its sour like a key lime
And when it is I gotta remind me
That I made it to the big time
And I know I might not be as big as T.I
But guaranteed, if you see me getting behind
A microphone, I'ma bring the heat each time

'Cause I was born for this
I'm so lucky to be this fortunate
My life, my heart, my soul got poured in this
And I'ma keep going until my story ends
Until the Lord above me decides to turn my lights out
But for right now
I ain't trying to put this mic down
Stage is mine now

Told my parents I was gonna make it one day
They ain't never look convinced
I was just a little kid at a young age
They probably thought it was a dumb phase
And I quit school, said I'm stupid, told me just wait
I regret it and I do, I was thinking I was cool
Started fucking with the drug trade
Just knowing I might end up blowing up big
I was finally of age, hitting up Atlanta at the club late
Doing every open mic, looking like a straight target
I was unsafe, in the middle of the hood
Only white boy on stage, had to let my nuts hang
Fifteen years later, all the work paid off
Kids coming tryna run game
Only difference is, I was a lyricist
Before the internet opened up the floodgates
When white boys had to have skills
If you didn't, then you getting booed, getting jumped
What you just say?
Had to live what you rapped back then
Nowadays you can say you 'bout gunplay
When you shot a target at a gun range
You can say you got a plug, I ain't following for the pump fake
Saying Usher's your cousin, your uncle is Just Blaze
As far as bullshit go, nothing much's changed
I'm getting better every year
All I see is competition to me that I wanna try to upstage
And there's still a lot of people that ain't never listened to me in their life
I think it's time to get an update
Rappers that I gave my demo tape to in the past
Tryna come and get my number, we should touch base
They could be me one day, but I'm hotter than a sun ray
I'm blazed

'Cause I was born for this
I'm so lucky to be this fortunate
My life, my heart, my soul got poured in this
And I'ma keep going until my story ends
Until the Lord above me decides to turn my lights out

Strugglin' tryna stay alive

So watch out for the snake eyes
They so cold blooded 
They so cold blooded 
Yeah

I done met all types of people
Good and evil
Been amongst all walks of life
Some that you be perceive to be decent
Will soon deceive you
'Cause who they really are inside
Ain’t who you thought they were
At the bar we worked at was full of skeletons in the closet door
I knew a couple named Steve and Rose who’ve been known to slow base
Let me start the story off with her
She was an alcoholic, but so was he
Socially they were both popular
So in love, it was rare to see him and her not there
Words can’t explain how shocked I was
And then when Steve walked in with his blood shot eyes
Cryin' I could tell that he’d been up all night
Told us that Rose had overdosed committed suicide
And the woman that he loved just died, not Rose
People sittin' at the bar froze
Made a toast to him, may she rest in peace
With his head in his chest, Steve wept with grief
He got drunk, went to get some sleep
It’s sick 'cause after he left rumors started to fly
Someone said Lady he’s sketchy Steve, been seen numerous times
With another girl he screwed on the side
Now all of sudden she was dead it seemed little odd (odd)
Was it crocodile tears he was cryin' was it all a façade?
She could drink, was it really a bottle of pills and some vodka that caused her demise?
A lot of the guys started callin' him a murderer
And I ain’t really tryin' to accuse him but
He was kissin' on his new girlfriend at the bar same night of my funeral
'Cause she’s so cold blooded

Ya runnin but ya can’t hide
Strugglin' tryna stay alive
People plottin' on ya gravesite
So watch out for the snake eyes
They so cold blooded 
They so cold blooded 

The ones that you trust are the ones in disguise
Thought you was loved but then gonna find out your despised
Snakes that were hiding they strike
They so cold blooded

I knew a couple named Ike and Linda
Same bar, different story
Let me think where should I begin'?
I wish this was a fiction piece
But I witnessed this shit time and time again
Ya see, Ike was the quiet type who shot darts with his best friend Mark
But he liked a pinch
Of cocaine and raw but none of us woulda thought his life would come
To a violent end
Until one day the bar got silent then
You could hear pin drop the minute that Lyn walked in
Cryin, 'causeshe said Ike died someone tied him up and then they set him on fire, damn
They found his body right inside of the complex
Whoever did it must've had an accomplice
But the cops just said it was drug deal gone bad
Tried to blame it on the drug problems
What I found bizarre was
They found an empty gas can in the storage compartment
That had Lyn’s palm prints
But it was her and Ike’s place so
It wasn’t enough to implicate her involvement
Case unsolved and two weeks later it would raise an eyebrow
But they burying him
Everybody at the bar found out that Ike’s friend Mark got married to Lyn
Cold blooded bitch

Ya runnin but ya can’t hide

But everyday someone starts bitchin' when
I don't accept or see the request they sent
They get upset feelin' like I rejected them
Impossible to talk to everyone that send DM's
But why you actin' like a bitch? Some dudes are hoes
Comments sayin' fuck you and the food you post
I hit em back, they retract everything they was sayin' like they was playin'
Homie I ain't in the mood for jokes
I'm not an actor rappin' in a movie bro
And I don't know you but know that you a douchey troll
With no do's or dont's
It's hard to recognize a face but I've seen some of you at shows
I'm lookin' at em like

Not a day goes by when someone ain't talkin' shit
They either brutally honest or the opposite
He said he doesn't really feel my style, but you can rap good luck
That's a backward ass compliment
I can't respond to them I really want to snap
Is it just me or does Rittz suck, he's wack
It's like no wonder why my postures bad
Too many hatin' swinging on the only pair of nuts I have
So why the fuck you mad?
I sent a track way back I was hopin' you could tell me what you think of it
Man I think I get this once a week
Sendin' me a song for me to hear without a link to click
Irritated sayin, how much for a feature Rittz?
You said it was a G on basket case
It was a Grand back in 2011 and went for three-five now, I'm sorry you might have to save
It's funny people tellin' me what type of track to make
You should do a song with him, put him on the end""
Namin' big name rappers that don't fit in my budget but they don't understand the biz they imagine it
On the real though If I could do a track with Drake or Kanye I would do the shit 'cause I'm a fan
Made a joke and I post like I did and now my so called fans said they was unfollowin'
Like what's the problem dam?
What you tryna go mainstream on us Rittz?
You supposed to keep it strange
My opinion is if you support a label that was underground
Then you should wanna seem em be the biggest name
Playin on the radio like every single day
Now where the real fans that be thinkin' out the box?
I show love for Jump St

I know a lot of people don't think logistically before they go and type some shit
The internet makes everyone accessible
You can go and tell 'em what you didn't like or did
And you can get it off your mind, and vent
And feel like you lookin' someone eye to eye and spit
Like your opinion matters, at least it got you feeling like it did

Rittz,"People all in my business
Talk about me online
Homies saying I'm changing
Calling me on my downtime
I can't pick up my phone because I just got home
And I've been gone two months my time is spent
I got a fiance take a while to adjust being home then I'm gone again
How the fuck you know how much money's in
My bank account, its funny the assumption made
Crumbs don't become a cake overnight
On the road for over fifty-something days
And I still can't post a GoFundMe page
Without a dumbass telling me, you got it, Rittz
So many hands in my pocket
I feel like the cops are frisking me looking for my dollar bills
I took 'em so low on the OD tour, lost like fifty-five grand
Lesson learned, I can't afford to bust shit
I told my girl we gotta cancel our plans
And I went off on a tangent
A wreck, cause I'm panicking
Life as a rambling man disappearing
And I'm damned and I can see they can't get a handle of saying it
But do it for my handful of fans
And I still ain't changed

Never
It's Rittz, bitch

People change and I don't know why
Cause I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah
Money come and go, but so what?
I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah, aw yeah

Look, might've seen me on a poster or the grocery store
People that are scared to approach me are
No different than me
I write raps for a living and I'm overjoyed
And even if I get no awards for my music
Fans say it helped them cope before
Made 'em hope for more
Sometimes the sky can seem so out of reach
When you're sitting on the ocean floor
I did Breakfast with Sway
On shade forty-five with Heather B
You can see the YouTube video
Where the mic fell, shit was embarrassing
Did a song with Trae the Truth
I met Devin the Dude
And man, I just did a video with Twista
Shit I think somebody needa pinch my arm
Here, lets take a picture for the Instagram
This is famous fam with no Travis Barker
Tagging Rittz bitch with a magic marker
The Agora Theater in Cleveland to Phoenix
It's like I'm on a magic carpet
Shit I'm dreaming a bit
Sold out shows, I was up in the arena with Tech
Then I flew back home to Atlanta, did a show for my homie
Only twenty-five people was there, but I rocked that bitch

Cause I still ain't changed
It's Rittz, bitch

People change and I don't know why
Cause I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah
Money come and go, but so what?
I'm still the same old me
Aw yeah, aw yeah

One time for the dreamers
I pray your day will soon come
It's hard to know what you here for
It'll reveal itself in due time
I rap with friends who ain't made it
Let your lyrics channel through mine
Two times for the fans that motivated me the minute I started to lose sight
They be showing up in each, state
Fans overseas saying peace, mate
They loving the lyrics because they re-late
They give me the motivation to cre-ate
When I'm fettered it gets hard for me to see, straight
To my family I used to be a di-sgrace
The time I'm spending rapping was a big, waste
But I finally got a record deal a big, break
Time to be, great
Homie we, chase
The paper 'til the muscles in our feet, ache
And finally I got to have a sweet, taste
Of victory, picture me rolling with the homies C-N-T, mane
Everybody in the world wanna de-bate
Who's better Meek, Drake?
I'm just hoping that I reach, they
Level, went back-to-back-to-back
Haters saying he, changed

Like really?
Ain't shit changed
I still live in Gwinnett
Still got the same homies

It was hard for me to make it through but since I'm a rapper
I feel like I should listen, now I'm wishin' that I didn't
I would rather watch an episode of Empire ten times
And I don't even like the show, chopping rocks of white
Just know I tried to crush it up but then my license broke
Your style's old like yellow stripes on [?] and wire spokes
It's time to go, I know your goal ain't to retire broke
But on a brighter note, they might be hiring at Kohl's
Try Verizon Wireless, there's always people buying phones
Drunk or flying drones, crowds at shows are multiplying
Fire marshal tryna say we violating codes
Spraying my cologne, smelling like a millionaire
Silver pair of Jeremy Scott's I hardly ever wear
Black hoodie but the fabric's made of leather
Looking fresh like I was Fred Astaire, with a better head of hair
With no fedora on, fuck is going on?
Rappers dressed like Def Leppard, so, Pour Some Sugar On Me in the name of love
I ain't never changing up
I be backstage with the - bitches in there taking bumps
Love to blow a dick so much she just might suck the pigment off the skin
And when you nut she rubs it in like it was facial scrub
Too busy getting money, I can't conversate with ya
And I don't rap for free, I want some compensation, bruh
Mike was cooking up the beat, he hung his apron up
And when he did I picked my pen and paper up

You think we close because we did a couple shows together
Some folks I met on the road, I'll probably know forever
You just kissing ass, always asking, can I open for you?
I got a talent for spotting hidden agendas (like what?)
You tryna copy me, watching like an apprentice (hell nah)
I'm not Italian but I got some homies down to do a hit for me
They caught him and shot him in his appendix
It's funny all these dudes, they shoes and scarves
And thinking they look original but they copying Jimi Hendrix
But everybody's looking for something like Annie Lennox
I'm looking for someone to bring the Xanax
Higher than Bob Ross, watch me while I paint the canvas
And you just a ho, I figured you oughta know, shout out Alanis
Morrissette, portraits I painted, ain't it gorgeous?
Still I made a fortune, Porsches and Corvettes
Run up with the torch lit
Run off at the mouth and we gon' show up at your doorstep

Cheddar but never seen competition, doomed to corpses

You making Silkk the Shocker sound like he's the greatest lyricist
That ever lived, that's not a diss, I'm just comparing them

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Of the water and the woods and the ol' dam too
