London Starlight Orchestra,"Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
Wait, wait along

I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love and duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' high noon

He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life or his'n
I'm not afraid of death but oh
What will I do if you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
Although you're grievin', don't think of leavin'
Now that I need you by my side

Wait along, (wait along) wait along
Wait along, wait along 
(Wait along, wait along, wait along, wait along)",High Noon
London Starlight Orchestra,"Diamonds are forever, they are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever

London Starlight Orchestra,"How can I just let you walk away,
Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against the odds

Take a look at me now",Against All Odds

London Starlight Orchestra,"I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find, find someone to call mine
But mama said you can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You gotta trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait how much more can I take
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hanging on

Can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night
For some tender arms to hold me tight
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no
You just have to wait

No April rain
No flowers bloom

I just called to say how much I care

No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze

Face to face, in secret places. Feel the chill.

Between the shades, assassination standing still.

Fall as snowflakes on your body,
First time in years,
To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain.

A chance to die, but can we

Dance into the fire,

London Symphony Orchestra,"Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping
She got to her room, and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah
She picked up the book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire

[Chorus]
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be.""

The theme of the sermon was 'Come unto me,
Love will find a way',
So Sally decided to ignore her dad
And sneak out anyway
She spent all afternoon getting ready
And decided she'd try to touch him
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday

[Chorus]

She arrived at six, and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying
She bit her nails, looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
Ran on and said, ""Here we go!""

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage

But soon the atmosphere was cooler
As Tommy gave a lesson
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
And leapt up on the rostrum
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure
And touched him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man
Threw her off the stage

[Chorus]

Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down
Mingling with her tears
Tommy carried on preaching
And his voice filled Sally's ears
She caught his eye, she had to try
But couldn't see through their lights
Her face was gashed, and the ambulance men
Had to carry her out that night

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face, oh

Sixteen stitches put her right, and her dad said
""Don't say I didn't warn you.""
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile

Let daylight dry your tears;

To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,

Let me be your light;

And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,

But, why is it secret? What have we to hide?

Well then let them see, it's an engagement, not a crime

London Symphony Orchestra,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight

In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there,
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

My/your spirit and my/your voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my/your mind

Beware the phantom of the opera

A most amazing man.
He had that look you very rarely find:
The haunting, hunted kind.
I asked him to say what had happened,
How it all began.
I asked again, he never said a word.
As if he hadn't heard.
And next, the room was full of wild and angry men.
They seemed to hate this man.
They fell on him, and then
Disappeared again.
Then I saw thousands of millions
Crying for this man.
And then I heard them mentioning my name,
And leaving me the blame.",Pilate's dream

In pursuit of your deepest urge
In pursuit of that wish which till now has been silent
Silent
I have brought you
That our passions may fuse and merge
In your mind you've already succumbed to me
Dropped all defenses, completely succumbed to me
Now you are here with me, no second thoughts
You've decided, decided

Past the point of no return
No backward glances
The games we've played till now are at an end
Past all thought of if or when
No use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend
What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction lies before us
Past the point of no return
The final threshold?
What warm, unspoken secrets will we learn
Beyond the point of no return?

You have brought me
To that moment where words run dry
To that moment where speech disappears into silence
Silence
I have come here
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined our bodies entwining, defenseless and silent
And now I am here with you, no second thoughts
I've decided, decided

Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion play has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race
The sleeping bud bursts into bloom?
When will the flames at last consume us?

Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed, so stand and watch it burn

Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Once in a while
Please promise me you'll try

When you find
That once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been

Think of me
Think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me
Trying too hard
To put you from my mind

Recall those days
Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you

Can it be Christine

Somehow you would
Be here

Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would

Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could

Passing bells
And sculpted angels,
Cold and monumental,
Seem, for you,
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye

Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try

No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow

Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely

Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,

And someone way down here loses someone dear.

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.

But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.

It's late, it's quiet
A taxi waits at the door
Footsteps, a door slam
What's going on, it's a quarter to four

So many times, so many fears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life

The phone keeps ringing
Are you there with a friend
I call back, it's busy
I hang up and try once again

So many times, so many fears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life

So many times, so many fears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken
'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight
Go to hold you again in my life

Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life
Come back, baby come back
Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life
Come back, baby come back
Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love

[ VERSE 1: J. Sands ]
Yo, it was June 2nd, wisdom, you know the math
In the lab with J. Rawls all night ready to craft
See, I'm drivin down Penn. Ave. early morning
Turned on the wipers cause it just started storming
Without warning, my destination was the rest
But first make a stop and get some sliced turkey breast
From the deli, my stomach went 'errr' like Akinyele
Parked the ride, went inside, rain pourin on my Pelle
Dashin for the door, made it, soaken wet
Drippin puddles on the floor as I walk into the door mad vexed
I guess that was the reason why I slept
Cause to my left I saw a sight that I'll never forget
It was the illest silhouette, I could hardly see the flesh
One quarter exposed, the other three fourths clothed
In linen, now I seen women but this was like a goddess
The oddest of situations, so much anticipation
For real, I could feel as our eyes soon met
Don't get me wrong, son, cause with shorties I'm like a vet
But it wasn't the same, a introduction sparked the flame
Poetically, without hesitation she said her name
I was Ayanna Monet, just came to town yesterday from Atlanta, GA
Wasn't plannin to stay no more than a week or two, maybe a month
I couldn't front, aiyo, yo queen, I don't mean to sound blunt
But if you have the time, I love to spend it, no harm intended
She recommended for me to have my phone number extended
On a piece of paper, so maybe she could call me later
Actin all shy, blushin, adrenaline rushin as I'm walkin to the door
Thinkin of the feelings that I never felt before, I adore mi amor
A perfect combination, sparkle like a diamond
And to top it off the sun started shinin

[ CHORUS: J. Sands ]
Ayanna Monet
A girl I met around the way
Ayanna Monet
I think about her everyday
Ayanna Monet
The name I just can't help to say
Ayanna Monet
Ayanna Monet
Ayanna Monet

[ VERSE 2: J. Sands ]
Later on I'm at the rest listenin to Quest
Dig it, wide awake, can't sleep, shortie got me ????
I got so used to all these Daisy Duke freaks
That when earth took position
I stopped, looked and listened
I'm on a mission, somethin like an expedition
To catch the next edition of Miss Monet's wishings
A movie, a dinner, I don't know, I'm waitin
By the phone, just turned on a Sony PlayStation
Anticipatin the next time I'll speak
To the miss elegant, unique beauty, petite
It's deep, her mystique was magnifique, in fact
It sent me back, reminiscin over jazz tracks
At that second the phone rang, now I'm checkin
The caller identification for information
The number I didn't recognize off top
So I answered the telly cool like Arthur Fonzarelli
Yo, whaddaya know, it was the lady named Ayanna
Paused like a coma - far from drama
For the words that were spoken, I knew I had her open
And she felt the same, so it was peace, no game
I had to spark the flame, so I cordially invited, her
On a late night tour through Pittsburgh
We drove up the [Name] Shore wile she told me more
And how around me she felt secure
What was in store? I didn't know and really didn't care
Cause this here was a power move, soon the hour grew
Late, wait, she's tellin me that she's gonna be back
In a month if we want we can relax and see if feelings remain
Sustain through the distance, time, it blew my mind
When she said she want my kinds and help me make my next dime
Tell me Ayanna Monet isn't mine
Come on

[ CHORUS ]",Ayanna Monet
Lone Catalysts,"Hip hop, a way of life
Chosen by the ghetto youth out of necessity
It involves graffiti, deejaying, breakdancing and emceeing
Which all rely on raw, artistic skill
You know, they used to tell me that this music would never last
Now look at it now, it influences all music here today
So either you respect it we gon' take it back

Hip hop, the voice of the street, the voice of the youth
The voice that you hear, the voice that only we produce
The way that we salute that makes the wildest niggas start to shoot
The voice that recoupes only 12% of the loot
The voice of the groups, like OutKast, LOX and The Roots
The voice of the truth, that no society can ever mute
The voice of the men and women who gave their lives defendin
The God-given rights, they had no choice but to fight
The voice of the black, latino and the white
The voice of the club that makes the freaks come out at night
The voice of the thugs who pop champagne and rock ice
The voice of the shorties who wear tight shirts and talk sheist
The voice of the shook who look one time but not twice
The voice of the crooks at gambling spot with hot dice
The voice of the church, mosque, synagogue and temple
The voice of your soul, your body and your mental
The voice that says ""rap!"" when I hear a instrumental
The voice that don't stop and it's just that simple
The voice that don't stop and it's just that simple
The voice that don't, d-d-don't, d-don't...

Yo, we live that life that you call hip hop
From the bottom straight to the tip top
Hey Rawls, we got em while them others did not
So if you with the LC, nigga, lick shot
If you live that life they call hip hop
Worldwide everyday tic-toc
This life is like nothin to play with, ock
That's why when I say ""shit"" you say ""shit hot""
That's why when I say ""shit"" you say ""shit hot""
That's why when I say ""shit"" you say ""shit hot""
That's why when I say ""shit"" you say ""shit hot""
That's why when I say ""shit"" -

[ Double Trouble ]
Cause here's a little story that must be told
About two cool brothers that were put on hold
Tried to hold us back from fortune and fame
They destroyed the crew and they killed our name
They tried to step on the ego and walk on the pride
But true blue brothers stand side by side
Through thick and thin, from beginning to end
This battle we lost, but the war we'll win",Hip Hop
Lone Catalysts,"[ VERSE 1: J. Sands ]
If hip hop was a crime, I'd be a felon, sellin
To all the conscious dope addicts, tragic, gotta have it
Get no static, rhymes get ripped automatic
Spray you from your feet to your cabbage
Lyrically hit you with the spiritual, infrared won't miss
Police lookin for the Catalyst
Hah, usually on the blocks in your neighborhood
When the flavor's good clientele's humunguous
Pittsburgh, Columbus
And all the other cities in the USA
Networkin, soon to be worldwide for certain
I know it's hurtin, competition creatin envy
Sure they want to end me when they see me in a Benzi
Throw salt in my game, in my face act friendly
That's why I play em close till they ass get ghost
Ain't no love lost here, crampin my poster'
This game is cutthroat, so I'ma aim at the utmost
Spot, not knowing if I'm gonna get caught
Be up in heaven, openin for Big and Tupac
But that's the nature of it, some live, some kick the bucket
I'd be a damn fool not to love it
Right?

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
Imagine that, if hip hop was a crime
Would you stick and move, would you sell dimes?
Or would you switch sides and play the role of po nine
Blockin me from the go line
Preventin me from gettin mine

[ J. Sands ]
Everything is kosher, slayin punk MC's with my toaster
Itchy finger on trigger got my rep bigger
You should see em shiver knowin down deep I deliver
Bulls eye, direct hit with hollow tip lyric
Like the bully of the block all the kids fear it
J. Sands is untouchable, how you hear it
Echo wind through the hallways where I be all days
Hustlin, ain't no small plate cause niggas always
want to plot against the local cat with props
Makin it harder to set up my shop upon the block
Like a martyr I be in this war until I drop
But if it ain't the haters it's the goddamn cops
Stressin me, just so they can get some cream off the top
Testin me, so now I gotta scheme, call the team
Dante, [Name], J. Rawls and Raheem
The ill syndicate, quick to light up the scene
No prints, squeaky clean, toss the heat in the stream
Rendez-vous somewhere serene around 12:15
See, if you don't hold it down, no one will hold it for ya
So be sure to have a alibi plus a good lawyer

[ CHORUS (2X) ]

[ J. Sands ]
See, niggas know my status, ghetto celeb' kingpin
A hip hop's fiend friend who always seen in
The fly be	-boy attire receivin
Praises from the holiest to the heathens
It's all good cause what I provide is pleasin
Comfortable, something your mind can ease in
One try, then you find out the reason
Why I got addicts for every season
Summer, spring, winter, fall and even
Leap years, you want that shit, then peep here
You need $10 and some change for the exchange
Then you'll have the ill sounds pumpin in your range
Or your walkman, head bouncin type strange
That's when you start to realize that your life is rearranged
Don't go to work no more cause all you want is the pure
Hip hop from the MC connoisseur
So now you on missions headed to the record store
Cop the product and beam up like never before
Now you're hooked for life and there's no escapin us
Cause one hit was too many, a million not enough

Lone Catalysts,"[ VERSE 1: J. Sands ]
Yo, stepped out my door into the world, now it's on
The sun gave birth, so now the nighttime is born
Nothin different than the norm as the plot takes form
Inner feelings remain warm to shelter me from the storm
Cause the city could swallow you whole, so be warned
The streets are filled with scorn from dusk to morn
I gotta be alerted for all times or be torn
From my earthly existence, I measure the distance
And calculate a path straight so my time is efficient
Can't waste not a second or breath
So when I step, man, I trek
Mind focused, hollow point is noticed
At the fly Latin hostess, workin ????
But never hesitate my motion
My body floatin like the wind over the ocean
I saw the brothers toastin, the Thunderbird wine
Givin praise to the stars as they shine
Exchanged pounds, started to rhyme
Once the cipher hit its peak, I continued down the street
Cause my mission was incomplete, this was no time to sleep
Gotta get back to the lab and freak something that y'all can peep
From Lone Catalysts, very unique
The way we organize it all with the ill technique
The way we organize it all with the ill technique
The way we organize it all with the ill technique

[ VERSE 2: J. Sands ]
Only a block left to go before I reach the studio
The story goes: Rawls in the lab eatin Oreos
Waitin on me to show, he got a track and need a pro
Usually have some tree to blow, but nowadays I leave or go
When it's time to breathe a flow, even though
You might see me in your section
Eyes red complexion
With my man [Name] and LG flex on
You know that, so finally the destination
I'm at the lab with Rawls and without no hesitation
""My mic sounds nice, check one
My mic sounds nice, check two""
And with no further ado, you know the are-e-s-you-me
We be in the lab like all day
Rawls makes the track and I spit not the wack
Mix all the levels, then record it all on the DAT
Then take it to the Sugar Shack where Rashaad is at
Let him peep the joint cause 'cause got a knack
To spot the sure shots and the or-not's
So we be up in the lab till about 4 o'clock
In the AM, the next day, yo, it's no delayin
Time to put it to wax, CDs and tapes
To generate the papes, to generate the papes
Cause once it circulates everyone will state
That the Lone Catalysts be on a ill technique

Yo
I grab these microphones to live, son
Pay the rent, put food on the table
Got a roof over my head
But I take it serious
No joke

Comin' straight out the box, first edition, nutrition
From musicians, food for thought when you listen
I been around the atlas, countries and states
Everybody knows the Catalysts bumps, beats and breaks
The most true to life rap tactics for practise
The fact is, I tilt a nigga off his axis
The way that Sands taxes, doin' his mic matches
Somethin' massive, let me explain what the wrath is
Four hundred years of oppression, anger, aggression
And the anxiety of a blackman stressin'
The devil keep on testin, always gotta offer his suggestions
Make it seem greater when it's less than
That's just tricknowledge
They teach you it from high school through college
So you can go out and get them dollars
It's just a game they play to see who has the fattest wallet
That's why most blacks smoke crack and most white alcoholics

I grab these microphones to live, son, rest in peace Big Pun
Because you know another day you're not promised to live one
Yo, the streets are hot, most blocks are like a prison
So if you're lookin' for love, kid, you gots to give some
Man, these days are cold-blooded, everyone's butted
Rock jewels that stay flooded, the weak, they never cut it
Sometime I be like 'what if' but ain't a damn thing gonna change
Cause it's just part of the game

Aiyo, I slap-box lyrics through mics, the smooth type
That move right into a state of mind to fight
Cause it's all ground zero, my street level bureau
We'll play this game until we master it like Ken Duro
So what's your role? My part is the aural
Sub-moral, Lone Catalysts remain plural
I'm like ? headin out to ?
Maryland, in a caravan to a rural
Spot to make a drop-off, that's how I hustle my raps to prosper
Cause MC's disappear like Jimmy Hoffa
The hungriest cats are at the crib writin' this very minute
They see the pennant and want to win it
That's how styles get invented
y'all new jack timid frontin-ass niggas rhymes be rented
I got no respect for y'all, y'all probably be the next to fall
You want to bang, kid, should be waitin' for the ref to call
A time-out, so you can find out
Any possible way to exit this rhyme bout

Okay now let me get back to the session at hand
My DJ's name is Jason Rawls, I don't need no band
Yo, I travel across the land, microphone in hand
Do some dates out west so I can work on my tan
I guess it's just the rap life
y'all know who y'all niggas act like?
Quick to blaze the bag pipe and talk about the last night
Some are real grimey muthafuckas up in the fast life
Don't give a damn about rap cause they're stresin the crack price
(And grip the Mack tight) Some niggas frail like a glass pipe
With more bodyguards than Bill Clinton around they ass, type
To walk the streets at night carryin a flashlight
Some are players grabbin all the mamis on they ass tight
Bust it, some smoke weed, get skeed, hashis
Dust and ecstacy, shrooms and drink ??booze??
For all my rappin niggas, I hope we link soon
Get yours, I'm gettin mine, cause it's about time

If you're trekin get a walkman and some headphones with cushion

(Yeeaaah!) Cause they actin real sweet with the glamor and glitz
Soft to ???? hardrocks when the camera clicks
Test me, then you and your whole fam'll get ripped
See, I'm not the DJ, but still the man in the mix
Easily handle this quick, then testify to the Most High

I mean, the rhymes, the loops, the snares, the kicks
Ain't no joke, baby paw, this is as good as it gets
A lotta y'all with the raps and beats just seem to miss
Like you ain't tryin' hard enough to be part of
The most elite, you can't compete, so why bother?
Swimmin' with the sharks when you can barely thread the water?
This is the pros, you're amateur, not a starter
You need to take time out
To properly learn how to spit your rhyme out
I mean seriously, do
Can't you see that this industry is all about loot?
So if you're comin' with the wack you'll never recoup
And that doesn't make sense, to not make sense
When you're supplyin' the demand with the rhymes you invent
It's simplistic, but don't get it twisted
Cause you still gotta know the logistics or you'll just be a statistic
At home snack up on a two piece and a bisquit?
My point: you're findin' ???? in case you missed it

[Chorus]

One time for your mind, two times for your body
Three times for your soul, fourth time I take control
With my man J. Rawls about to break the mold
Under pressure never fold cause the hand that we hold
Is laced tight with the trump that makes you bump-bump
Don't front, cause suckers look chump right from the jump
When they act like they want to battle against the monk
Usually they probably drunk or feelin' it from the skunk
It's a sobering effect once we snap that neck like Erick and Parrish
Even your peeps will be embarrassed
So why you wan test against a strong guest
Who you know gon' bless the East Columbus

Way I lay my vocals to his drum kicks
With one swift paragraph I enlist
You and yours to explore with the Catalysts

The real reason why MC's remain amateur
Just examine the delivery and stamina
Focus in like a camera, see what I'm handin ya
Is the recipe, the basics and neccessities
For those who's blessin thee, mic, but too aggressively
Relax, man, let it come natural, feel the ecstacy
When you're holdin the mic, you should expect to be
In a mindframe that 'no one can stand next to me'
Blowin spots is the destinies of the best MC's
And the rest? Well, they settle for less
Here's a 'classic example' like A Tribe Called Quest
We got jokers in the industry who never paid dues
Cause their cousin brother mother knew somebody who knew
And you know how that goes, political, and it's critical
The charts are full of MC's who lyrically are pitiful
That's like sayin analog would sound better than digital
Rap is outta control, this why this time is pivotal
For us to make a change from the youngest to the oldest
Humblin these cats who swear up and down they the coldest
Frontin like they're boldest when they know they cannot hold this
If you can't protect your neck then you just be head and shoulders
I swear, cause these lyrics comin sharp like shear
So put my name up in your mouth, I double-dare you, yeah

[ CHORUS: J. Sands ]
Yeah, some MC's are rich, yeah, some MC's are poor
But none of that will be a factor once we settle the score
So we can do it like this or do it like that
Cause it don't matter where you're are because I bring it where you're at

[ VERSE 2: J. Sands ]
I heard some MC's want to get down
Put your shit down and have a sit-down
Forget the studio and the mixdown
It's time to set it, you talkin loud without the credit
You clean like a radio edit
You couldn't tell that the styles that I use are embedded like Dyanetics
Rhymes on time like FedEx
Alert the medics, it's about to get messy
Dirty like an SP-1200, backdoor like alley hoops
It's the way I enter ciphers, spark it like a lighter
Freestyles off the top for herbs and rhyme biters
J. Sands, focusin 360 degrees
With my plans for revolution, for land and currency
But for now I'm in the Pittsburgh streets
In all the sections cause in my section
I make moves like I was destined
To be a visualser with deep thoughts perplexin
Detection negative force in all directions
Usin microphones to broadcast suggestions
Of devil wizardry and black folk mysery
MC's fallin captive because their skills are not adaptive
I rock the East Coast and every city on the atlas
You paranoid, actin all sheist around your boys
Didn't use your own style, so you use the decoy
Now you're shadowed by a character you cannot destroy
Check your reflection, your whole concept needs an inspection

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: J. Sands ]
You can take it personal or consider this strictly business
Allah's my witness, I got the knack for lyric fitness
Have you duckin me like I was a Jehova Witness on your front porch
You know the repertoire, kid, you don't want more
Okay then what you run for, your ego's crushed, now you at the gun store?
Countin your chances hopin for one more
Sayin to yourself, 'I'm gonna get Sands', a slick plan
You never shoulda thought up, now you gettin nada
God don't like ugly so as you proceeded to plug me
????? Goretex boots and rugbies
A 'frantic situation' like the Zulu Nation
You shoulda used ???? they help you balancin your p.h.'in
Snake type tactics, curse all those who practice
If it comes around, then it goes around on the axis
A powerful impact make your ??ass back??
After no one will ever want to touch you like a cactus
The law of the shady, be it and then you'll see it
Reflected by three-fold from the way which you directed
It, to put it simple, you just need to quit
You just a mediocre rhymer but you still talk shit
You just a mediocre rapper and you still talk shit
It don't matter what your name is, you can still get dissed

[ CHORUS ]",Settle the Score
Lone Catalysts,"Yo, from Pittsburgh to Pelan this type shit we be on
When we on inside a cassette deck of your Neon
Or in your navigator whippin' with the CD on

Make a sucker new jack be gone
He kick his shit, I be like
Yo, you puttin' me on?
You wanna battle? Out to Rawls pick me a beat to freak on
Something with a lotta bass and some highs to tweet on
The drums, I give it a run, you know, turn the heat on
Up in the kitchen, then you'll delish on
Who put me in a top position, J. Sands dishing
No look like Ron Strickland
Make the average MC contemplate, just sitting
Down, the wax spin like merry go round
While I format the verbs and nouns through underground
Now what you're looking for you have found
So now bump to the sound properly laid and mixed down
By no other than my brother, although from different mother
J. Rawls with Sands on the mic, so take cover
The sound makes you bounce like flubber, Ludacris, Danny Glover
Lethal Weapon, so while you're checking

Due process, paying these dues, battling crews
At the same time, livin in life, givin enlightenment
Seeing eye for the blind
Through the darkness of the industry we ministry

I go on like etcetera
And blast my way out the plethora of replicas
Cats steady acting extra
And they parts is non speaking
My skills go without and beyond speaking
Address your congregation like a deacon
Seeking converts, my convo is a honor and a pleasure
You seein me is like Geraldo seein Al Capone's treasure
You the don of mediocrity, I'm the indispensable hero of hypocrisy
Stopping your flow like bureaucracy
Due process, you got blessed by the best of the population

Word to Black Shawn, I see your whole operation
And shut it down, cut it down like rain forest
You see Talib Kweli when you look up the idlest in the thesaurus
I'm the definition of special edition with rack and pinion steering
To make my handling more smooth than aloe and lanolin
Manifesto spitting, my stiletto's hitting
On a ghetto mission to keep it fabulous 
Like a Lone Catalysts composition

Due process, paying these dues, battling crews
At the same time, livin in life, givin enlightenment
Seeing eye for the blind
Through the darkness of the industry we ministry

On a level of metaphors with lies life seems to depreciate
Like automobiles submit its original state
I'm into brothers with registered plates 
Pushing the weight of my spirit
Passing the limit of speed, rhymes per minute
Cerebral engine is infinite
Class, the third eye high beams illuminates the distance
The pressure on pedals accelerates, racing the currents of winds
Making the intangible bend with aerodynamics and panoramic visioning
I see the world we livin in, five gallons of knowledge
A tank full filled with lessons
My temperature gauge measures all of the blessings
For the miles I'm stretching
Passing what is hot and what you got for all you cats on the list
Cause us to be the Catalysts
Of a new era, correcting errors
Learn to love it or leave it alone
Reciting these Nubian poems
From NYC to ATL we got continuous flows

At the same time, livin in life, givin enlightenment

Lone Justice,"My folks own the land round here
And our big old house now for some fifty odd years
We'd all seen a few rough days
But I never dreamed I'd watch it all get swept away

No one knows what causes angry rain
The water rushed right through this town just like a great big train
Years of hard work and memories
Are floatin? down big river on their way out to sea

After the flood
After the flood
The land it washed away
Felt like my flesh and blood

I'd rather be shovelin'
Through the slush and mud
Than to leave my home where I grew up
Life goes on after the flood

The Clover Inn Bar was hit pretty hard
The piano's lyin? in the street broken apart
My favorite old oak tree's rooted up
But I'll plant myself a new one after the flood

After the flood
After the flood
The land it washed away
Felt like my flesh and blood

I'd rather be shovelin'
Through the slush and mud
Than to leave my home where I grew up
Life goes on after the flood

A place to call your very own means so much
Though it's a little soggy
After all the water's gone
I'll scrub it clean and make it home again

A natural disaster can't hold nothin' on me
Their quakin' out west and freezin' back east
So I think I'll stick around
And show a little faith in a weary town

After the flood
After the flood
The land it washed away
Felt like my flesh and blood

I'd rather be shovelin'
Through the slush and mud
Than to leave my home where I grew up
Life goes on after the flood

I want to laugh cry jump for joy scream and shout

At the end of every storm there's a quiet night

Lone Justice,"Nobody knows about inspiration
Where it may hide or it's destination
Forever seeking the fire of its presence
And when it finally hits in its struggles and fits
It's as precious as silence

What was bound in my soul
Has now burst beyond control
I can't contain it anymore
Your love drowns lonely cold
With the satisfying warmth of inspiration

I was spent, I lacked inspiration
Too many false attempts had only left me vacant
Potential trials, trapped in a crowded prison
But your love is bold enough to bring a mighty flow
To the driest river

What was bound in my soul
Has now burst beyond control
I can't contain it anymore
Your love drowns lonely cold
With the satisfying warmth of inspiration

All is alive, there is no distance
How my spirit longs for your inspiration
So fill me up, fill me up, fill me up
Oh, fill me, oh

What was bound in my soul
Has now burst beyond control
I can't contain it anymore
Your love drowns lonely cold
With the satisfying warmth of inspiration

Lone Justice,"Standin' on a corner,
Suitcase in my hand.
Jack's in his car, says to Jane, who's in her vest,
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Brings a blow to chill my sesses and my heart quakes and tenses 'till those moments pass

I left so long ago
I'd forgotten just what for
But they say
When a big city beckons
You have no choice but to go
And here, there are no dixie storms
Thank God, there are no dixie storms

And the smoke on the street
Makes me wonder why I stay away
From those gentle dixie storms

When I was younger
How I would wonder
What made the sweet Georgia rain
Make me feel so warm

And how I loved those dixie storms

Pretty blonde sittin' on a seat of red leather

Old folks watchin' from a rockin' chair

Sweat like a tear rollin' down her neck
Watchin' him pullin' down the shades on the window

Lone Star,"His name was Travis, hers was Vanessa
Two Texas kids from west of Odessa
Young love and lust defy rational thinkin'
They were hotter than an oil field on fire
When you're that young everything's crucial
You don't wait around for parental approval
So he asked the question and she answered yes
They jumped in his truck and tore out for Juarez

They had an informal wedding south of the border
Got a room with a view for three bucks and a quarter
On a Mexican night you don't care what might lie ahead
They had a wonderful week in Juarez

Now, when the bottom fell out of his chosen vocation
They were too broke to move to a greener location
Bills you can't pay put a strain on devotion
They decided to just call it quits
Well, it might have been luck or divine intervention
But on the way to the lawyer divorce wasn't mentioned
He said I still love you, she looked at him
And said I know a great way to start over again

I would give all I own, for one little stepping stone

Lone Star,"Seven hundred head of cattle on an old forgotten trail
Six cowboys and one old man in another day of hell
Chuckwagon lagging behind from the strain of a broken wheel
The only thing to look forward to was a campfire and a meal
Asleep beneath an open sky with just the stars above their heads
A saddle for a pillow and some sagebrush for a bed
Waking up tomorrow was merely down by chance
Back when the west was wild and cowboys didn't dance

When cowboys didn't dance
Didn't wear designer shirts
When their hearts were filled with memories
Their bodies filled with hurt
They would sit around the campfire and exchange a piercing glance
Back when the west was really wild and cowboys didn't dance

More coffee from an old tin cup, more sweat upon the brow
Another day of chasing that same old lonely cow
With every new horizon began a brand new day
Thirteen hundred miles to go as they slowly made their way
Across the plains of Texas and through the Colorado snow
Final destination, Blackfoot, Idaho

When cowboys didn't dance
Didn't wear designer shirts

So you want to be a G ?
I want to be a G
I want to be like you

[Verse 1}
I want to be like you Sheed getting' respect on the block
Packin' a teq and a glock
Fat pockets you got your game on lock
But yet I still see you bowin' your head 
Askin' for forgiveness under the street light
Yeah right Shorty 
My life style still wrong 
It ain't easy standin' strong
Won't be long 'till I'm gone
Every cop in the city got me in they picture frame
Plus different gangs with bullets that got my name
So what then if they come I got something for them
I got your back 
We can go to war right now with 'em
And I'll floor 'em
Pour them bloodclots
Dead soldiers for O.G.
If these bullets come flyin'
I'm in front of you dyin'
You got heart huh?
What's this on your chest?
You for real ain't you Shorty
Where you get this bulletproof vest?
You a mess but I like you a lot
Let's split them from this spot
Them bullets is hot when the enemy came for the shot

[Chorus repeat 2x]

Say Shorty you ever fell a bullet up in your chest?
Or seen what a hallowpoint bullet can do
It's a damn mess
It's messed up when you have to resort to violence
That's why real bad boys gotta move in silence
Comprenda I understand you tellin' me avoid any trouble whenever I can
That a make me a better man
Be quick to listen and slow to speak
Watch everything and my game will be at peak
And don't trust a freak
You catch on fast you got the heart of a G
And as much as I hate to tell you
You kind of reminder of me
Look out Shorty
What one time commin' up the block
I can't let them see my face 
Put away the rocks and the glocks
Say no more
""What's the problem officer?""
""Now none of ya move come here sir let me talk to ya""
Yeah right 
Say Shorty I gotta break
I ain't stayin' here either
Well yo lets shake this crooked jake

[Chorus repeat 2x]

[Verse 3]

Damn O.G. you sure run fast for your age
That came from doin' push ups and workin' out when I was in the cage
Say Shorty let's chill for a while 
I got a little something in my pockets that will make you smile
I hope it's hydro 
If not I got some formaldehyde
What  Shorty?
They put it in people after they died
I'm already fried still pass me that dro
And let me taste this stuff and see what you be trippin' fo'
Smooth with great taste
Shhhh say O.G. you here some bass
Damn that's them busters from the otherside
Watch out Shorty
They pullin' gats out they ride
BOOM BOOM oh man I think I'm hit
Me too Shorty
Better get out of here quick
I can't everything is goin' black O.G.

Always stressing me out, but still bring the best in me out

I'm a big timer trying to flip thangs in the city
Streets got you racking ? foot playas on your pretty feets
Pretty face laced up, tight from the waist up
Thick from the waist down, that's why I chased her
Everyday I wake up, nothing could stop me
I'm cocky, kissing me smelling like it's a mi atay
I'm a thug on the block with my whodis
Spending two g's when we shop at the Foley's
When the beef pop, she be looking at Max funny
But she won't trip, cause she love spending Max money
If I shot a ten, she'll bring a twenty back for me
If she really love me hit the cut push it back for me
Ride or die, and here you go hide the gat for me
And I can't wait to be alone so you could act for me, what act funny

Out of the sky, I close my eyes

Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Lonely Trailer,"My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts with a quick turn of his wrench
And he pulled splinters from his hand and never even flinched
In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that Grandpa died I realized

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think'll never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

Then there was my junior year, Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch they brought the helicopter in
Billy couldn't feel his legs, they said he'd never walk again
But Billy said he would and his Mom and Daddy prayed
And the day we graduated he stood up to say

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

So don't tell me that it's over, don't give up on you and me
'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless if you believe

Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that

As to her whereabouts
Her sister says, ""I'm certain
Your romance is headed south.""

On the road with Pearl Jam

A saddle for a pillow and some sagebrush for a bed

When their hearts were filled with memories

The cafe is closed where our names were carved on that corner booth
Yeah, everything's changed except for the way I feel about you

That westbound to Santa Fe don't stop here anymore
You were one of the last to get on board
That street that we grew up on you wouldn't recognize

Flashing out a heartache in the back of my mind

And the love we threw away 
And I guess I always will

Got her order pad and her ball-point pen

Another smoke filled evening with no fire to be found

Before I close my eyes 
I look at my woman and 
I ask myself did you

On Mary's lap is sleeping?

While shepherds watch are keeping? 

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing. 
Haste, haste to bring Him praise, 
The Babe, the Son of Mary. 

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh; 
Come, peasant king, to own Him. 
The King of Kings salvation brings; 
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

As we go along

He'll say, Are you married? 
We'll say, No man 
But you can do the job 
When you're in town 

Later on 
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid 
The plans that we've made 
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman 
And pretend that he's a circus clown 
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

Though your nose gets a chilling 
We'll frolic and play

From a lonely, cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said, ""Daddy when you coming home?""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh, I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you, darling
Don't worry about the kids--they'll be all right
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind

Said call me Caroline for short

That somebody left your grass out in the yard all night?""

Of a trident submarine

Hidden deep within our dreams
And her diamond eyes, different in color
Held me captive in their light

We used to be brothers in some past life?""

Give them hope, give them praise, give them love every day
Let them cry, let them giggle, let them sleep in the middle
Oh, just let them be little

So innocent, a precious soul
You turn around
It's time to let them go

So let them be little 'cause they're only that way for a while
Give them hope, give them praise, give them love every day
Let them cry, let them giggle, let them sleep in the middle
Oh, just let them be little

Let them be little",Let Them Be Little
Lonestar,"Tell me what I have to do tonight
'Cause I'd do anything to make it right
Let's be us again

I'm sorry for the way I lost my head
I don't know why I said the things I said
Let's be us again

Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us again

Oh us again

Look at me, I'm way past pride
Isn't there some way that we can try
To be us again
Even if it takes a while
I'll wait right here until I see that smile
That says we're us again

Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us

Baby baby what would I do
I can't imagine life without you

Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in

Oh, here I am

Lonestar,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and a kiss and that's too bad
She said, ""I can go to work until you find another job""
I thought I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard working dad to being Mr. Mom

Well, Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast at six, naps at nine
There's bubblegum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday, Mr. mom

Football, soccer, and ballet
Squeeze in scouts and P-T-A
And there's that shopping list she left
That's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make?
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any man can take being Mr. Mom

Well, Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time
Breakfast at six, naps at nine
There's bubblegum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday, Mr. mom

Before I fall in bed tonight
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds
I'm gonna look just one more time

'Cause Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the eighteenth time
Breakfast at six, naps at nine
There's bubblegum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
Oh, been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday, Mr. Mom

Oh Mr. Mom
Balancing check books, juggling bills
Thought there was nothing to it
Baby, now I know how you feel when
What I don't know is how you do it
Oh
Honey, you're my hero",Mr. Mom

If ever there was a night
If ever the time was right
It's now
Nothing else matters
If ever a meant to be
Truly was meant to be
It's us

Say a million other dreams
Haunt you in your sleep
It's hard to know which ones
Are the ones that you should keep
But look around
Don't get caught up in the past
Put your faith in the ones you think will last

Lonestar,"Turn to the six o'clock news--another soldier dies
Tried to hide it, but I couldn't help it: I had to cry
When my little boy asked me, ""daddy, was he your friend""
I said, ""no, I didn't even know him""

[Chorus]
But he was somebody's someone, a neighbor, a husband
A brother, a father, and a mother's only son
He was an uncle, a cousin, somebody's best friend
And I'm sure at times a shoulder to lean on
He was somebody's someone

So I sat there in that chair and helped him understand
How this brave young man gave his life for our land
And although he's someone we'll never know
To you and me he is a hero

[Chorus]

To the world he was a total stranger
Who kept us safe and out of danger
But now he's just a picture on TV

All warm and bundled up tight

One lazy toe in the pool
Laid back and sippin' on something long, tall, and cool

Yeah, I can't wait for a warm breeze blowin'
Green grass growin' and the bright sunshine
Short sundress with your long legs showin'
I can't wait for the summertime
Oh, the summertime

I'm gonna find us some tickets
To a tropical isle
You just see if your mama can keep the kids for a while
We'll take our drinks with umbrellas
We'll take a room with a view
I'm gonna take my sweet time makin' love to you

Lonestar,"It's the way you twist a curl into your hair
As you sit there unaware of how beautiful you are
It's the music that I always seem to hear
When you bring yourself to tears from laughing way too hard
And when we're slowly dancing and you slip off your shoes
Don't you know, baby, just like everything you do

[Chorus]
That gets me; that just gets me every time
Right here inside this heart of mine
You open up your world and lay your love out on the line
That gets me; that just gets me every time

It's the way you say your prayers before you sleep
Then you curl up next to me and we hold each other close
And you tell me with your eyes that you'll never let me go
And that may be the moment that I love the most
When you make me feel like no other man exists
And when I taste the power and surrender of your kiss

Right here inside this heart of mine
You open up your world and lay your love out on the line

Lonestar,"I hear the sound of gentle rain
Like teardrops on the windowpane
A priceless smile in a wooden frame beside the bed
I stare at the ceiling and talk to the walls
I lay here alone and imagine it all
As a river of memories rushes through my head
I can almost taste your kiss as I think about how much I miss

Your hungry eyes, your satin skin
The sound of your voice whisperin'
The love I feel inside your heart
When you're wrapped up in my arms so close
That's what I miss the most

I try to rest, but sleep won't come
My body aches and my mind is numb
Shadows fall as the morning sun begins to rise
Another day without you here
Has it been weeks or has it been years
I find it getting harder to keep track of time
I breath in and I breath out
But it's getting tough to live without

The way they talk, the way they giggle
The way they walk, the way they jiggle
Makes men buy 'em diamonds and pearls
That look when they're up to something
Soft touch, oh, that lovin'
They're sexy when they're mamas
Cute when they're girls

We men like to think we're in control
We all want to be big shots
We like to think we run the show

You ladies know you can drive us wild
Those mini-skirts and the way you flirt
You know just what works

To see some other lovely thing
Walking pretty down the street
'Cause just about that time my girl she realized
Caught my eyes and busted me
Now I'm back out in this bed I made face down in the dirt
Beggin' to get my baby back, you think I would have learned

[Chorus]
It's just another day in the dog house
I better change my ways and my wandering eyes
It's just another day in the doghouse
Thinking this is probably where this dog is gonna die

I stumbled in at 3am
After poker night with my friends
She was waiting up and angry
I said honey I lost track of time, not to mention every dime
That I had on me
Now I'm back out in the yard and sad and all alone
If you find forgiveness in your heart just throw this boy a bone

I am a man of passion
Maybe it's magic, maybe it's a chemical reaction
All I know is you walk in the room
There's a fire deep inside me
And it's burning just for you
You know I want you baby
Try to understand

I'm right, I'm wrong
I'm weak, I'm strong

I do believe in God
But I wrestle with the devils of addiction

More than life itself

Let's shut out the world, dim all the lights
Baby tonight
I just want to love you

And watch the shadows dance on the wall

Let me feel your touch on my skin.

Is how sweet you looked standin' in the doorway,
Smilin' while I brushed away your tears.
An' all I dream about,
Is the next time I can hold you,
An' I can show you all the love I'm feelin' here.

Over two bottles of beer, we watched the sun disappear
I knew I thought she was cool an' could tell she dug me
I could go on about that first kiss but it really all started with
Two bottles of beer in Biloxi

Gulf breeze, Mississippi moon, a billion stars above
Half a mile down the beach from that little Tiki hut
Stopped in our tracks when we found out that we both went to school at UT
Only catch was, I was from Texas an' she was from Tennessee

Over two bottles of beer, we watched the sun disappear
I knew I thought she was cool an' could tell she dug me
I could go on about that first kiss but it really all started with

We were bridgin' the gap between two college towns

While shoveling mud in a rain-soaked ditch

She wants a dirt bike mud ride in the country

Wasn't sure he'd make it

When You gave Your son to us
You must have cried then too

By the time he opens his eyes she'll already be a blur

There ain't no lie in looking back

Sideswiped a couple of highway signs
Tore off both mirrors, something free and wild

That long lost smile

Staring through the windshield, a new look in her eyes
A conscience as clear as the Texas sky
She ran out of patience, out of strength and out of tears
He ran out of second chances and now she's outta here

My brother and me, Mama's tears falling like a Carolina rain

Cause she pulled out a gun the night before
Said he ain't gonna drink and hit me no more
She pulled the trigger on my father in a moment's rain

Thank God that gun wasn't loaded
Didn't know where to go or how she'd survive
Didn't care, anywhere but there that night

Now she held her babies tight
And we rode through the cold of the midnight blue
She was scared, she was broke
But all she knew was she was gonna do
What she had to

She got her a job in a trailer out west
It wasn't much but she was doing her best
Putting food on the table for her family

But then one day I came home from school
My Mama was crying alone in her room
She said, I lost my job and we're gonna lose the trailer too
And she got that volkswagon loaded
Didn't know where to go or how she'd survive
Didn't care, anywhere but there that night

She held her babies tight
And we rode through the cold of the midnight blue
She was scared, she was broke
But all she knew was she was gonna do
What she had to

Whenever things go wrong in my life
I just think of her, what it took that night
To get on that bus in a Carolina rain

I watch it go
The memory
Of how it feels

I can hear it now
It's so beautiful, it's hard
This [unverified]
Inside of me

I stumble, stumble down
From what was mine
I choke, I drown
With all fading out

The hills beneath
Can't fear them now
I watch it go
But it's out of reach

Is what we did
When all is told
What we do
When all is told

'Cause I can hear
And I have caused
I can feel
What's been lost

It turned so dark

",I Lose It All
"Loney, Dear","Johnny and I, we got lost tonight, we got carried away
It takes someone like me to lose track like that, to be troubled down,
Got a heart full of plans but nowhere to run
There were seventeen dogs out to track us down
And I got some bruises and I got a scar but now,
Never gonna let you down,
And I got it wrong like I knew I would, and I told you,
Never gonna let you down,
I must never let you down,
Never gonna let you

And everything must start from here,
In a sunshine with ease with somewhere to go,
With no sticky feeling of going wrong,
No heartbeat asking where you're gonna go
With the trouble you wear, you want to wear it down,
You want to make something new of this but
Never gonna make it (home), never gonna make it
Someone I want now, somewhere I want to go, and I told you,
Never gonna let you down,
Never gonna let you down,
But I will always let you down

I said Johnny and I, we got lost tonight,
But we doubled our chances, we've got somewhere to go
We've got devils chasing us to hunt us down,
And we know we can't go like this from now
I've got a feeling of you, and we danced for so long,
I want your arms around me, said
Never gonna let you down, was never gonna let you
Someone I want now, somewhere I want to go, and I told you,
Never gonna let you down,
Never gonna let you down,
But I will always let you down

I've got a feeling of you and we danced for so long,
I want your arms around me like lovers do,
And I'm never gonna let you down, gon' let you down,
Gon' let you down, gon' let
I've got a feeling of you and we danced for so long,
I want your arms around me like lovers do,
And I'm never gonna let you down, gon' let you down,
Gon' let you down, gon' let you down
Johnny and I, we got lost tonight, we got carried away
It takes someone like me to lose track like that, to be troubled down,
Got a heart full of plans but nowhere to run
And everything must start from here,
In a morning with ease with somewhere to go,
With no sticky feeling of going wrong,
With no heartbeats asking where you're gonna go
I've got a feeling of you and we danced for so long,
I want your arms around me like lovers do,
And I'm never gonna let you down, gon' let you down,

Long Beach Dub All-Stars,"Kick me down is all I hear nowadays
Break me off you can say it in a thousand ways
Give me this, give me that as if you feel angry
Lyin' to kick it just to smoke up all my weed
Drinkin' my brew and gettin' drunker than me
Tell me what is it that you wantin from me
Ain't nothin' free I had to work to get what's comin' to me
Open your eyes and realize this is somethin' to see

Kick down is what they talk 'bout today
Your in my arena but you don't want to play
It's how you move and not what you say
When the cats away the mice will play
'Cause I'm remembering the days when I didn't have nothin'
Livin' in the ghetto east side I'll tell you something
From the life I've lived and what I've seen
Nothing from nothing means nothing
So you better have somethin'
If you want to kick down from me
So let's move to the side and make this discrete
Take a look at my numbers to see if they meet
Up with your stylin' to fill up your streets
I don't who you are but I guess you know me 
Stop thinking you can come up so easily

Open your eyes and realize that this is somethin' to see

What is it that you beggin' me for
I've got it all but now you can't have it
I've learned from what I've earned 
And established my status as a job to manage
And to my advantage I will stand ground 
Shake your hand like the ????? man around 
And your town kickin' you down for a minute
But everything your life have consequences
Beginning only to end it 
As if it was intended
But you still have to take to the streets and represent it
For each one to step off a street and represent it 
So you can sleep for each consecutive second 
That's independent from each hour
I speak as if I was the only source of power
Keeper of keeper thought with knowledge in my conscious tower
I read the fate like characters in fictitious novels
And yet between the lines I find more follow
A most hollow way of life to model
For our street investin' stress in a bottle 
Nah your better off wishin' a lotto
 
Kick me down is all I hear nowadays
Break me off you can say it in a thousand ways
Give me this, give me that as if you feel angry
Lyin' to kick it just to smoke up all my weed

Hey ?????.  Ha Ha, what's up Op ain't seen you in a while chile.
Hey man you fuckin' livin' large huh, comin' up huh you like it, 
Servin' the purpose and shit. Gold card and everything.  
Right Right. Kick me down. Huh, I'm gonna tell you like this
Bro. 

Kick me down is all I'm hearing from you
Come on man break me off save me some
As if there's some for you
I need this, give me that
As if you need some help feed your self, yous the only one that needs yourself
I need a drink to get me drunker than the forty thieves
Tell me why is it that you frontin' on my fortune please
Speak your peace or forever hold your own
I need a loan, I need a car to get on 
Naw dawg you better off fetchin' for your own bone to throw
Come on I'm in the streets I'm all alone
But if you seek then you shall find your shine ain't gone
So can I get a kick down
Naw
You wrong

Kick me down is all I hear now a days

Way back in junior high I could of swore my name was white boy
(What's up white boy?)
There was all types of ill shit going down
Between gangsters, thugs and cholos
Heshians, Asians or insane usos
Well I've got friends black white yellow red and brown
We would sit there by the river
And listen to the freeway
Just sit and smoke and drink with all my crew (ohh)
Well now when I look back
Over blue skies and smoke stacks
It makes me laugh to think I've made it through
And I hear the birds sing
When the sun brings out the morning
And there's everything or nothing I can do

When I break into my stash
I remember trailer ras
And there's everything or nothing I can do

We would sit there by the river
And listen to the freeway
And do the things you're not supposed to do

How to the jump the fence was the first thing I learned in high school
And I knew this girl that lived just down the street
On the phone the whole day scoring
And when hickeys got boring
The neighborhood was filled with pounds of tweak
We would sit in the recliner and listen to the TV
And do the things you're not supposed to do
Well now when I look back or I see teenagers mack
Well I think about those days I spent with you
And I hear the birds sing
When the sun brings out the morning

""boy you better watch out cause I got my eyes on you.
This might be hard to understand, my friend.
When I got caught I didn't care.
Let the humble be ground and beneath thee feet, as they kill over colors
Love is not as simple as love on the streets, so don't cry for my brothers.

Better watch your back, try not to stay.
When the shit goes down you better be away.
So I got caught, I didn't care.
When the night falls it's time to say your prayers.

Tell me why I'm not dead with them in the valley down below.

And a little bit of something about the positive vibes of the sea
'I feel at one with the waves!'
He said: 'Let's get a Big Mac, tune into happening sounds, check out the chicks on the beach and

Or is it all you care about

In your eyes is a dead and blue little nerve
Is it minding its business
Or is it all you care about

Every minute that you go
I hope you never know

Always my secret and jump from it always

Longview,"Thinking of you while out for a ramble
Down by a cold frosty stream
Set down on a bed of hemlocks and primroses
Gentry I fell into a dream



I dreamed I saw a pretty fair maiden
Such beauty I'd never saw before
Her dress was bound round with hemlocks and primroses
So gree was the mantel she wore



He hair was of a dark brown color
Her teeth was as ivory so white
Her eyes they shined like sparking diamonds
Of stars than shine on a cold frosty night



I drew her near then I awakened
With two empty arms and you on my mind
Heaven seemed so near while I was dreaming
It hurts to know you left me behind

Longview,"The big court room was crowded while the jury heard my plea
I said, sir I'm not guilty of the crime you're accusing me
I guess no one believed me for they only truned away
To tell the judge their verdict while I bowed to pray

    I heard my mother weepin' when the judge said, guilty son
    I'll have to give you life now for the crime that you have done
    She cried, don't take my darlin' he means the world to me
    He's all I have to live for, I pray you'll set him free


His father was a drunkard, went away left us alone
I washed to keep from starving and to raise our darling son
Now if you take him from me his face no more I'll see
Just put your son in his place his mother's here with me

    * Refrain


The judge sat there with head bowed low, at first did not reply
And then I saw him wipin' a teardrop from his eyes
He motioned to the jury, this sentence can't be done
God bless you darlin' mother I still love you and my son

Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

Frankie went over to the barroom
Stopped for a bottle of beer
Said to the old bartender man
Has my lover Johnny man been here?

He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong.

And then to her great surprise
There sat her lover man Johnny

He wears cor blimey trousers

Lonnie Donegan,"Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone
I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever more

I had it all right on my back

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

It's hard to tell the state I'm in
Where I'm going, where I've been
But there's a dream I've been following so long
If mama knew the things I've done
She'd forgive them everyone
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Can't remember when I ate
it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.

Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

From Florida to the North Pole.

Lonnie Donegan,"If you wanna get in trouble let me tell you how to do it
Get yourself a guitar and then you're right into it
You play all day and you play all night
People say you'll never learn to play the thing right
Always messing about, groaning at you
Moaning, won't let you practice

So I bought myself a guitar about a year ago
The man said I could learn it in a week or so
Gave me a little book, pick or two
Said, ""Here why'are mate, it's up to you""
Dirty rotter, cost me ten nicker, all the loot I had
Good guitar, though, called it a pluck it

Anyway, spent me dough
And I couldn't let it all go to waste, you know
So I took the book, guitar and all
And I went back home where the trees are tall
Down in Woodford, good place to be if you've got a guitar
Pretty rotten if you ain't

Well, for weeks and weeks I worked hard
And I tried to learn a few main chords
The book says they're easy as ABC
Cor, my fingers is killing me, got sore on the ends
Couldn't hold the strings down
Wanted to pack up, cor, I felt rough

Anyway, kept on playing with all me might
I could see Mum's hair was turning white
And her face was lined with discontent
She said her patience was pretty near spent
She was nervous, ears ringing, wanted to scream
You know, couldn't get no relief

So sister, anyway, she took it worst of all
'Cause she got married the following fall
She said ""For love"" but I got me doubts
I think the guitar chased her out
She's a game girl, though
Just couldn't take it, you know, limit to everything

Dad, he took it a different way
He said, you can turn your Mum's hair gray
Drive your sister away from home
But you or me boy's gonna start to roam
And I ain't going, never intend to
You figure it out, so I did, fast, you know

Anyway, next day had me clothes all packed
And I slung me guitar across me back
Caught myself a great long train
Searched the world for me share of fame
Ain't found none, just hardships, messing about

But of course, if you got certain things on board
You're okay and you don't have to pay the man nothin'

I got sheep, I got all livestock, I got all livestock
I got all livestock

You don't have to pay me nothin'""
And then the train go through
And when he go through the tollgate
The train gotta have a little bit of steam and a little bit of speed
And when the driver think he safely on the other side
He shouts back down the line to the man and he says

I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Oh, now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die?

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free

Of paradise, where roses grew

The hip hop world as you know it, is now at an endin'

This rap hell has got skells and mac twelves
Over past gels, crack sales, and blackmails
When your people get clocked it hurts
They quit thuggin, run and join a baptist church
We pushin white see-3's with five TV's
The Outsidaz, its on the Night Life EP

Roll up the crime crime, organized crime dime
Between love and hate there's a fine line
Some people hate how we gettin it, some people ride mine
Cheer for me like they got pom-poms in the nine-nine
We straight rockin it, two G, we lockin shit
Outsidaz' Night Life a gift to the provocative

Where I'm from we miss Biggie
Flip keys, so if you stick with me
Its strictly bright lights and big cities
No dough, its a lotta caffeine, gotta have cream
That's why we run this rap scene like a Carl Lewis track team
D-you'a, representin New Jay-ruz
Pump six holes in you like pool tay-bles

Yeah, we stack dough get wet like tadpoles
Y'all fags though nigga, all pussy like black gold
With the mack fold, punk you ain't gon' do shit
Don't pull it out if you ain't gon' use it
These are the last days before I get cast weight
Its a must, I have to Rock Hard like Cafe

Lonnie Mack,"Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds	
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree	
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of the man that Brandy loved

Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay

When he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its ragin' glory
But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around

Aiyyo, the game keep callin', niggaz in the streets is ballin'
Tryin' to creep just to keep from fallin'
But the block keep hollerin', yellin' my government name
I tried to stop but the love of the game

They got my girl in a frenzy, my niggaz used to be friendly
'Til they seen me and Puff in the Bentley
Now, forced to stay, forces use force and spray
Coffins lay when I'm forced to play

Like an animal, dawg, if I put my hand on you
I'ma handle you, like I'm Hannibal, the motherfuckin' cannibal
All plans is through, dreams and goals
The block hot but why this shit seem so cold

This shit seems so old, tryna redeem my soul
The Feds roll and my team done fold
Like a bad hand of poker, even ya man'll smoke ya
For these crushed up leaves of coca, now

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Yo, check it out
It's been four years and you ain't shed no tears
And through the course of that, I lost four pairs
That's why I smoke more blunts, drink more beers
You never consider it, like you just don't care

The pain I feel inside, you just don't share
When I share my deepest thought, you just don't hear
Well aware of my fears of me losin' my life
I'm well aware of my fears of me losin' my wife

That's why I stay usin' my gun and usin' my knife
Gotta deal with this shit 'til my music get right
I buy you pretty things just to see you wear it
You sayin' I ain't shit, tryna break my spirit

I try to change my life but you just don't hear it
Guess I gotta find another girl to spend four years with
Damn, all that time got wasted but I guess I gotta face it

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Uh, yo, uh, aiyyo
The cops don't like me, they always eager to fight me
Even though I know they wanna be like me
'Cause they see a nigga icy, doin' a buck in the white V
Twizzy gettin' busy with wifey, gettin' head on the highway

I'm gettin' money to fly away
Pull me over just to fuck up my Friday
What could I say? Nothin', still they be frontin'
Throw a brick in the trunk and try to make up somethin'

But I'm not with the bullshit, that's why I roll with a full clip
Flint cock the hammer and pull quick
Don't care about your uniform or that bullshit you be on
Now who gon' really mourn when you be gone?

One in your head like a unicorn
You movin' on, your favorite suit is on
Moms singin' that stupid song, ""My baby ain't blast nobody""
But he still got smoked at Bay Bay's party, that's why

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do
I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do
I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Loon,"[Intro - Loon - talking]
Uh, check it out, yeah
Let me tell you a little story
A little couple street tales, ya know
On the shit I be seein
Cause yo I'm from Harlem and everyday I see shit yo
This, check it, uh

[Verse 1 - Loon]
Now here's a story about a young kid, had everything in life
Never had to ask for nothin more than twice
His pops was gettin it, moms was a lawyer
And his ball game almost got him draft to the Hoyas
He fell in love with this chick named Latoya
But little did he know, Latoya was a ho
Lotta shit about Latoya he don't know
She fucked with some nigga named Bo, who sold blow
But the day he found out, turned the town out
Ran up on Bo and his ass got pound out
But yo when he came through, he seen the devil in disguise
It was Bo with the devil in his eyes
Mack 11 on his side, him and seven other guys
And every last one of these niggaz ready to ride
Beside the fact, that this cat in the mix
His jaw all broke up but that could be fixed
Drawers all soaked up, cause that nigga pissed
Full force, cocked back the rap nigga shit
Now perhaps nigga flipped or perhaps nigga cried
But deep down this nigga didn't really want to die

[Chorus - Female voice]
Niggaz get a little bit of loot, then think they fly
Then they want to claim they thugs, but they really don't want to die

Niggaz get a little bit of loot, and then think they fly
Then they want to claim they thugs, but they really don't want to die

[Verse 2 - Loon]
Uh, yeah, uh
Now here's a story about another nigga by the name of Jermaine
This nigga pushin thirty and still in the game
He won't change, all he do is sniff cocaine
Recruit niggaz outta school and poison they brain
I'm sayin any nigga fuckin with Jermaine
This nigga have you hustle in the rain, or bust a nigga brain
This duke was a menace in fact
But these Dominican cats could finish him black
Cause he didn't finish them packs, didn't finish that weight
The kid he had picture, caught ten in the face
Him and his ace, walk around with Mack 10 in they waist
But pop never been a disgrace
Word to mother, he got contract killers, combat niggaz
They kill if a whole fifth of Coniac liquor
Skipped town thinkin they wouldn't harm that nigga
Found out they know where your mom's at nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Loon]
The last story Samantha, type of chick that you pamper
Got a lotta junk in her Pamper
Pops was a Panther, her mom's some happy camper
That thought the whole world of Samantha
Moved to Atlanta, at the age of 18
Got a couple girls and they formed the A-team
Some play things, specialize in blazin
Her and her girlfriend Mayling from Beijing
They was bugged, harrassin the scrubs
Everybody knew about Samantha and clubs
Gullible, get Samantha some drugs
And you could take her home, get Samantha some love
Back shots, yo Samantha don't budge
Probably all the niggaz that Samantha done fucked
Lotta kids, she done twist lotta ways
'Til she found out she HIV positive

[Chorus] - 2X",Don't Wanna Die
Loon,"Oh yea oh yea

Spend your whole life in the slums if you want to
I eat good, eat crumbs if you want to
And keep wastin' time with the bums if you want to
I got long though, you know how the song go
My name hold weight, far from a John Doe
It so strange how the game made my arm grow
Used to live in cell blocks, now I live in condos
And every morning I feel like Alonzo
Number one on the pop charts and your moms know
Every time I pull up, there's a car show
Young cats, stay lookin' like the head honcho
My escargot my car go one-sixty
The world's Fargo Parto
Me and Puff like the ""Lone Ranger, Tonto""
Leave the club and we leave with a whole car load
And we got better ratings than a new gong show
But right now you got to let my arm go, see'mon ma

[Chorus:]
I know what you've been through
Sometimes love is so cruel
(Sometimes)
Oh, yes it is
(Oh, yes it is)
I know I ain't perfect, but I'll be there for you
(Gonna be there for you baby)
Oh yes I will (oh woo woo)

Uh, check it out
You choose to lose, only 'cause you confused
If you was with me, I'd probably go abuse them dude
But you runnin' 'round 'busin' shoes
'Stead of 22's that cruise
How you gon' abuse the rude
Girl you runnin' with some popular dude
Poppin' bottles of Voo
Now you seen me and you not in the mood
Girl he has you on the block with his dudes
Different watches to choose
Baby girl I think you got me confused
That's like a chair to a sofa
Ma tell her Oprah, seein' Russell in a pair of loafers
It's evident, that's irrelevant, you was elegant
Taught you proper etiquette, for the hell of it
It's like you feel me, but you not smellin' it
I try to talk but you stay on some yellin' shit
Then you complain about the things that Helen get
Leave me and get the same treatment a felon get

[Chorus:]

Uh, yo
Yo I'm the type when I come through
Mami I do what I want to
As far as you if I want you
Now I ain't come here to haunt you
So you can have a attitude if you want to
I'ma have you, reason why
All four seasons I'm fly
I'ma player, ain't no reason to lie
Ain't no reason for you breezin' on by
Without squeezin' a ""hi""
'Cause I could tell by the gleam in your eye
You like cats with dough that fold up
22's when they roll up
Ma you need to slow up, hold up
Here's a proposition, on the real ma, he got to listen
I know he's loud, cause the top is missin'
But you could be in the Tropics fishin'
By the sea, mami poppin' Crisses
Though it seem kinda optimistic
I got green and a pot to piss in
Fuck with me, you got a lot to witness
'Cause I'ma have you

[Chorus:]
I know what you've been through
Sometimes love is so cruel
(Sometimes love)
Oh, yes it is
(Sometimes, oh yeah)
I know I ain't perfect, but I'll be there for you
(I ain't perfect, but I'll be there for you)
Oh yes I will (oh, yes I will)

Wa hoo, I know that love
Don't give you a fan sometimes
Sometimes what you gotta, what you gotta
You gotta reach down and play it with your poker face

Loon,"Yeah, check it out, uh yo

Yo, I was sittin' on the block with the deuce-deuce, the bubble goose
Nigga popped up in the blue Coupe, this nigga Moose
This nigga fishy, this nigga he stay pissy
Run up behind niggaz, the blizzy and get busy
I seen niggaz resent, some nigga wrist be broke over this coke
Or pocket full of crispy
Dollar bills make nigga swallow the steel
And most niggaz can't swallow a pill, know how that feel?
But back to the skit nigga, in back of the whip
With the windows half way down about to clap on some shit
And I'm rappin' and shit to this platinum chick
It was fucked up, I got shorty back of the whip
I'm paranoid but still got the gat and the clip
If them niggaz spit, I got to spit back at the whip
If it go down, shorty whole back'll get ripped
And that's low down, real life theatrical shit
So I grabbed shorty hand, took a couple of paces
Said some ""Hail Mary"" maintain my patience
Oh shit, this nigga spit four quick
I threw shorty down and let off the whole clip
Then reloaded but holdin' the whole whip
In broad day, so niggaz done witnessed the whole shit
Had to flee this shit is blasphemy
I took a couple of steps and the nigga blasted me
This nigga Moose got loose from the caboose
Ain't thinkin' about a truce, try to knock my dick loose
My deuce-deuce ain't fuckin' with Moose point forty
I try to save the chick but the nigga done lose shorty
Two to her gut, one to her chest, one to her head
Now shorty layin' puddles of red, fuck it I'm fed
I'm tryna figure was it somethin' I said
That got this dumb nigga bustin' out lead, discussion is dead
I understand this man, he got a cannon in his hand
The sound alone, this shit is bananas
My one plan was to hit him and run fam
But God saved my life, when he made his gun jam
Time to leave but he still tryna squeeze
Instead of tryna buy him some time on his knees
Nigga please, you got no reason to buck up
Knowin' that you 'bout to get shot the fuck up
Duke was brave but his stupid ways
Is the reason why I'm 'bout to twist Duke toupee
And I'ma squeezin' but the gun wouldn't shot no strays
Now we even but the nigga like six two, what would you do?
I'm 'bout to out fox this nigga
Son at one sixty-five, I'ma box this nigga
But what he don't know, Loon 'bout to ox this nigga
Hit him dead in his fuckin neck, when I chop this nigga
But thoughts in my mind, tellin' me let it slide
So I'ma get in my ride and catch Duke another time
Just circle the block smoke a purple of choc
This nigga heart stop, nigga died right on the spot
No bullshit, collapse right on the block
Crackheads went in his slacks, hit him right in his knot
Save me the trouble, now my phone on bubble (they comin' for you)
Feds tappin' my line, like nigga condone the trouble
Walk out my motherfuckin' home is a struggle
Fuck them pigs, I don't own no shovel

What the fuck
Now all that bullshit I done been through with this nigga
I ain't lay a single solitary motherfuckin' hand on this nigga
This nigga drops dead, these motherfuckers is all on my ass
Like I did somethin' to this nigga
Word to my mother, this shit is some real bullshit man
This nigga killed my motherfuckin' bitch
Now I'm runnin' around like motherfuckin' Harrison Ford
Like I'm some motherfuckin' ""Fugitive"" or somethin' man
This is some real bullshit man
But I'ma ride this shit out man

Oh, I like ya baby, I like
Ah, hey, baby, I like, yea

Check it out
There was a reason I like you
And there's a reason I wifed you
'cause I never seen nothin' like you
So sweet, my team even like you
There's no limit to the things that I might do

And that's why you stay in the finest
Everything major, never in the minors
We dine on yachts, far from them diners
I'm by your side far from behind ya

And I ain't gotta buy cars to remind ya
Gas you up and put your heart in the grinder
You don't know what you mean to me, girl
'cause you more like a queen to me

And I want you to cling to me
'cause you came here, you changed my scenery
It was just like a dream to me, that's what it seemed to be
You need a ring, it not a thing to me

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way
The feelings good things from you

Girl, you are my lover
When I'm with you, there is no other
A spell you got me under
Please don't you leave
I'm on my hands and knees

And now I'm back by popular demand
Rocks is in your hand, so let 'em know, girl, you gotta man
Even though you know I got a lot of fans
See me in the club with the bottles in my hand

Models on the side tryin' to holla if they can
Get a nigga home, try to swallow if they can
But you know they can't holla at your man
I'm focused so they can't bother without plans

White sand, we done, did that
London, did that, Sandrope, we done, did that
Went to Sydney and dropped dough
Trips to Morocco, Paris popped more, we did that

So ain't nothin' else left to do
But spend the rest of my life and invest in you
I know them haters be testin' you
But don't let nobody stress you, boo
You know they like that

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way
The feelings good things from you, girl

Aeyo, now that we made our bond
It might sound crazy, ma, but it's time to get our baby on
It's time to get a life together
'cause you gon be my wife forever

'cause I made up my mind, it's crazy at times
Visions of you and a baby of mine
Half the hassle, livin' in half a castle
There's no way to act or pass you

I'm blessed to have you, pain that I loved done last through
Can't nothin in the world surpass you
I have to ask you, please be my only girl
I can't breathe in this lonely world

'cause I'm often hounded, concerts surrounded
By chicks that think Loon is astounding
But without you, ma, Loon won't be grounded
Loon would be runnin' round clownin'

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way the feelings good things from you, girl

I like the way you wear your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
Way you kiss me I feel warm
Give me all your lovin' all night long

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way

Loon,"Uh yeah, c'mon, uh, yo, aiyyo

[Verse 1]
How I'm gon' forget my muscle, I just had to switch my hustle
And try to make hits that crush you, and dance like Nipsey Russell
And have Puff doin the hustle, I do what I must do
I keeps my shit consistent, I keeps my listeners listenin
My rocks be glistenin, I come through blocks be hissin
But niggaz can't stop my mission
My main intention, is to make niggaz pay attention
I don't want to call my henchman
I got some French men, that come through put some French in
Or Muslim to burn nigga body like incense
If Loon dies, wolves come out like moon rise
And make niggaz hard to find like moon pie
If you wise nigga, you'll move like two pies
Then to stand here and keep on lookin in Loon eyes

[Chorus] - 2X (with second time starting with ""now"")
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
I'm just another brother that's out to get cash
The goal of the street is to hold ya own
If you smart, then you never got to hold no chrome

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, now this verse I feel I owe you
You tryna get dough I show you, even if I don't know you
Tell you couple things I go through
And maybe you can get some dough too, just spit your vocals
And do the shit Tone and Poke do, or get a nigga work the pro tools
I chose a local, nigga that's probably broke to
So this way a nigga could blow to
I beg to differ, you the type nigga bread get thicker
Top of that, nigga head get bigger
Go 'head then nigga, you don't know where you headin nigga
Last year you was a beggin nigga
Never said the nigga was even close to bein bred from nigga
You got a plan, get ya bread then nigga
I fed you niggaz, just like Moses when I led you niggaz
I could see why niggaz dread you niggaz, uh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ha, ha, haha, never find that funny (why?)
Girl you know I works hard for my money (hmm)
You callin me a thief please, don't even try it
Find ya groupie ass a seat and be quiet
She almost got cut short, you know scissors
For stuntin on that kid, who neck look like lizard
That young Harlem nigga, who lifestyle exquisite
And all the young ladies can't wait to come visit
Loon, I stay on ass like sassoon
Mansion with 22 rooms in Cancun
Handsome, I keep the girls glancin and dancin
Prone to rock stone when I blow my advancement
Never alone, either home or romancin
Nigga get in the zone when I'm rollin my Branson
And yo chances of you gettin this shit is no chances
You better get a drink and go dancin

[Chorus]",This Ain't Funny
Loon,"[Intro - Loon - talking]
Yeah, see a lotta finger pointin goin on
A lot of judgment bein passed
Niggaz don't even know what their fuckin talkin 'bout
I go by the name of Loon
And I represent this Bad Boy shit
'Til the motherfuckin casket drop
Damn right, uh, aiyyo, aiyyo

[Verse 1]
Niggaz don't know me, it's time that I give you the first taste
In case niggaz suffer the worst case
Harlem my birthplace, I used to run with niggaz that hurt Mase
I started ""Harlem World"" in the first place
Niggaz was thirsty, jumped out the window
Indoed the fuck up, it cost they friends yo
Cause that's how friends go
But niggaz tryna get they ends yo
Forget about the nigga that lent yo
Ask for dollar, now you want to holla cause your ends low
But look at how far your friends go
Killer is doin it, nigga Loon drop bitches is losin it
Keep the tool cocked, niggaz is usin it
Only if it's a must, nigga front, put they dick in the dust
That's what you get, fuck with niggaz like us
Loon that nigga that bust, even though you think that nigga just lust
These chicks, after I hit, I put the bitch on the bus

[Chorus]
(Oh you don't know who the fuck I be?)
Oh it's the L, double O, N, representin the NYC
(Any nigga disrespect my G's)
Son a nigga get jacked, nigga get crapped, even dumped in the sea
(Oh you don't know what the fuck I know?)
When it come to the dough, nigga I'ma pro, when I step to them hoes
(Oh you don't know what the fuck I do?)
To a nigga like you thinkin your crew gon' do somethin to Loon

[Verse 2]
I'm glad Puff let me get to my gat
Cause now I'm 'bout to give 'em my pack
Get in the 'Lac, sit in the back
Ride around with my shit in my lap
The first nigga react, the first nigga act, nigga get clapped
I don't get down with you niggaz like that
So all that yikkety-yak, a nigga front, gun clickety clack
Make it hard for you niggaz that rap
Cause when you gotta pick up the slack
Pick up a pack or pick up a plaque
You ain't think my flow could pick up like that
The way I stick to a track, the impeller gettin hit with a bat
One swing'll bring your shit to your lap
And make you shit in your slacks
Your body shape forever zip and your trapped
Let me tell you about the difference in rap
And the difference is street, niggaz that creep
Bust your shit with the heat
If I find out a nigga soft and he sweet
I'm knockin 'em off their feet
Snatchin his bitch and ridin off with his Jeep

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Uh, yeah, aiyyo you frontin like you seen stacks
Deep down, you's a clown and you don't need to feed back
Hey yo, y'all niggaz need to ease back
Now how you come with your guns and your ones, and your sons like you squeeze gats
Niggaz don't believe that, and them bitches don't believe that
That's why you ride with your seat back
Niggaz don't like you, they probably put a bullet right through
ya motherfuckin chest with they rifle, niggaz livin trifle
And last year 'round this time, we did it to a nigga just like you
Lean like the Eiffel, scream on you like your wife do
Gleam on you like the ice do, I might seem like a nice dude
Even though niggaz know, got a nigga eighteen that'll knife you
Split nigga ass crack, picture we waitin on ass cap
When you could get it like the last cat, rat a tat tat

Looper,"We kept seeing Columbo's car around. First of all we saw it outside Burger King on Byres Road, badly parked- about five feet away from the kerb and at the craziest angle, as if he'd stopped there in a hurry. Then my brother saw it outside the place where the swimming pool and the badminton courts are. And later again I saw it parked outside the off-licence, closer to the pavement this time, and parallel too. We only ever saw the car parked, but it always seemed to be outside somewhere I liked to go. And then, when we went out for dinner on wee Karn's birthday and we were hanging our coats up on the coat-rack, we saw Columbo's old mac already hanging there, in amongst all the expensive fur and leather and things. I had a quick look around while we were being taken to our table, to see if he was there, but I couldn't see him anywhere.

But then one night while I was sitting outside on the steps playing my Game Boy, I heard a car stopping on the gravel in front of me. And while I tried to decide which way round to put the L-shaped Tetris piece that was falling, I felt someone sit down on the steps beside me. And I heard them scratching their head. And then, on the reflection on the screen, I saw that it was him.

""Those really are the most fascinating little machines."" he said. But I'd built up a whole high pile, which needed a single line for down the side, and I couldn't look up in case it came. ""It certainly is nice around here."" Columbo said, and I heard his mac moving as he looked around. The single line I'd been waiting for didn't come though, and soon my screen was filled all the way to the top. So I put it down and asked Columbo if someone from around here had been murdered.

""Not murdered, sir. No."" he said, ""I don't think you could call it murder."" 

""Well what are you investigating?"" I asked him.

""Well, sir, it's a case of counterfeit notes. Perhaps you'd call it theft, but I'm not rightly sure. It's new for me, I'll tell you that."" Then he picked up the Game Boy and stared at it, all fascinated. ""Could I? Would you mind?"" he said, and I showed him how to start up a game. But pretty soon the screen was full and he shook his head. ""Well, well..."" he said, ""You know, Mrs Columbo- she's great at these sorts of things. But me, I just can't seem to get the hang of them."" And he stood up and handed it back to me. ""I'm sorry to have troubled you, sir."" he said, ""I'll let you get back to your game. You know, this really is a lovely area."" And as he walked off down the steps I watched until he opened the door of his car, and I went to start up another game. But then he stopped. ""Oh, I'm sorry."" he said, holding one hand up in the air, with a cigar between his fingers, and looking down at the ground. ""Just a little thing..."" he said. And he scratched the back of his head with the hand that had been up in the air. ""With something like that, sir- that little machine you have there- would someone be able to make samples with that, from records and stuff?"" I laughed and shook my head. ""That's fine, sir."" he said, ""I was just curious."" Then he got into the car and drove away. 

I didn't think I'd see him again after that, but I was very wrong. I began to see his car around a lot more, quite often outside the houses of people I knew. And not only that, but just lately he's started turning up wherever I might be, asking me all kinds of crazy questions about technology and sampling and stuff. Pretending he's trying to learn all about it. It got me quite worried for a while, but I think I'll be alright. I think I've got him foxed. I think I've been way too clever for him...",Columbo's Car
Looper,"Drunk, and lying outside on the lawn-

Dave the Moonman.

He'd look up at the blurred stars, as the dew on the grass soaked through the back of his jacket and the back of his trousers, and then he'd look towards the moon. All that distance from the surface he was pinned down on to the surface glowing in the darkness, with nothing but space all the way in between. Nothing to hold onto. And yet, someone had managed to get there. Someone had managed to do that. A truly impossible thing. So he'd get up out of the grass, light-hearted again. It made everything else possible. Anything you could think of, anything you were stuck with, it could be done. Because that had been done. Someone had got up and gone to the moon. And nothing else was more impossible than that.

Dave the Moonman.

But sober and playing around on the internet he started to find bits and pieces, Dave the Moonman. Things about the Van-Allen Belt, and about Kodak film and dual light sources. And he talked to people who knew about similar stuff, and he read bits in magazines and books.

The first time I met him was at a party. He was surrounded by a group of people and he was giving short lectures about all the stuff he had learned, going round the party one group at a time with all the energy of someone newly-born to a religion. You had to wait your turn if you wanted him to tell you about it, so I waited my turn.

The first thing was the Van-Allen Belt, he said; an outer layer of the atmosphere that all the shuttle flights stay inside, that protects the earth from radiation. He raid somewhere that if the astronauts had really gone beyond that, and gone all the way to the moon, the radiation would have killed them soon afterwards. Then there were the photographs of the astronauts walking on the moon. He said you could tell from the shadows that the light sources were all wrong, which suggested studio lighting. And there was something about the photograph of the footprint too. If a moon boot could leave such a deep impression on the surface of the moon, then the thrust of the rocket when it was landing should have forced two big mounds up on either side of the rocket. But there are none in the pictures. 

There was a whole load of stuff. A whole load of stuff more than that. And so he was coming to believe it was a hoax, and that no-one had ever been to the moon.

I thought he had a mission, Dave the Moonman, to prove to everyone that no-one had ever landed on the moon. But that wasn't it at all. He was telling everyone all this stuff he'd learned cause he was hoping someone could prove to him it was wrong, and it wasn't just a hoax. Cause dreaming was so much harder otherwise. And it was so much harder to find the belief to get things done- lying out on the lawn at night, drunk, with the dew soaking through the back of your jacket. And all that distance between here and there. And he really wanted to believe that people had travelled to the moon in that crazy rocket, that looked as if it was made out of tin-foil and cardboard. He really wanted to believe that they'd managed to get it there, just by strapping enough fuel on, even though today you probably wouldn't trust it to get you down the shops.

Looper,"There are some days that catch the light,

Days like diamonds.

I saw a girl amongst the pillars, as I was climbing up the stairs. But just when I saw her she hid behind one of the pillars, so I went to see if I could find her. But she kept walking around the pillar at the same speed as I was walking, so that she stayed invisible. Then eventually she stopped and I caught up with her- and that was how the day began.

There are some days that catch the light,

As if someone's put a magic spell on them,

So that all of these kind of ordinary things

Seem like magic things.

We went to this pub that was very dark inside, me and this girl from amongst the pillars. And while she was telling me this story about someone's belly-button, this looper-man came up and said to me, ""Can I get in to use the phone there, unless of course you have a pigeon.""

And then we tried to get in to see a play which didn't start until the next day, and after that we queued for a different one beside a sign which said it was sold out.

We ended up at a street market, looking at curious bottles, where a woman behind a hat-pin stall mistook us for a couple in love, me and the girl from amongst the pillars. And we saw a man walking along the pavement with the most incredible moustache in the whole world, and another man rode a penny farthing along the street.

Some days are good,

They're like an adventure.

When it got dark some people were putting on a show outside, and we stood outside the fence thinking about climbing over it cause we couldn't afford to pay to get in. But just before the show began the ticket collectors moved away from the gates, and we managed to sneak in for free.

It was a great show. There were skeletons and beggars on high stilts, and they set fire to a tower they'd built while loud bells rang and sad cellos played. And then, near the end, they tied candle-lanterns to balloons and let them go up into the air. And I watched the lanterns instead of the show til they disappeared, which took a long time.

And two of the candles were still burning when they went out of sight.

Even when we not on tour I'm sleeping on the floor
Always on the road, on the couch, or with some girl I don't know
Hear myself say - I gotta go, I gotta leave, we gotta roll
a restless soul, mom I love you, promise I'll give you a call
once we checked out, sound checked, checked in the hotel room
Yeah, I know you want that same kind of perfume
off course I'll get it, get my brother on the phone
Tell grandma I'll help her with that garden stuff as soon as I'm home
We'll sit down and talk when I'm in Västerås
I don't know when, but once I'll get, I'll send you my schedule for shows
I'll call the booking right away, I'm going down to Jay in Malmoe
meet up with the guys in Gothenburg, work on the album
They say, home is where you're heart at, don't know where to start at
got loved ones all over, cross oceans and borders
I mean I love to travel, hate to fly, I want to go, but hate goodbyes
plus it's getting worse - Looptroop is on the rise
At times you'd like to press pause, no more ciaos and adios
but I'll be back in bit, now I'm out, business calls

[Chorus]
I gotta fly away. Gotta catch the train. We gotta catch the plane
but I really can't complain. We gotta fly away. Pack my bags today
We gotta ride the wave. See you in a couple of days

[Verse Two]
I'm sorry for all I'm sorrys that came too late
I'm sorry for the times that I went away
but yo, I'm still here cus my love came to stay
Remember that even though the weather is grey today
I know we had some situations and I hate to say
that I don't know the answers and how to erase the pain
Close your eyes for the things that led us astray
Then open them up towards a straighter way
All I ever wanted was to hear you say my name
Capture this second we'll forever stay the same
I take the blame for all my great escapes
there's a high price to pay for travellin´ state to state
I'm gone right now but you won't wait in vain
I'll be back before you know it to put the aches on layaway
Don't be afraid I know we'll remain ok
till I'll be back keep in touch through the radio waves

[Chorus]
Sometimes I fly away, but don't cry babe, cus you know I love you girl and
you know that you're my world. It's just you and me, that's the way we
supposed to be

[Verse Three]
You flew away like you were scared that I would clip your wings
after five years we haven't kicked it since
but straight up this ain't no pimpin' thing:
You a true queen baby only fit for kings
Maybe I couldn't see in the midst of things
now in my chain of life you're the missin' link
Just to hear your voice used to lift my chin
and I still feel the taste from when I kissed your skin
I'm looking at your picture wishing we'd click again
next time I make sure to get our shit in synch
next time I be your man through the thick and thin
I promise no more committing wicked sins
I buy you a house with a picket fence
get you everything you could give me twins
No bullshit on tour never hittin' skins
chasin' no groupies with chicken wings
Not the type to chain you between bed and kitchen sink
I merely praise the place where your lips begin
Your hips begin - I know you're quick to think:
It's pathetic, but I'd be the richest prince
if you once more unzip and let me sip your drink
Addicted to your love worse than nicotine
But there's too much pain for me to dig within
so I'm a let the music massage my crippled limbs..

and just fly away, into my hideaway
sometimes I lie awake and cry the night away
why you had to fly away?
Now you miles away
You took my smile away
why couldn't you have stayed?",Fly Away

Now I hear you dissin', frontin' and bitchin'
About: he probably wack, can't make a partytrack.
Fuck that. I pump the beat till the beast get a heartattack.
A part of rap like battlin' and all of that,
But before I kill emcees I kill the police.
I'm really for peace, love and equality,
But it seems the police love to follow me,
Because I' m hiphop. I never felt the pressure from the hype.
Not the type to give a fuck - spit it in the mike!
'Cause I never aspired to be the best of all,
Only here to inspire the rest of y'all
to stand tall. Get up, stand up for your rights.
My people know what I mean. Yeah, sure you're right!
Unite, focus on the real things in life.
Stay away from all irrelevant things like:
Who got the most dough? Who got the best flow?
Who gives a fuck when it's our turn to go? Get ready!

For when the music hits you - Get ready!
For when the judgement hits you - Get ready!
For when the truth hits you - Get ready!
For when love hits you - Get ready!
For when the people fight back - Get ready!
For when nature strikes back - Get ready!
For the Looptroop terrorists- Get ready! 
For David vs. Goliath - Get ready!

When your friends is gone who's gonna save you?
And when the money is gone who's gonna pay you?
And when you keep telling the same lies as they do,
Who's gonna believe what you say's true?
'Cause in the end when the judgement comes,
Who cares if you're a millionaire, rap star or bum?
What's that car gonna do when you lost your girl?
What's that cigar gonna do when it's war in the world?
What good is green when love is washed away?
What good is cream when happiness never come to stay?
When shit just don't seem to go your way
Who is there tellin' you everything is gonna be okay?
While you were talking about whether this or that's true,
We gave the people a voice and somebody to look up to.
I don't live and die for diamonds and ends
And I don't live and die for the four elements.
Yeah, I rap but is hip hop my life?
Who gives a fuck when millions of kids starve tonight. Get ready..

For when it's time to speak up - Get ready!
For when it's time to shut up - Get ready!
For when the world is burning - Get ready!
For when it's time to stand up - Get ready!
For when the judgement comes - Get ready!
For when the police comes - Get ready!
For when they drop the bombs - Get ready!
For when you hear the next song - Get ready!",Get Ready
Looptroop,"[Promoe:]
I write with a great vengeance
Sort of like I'm innocent, facing a death sentence
Like I might not even finish my next sentence
Like all I got left to live is ten seconds
The clock's ticking, this could be my last song
My last will if you will before I pass on
I'd like to pass on some words that'd last long
And mean something even after rap's gone
Despite all the wickedness in the wilderness
And the fact that my life kinda been a mess
If I die tomorrow, I feel no bitterness
No sorrow and not one bit of stress
I'm feeling blessed that I made it this far
My 26th year, my 14th bar
I see the sunshine, feel the bass-line
Listen to it, telling us not to waste time 'cause...

[Chorus:]
[R:] If I die tomorrow
[P:] And this was my last song, I would
[R:] Feel no kind of sorrow
[P:] Nah, I would shatter no tears, but
[R:] I'd smile at my memories
[P:] Yes I, how you feel Supreme?
[R:] And pray for my enemies
[S:] Feeling good, P

[Supreme:]
Man, tough I'm sad, I had to go and all
I'm so glad I got to know you all
Don't feel bad, I hope I told you all
We had one hell of a ride so far
If I did die (Oh Lord), no need to cry (Oh Lord)
'Cause I've been around
I've been around friends who's been around since
My story begins, seen my flaws and sins
I had the women (Loved them all)
Most the bads was my fault
Hope you forgive me and remember me by our happiest memories
I tend to be afraid to give me heart away (But you was my light)
And if it's dark today, I know you'll rise and shine someway
I went away on my way up, but that's a good way to leave
Believe me when I say, ""You made it easy being me.""
[R:] (So easy-ah)
Darling you made it easy being me
Ranto, help me out
[R:] (Uuh, so easy-ah, I want to thank you)

[Chorus]

[Supreme and Promoe:]
And mom, you taught me how to see things from the bright side
That's why my brother survived, why you and dad stayed tight
Though you divorced and broke up, now I ran out of luck
But I know you grow stronger when the going gets tough
Hope I made you proud, hope you didn't worry too much
About my drinking and drugs, it never came between us
Didn't keep no secrets, I always told you about stuff
And I know you know I love you and to me that's enough
So if I die rich and famous in the hall of fame
Or in a prison nameless with a ball and chain
Sky high above the clouds and the falling rain
Making love to my woman, hear her call my name
Or banging my head against a brick wall in pain
If the last days of my life I was called insane
It's all love 'cause it's all the same
And if I'd get a new life, nothing at all I'd change

[Chorus]

[Supreme and Promoe:]
I wouldn't undo if I could... Hell, maybe I should
But it's one life to live, one love, it's all good
Think I did okay, at least enjoyed it while it lasted
Think 'bout how we laughed, shit, I'm smiling in my casket
Though I may have caused some beefs
And indeed I regret all
May have pissed off my peeps
Best believe I won't forget y'all
When I'm chilling in hip-hop heaven or spitting burners in hell
Hope you got your health and you're at peace with yourself
Became older and wiser, I hope you toast to my name
I sit beside you guys even tough my bones in the grave
I got so much more to say but this the end of the song
So just rewind the tape and don't mind singing along
Come on!

[Chorus]

If this was the last song
And these were the last days
If the show really can't go on
Then I'm catching the train (And I'll be gone)

Looptroop,"[Verse 1]
The night was still young, she felt like a million bucks
Leaving behind the pain and the building blocks
...Blockin' the sunshine mockin' the young minds duckin' from one time
...To fly the nest and try the next
Leave it all, set out on her private quest.
Not really sure what she lookin' for, but like
She knows that there must be more to life
Too many things tryin' to control her life
Like the career that she know ain't right
Or like the boyfriend that told her lies
Or her jealous friends. Yo it's only right
That I'm gone tonight. I wasn't meant to be
Trapped like this physically and mentally
Only thing I'll miss a be my family
But I'm on the right path so don't cry for me.. Cus I'm

[Chorus]
Lookin' for love
And you are - Lookin' for love
We are all - Lookin' for love...

[Verse 2]
One love, one aim - different name, different city
Same old shitty pollution. This kid he sees no other solution
But to leave with the last train
He's tired of the fast lane and the acid rain
The massive pain that we all feel at times
But nobody else understands when we feel it. Why?
No sympathy, no empathy, no love in the city, no identities
He went to sleep. When he awoke the next day
Lookin' out the train window he sees he's halfway
To the Promised land, and face to face with a young woman
Ey, what's that song you hummin'?
It's the new Looptroop - lookin' for love or something
Oh, I ain't heard it yet. Is it hot? Yeah, bumpin'
Can I hear it? Alright. Exchanging looks
Listen, it's just coming up to the hook.. and I'm

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The night was still young, their lives were still young
And who knows - they just might fulfil one
And others' needs over this butter beat
It's a bitter sweet little lovers' theme
Cus some find love around the corner
Some never find it though they travel the four corner
Of the earth, but for what it's worth
I'm sure it's out there - I'll continue to search.. cus I'm

When we first met
That's the time I remember so well

We were two passing strangers
Who would know what we know now
Just two hearts reaching out for each other

And my heart was falling in love

Outside my window pane
It still had me falling in love

But when the camera's off, you be actin' soft

But everywhere around the gates people saying that ya fake
Like dropping out of weight while you're trying to have your cake
But ya jams ain't got no weight and many niggas won't debate

Down with the Liks, Jump straight from the bass onto the kicks
Non-freestylin' MC's fall straight down in the pits
My name be Jack, spontaneous freestylist when I catch wreck

So I take it to the max, take out Fake-Funkin' Jacks
Get to the point as I rock over Madlib bumpin' tracks
""You used to get busy at open mics?"" Nah, I still do
I kill crews, lyrically, spiritually, yo I will do
Anything it takes to bring be	-boy style back
And the thanks for you to make ya say my rhyme style's phat
But I'll die before these wack MC's infect these

But if Wildstyle dies before Wild Child wakes
I pray to God to step down and take out all them fake

My direction takes course of a fraudulent, fake endorserer

Dejar un día esta ciudad
Cruzar el mar en tu compañía
Pero ya hare tiempo que me has dejado
Y probablemente me habrás olvidado
No sé que aventuras correré sin ti
Y ahora estoy aquí sentado
En un viejo Cadillac segunda mano
Junto al Marbellí
A mis pies mi ciudad
Y hare un momento que me ha dejado
Aquí en la ladera del Tibidabo
La última rubia con quien iba a probar
El asiento de atrás
Quizás el Martini me ha hecho recordar
Nena, porqué no volviste a llamar
Creí que podía olvidarte sin más
Y aún a ratos ya ves
Y al irse la rubia me he sentido extraño
Me he quedado solo fumando un cigarro
Me ha sentenciado, nostalgia de ti
Y desde esta curva donde estoy parado
Me he sorprendido mirando a tu barrio
Me han atrapado luces de ciudad
El amanecer me sorprenderá
Dormido, borracho, en el Cadillac
Bajo las palmeras, dulce Y solitario
Y dice la gente que ahora eres formal
Y yo aquí borracho en el Cadillac
Bajo las palmeras, dulce Y solitario
Y no estás tú ¡¡Nenaaaa!

When she was nine years old
She had a little trouble
Doing what she was told

Not your typical yes ma'am, no ma'am child
It was her life and she was gonna live it
And if it took her heart and soul
She was gonna give it

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge

Love is the teacher
Life is the school
And she figured it out one fateful day
That if she played it safe she would never play
And in that moment hearts dream about
A girl walked in and a woman walked out

Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge

Lord Finesse,"Chorus:
(Mad brothers know his name) (Yeah, it's him again)  Repeat 4x

Lord Finesse got something for your eardrums
Back on the scene, long time, no hear from
It's the funky man, the brother with the same sound
I've been coolin about a year and some change now
So hand over the microphone cause it's my turn
The brother with a fade, half-moon, and long sideburns
Nice, dope, and keep the girls scoping
Say the funky shit and get all the niggas open
So heed that, don't try to yap and give me feedback
I'll get in that ass, believe that
Can it, I'll steal your show like a bandit
I get papes while you're broke like mass transit
You're not as smooth as this, so what can you do with this
Brothers need to stop and step with that foolishness
I'm the type to interrupt a party
I don't need a phone to reach out and touch somebody
Gimme a mic, it's just as good as one
Leave the party is what you wack MC's should of done
Cause y'all starving, I'm living extra large and
I'm swinging shit as if my name was Tarzan
Yeah, cause I'm on some old new shit
Got more styles than you see in a Kung Fu flick
Mic the seas, wax opponents off with ease
I'm more deadly than a venerial disease
So think twice, those who think Imma fall
I'm shining more than a tire full of Armor All
It's Lord Finesse and I got shit planned
Hot damn, it's the Return of the Funky Man

Chorus

Brothers get cash, but I get way more
In the 90's, I'm getting paid for
Rhyme and envy, 21st century
When asked, ""Who's the funkiest?"" You better mention me
I go all out while a lot of crews be fronting
I know and they know that they can't do me nothing
Cause I'm smooth and wise, the skills I utilize
Lyrics all advanced you'd think my brain was computerized
So who needs a partner or a sidekick?
When it comes to being funky, I got all that old fly shit
The rough and rugged, plus the pimp smooth rhyme
I polish opponents off like a shoe shine
They be fronting like they on the crazy tip
Trying to hang but they softer than baby shit
Fronting like they wild with they bullshit style
I'll put they ass on trial, pull they card and they file
I'm hardcore, but I still keep the scene pumping
So all that singing and dancing, that shit don't mean nothing
MC's suffer Lord Finnese lately
Some of them hate me, think that they can take me
I'll take on some of them, bring a whole ton of them
I'll take em all on and stomp each and every one of them
I just chill, relax and flaunt my cash
You want to riff, I'll be quit to stomp that ass
And let you know that you can't get with this
Come one come all and get burnt by the quickness
Greater, creator, drop stupid data
If I ever got served it had to be by a waiter
I lounge in the rest until my song is done
I plan to be straight with papes in the long run
Cause when it comes to rhymes I give you more than you ask for
Bring a whole task force, I rhyme my fucking ass off
I stand in command with the mic in my hand
Aw shit, it's the Return of the Funky Man

Chorus

Stand back, I'm about to flip here
Got dissed last year so I kick ass this year
Brothers were stressing me, strictly overworking me
(They showed you last year)  Yeah, that fits perfectly
Cool, cause I'm still kinda fed with them
Who gives a fuck, I'm about 20 steps ahead of them
Now I'm established, they feel all embarrassed
Cause I'm with Warner Brothers and my man Gary Harris
Spread the news or should I say buzz?
(Finesse is paid!) Thought I wasn't when I was
The last label was confusing me, jerking me, fooling me
Now that I'm paid, you know what y'all can do for me
Since I sound funky a lot of labels want me
But I'll be damned to be another man's flunky
I can never be a stool pidgeon, I'd rather be a full pidgeon
Fuck the bullshitting
Cause in the 90's I got more than a little game
I'm Lord Finesse and funky is my middle name
Plus my title and everyone wants mine
It's the brother with the compounds and punchlines
I can still put my foot all in your ass
I'm smooth and funky plus smoother than Teddy Pendergrass
It's the man to put words in a simile
(He's a funky technician) Yeah, y'all remember me
I'm real and actual, the man out taxing you
I got rhymes and Mike got a scratch or two
So ain't no use trying to eat us for din-din
Brothers better off trying their luck with Win-Ten
To the opposition: I'm the man out burning ya
I dust a rapper off like furnature
So take our stand, I foil your plan
Goddamn, it's the Return of the Funky Man

Don't font on me, I read your whole card like a psychic

I'm real like the Son Of Sam while other are soft like Richie Gun-In-Hand
Their styles is outdated like the _Running Man_
A tough vet, I'm the roughneck that drops logic
The hefty solid, prophet from the projects
The spiritual, the lyrical, individual
(No doubt, kid) Yeah, the Lord works miracles
I hustle for mine like those pumpin cracks
I got thumpin raps that'll have you niggas doin jumpin jacks
I come with the fat songs, put me on any platform

A top cat that rocks rap

The Asiatic rap fanatic that don't have it
My style's tighter than a virgin locked in traffic
You get ripped like a cardboard

I'm so devine when I flow and rhyme

Be on some hip-hop shit, cause the music like hypnotic

Till the slayings leave abrasions, hot like cajun
Trails be blazin behind this chinky-eyed non-Asian
Female bringin it to ya like e-mail
With advanced techniques off these New York streets

But then it, really wouldn't matter to a nigga
You figure you have to sneak up cause I'm bigger
Yo jigga, take down the beat just a little
Far from brittle, chew a nigga like a skittle
But it'll, be a cold day in the Caribean
At the Meridian, I swim through girls like an amphibian
I'm witty and, versed with the lyrical blessin
Never fessin, and keep the chickens second-guessin
Known for stressin engineers in my session
I flake in one take, and slide like Wesson
So learn a lesson, I make the episode brief

Try to spark this, you'll get torn, cause you never win

Leave up to my seed, teach him that he gotta bleed
Don't fall victim to greed
That you give is what you're blessed with
Find it, put it to use, have faith and don't stress shit
Meanwhile I hit the ganja, now watch it kiss my lips
Bless it, then pass it, like Magic's top 10 assists
It's the cheeba-cheeba, another neighborhood news feature
Who can see the, Giant? Not a known creature
Or being alive that can see me on this rap vibe
High off of hip-hop, can't die, I got cat lives
Abuse this, get smuddered is how you'll be discovered
Give me 20 years in here with no dough, I still love it
It's in my heart, when I bled, it was red
Won't stop till I drop dead, or catch some led to my head
Some search for bread, loot, cheese, or whatever

Since you finishin em early, what posessed you to start him?
We made a vow later we'll regret til death do us part

You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded wonderin why
Cryin, pourin out my heart, pourin out liquor behind it

Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial

To straight breakin down and showin all emotions

Lord High Fixers,"I've been crying
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby

Sometime's up
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (Come see about me)
See about you baby (Come see about me)
You know I'm so lonely (Come see about me)
I love you only (Come see about me)
See about your baby (Come see about me)

Lord Huron,"How long have I known you, brother
Hundreds of lives, thousands of years
How many miles have we wandered
Under the sky, chasing our fear

Some kind of trouble is coming
Don't know when, don't know what
I will stand by you, brother
'Til the daylight comes or I'm dead and gone

I've shared my life with you, brother
Since I recall, you've been my friend
You say we're not like the others
Still we must die, all things must end

I know we can't stop what's coming
But I will try, oh how I'll try!
Will you fight with me, brother
One last time, one last fight

Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers 'til the end
Don't run away, our time will come but not today

Wanna be the first to arrive

Where the great waves break
And the night runs right into the day
I wanna be with the ones I left
But I'm way out west
And the years keep on slipping away
I wanna run on the sacred dunes
Through the ancient ruins
Where the fires of my ancestors burned
I remember that fateful day
When I ran away
And you told me I couldn't return

You made me swear I'd never forget
I made a vow I'd see you again
I will be back one day, and I'll find you
There by the great big lake

Trying to flee that life
But I can't seem to leave it behind
Wanna visit the windswept shores
Of a time before
When the moon and the stars were aligned
I remember the bright spring day
When you sparked that flame
And a fire that continues to burn
I remember the day I left
Headin' way out west
When you told me to never return

You made me swear I'd never forget
I made a vow I'd see you again

You've been in the wind, you've been on my mind
You are the purest soul I've ever known in my life

Take your time, let the rivers guide you in
You know where you can find me again
I'll be waiting here 'til the stars fall out of the sky

When you left I was far too young
To know you're worth more than the moon and the sun
You are still alive when I look to the sky in the night

I would wait for a thousand years
I would sit right here by the lake, my dear
You just let me know that you're coming home
And I'll wait for you

Years have gone but the pain is the same
I have passed my days by the sound of your name
Well they say that you're gone and that I should move on
I wonder: how do they know, baby?

Death is a wall but it can't be the end
You are my protector and my best friend
Well they say that you're gone and that I should move on

Lord Huron,"Minor changes and grammar I land on an island coast
Where the only souls I see are ghosts
I run through a wooded isle
And I chase the sunlight mile after mile
And I feel like I know this place
As the tree line breaks into wide-open space
I stare at a bright red sun
Though I search all day, I never find anyone

I walk on a winding road
In the deep of the night, near the edge of the known
I pass by a moonlit lake
And a cold wind blows and my bones start to shake
And I feel I should know this place
As the road winds on into wide-open space
The wind plays a haunting tone
As I make my way through the night all alone

I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I've got no friends
Just the rocks and the trees in my lonesome dreams
And a road that don't never end
I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I'm on my own
What am I destined to be? It's a mystery baby
Just please don't leave me alone

I lie under starlit sky
And the seasons change in the blink of an eye
I watch as the planets turn
And the old stars die and the young stars burn
But I don't really know this place,
And it's lonesome here in the wide-open space
Can it be as real as it seems?
Maybe this time I won't wake from the dream",Lonesome Dreams
Lord Huron,"You arrive along with the sun
Where have you been darlin'? What have you done?
You were out finding trouble again
There's a fire in your eyes and there's blood on your hands

Come inside and lie down to sleep
You ain't gonna run and you know that you're beat
Rest awhile, they're coming for you
There's a price to be paid for the things that we do

Fall asleep and forget all your troubles
Dream of laughter and old friends and lovers
Dream of when you were innocent
Dream forever

Trying to keep my eyes open wide
I'd gone days without any rest
Saw him lying in the road looking bad about 20 yards ahead
You come back from a trip to the east
But you don't come back from the dead

Sure as hell he was dead as they come
And he was already starting to smell
Just a kid with his hair slicked back
And a knife tucked into his belt
Was he unforgiven or just tired of living a life
That never felt like his?
Though I was was worn and weary, I thought I'd bury him
And lay his soul to rest out in the desert night

I laid him down in a grave in the sand
And he grabbed my arm with his dead man's hand
He said: ""I know I'm dead but I don't wanna lie
In a grave out here where the coyote's cry

I stared right into the endless void
And I ain't going back if I got any choice
I know how to live, I don't know how to die
And there ain't no thrills in the afterlife

So lift me up out of here my friend

On the night you disappeared
Oh, if I had seen you clear

There was no one else in sight

But I wonder how they know, cause they don't die if they don't grow

I am ready to follow you even though I don't know where
I've been waiting the night until you decide to take me there

Cause I know I don't wanna stay here forever it's gotta be moving on
Oh, I don't wanna be the only one living if all of my friends are gone

And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

What if we're unmade when the stars fade?

I've been running through life and cruising toward death
If you think that I'm scared you've got me wrong
If you don't know my name, you'll know it now
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
There are many more flames when mine is gone
They will build me no shrines and sing me no songs

I'm a long way from the one that I loved
I've been tending old flames, lamenting what was
Drifting in a land time forgot
If you think that I've changed, you know me not
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
I been unraveling since my birth
Gonna wander out there and see what I'm worth

Find me way out there
There's no road that will lead us back
When you follow the strange trails
They will take you who knows where
If I found a way to stay with you tonight
It would only make me late, for a date I can't escape

I was the man that I wanted to be
I had a place where I lay my head
They burnt it to the ground and the sky turned red

I had a life and a place in the world
I had a sweet talkin’ wife and a beautiful girl
I know I’m never gonna see 'em again
Gonna tear the world up until I have my revenge

They took my life but it isn’t the end
They put me in the ground but I’m back from the dead

Oh I'm the World Ender baby and I'm coming for you
They put me in the ground but I’m back from the dead
Oh I'm the World Ender baby and I'm coming for you
They put me in the ground but I’m back from the dead

You'll hear me howl by the light of the moon
That's how you'll know that I'm coming for you
Gonna find you alone in the dark of night
When the World Ender comes better run for your life

I’ll never bleed and I won’t ever age
I’ll never feel the embrace of the grave
The fair and the brave and the good must die
I seen the other side of living, I know heaven's a lie
I’ll tear through the night, and I'll raise some hell
'Cause I'm the World Ender, baby and I'm back from the dead

Lord knows I should be pushing daisies
I was 6 feet down, but something raised me up
Sent back for to lift my curse
I’m gonna get me a taste of some chaos first
Untied, gonna get little wild
Go screaming through the dark like a demon child
Close your eyes now, the light is fading
And the noise in the night is gonna get a little louder, baby

I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m back from the grave
They can run for their lives but they cannot be saved
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m coming for them

They just lie there, and they die there

Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz,"New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my fa-mi-ly roam
Hoe damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat...
... splat, like Deja Vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her
and beat her, niggaz in the Bronx call me Lex
cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
and I lounge on Lex', and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul 
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't time to fold, ho

Chorus: Peter Gunz, Lord Tariq (two parts)

But outta town niggaz is all the same
Brooklyn niggaz get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggaz know how to play
Mack the 600, gettin crazy pay
Niggaz outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the glock, runnin up in yo' spot

Yo, the RM-80, is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked
For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around
thinking shit's gravy; stop me? Maybe
I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments
on them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Ri-carro, two quarters of my life
walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by
Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharoahe, bought a new five
with the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo
Keep my toast closer than most niggaz keep they own shadow
and I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggaz rock gravel
Talk shit? Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview
Bronx most wanted, front get confronted
Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded
With the Bronx it's a warnin, stormin guns out
From, Dusk Til Dawn and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about
And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house
cause youse a small-time nigga, bout a half an ounce now

On the streets of the Bronx where my fa mi ly roam

But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat...

Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged 
Anything less than that, you keep the change 
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke 
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope 
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife 
'Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife 
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her 
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her 
And beat her, niggaz in the Bronx call me Lex 
'Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex 
And I lounge on Lex', and I love sex

In '98 I blasted out in the phat 420

I get a lotta love  lotta hate 

Yes that's the bet you make when you see a lotta cake 

Now they calling me fake 

Shit back they was calling me love 

Now they're scratching up my car and calling me blood 

See it be the ones you know scheming on the low 

Saying you're dope but steady sizing up your Rol' 

I drift, to the past where there's no riches 

No hits and no chips and no bitches 

Just another cat named Peter 

Trying to make a dollar off a nine millimetre 

Now life a little sweeter 

I'm in the dealer

Caught a case mom expects me to cop out

The Bronx was the shit but we all hung in Harlem 

Where gettin money's easy spending it was the problem 

And I cop 16 valves foot is on the pedal 

Telling bitches this your last chance to get out the ghetto 

For less I wouldn't settle 

Think big you get big 

Came across the wrong niggas almost split my wig 

Some say I bitched up because I switched up and started rapping 

But I'm turning gold crack sales to drugs raps platinum

Never prayed 'cause I never seen, and I was never with
Kneelin' on my knees, just thankin' Jesus
For stuff that I received when I wasn't receivin'

Thanks for the food that's gone

Thanks for the clothes that ya sent me

I want to thank you for my brother smokin' crack
I also want to thank you for my cousin gettin' shot in his back

I want to thank you for my friends that's gone
I mean they all under thirty right, but life goes on
I want to thank you for my moms being sad
Thanks for the house with the swimming pool I never had

I want to thank you for my Uncle Bill, smart enough to get his PhD
He got HIV
I want to thank you for my pops, what a joke
Work hard all of his life and got nothin' to show

I want to thank you for the lives that you moved
I also want to thank you for the cancer that you gave E-Smooth

Am I gonna see him or see you?
Give me a clue, tell me what to do
Will you open the gates or am I through

I seen a lot of bad, never had reason to believe
Now I simply thank you for this air that I breath

Yo, you know people used to say this kid's really crazy
That religion and forgivin' church stuff never fazed me

Johova's witness says he witnessed, but he never seen
What he seeks is forever green, and he forever fiend
I used to hit the mas now and then
Me and X used to bill with these guys that was five percent

But see, one thing I learned in life being hard
Is no matter who you serve in life, there's one God
Whether you're black or white, Chinese, Japanese
You breath the same air I breath, bleed the same blood I bleed

That's why I'm sayin' you're wrong
If you're sayin' my song is blasphomy, just ask of me
I got God in me just like an artery
If I offended you then pardon me

The things I seen in life hardened me
Want to treat the next man like a slave
And go to church shoutin', holy ghostin' and
Claimin' you're saved

Then you think because the offer that you gave, you forgivin'
But you better fix the life that you're livin'
You want to be God-filled, steady sinnin', change your ways
'Cause you know it's really money that you praise

It's time to wake up, drop yo' blunt and put away the beer
'Cause I'm feelin' like the last days is here

And I'm boning powder-forming transform into a rock

Might take your son's life in the middle of the night

Chopped down a hundred packs for hundred stacks
And I'm sold through a hole through the wall
I'm controlling you all
So who am I?
My pipe game is wicked
And an hour get you by and it can be kinda fitted
Who am I?
I might last for five minutes, but that's all right
Because that 25 Mitch will get you high all night
So who am I? I'm born to kill blacks
And I'm made in the U.S. I'm known as crack

That hang around Bloods and Crips
Mostly found around your drugs and whips
Find me in a artery

While your lying there leaking looking at Lord saying ""soddy""

But 9 out of 10 I pierce through many chests
Colorblind, hell if I'm not like fuck it
Kids and ladies and even babies kick the bucket

Seven I pop, there'll be a lotta niggas dropping
Majority, minority die when I fuck
But I mean I'm just a bullet and I don't give a fuck

Now you can catch me but can't kill me
Try to scare but you can't feel me

In the year 2010
Probably be the end
I just spread around the world and I do it again

Yo, I seen you eat cla**y in the block
In your silver 320
No ten, flashing to the world

You got a few pennies
With an S cla** face 
And a slight beige complexion
Givin' me memories 

Of you and me sexin'
So I stepped in
Less than a minute or so
I saw your eyes on my six

'Yo, get in we go'
Her s*** is good
Yeah I know
Because I hit it before

But it's the warmth 
That's got me still feelin' this ho
I'm offer her the world
And ya still politely tellin' me 'No'

You cuttin' it short
Said 'you didn't like me sellin' that blow'
I only do what I know
These streets raised me

Pays me
Put you in my life
It's all gravy
Maybe a trip to the Allen's'

While in the sun
And you ask
'Why should I?'
'You be smilin' for one' (huh)

I gets the job done
In more ways than one
Grow old and maybe raise a son
So, let me know, huh?

[Chorus: x2]
What's it gonna take to get next to you?
Tell you some good s*** and have sex with you
Sure you want to know about me shady
And I'd love it if you'd be my lady

Shorty, I remember back
When I seen you with your crew
And they was hatin' cottonblock 
'Cause they knew I wanted you

They would tell you that
I dog girls and all the s***
And you was just another chick I wanted to hit
And it was true

I ran through many thinkin'
Love any
And the thug in me
Dog many

But now I see my playin' days is over
I'd like to take this time out
To finally get to know ya
A lot of things I want to show ya

You say you're not impressed with my money and fame
And it's crazy how you say I make my money in vain
'Cause I talk about guns and drugs
Hoes and thugs

Don't ya know that your music shows no love?
But I rap what I see
But is this whole tree the clown cat that you see
And the ka-chap in me?

We can sit in the six 
And make plans 
And talk about the steps I gotta take
Honey, to be your man

Come on

Come on, babe
Come on, baby
I said come on, girl

The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood

I'm sick of words that hang above my head
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free

Be a part of the love club

You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill make it too ill
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want
Except to be alone

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member go on your great adventure again
They will be waiting at the end

I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing and love it

And everything works out so good

Bruising the sun, I feel grown up with you in your car

Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue

They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone
We're alone

Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us
Or maybe people are jerks

When people are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it

They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone,
We're all alone
We're all alone

I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we're all get still
When people are talking, people are talking
Get still

When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it

Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone

Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison

Into the arms of the girl that I love

She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands

In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek

Eating me alive until you're gone

It's all there in the fee

For better or for worse and you don't care which
The devil is a loser and he's my bitch
Runnin' into trouble you skitch

You wanted riches and license to kill
You got poverty and then you got ill
You got poor and you lost your will
All your dreams unfulfilled
I get my kicks when you blow your fuse
No-one got killed but that's no excuse
Hands up, I let you know when it's done
I've got the only gun

Just failing guarantees
Confess your sins, son

Lost are the lambs with no guiding light

The walls come down like thunder
The rocks about to roll
It's The Arockalypse

All we need is lightning
With power and might
Striking down the prophets of false
As the moon is rising
Give us the sign
Now let us rise up in awe

Rock 'n roll angels bring thyn hard rock hallelujah

Thou shall be saved
Brothers and sisters keep strong in the faith
On the day of Rockoning
It's who dares, wins
You will see the jokers soon'll be the new kings

Lordi,"This is an SCG3 Special Report with Sam Romero.

""Good evening, I'm Sam Romero. We continue our special rapport now on the so-called monster invasion. As of eleven AM today, the president has declared the nation to be under Marshall law. Reports coming in now indicate that mass hysteria continues to spread throughout the globe. It is not yet confirmed by officials what is causing these horrific events, but it is suggested by certain sources that these creatures that are now being spotted throughout the world, are neither human... nor are they wild animals. It is strongly advised that people should stay indoors and if you encounter one of these beings, do NOT try to make contact with them... They will attack without warning! Our very own William Tracey in the sky is now reporting.

Will?
Sam! We're here hovering over down-town
where the monsters are litterly swarming the city!
The freeways are glocked
There is absolutely no way out of down-town.
These creatures, they are incredibly strong.
A few minutes ago we saw one actually pick up an SUV and throw it in a clump of people.
And then, zoom in on that, yeah.
Are we getting that? It's actually looking at us!
It's, it's climbing. It's
No, pull up, pull up, pull up!

[Sam:] Will? Ehm, we seem to be suffering from technical difficulties. We'll get back to William Tracy as soon as we get the satellite feed repaired. Hm... In the meantime, we now go live to Joan Carr at the Hellbender Plaza. Joan?...
[Joan:] Sam! I'm standing here with thousands of citizens. The first thing that greeted us when we drove up was the smell of decomposing flesh! The dead are litterly walking the streets! Aah... Even though the people know about the curfew, there is absolutely no trace of police or the military yet. It's understandable that the people feel the urge to get out of their homes and go look for their loved-ones. They don't know what to do and how to cope with all of this. Aah... Something is happening. Eehmm... Oh my God! RUN!!!
[Yelling]
[White noise]

[Sam:] We ehm... seem to be experiencing some more technical difficulties with Joan as well, so... Ehm... I'm just being told that someone is infiltrating our broadcasts. Eh... Are we going off the air?..

[Strange monster voice / Dee Snider:] Good evening, you puny little humans. Don't try to adjust your sat's, we control the transmission. Your deminion of the earth has gone on far too long. You've had your chances, you've blown them all! Now it's time to cut the bullshit. You are a plague! We are forced to take disciplinary action. Behold the sounds that will grind your insides, the sights that will make you blind. Your walls of iron will bend and the seas will run red with your blood. The earth will quake and open its fuming maw swallowing all the heretics and fools on the wide path to hell. The skies will open with a thunderous raw! My little pets will fly out in swarms that will block the sun. They will kiss the flesh off the bones of those who still choose to follow the false prophets. Join us or forever drown in the pit of despair. The Scartic Circle Gathering is now. This is the day of reckoning. This is...

Since you're giving me the silent treatment
Though I know there's something eating you and you're got my ear with that you do

I think there is hope for what we share
Since we can't seem to black out something
'Cause in the wake of love, this everlasting love
One can't seem out to black out something

What the hell is wrong with you, is there anything going through
'Cause now you're leaving all the innocence away
'Cause even with a broken clock is right at least twice a day
So I guess it's fine for you to start thinking

I've had this problem since I was a kid
I used to look up to my Auntie Marie
Because she had big tits hanging down to her knees

I looked like a faggot, a vamp in 3-D

Not long did I wait to catch the first guy

""If you want your man to drown in your lust,
You must, you must, increase your bust.""

Always skipping school, I was really wild
My poor old dad, he went insane
'cause of his little bitch and her love with pain
So my daddy, he spanked my butt
He turned me into his super spanky slut
I begged him for his mercy with tears in my eyes
He didn't know that he just showed me paradise
Then I met my boyfriend, he was almost 85
Crawling on the floor he knew all about life
I was feeling horny and just couldn't resist
I had to have him beat me with his manly fist
I started bleeding badly, love at first strike
Since that romantic moment I crawled by his side
But just the other day I hit him right back

Lords of Acid,"One of Satan's strongest demons is so evil, 
It is known as The Unholy
The Unholy may remain on earth out of hell, 
So long as no-one resists its temptations.
The Unholy kills the sinner in the act of sinning 
And sends another soul to hell!
The Unholy drives on purity, on priests and virgins.

Can I come and visit - I'll be at your house tonight
They tell me it's soft to touch and really smooth
I can hardly wait to feel that pussy too
You wanna play with pussy all the time
To hide that kinda pussy is a crime
You say your pussy's clever and so slick
But I think that your pussy's kinda sick

I wanna bet your pussy ain't as pretty as mine
I don't hide my pussy like you do all the time
My pussy's just the sweetest thing that you've ever seen
Compared to mine your pussy's really ugly and mean
I bring my pussy everywhere I go
To watch my little pussy is a show
You say your pussy's clever and so slick
But I think that your pussy's really thick

She turns into a tiger when she's ready to eat
My pussy's always hungry for a big chunk of meat
So lay your little pussy right next to mine
You can bring her over round dinnertime
My pussy is the hippest thing around
She's always been the talk of the town
You say your pussy's clever and so slick
But I think that your pussy's mighty thick (miauw, baby)

I wanna see your pussy show it to me
Let me see your pussy show it to me
Show me your pussy show it to me
I wanna pet your pussy show it to me",Pussy

Boom shaka laka yo here comes the Chief Rocka
Rock it down, so jump up off the tip you're not my nucca
For sharper type to battle make the people say ooh ah
Think I won't curse, I'll break down and say puta
Hey, madrigon, sesa me bichafi mi chocha?
Say what I want because, I'm that type of guy
Now fam-a-lam, I'll be damned, slam jams the weak
Could it be the skunk weed that makes us oh so funky?
Now hold it let me choose, couldn't be the booze
No it's the shoes (the shoes) It's gotta be the shoes!
'Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock
so I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock
To tell you the truth, when on the mic
I'll say anything that sounds good
Like jump and a grump and sound over some uh?
The Cat in the Hat and the mouse ran up the stairs
""That doesn't make no sense!"" c'mon who cares?
See even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin' to knock me
I say what I want to say, as long it sounds funk
Some MC's wanted to buy me, so they try to take stands
But they don't understand, I'm the motherfuckin' man
I amaze and astound, rhythm up and down
Smack a group of them around, let them know who wears the crown
Who's-the-tip-of-the-top, the-cream-of-the-crop, the-best-under-the-sun?
I'm the Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Mr Funke, uh

Well um, boom, shak-a-lak, I got the flavors, the funk
Whew! And it's smellin' up the hip-hop
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
Mixed a, little of this, and now I gotta rap
I'm the, Chief Rocka, so I guess I am in charge
I freak it with a twist so you'll boom it in your cars
I'm the, one with the flow and the grip like GI Joe
I snatch, I grab, and then I grab the dough, see if
I was an Indian I'd still be the Chief
The only other difference I'd smoke weed in a leaf
To the hip, the hop, to the hibby to the hibbidy
hip-hop, oh no, I don't want to go pop!
I got, too much soul, rhythm and blues
R&B ya see, all that's cool, but
hip-hop and rap yeah that's where my heart's at
Even back when I used to break on a box
Backspins for backspin, even while I'm rappin'
Before I had a record, I always kept 'em clappin
Freestylin on the block, now I Chief Rock
I always entertain, by diggin in my crux
My brain, so if it's gonna rain let it rain
I spook you with the hit, make you jump like House of Pain

through the block, and don't forget to boom shak shak-a-lak
Well damn ""Do It All"" can I rock?
I hear a beat I grab the mic, and then I start this workin'
The kids around the way used to think that I was buggin
But they don't understand how I feel about the funk
I walk with the funk, I talk with the funk
I eat with the funk, I sleep with the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

Lords of the Underground,"[Mr. Funkee]
The year is 1971. Now comes the first of the children of Roton.
Lords of the Underground witness the brith of the funky child,
Doitall, hit 'em!

[Doitall]
Born with the funk from the womb of Brenda
See I likes the Lords but you used to dig The Spinners
First with the style from the birth canal
And now I got the flav to make the crowd go wild
Do dig it (screams) Ooh watch me kick it
I'm taking no shorts unless this ?girl from my midget?
I packs the piece more than chicken packed grease
I'm nearly knocking boots, but if not I'll knock teeth
Wahh! Gaga, ooh cries the baby
Smacked on the ass now the Doitall's crazy
No rattles or playpens, the crowds what I'm rapping
And yes I do Reruns, as if this boy was happening
Now January 14th has birthed the funk one
The D-Day for Dupree and yes I'm funk-ay
I got you bobbing to the funky style
K-Def let 'em know here comes the funky child

[K-Def]
Yeah, born in the underground of Newark, now witness the birth of Mr. Funkee

[Mr. Funkee]
The fifth of the terror, it's the return of Funky Kreuger
A.K. Anger, but yo that's Mr. Funkee Wallbanger
Concieved in the fire by you warned through disaters
The funky child was taught to the ways of the masters
Mr. Funkee, yes girl the black mack is back
Here to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that
You can work kid you know, you could practice all your life
But I still take the show and then I go home with the wife
Oh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy
I hurdle over rappers just like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Watch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do
Make you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?) Uncle (Who?)
When I was younger I used to sing with my sister
Now I kick the ill styles you have to call me mister
Cooling in the House of Hits, time to buckwild
Raised in the ways of the funky child

	(Funky child) (Funky funky style)  (Scratched by Lord Jazz 6x)

[Doitall]
Well um, back up baby, here come the schooler
We're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' roller
I'm caught in the swinging, hear no ties by the Pendulum
Just ???, so this is how I'm killing them
K is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technique
Marley's on the mix and now the Lords have a hit like POW!
Now it's time to get buckwild
And watch my funky brothers freak the underground
In a second, or minute, in no times flat
(Flatline noise) Bring it back
And go grab the album to give the Lords money
Take it home to mom to say ""Ain't they funky?""

[Mr. Funkee]
We gone psycho and everbody thought they did was styles
They didn't affect me, I said ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes
I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow
I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on (And it's on)
Don't worry not for other crews selling out
As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground
The brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness
Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business
You might say ""Damn, Mr. Funkee's throwing out""
But if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about
Any props you receive are the props that you earn
I'm off till the funky child returns",Funky Child

Give me the mic and watch me wax that ass *horn sample*
Keep the camera moving cause I'm kinda fast *horn sample*
You can trip, you can flip, you could even slip or dip
but you'll never ever rip, Funke style as good as this
Because you sound like you're drugged, you might as well be a singer
Your whimsy couldn't touch me if your name was Sticky Fingaz
So when I come around, don't try to be down, don't try to be down
Just dig the sound, cause here comes the Lords of the Underground

(Here Come the Lords) 7X

[DoItAll]
Well umm, open up the doors and yell, Here Come the Lords
Yell it loud yell it loud, let me hear it from a crowd

And love to hear the girls go OOH when I'm rockin
So catch it, no stutter in my flow but I wrecks it
And caught you on the dillz from my jam called _Check It_
Check it check it check it check it microphone check it
Yeah, you went wild, cause your moms digs my records
So come on, I'm takin you where the sun don't shine
The underground, but everything is fine

Your vocal chords'll get CRACKED, you gets no chloraseptic
So hit em, so chill, chill man chill
I know who used to be but now who's _Top Bill_
Well it's me, and yes, I am back by the Funke
Marley filled the House with Hits so you know The Lords are chunky

Lords of the Underground,"Verse One:

Well, I'm gonna creep through your area with steps that are slowly
Camoflauged and in black so niggas they don't know that
While niggas givin hi's I'm givin goodbye's
I'm still shooting persons out the corners of my eyes
But brothers know nothin and ain't seen nothin
But best yet the fest when I leave knots in their stomachs
So who want to have a little shindig with me?
Well, bro, you got it, until the return of Funky
'cause I'm that brother who was born in the under
And if you don't believe that then go ask my mutha
'cause when it gets hot I ignite what I got
Just to let you know that I blow up the spot

[CHORUS]

Verse 2:

I have an attitude that's shitty but don't need no pity
'cause all I want to do is get down to the nitty
So watch every move as I step up on this groove
My voice is filled with madness, and not ment to sooth
Say the name Doitall, say it backwards [llatiod]
Say it one more time and I'll appear by your side
My voice'll drop a measure and your ears'll feel the pleasure
You'll here my tongue lashing because my tongue is like leather
Now I be from the land where the crooks be grand
And the boys grow up to be the Stickyfinger man
Now I got you straight from the block known to rock you
But just like I got you some day you want the Do
I smell a sniff, can it be the Funkyman approachin?
Well I'ma keep roastin on behalf of the Lords
I swear to my G, I have unity, my crew have unity and this is me
Now who be I when I be that fly guy from NJ?
Some say Doitall, but my real name is Dupre
The ghetto type heart is sparked by the horror
I creep at the corner while you search for tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, they love me tomorrow 
Words I usually hear 'cause I have hip-hop by the collar
Underground the meaning:  below, beneath
That's what they think of us rhymin on these beats
Rap music - can't hear it, peep it, or speak it
That's why a Grammy, I'll probably never see it
So who in the public does the Doitall trust?
The Lords, the Lord, until my heart busts
So remember, L.O.T.U.G. is forever
You dis one, you dis the other
You dis the other, you dis the under
And you don't ever want to dis the under.

I'll always rock a crowd
So (um) peace to my area, n.w.k.
Which is scarier
So if your on the deals,
Who cares, the more the merrier
Now right off south orange
On the block of one-nine
Of course, thirteenth ave
Is my stomping grounds
I open up my chest
And to my 'hood give my heart
'cause without the heart
Then your 'hood falls apart
So respect to the cement
The park called ""the corner""
'cause that's where the doitall two was performing
Runnin' from the cops
I couldn't be stopped
'cause I was jumpin' big gates that connected the blocks
Now before making records
The 'hood was my savior

Half you rappers out there couldn't see me with binoculars
Anyone who thinks he'll take me out is just a dreamer
If you think you're the bomb, then I'm hiroshima
When I die,
I hope they're making records up in heaven
On a scale of one to ten
I'm like 100-5th-11
And sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones
But if you ever try to dis the lords, then it's on
I go on beat
Off beat
Then jump right back on time
I drop another rhyme
And talk about your fat ugly mama
M.c.'s cannot rock me
I'm stone-proof
Me grabbin' the mic
Is like superman running to a phone booth
Straight from martin luther king boulevard
In the heart of newark, new jersey
Make you say ""lord have mercy""
If you step up in my face
Then it's do or die
And I'm gonna make you cry!

Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)

Well, times have changed
Not only for the urban
But also for suburban
We get props, we're deservin'
From black kids, to white kids
I see them bob their heads,
From the blond hair, to redhead
I even seen a dread
So now it doesn't matter
As the clock winds down
With the tic and the toc
Because they love the sound
But people 'round your area
Say you sell out
Because you sell a million copies
And your tour goes baow
So do it for yourself
And do it for the 'hood
But do it from the heart
'cause that's when it's good
Now tell me what's gonna happen
After the rappin'
When the clock  ticks away
And ain't nothin' happenin'

I remember way back in the days on my block
When the kids used to meet up in the hallway and rock
On martin luther king's boulevard
With p.c., wise, easy ed, and my brother hard bernard
Used to hit the ill rhymes from the head
While I'd hit the beat on the wall until my hands turned red
You had the shorty two m.c.'s
The educated three
I have to give them props for helping me be me
Now I'm the one who's educated
I suffered but I made it
I only write rhymes that will be appreciated
No matter how large I get
The fire still burns
'cause from the 'hood I came
And to the 'hood I must return

So you know I have to roll on the quest
For what I'm after

(I'm after the gold then after that the platnium)
Hip hop and props that's what what I'm after
(I'm after the gold then after that the platnium)
Stacks of those plaq's that's what were after

If it's hip hop that makes yo knees knock
Turn us up box 
I know you peep da sound it's the lords on the block
It's da list now this is how I live now
Making people get down to my funky sound
Ever since I heard the sound I wanted to be down
Here's my demo tape won't you please pass it down
So I can get paid and have thing's like I said
A car, a yacht, a house with a maid 
But wow! slow down the party ain't that easy
Oh my god I think I let that video dicive me
No matter as long as the rhymes are the phatter
I bet yo billboard has me top of da ladder
Publishing like loving, I learded that from my cousin
Write you on tour you'll see thousands like the dozens
And after all dat if yo games phat
All I want to see is da golden platnium plaq

Now it's 1995
And I finally got my foot in da door 
Got props I want more 
Cause I'm definitely not where I used to be 
But I'm no where near where I want to be
I want to be able to go out and buy a golf range 
And still walk away with change
Until then there's no time to be wasting 
So I gotta keep on chasing

Well, what I'm after that's simple 
Come on and peep the mental 
This ghetto born kid blowin up on instrumentals
What's the matter oh I know you can't peep my pattern
My style is desined to shed light like a lantern
Click click click now the light's directly on yo ear
If you peep da sound then run go tell a peer

He was a friend of mine

Those are people who died, died

Cause I'm cruisin' down the ave system thumpin'
Brooklyn buddah batch yo is what I'm tokin'
I take a lot of pride in that Brooklyn shit
I didn't make it up I was born with it
I got the Saturday night fever
The bars and pizzerias
The tinted up windows cuisettes with their feet up
Drive to the bridge take it for a climb
I'm on top of the world lookin' down with Brooklyn pride

[Chorus]
Hey Goombaa, where you at
Yo I'm cruisin' down the ave in my black cadillac
Hey Goombaa, where's it at
I got the Brooklyn pride that's where it's at

[Verse Two: performed by ADMoney]
I'm from Brooklyn baby respected by all
You can tell my freegin' style from the writin' on the wall
It's all about the kid in the tattoo parlor
Gets his name on his arm and a heart for his mama
Well it's the Lordz of Brooklyn and I sport it on my vest
I love a Brooklyn girl in a Catholic school dress
Never talk to a cop, drag down the block
I got my brother on my side check the style that he rocks

[performed by Kaves]
It's Kaves the crooner, I should have been here sooner
I'm live from Bensonhurst, livin' like The Honeymooners

Well it's Brooklyn Bums
Well it's the dirty birds
Well it's the Lordz of Brooklyn won't go back on our words
Cause' we're pissing on the curbs, dishing out the dirt
Yo! someone's got to shout out to Bensonhurst
Ray Ridge Lordz rule
I might lose my cool
in a bar room brawl
and beat them down with a stool
I'm drunk it hit my head
I'm pissed I'm turning red
Well it's the Lordz of Brooklyn
if you fuck around you're dead
E to the D to the G the E
Like the loans shark's muscle
(Admoney) ""Yo, I'll bust your freakin' knee!""
With a bat or a pipe
In my parish that's a fight
Yo, you caught the Brooklyn fever on a Saturday night.

[Chorus by Admoney]
Come on!
It's a Saturday night
Come On!
It's a Saturday Night
Come on!
It's a Saturday night
So bring your boys and your bats cause it's a bar fight

[Admoney]
Ayeoo! Kick off your shoes, jump off the rock
It's the crazy white boy from a Brooklyn block
Standing on the corner drinking cheap wine
It's a Saturday night, yo, let's all get high
Puffing on the blunts and sipping on the brews
Mess with LOB!
Punk! Yo! You lose
I'm out getting drunk, writing on the walls
Step to ADM If you got the balls
I come full fisted swinging the bat
So tell me right now man
Who's the mack?
I'm in my Cadillac, running red lights
The cops on my tail
It's a Saturday night..

[Chorus]
Come On!
It's a Saturday night (X 3)
So bring your hoes and blades cause it's a bar fight..

I got the Saturday Night fever, word to mama mia
It's that crazy L.O.Bia, yo It's my pizzeria
Connected like Sinatra
The phantom of the opera
The turnstile hopper

Got the Dean Martin style
[Dino Botz: ""Woo doo bee doo""
I got the drunken flow
""From the Budweiser brew""(Dino Botz)
Swinging on the cable Like I'm Tony Manaro
The ginny gang plank is the Verrazzano
Like Lucky Luciano with the tommy gun
I never leave the body till the job is done
Won't be late for dinner, cause I'm mommy's son
And like my Pop said never turn and run

[Scotty Edge]
Just leave them laid out, lights out
kissing on the pavement
Well it's the Edge One, ADM, and the Kaves
and Paulie Two Time, and my man Dino Botz
And we're the Lordz of Brooklyn and we ain't got gotz..

Lordz of Brooklyn," 

[Verse One: performed by ADMoney]
Listen up here's a tale about a white kid
That had to make some cash
Dropped out of school ain't never went to class
Sold a little grass, robbed a couple cars
Had a name around the neighborhood for fightin' in the bars
Had a chip on his shoulder
He's a chip off the block
When he drinks, he drinks alone
Grabbed the whiskey took a swig
Heard the fiddle didn't jig
Cause he's watchin' everybody round him blowin' up gettin' big
So he picks out a ride, slim jims the door
Now he's runnin' red lights and beatin' stop signs
Cops are on his ass and he's runnin' out of time
So he hits the chop shop, makes drop, cause he's sick of bein' poor
He's white trash and he's knockin' on your door

[Pre Chorus]
Somebody's knockin' at my door, somebody's ringin' my bell

[Chorus]
I'm white trash and I'm knockin' on your door
White Trash and I'm knockin' on your door
White Trash and I'm knockin' on your door
I know you hear me knockin' so what you hidin' for

[Verse Two: performed by ADMoney]
He ain't never joined the, he ain't no altar boy
He's an angel with a dirty face like Pretty Boy Floyd
He's the kind a kid sittin' in the park if you want to cop a lid
And if he got popped he wouldn't rat he do the bid
Cause he's tuff like rugby down right ugly
If you owe him money you'll be black and blue and bloody
From his tenement slum right down to the gutter
He might run a number, sell some iron to the brothers
Cause the cops beat him down and it doesn't make the news
But to him that's payin' dues when you're walkin' in his shoes

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: performed by ADMoney]
It's just another night in the old gin mill
He got a pocket of old dirty dollar bills
He buys his boys a round, they toast it up, they shoot it down
They're gettin' stared at by some off duty cops sittin' down
So what you lookin' at you want to catch a smack
He finishes his beer and his boys take his back
And they mix it up, they're brawlin' on the ground
The cop pulls his pistol and fires off a round
Yo he should of got a job, should of went to class
Now he's layin' all alone, still poor white trash

[Pre Chorus]

Siamo schiavi di una vita sola
E come è difficile con la museruola
Morsicare un'altra bocca azzurra che non mi consola
Tu all'altitudine del cuore ci credi 
Malgrado i marciapiedi
Su quel tuo aereo
Tutto quanto scassato
In qualche posto sei arrivato
Sei arrivato 
Ma se l'aquila vola
C'è una speranza
Che quel che resta di me
Voli fuori dalla stanza
Se l'aquila vola
C'è ancora qualche futuro
Un aeroporto su uno scoglio
Non è uno scalo sicuro, oh 
Ma voglio crederci che
Il cuore è ancora vivo
E così ti scrivo, ti scrivo
Che il tempo passa scarrozzando
E quell'America
Che tanto si dice
Della rosa solo il gambo, oh
Se l'aquila vola
C'è una speranza
Che quel tuo aereo tutto quanto scassato
Arrivi dentro a questa stanza

Come cheer up your hearts and revive like the spring
Join off in pairs like the birds in February
That St. Valentines D'ay it forth do bring.

Then cometh Spring, which all the land doth nourish;
The fields are beginning to be decked with green,
The trees put forth their buds and the blossoms they doflourish,
And the tender blades of corn on the earth are to be seen.
Don't you see the little lambs by the dams a-playing?
The cuckoo is singing in the shady grove.
The flowers they are springing, the maids they go a-Maying,
In love all hearts seem now to move.

Next cometh Autumn with the sun so hot and piercing;
The sportsman goes forth with his dog and his gun
To fetch down the woodcock, the partridge and the pheasant,
For health and for profit as well as for fun.
Behold, with loaded apple-trees the farmer is befriended,
They will fill up his casks that have long laid dry.
All nature seems to weary now, her task is nearly ended,
And more of the seasons will come by and by.

When night comes on with song and tale we pass the wintryhours;
By keeping up a cheerful heart we hope for better days.
We tend the cattle, sow the seed, give work unto the ploughers,
With patience wait till winter yields before the sun's fairrays.
And so the world goes round and round, and every time andseason
With pleasure and with profit crowns the passage of the year,

Loreena McKennitt,"Good people all, this Christmas-time,
Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done
In sending his beloved Son.
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas day;
In Bethlehem upon that morn
There was a blessed Messiah born.

The night before that happy tide
The noble Virgin and her guide
Were long time seeking up and down
To find a lodging in the town.
But mark how all things came to pass;
From every door repelled alas!
As long foretold, their refuge all
Was but an humble ox's stall.

There were three wise men from afar
Directed by a glorious star,
And on they wandered night and day
Until they came where Jesus lay,
And when they came unto that place
Where our beloved Messiah was,
They humbly cast them at his feet,
With gifts of gold and incense sweet.

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God's angels did appear,
Which put the shepherds in great fear.
'Prepare and go', the angles said.
'To Bethlehem, be not afraid:
For there you'll find, this happy morn,
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born.

With thankful heart and joyful mind,
The shepherds went the babe to find,
And as God's angel had foretold,
They did our saviour Christ behold.
Within a manger he was laid,
And by his side the virgin maid,
Attending on the Lord of life,
Who came on earth to end all strife.",The Wexford Carol
Loreena McKennitt,"Alas my love you do me wrong
To cast me off discourteously;
And I have loved you oh so long
Delighting in your company.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

I have been ready at your hand
To grant whatever thou would'st crave;
I have waged both life and land
Your love and goodwill for to have.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

Thy petticoat of slender white
With gold embroidered gorgeously;
Thy petticoat of silk and white
And these I bought gladly.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.",Greensleeves
Loreena McKennitt,"On either side of the river lie
Long fields of barley and of rye,
That clothe the world and meet the sky;
And thro' the field the road run by
To many-towered Camelot;
And up and down the people go,
Gazing where the lilies blow
Round an island there below,
The island of Shalott.

Willows whiten, aspens quiver,
Little breezes dusk and shiver
Thro' the wave that runs for ever
By the island in the river
Flowing down to Camelot.
Four grey walls, and four grey towers,
Overlook a space of flowers,
And the silent isle imbowers
The Lady of Shalott.

Only reapers, reaping early,
In among the bearded barley
Hear a song that echoes cheerly
From the river winding clearly
Down to tower'd Camelot; 
And by the moon the reaper weary,
Piling sheaves in uplands airy,
Listening, whispers ""'tis the fairy
The Lady of Shalott.""

There she weaves by night and day
A magic web with colours gay,
She has heard a whisper say,
A curse is on her if she stay
To look down to Camelot.
She knows not what the curse may be,
And so she weaveth steadily,
And little other care hath she,
The Lady of Shalott.

And moving through a mirror clear
That hangs before her all the year,
Shadows of the world appear.
There she sees the highway near
Winding down to Camelot;
And sometimes thro' the mirror blue
The Knights come riding two and two.
She hath no loyal Knight and true,
The Lady Of Shalott.

But in her web she still delights
To weave the mirror's magic sights,
For often thro' the silent nights
A funeral, with plumes and lights
And music, went to Camelot;
Or when the Moon was overhead,
Came two young lovers lately wed.
""I am half sick of shadows,"" said
The Lady Of Shalott.

A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,
He rode between the barley sheaves,
The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,
And flamed upon the brazen greaves
Of bold Sir Lancelot.
A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd
To a lady in his shield,
That sparkled on the yellow field,
Beside remote Shalott.

His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;
On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;
From underneath his helmet flow'd
His coal-black curls as on he rode,
As he rode back to Camelot.
From the bank and from the river
he flashed into the crystal mirror,
""Tirra Lirra,"" by the river
Sang Sir Lancelot.

She left the web, she left the loom,
She made three paces taro' the room,
She saw the water-lily bloom,
She saw the helmet and the plume,
She looked down to Camelot.
Out flew the web and floated wide;
The mirror cracked from side to side; 
""The curse is come upon me,"" cried
The Lady of Shalott.

In the stormy east-wind straining,
The pale yellow woods were waning,
The broad stream in his banks complaining.
Heavily the low sky raining
Over towered Camelot;
Down she came and found a boat
Beneath a willow left afloat,
And round about the prow she wrote
The Lady of Shalott

And down the river's dim expanse
Like some bold seer in a trance,
Seeing all his own mischance - 
With a glassy countenance
Did she look to Camelot.
And at the closing of the day
She loosed the chain and down she lay;
The broad stream bore her far away,
The Lady of Shalott.

Heard a carol, mournful, holy,
Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,
Till her blood was frozen slowly,
And her eyes were darkened wholly,
Turn'd to towered Camelot.
For ere she reach'd upon the tide
The first house by the water-side,
Singing in her song she died,
The Lady of Shalott.

Under tower and balcony,
By garden-wall and gallery,
A gleaming shape she floated by,
Dead-pale between the houses high,
Silent into Camelot.
Out upon the wharfs they came,
Knight and Burgher, Lord and Dame,
And round the prow they read her name,
The Lady of Shalott.

Who is this? And what is here?
And in the lighted palace near
Died the sound of royal cheer;
And they crossed themselves for fear,
All the Knights at Camelot;
But Lancelot mused a little space
He said, ""She has a lovely face;
God in his mercy lend her grace,
The Lady of Shalott.""",The Lady of Shalott

Loreena McKennitt,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy!

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds 
Brought tidings of the same
How in that Bethlehem was born
The son of God by name


""Fear not,"" then said the angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a saviour
Of a pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's pow'r and might""


The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightaway
This blessed babe to find


But when to Bethlehem they came
Whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeling
Unto the Lord did pray


Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All others doth deface

Loreena McKennitt,"Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the Feast of Stephen
When the snow lay 'round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel
""Hither, page, and stand by me,
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?""
""Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.""
""Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine-logs hither
Thou and I shall see him dine
When we bear them thither.""
Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.
""Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer.""
""Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""
In his master's step he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye, who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing.",Good King Wenceslas
Loreena McKennitt,"The wind was a torrent of darkness
Among the gusty trees
The moon was a ghostly galleon
Tossed upon the cloudy seas
The road was a ribbon of moonlight
Over the purple moor
When the highwayman came riding
Riding, riding,
The highwayman came riding 
Up to the old inn door

He'd a french cocked hat at his forehead
A bunch of lace at his chin
A coat of claret velvet
And breeches of brown doe-skin
They fitted with nary a wrinkle
His boots were up to the thigh
And he rode with a jeweled twinkle
His pistol butts a-twinkle
His rapier hilt a-twinkle
Under the jeweled sky

And over cobbles he clattered
And clashed in the dark inn-yard
And he tapped with his whip on the shutters
But all was locked and barred
He whistled a tune to the window
And who should be waiting there
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter
Bess, the landlord's daughter
Plaiting a dark red love knot 
Into her long black hair

""One kiss my bonny sweetheart
I'm after a prize tonight
But I should be back with the yellow gold
Before the morning light
Yet if they press me sharply
And harry me through the day
Then look for me by the moonlight
Watch for me by the moonlight
I'll come to thee by the moonlight
Though hell should bar the way.""

He rose up right in the stirrups
He scarce could reach her hand
But she loosened her hair in the casement
His face burned like a brand
As a black cascade of perfume
Came tumbling over his breast
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight
Oh, sweet waves in the moonlight
He tugged at his rein in the moonlight
And galloped away to the west

He did not come at the dawning 
He did not come at noon
And out of the tawny sunset
Before the rise of the moon
When the road was a gypsy's ribbon
Looping the purple moor
A redcoat troop came marching
Marching, marching
King George's men came marching
Up to the old inn door

They said no word to the landlord
They drank his ale instead
But they gagged his daughter and bound her
To the foot of her narrow bed
Two of them knelt at the casement
With muskets at their side
There was death at every window
Hell at one dark window
For Bess could see through the casement
The road that he would ride

They had tied her up to attention
With many a sniggering jest
They had bound a musket beside her
With the barrel beneath her breast
""Now keep good watch"" and they kissed her
She heard the dead man say
""Look for me by the moonlight
Watch for me by the moonlight
I'll come to thee by the moonlight
Though hell should bar the way.""

She twisted her hands behind her
But all the knots held good!
But she writhed her hands 'til her fingers
Were wet with sweat or blood
They stretched and strained in the darkness
And the hours crawled by like years
Till now on the stroke of midnight
Cold on the stroke of midnight
The tip of her finger touched it
The trigger at least was hers

Tot-a-lot, tot-a-lot had they heard it?
The horse's hooves rang clear
Tot-a-lot, tot-a-lot in the distance
Were they deaf they did not hear?
Down the ribbon of moonlight
Over the brow of the hill

Riding, riding
The redcoats looked to their priming
She stood up straight and still

Tot-a-lot in the frosty silence
Tot-a-lot in the echoing night
Nearer he came and nearer
Her face was like a light
Her eyes grew wide for a moment
She drew a last deep breath
Then her finger moved in the moonlight
Her musket shattered the moonlight
Shattered her breast in the moonlight
And warned him with her death

He turned, he spurred to the west
He did not know she stood 
Bowed with her head o'er musket
Drenched with her own red blood
Not till the dawn he heard it 
His face grew grey to hear
How Bess the landlord's daughter
The landlord's black-eyed daughter
Had watched for her love in the moonlight
And died in the darkness there

And back he spurred like a madman
Shrieking a curse to the sky!
With the white road smoking behind him
And his rapier brandished high!
Blood-red were the spurs in the golden noon
Wine-red was his velvet coat 
When they shot him down in the highway
Down like a dog on the highway
And he lay in his blood in the highway
With a bunch of lace at his throat

Gazing where the lilies blow

Only reapers, reaping early,

Hear a song that echoes cheerly

Piling sheaves in uplands airy, 
Listening, whispers ""'tis the fairy

She has heard a whisper say, 
A curse is on her if she stay 

To look down to Camelot. 

She knows not what the curse may be,

Full of berries

With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping

The dim grey sands with light
By far off furthest rosses
We foot it all the night
Weaving olden dances
Mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight

And chase the frothy bubbles
Whilst the world is full of troubles
And is anxious in its sleep.

Leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
Over the young streams

Than you can understand

Away with us he's going
The solemned eyed
He'll hear no more the lowing
Of the calves on the warm hillside
Or the kettle on the hob
Sing peace unto his breast
Or see the brown mice bob
Round and round the oatmeal chest.

Come away oh human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow

Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air
But His mother only, in her maiden's bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss

If I were a shepherd, would I bring a lamb
If I were a wise man, would I do my part
Yet what can I give him, give my heart

Loreena McKennitt,"I sat within a valley green
I sat there with my true love
My heart strove to choose between
The old love and the new love
The old for her, the new that made
Me think on Ireland dearly
While soft the wind blew down the glade
And shook the golden barley

'Twas hard the woeful words to frame
To break the ties that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame
Of foreign chains around us
And so I said, ""The mountain glen
I'll seek at morning early
And join the brave United Men
While soft winds shook the barley""

'Twas sad I kissed away her tears
Her arms around me clinging
When to my ears the fateful shot
Came out the wild wood ringing
The bullet pierced my true love's breast
In life's young spring so early
And all upon my breast she died
While soft winds shook the barley

I bore her to some mountain stream
And many's the summer blossom
I placed with branches soft and green
About her gore-stained bosom
I wept and kissed her clay-cold corpse
Then rushed o'er vale and valley
My vengeance on the foe to wreak
While soft winds shook the barley

'Twas blood for blood without remorse
I took at Oulart Hollow
I placed my true love's clay-cold corpse
Where I full soon may follow
Around her grave I wandered drear
Noon, night and morning early
With aching heart when e'er I hear

Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She had danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery,
Touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push shove world
But there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold connective heat
Struggling stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It can cut you like a knife
