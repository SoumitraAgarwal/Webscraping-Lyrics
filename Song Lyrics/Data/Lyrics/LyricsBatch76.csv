Drop,"So you say you fell in love
And you're gonna get married
Raise yourself a family
How simple life can be
Somewhere it all went wrong
And your plan just fell apart
And you ain't got the heart
To finish what you started

Yeah you fell in love
And you went and got married
Had yourself a family
How simple life can be
Somewhere it all went wrong
And your plan just fell apart
And you ain't got the heart
To finish what you started

The ones that you loved
The ones that you left behind
The ones that you said you tried to find
They tried to find you

The ones that you loved
The ones that you left behind
The ones that you said you tried to find
They tried to find you

Somewhere it all went wrong
And your plan just fell apart
And you ain't got the heart
To finish what you started
You walked out that door
To find out where you belong
To fulfill your own selfish dreams
I think you might have forgotten

The ones that you loved
The ones that you left behind
The ones that you said you tried to find
They tried to find you

The ones that you loved
The ones that you left behind
The ones that you said you tried to find
They tried to find you",Walk Away
Drop City Yacht Club,"So, I told her like oh darlin
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it

I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a fuck
Oh, oh, pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

I’m like “Girl whatcha doin for today?”
I'm thinking maybe me and you should go and run away
And now I don’t believe in love at first sight
But after seein’ you baby maybe I might

Cause when you walked by, I knew you we’re my type
The apple of my eye, you’re flyer than a kite
Okay alright, I know that was kinda corny
But (but) I’m just warmin’ up

Look at you, look at you, all dolled up
Look at me, Look at me, gettin’ caught up
Goin’ down, goin’ down, yeah I’m shot up
But hopefully, you got a number I can call up

And If you do girl, that be super
These chicks hot, but you’re so much cooler
And I was hoping she would give me a chance
She walked by and didn’t gimme a glance, damn

So, I told her like oh baby
I'm so amazed by everything that you do
I told her like oh darlin'
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it

I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a fuck
Oh, oh, pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

Yeah, yeah, I said “Girl whatcha doin’ on the weekend”
And she said “I don’t even know depends”
But you’re the one that I’ve been seein’ in my dreams and
Maybe we can get together in the evening

I know we just met but fate I believe in
I know a spot where the stars just peek in
If love is deep, I’ll put both feet in
Show me where the sea is, I’ll be in the deep end

Ha your beauty got me sinkin’
Got me sayin’ “all this shit” without thinkin’
I probably sound like I spent the night drinking
Or these are lines that I’m always repeatin’

But it’s the heart on my sleeve
That wanna know if your might have a spare key
But if you’re a heartbreaker then please spare me
Damn, she was apparently

So, I told her like oh baby
I'm so amazed by everything that you do
I told her like oh darlin'
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it

My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a fuck
Oh, oh, pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

In this light, you’re lookin’ like you’re inflight
Pretty voice, put a ribbon on you’re wind pipe
Silly girl, you’ve been playin’ with me all night
But we can work it out, I been on my gym hype

Yeah, I heard you had a boyfriend and stuff and
I was just calling to tell you that its cool cause
My other girlfriend got one too haha
So I told her like

Oh baby

Drop Nineteens,"Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel baby

Drop Nineteens,"I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
A shadow of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized 
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes 
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
Now I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking

There's no better time to burn the sage.
To turn around.

All's fair in love and war.
But all I see are blacks and greys.
My life will measure yours.
See you at the end of days.

Underneath your lies I feel betrayed.
It's getting old.
Never being locked down by your chains.
They're so cold.
Fighting all the pressure you receive.
Then you leave.

All's fair in love and war.
But all I see are blacks and greys.
My life will measure yours. 
See you at the end of days.
But all I see are blacks and greys.
Needing and wanting more.

Dropbox,"You all apart and I fall away.
I know it's hard but you know I can't stay.
And in my heart you'll always be the blame.
I'll take the part that you can't take away.

You are hollow, the one with no soul.
Can I borrow a little self control?
It's hard to swallow.
It's hard to fill this hole.
And I won't follow, so I will let you go.

I fall away when I can't take the pain.
I fall away and find a better place.

Resurrect me and help me find my way.
Disconnecting and look into another day.
Feel so empty and you are out of reach.
So preach to me a sermon you can't teach.

I fall away when I can't take the pain.
I fall away when  nothing feels the same.
I fall away and find a better place.

The blinding sun told me I'm the one.
And I knew that this would get me through.
So you can stay and watch me fall away.

I felt I know at the age of twelve.

Nobody know my pain.
And no one sings in the rain.
Nobody's hummin' forgotten songs.
And no one really belongs.

They say a real man can show how he feels.
But when I try I just keep spinning my wheels.
Something tell me I could be wrong.
Let's sing together to the forgotten song.

Nobody knows my pain.
And no one sings in the rain.
Nobody's hummin' forgotten songs.
And no one really belongs.

As I walk along I slip and wonder where I went astray.
But I'm gonna find my way.

But now he fights and looses got all the bruises will someone please step in? 
Cause this Irish fools got a great big heart he keeps climbing back in to the ring 
In the low down circles where he holds his court this man he once was king.

Saved family and friends from the hardship and horror, 
in a land of depression he gave hope for tomorrow.

Work on and on with nothing to show

A cloudy image of a Middle East land 
Comes down and wrecks my hopeful thoughts.

Dropkick Murphys,"Tim Finnegan lived in Wattling Street
A gentle Irishman mighty odd
He'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet
To rise in the world he carried a hod

See he'd sort of a tripling way
With love for a liquor poor Tim was born
To help him on with his work each day
He'd a drop of the Craythor every morn'

One morning Tim was rather full
His head felt heavy, which made him shake
Fell from the ladder and broke his skull
So they carried him home, his corpse to wake

Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And laided him upon the bed
A bottle of whiskey at his feet
And a gallon of porter at his head

And whack Fol-De-Dah now dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you
Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake

His friends assembled at his wake
And Missus Finnegan called for lunch
First they brought in tay and cake
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch

Biddy O'Brien begged to cry
Such a nice clean corpse did you see
Aye, Tim me boy, oh why did you die?
Arrah shut your gob said Paddy MCGee

And whack Fol-De-Dah now dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you
Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake

Then Peggy O'Connor took up the job
Biddy says she you're wrong I'm sure
Biddy then gave her a belt on the gob
And left her sprawling on the floor

There the war did soon engage
Woman to woman and man to man
Shillelah-law was all the rage
An a row and a ruction soon began

Mickey Maloney raised his head
When a bottle Of whiskey flew at him
It missed him falling on the bed
The liquor scattered over Tim

Tim revives, see how he rises
Timothy rising from the bed
Whirl your whiskey around like blazes
Tonamondeal, do you think I'm dead

And whack Fol-De-Dah now dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you
Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake

And whack Fol-De-Dah now dance to your partner

We got loyal friends
We keep our heads held high,
We'll stick together you and I
Don't need no guns or no drugs on our streets
just a place to go and the boots on our feet.

Young skinhead they call you hooligan
Just because you don't make any sense to them
You're a hardworking man whose paid his dues
But they still call you racist on the evening news
But the blood that runs right down your wrist
Don't come from a knife, but the cuts on your fist

Your torn up knuckles and faded blue jeans
Are the colors you wear and the life that you've seen
You tell the truth look people in the eye
Don't live your life in no baggy disguise.

Just loyal friendship and a pint of Bass

We'll sweat in the ring and bleed in the streets
But our will and spirit can never be beat

You can shoot and you can kick but together we'll stick
Through thick and thin not stick or stone
Can break the bond that has here grown

Dropkick Murphys,"I once met a young girl filled with fire,
That saw through my front to this shell of a man
She knew I'd be a handful from the start,
This strong willed woman had an angels heart
The holes in these wings don't allow me to fly
So you'd better brace for a life of pain,
And if fate is the path to this better life
Somehow I feel you'll never see the faces change

Through thick and thin,
She stood by you
She held the key to my broken heart

I look back and wonder,
Sit and ponder.
How I could have ever neglected you.
For the blood soaked soil on the old ball field,
I gambled on a hand I wasn't ready to lose
But if the tables were turned and I faced the troubles,
Tough times and struggles I put you through
I'd of been there as you were through hardship and horror
My life and my love are pledged to you.

Through thick and thin,
She stood by you
She held the key to my broken heart

Remember the nights she waited and wondered,
fused to a myth that it had taken it's toll.
But this Godless man has mended his way,
Never again will she be alone.

I remember it well,
Still I always knew that she was destined to be my bride
This woman had pride,
She was full of life.
I could see the passion in her eyes.
She thought she found a man,
But she fell for the devil
An evil monster in disguise.
Now I'll honor and obey,
Forever stay.
True to you, my Irish rose

She stood by you

For this man from whom I need my advice
If the price is your life son, 
you'd better think twice as you march to the front like a soldier

hell-Bent to make a name on my own
Genetically programmed for the Wheel of Misfortune,

That time and tide waiteth for no man.
So without fear of confrontation of the consequence of outcome,
It's for freedom and for happiness they toiled.

We can see a better place where we can shake the yoke of tyranny for all.

And by virtue of their fortitude and single-minded strength
They cleared the way for the people of today

Dropkick Murphys,"Now let me tell you a story
Of a big ole' skinhead
On a tragic and fateful day
He put 10 cents in his pocket
Kicked his wife and family
And went to ride on the M.B.T.A.

Did he ever return
No he never returned
And his fate is still unknown
He may ride forever
Neath the Streets of Boston
He's a skinhead who never returned.
Skinhead goes down to the Kendall Sq. Station
And he changes For Jamaica Plain, 
The conductor says skinhead I need a nickel, 
Skinhead punches him in the brain.
Did he ever return, 
No he never returned
And his fate is still unknown
He may ride forever
Neath the Streets of Boston
He's a skinhead who never returned.
Now all night long
Skinhead drives through the station
Wondering who can I go and see
Can't afford to buy crack in Chelsea
Or a bundle in Roxbury
Did he ever return, 
No he never returned
And his fate is still unknown
He may ride forever
Neath the Streets of Boston

He's a skinhead who never returned
Skinhead's wife goes to the Scollay Square Station
Everyday at quarter past two
And through the open window
She hands skinhead a grenade
As the train comes a rumbling through
Did he ever return
No he never returned
And his fate is still unknown
He may ride forever
Neath the Streets of Boston
He's a skinhead who never returned
Now you citizens of Boston
Don't you think it's a scandal
How the skinhead stole the train
What's the big fuckin' deal
He'll work for beer
Let skinhead drive that fuckin' train
Did he ever return
No he never returned
And his fate is still unknown
He may ride forever
Neath the Streets of Boston
He's a skinhead who never returned
Did he ever return
No he never returned
And his fate is still unknown
He may ride forever
Neath the Streets of Boston
He's a skinhead who never returned
He's the skinhead who never returned

That saw through my front to this shell of a man
She knew I'd be a handful from the start, 
This strong willed woman had an angels heart
The holes in these wings don't allow me to fly
So you'd better brace for a life of pain, 
And if fate is the path to this better life
Somehow I feel you'll never see the faces change

Through thick and thin, 
She stood by you
She held the key to my broken heart

I look back and wonder, 
Sit and ponder. 
How I could have ever neglected you.
For the blood soaked soil on the old ball field, 
I gambled on a hand I wasn't ready to lose
But if the tables were turned and I faced the troubles, 
Tough times and struggles I put you through
I'd of been there as you were through heartache and hardship
My life and my love are pledged to you.

[Chorus]

Remember the nights she waited and wondered, 
fused to a myth that it had taken it's toll.
But this Godless man has mended his way, 
Never again will she be alone.

I remember it well, 
Still I always knew that she was destined to be my bride
This woman had pride, She was full of life. 
I could see the passion in her eyes.
She thought she found a man, 
But she fell for the devil
An evil monster in disguise. 
Now I'll honor and obey, 
Forever stay.

one more day to find some justice with your shadow by my side 
Cuff me, tie me, lock me down, cause I'll be back to go another round 

As one- my blood runs red beneath the night, 
I'll give my soul to you tonight 

From early on I was on my own with no light to guide my way, 
then the hand of destiny called me only now I understand 
Interwoven our lives became, bonded by blood, no need to be repayed

If I could undo all the wrongs that I've caused
Fall to my knees, pray for swiftness and just
for I'm Just a fool, a fool driven to dust
An the world ain't gonna change for me

So give me one more chance to prove these problems and frustrations
Aren't just manifest in memories we're destined to repeat
A second chance to prove I know right from wrong

I swear I'll do things different but can't promise to be strong
If you could look into this old face and try to see the young man
I swear I once was pretty, not the monster you now see
But I squandered all my chances, lost my faith and took for granted
This life and precious one chance, the whirlwind I'll wreak

Apprenticed in trade I was bound 
And many an hour of sweet happiness 
I spent in that neat little town 
Then bad misfortune befell me 
And caused me to stray from the land 
Far away from my friends and companions 
To follow the black velvet band 

As I was out strolling one evening 
Not intending to stay very long 
And there met a frolicsome damsel
As she came tripping along
A watch she pulled out her pocket
And slipped it right into my hand 
On the very first night that I met her
Bad luck to the black velvet band 

Her eyes they shone like the diamonds 
You'd think she was queen of the land 
And her hair hung over her shoulder 
Tied up in a black velvet band

Before judge and jury next morning 
Both of us did appear 
A gentleman claimed his jewelry
And the case against us was clear 
Now seven long years transportation 
Right down to Van Dieman's land 
Far away from my friends and companions 
To follow the black velvet band 

Her eyes they shone like the diamonds 
You'd think she was queen of the land 
And her hair hung over her shoulder 
Tied up in a black velvet band 

So come all you jolly young fellows 
I'll have you take warning by me 
That whenever you're out on the liquor 
Beware of the pretty Colleen

She'll fill you with whiskey and porter 
Until you're not able to stand
And the very next thing that you know
You've landed in Van Dieman's Land

Come single guy and gal unto me pay attention
Don't ever fall in love
It's the devil's own invention
For once he fell in love with a maiden so bewitching
Miss Henrietta Bell down in Captain Kelly's kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

At the age of seventeen I apprenticed to a grocer
Not far from Stephen's Green
Where Miss Henri' used to go sir
Her manners were sublime she set my heart a-twitchin'
When she invited me to a party in the kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

Sunday was the day that they were to have their flare-up
He dressed himself quite gay
I frizzed and oiled my hair up
The Captain had no wife and he had gone a-fishin'
She groped me on the stairs beneath the old man's kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

Her arms around my waist she slyly hinted marriage
When to the door in haste came Captain Kelly's carriage
Her eyes were full of hate and poison she was spittin'
The Captain kicked the door in and stormed into the kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

When the Captain came downstairs he saw my situation
In spite of all his prayers he was marched off to the station
For him they'd take no bail
To get home I was itchin'
He had to tell the tale how I came into the kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

I said she did invite me
But she gave flat denial
For assault she did indict me and I was sent for trial
She swore he'd robbed her house
In spite of all her screechin'
I got six months hard
For his courtin' in the kitchen

With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie

My mind was bent on rambling to Boston I did fly
I stepped on board a vision and I followed with the wind
When next I came to anchor at the rocks on Fairmount Hill

It was on the 23rd of June the day before the fair
When Boston's sons and daughters and friends assembled there
The young, the old, the brave, and the bold
Came their duty to fulfill
At the parish church on Thatcher, a mile from Fairmount Hill

I went to see old friends there, to see what they might say
The old ones were all dead and gone, the young ones turning gray
I met the broker Hughes, he's as odd as ever still
See I used to crash at his mother's house, when I hung on Fairmount Hill

I paid a flying visit to my first and only love
She's as white as any lily, and as gentle as a dove
She threw her arm around me saying, ""Andy I love you still""
Oh, she's one miss Bazo Bailey, the pride of Fairmount Hill

I dreamt I'd fought a violent war for the hand of this darling gal
Against an angry jealous foe by the name of Danny Gill

I was left so lonely
No one remembered, no one was there
To hear my please to hear my prayers

I'll begin again
I was headed here from the start 
I'll begin again
I paid my price for my part

Not a dollar to my name
I suppose I can't complain
My life again was mine
And that's just fine
As I knocked on my mother's door
She didn't live there anymore
A second mortgage to fund appeals that got no deal

I'll begin again

In no shape for success headed nowhere to fast

He may have been someone once by the sound of his call 
Now he answers to no one
NO-ONE AT ALL!

We all die alone, he shouted as he passed
with no sense of regret, see he never looked back

For his pride was wounded, his ego was strong
Yea that was his Trouble and this is his Song

You said we die alone, in this case you were right
No friends by your side or family in sight
There'll be no talking your way out this time
So don't count the cash cause you leave it behind

He can't keep a women they all realize
He loves them, leaves them, takes what he needs
He's loyal to no one, no one at all

You were brought up well still in spite of it all
You're touched by nothing, watch a man fall
Put a foot on his back to get a better view
Cause your loyal to No-one. NO-ONE BUT YOU!

No friends by your side or family in sight
There'll be no talking your way out this time

From these hours I wish to forget
With the night still fresh on my breath
I awoke to the grim face of death

I thought it was all just a nightmare
I guess it was true

As I crawled across the floor for the door
From one room I don't know to the next
There was nothing familiar around
And it just ain't my style to leave the seat down

I pulled on my clothes still half in a dream
As I struggled with my conscience & a multidirectional stream
(What ya take her for)
I buried my loneliness with her for the night
Then I left with new symptoms no antidepressant could cure
(What ya take her for)
She took me for all I was worth
May I remind you that ain't much at all
A meaningless gesture in the meanest of times
As it turns out you weren't worth the call

I though it was all just a nightmare
I guess it was true
But now I'm left with a daily reminder of you

With equal surprise she opened her eyes
Sat up & shouted ""for christ sakes who the hell are you!""
(What she take ya for)
She cooked me my breakfast then called me a cab
Shoved me out the door & threw the five dollar
Fare in my face

Sending every penny home to the family
Off to find fortunes that can't be bought
Now Paddy's struck down from a single shot

Paddy's struck down from a single shot!

They lured the men away
They promised wealth and riches
A thousand miles from home
Lying steel and digging ditches
The work would be a challenge
Nary a soul could stand the trial
These wayfaring boys built the railways toughest mile

Fifty-seven men on the hardest mile!

Fifty-seven men on the hardest mile
Murdered for their troubles, left to die
Immigrant sons from Donegal, Tyrone & Derry
Their numbers were few but they did the job of many

Eight weeks went by and the path was clear
Fifty-seven men had all disappeared
Not a mention of their name
No stone was ever turned
It would be so many years
Before the truth was ever learned

Fifty-seven men on the hardest mile
Murdered for their troubles, left to die
Immigrant sons from Donegal, Tyrone & Derry
Their numbers were few but they did the job of many#

Now ghosts dance a jig on an unmarked grave
A slug full of lead was the price they were paid
Vigilante justice, prejudice and pride
No one in this valley
Will be seen again alive

Dropkick Murphys,"On the fourth of July 1806
We set sail from the sweat cove of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand city hall in New York
Twas a wonderful craft she was rigged fore and aft
And oh how the wild wind drove her
She stood several blasts she had twenty-seven masts
And they called her the Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrels of stone
We had three million sides of old blind horses' hides
We had four million barrels of bone
We had five million hogs six million dogs
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million bails of old nanny gold tails
In the hold of the Irish Rover

There was old Mickey Coote who played hard on his flute
Ehen the ladies lined up for a set
he was tootin' with skill For each sparking quadrille
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
With his smart witty talk he was cock of the walk
He rolled the damnes under and over
They all knew at a glance when he took up his stance
That he sailed on the Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And your man from the West Meath called Malone
The was slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracey from Dover
And your man Mick McCann from the bankls of the Bann
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in the fog
And that whale of a crew was reduced down to two
Just myself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock oh Lord what a shock
The bulkhead was turned right over
Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
And the last of the Irish Rover",The Irish Rover

In 1861 they prayed for god to keep their souls

Jimmy left home in April, that was one year to the day
Writes his mother back home in brighton but he ain't got much to say
He's forgotten what his town looks like, the smell of death is all around
He dreams of the blue atlantic to once again be homeward bound
Homeward bound

Though the road was long and winding
Many snares lay in their path
But their struggle they saw as righteous
They fought with might and struck with wrath

Now the battle hymns are playing, report of shots not far away
No prayer, no promise, no hand of god could save their souls that April day
Tell their wives that they fought bravely as they lay them in their graves

As the train pulled in the station and the families gathered 'round
You could hear the first car echo with a loud triumphant sound
But the last car it was silent, they listened close but they couldn't hear
It was laden down with coffins, that didn't speak and couldn't cheer

This life has many shades
I’d wake up every morning and before I’d start each day
I’d take a drag from last night's cigarette
That smoldered in it’s tray
Down a little something and then be on my way

I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn’t be alone

Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over
I wear it just for you
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo

In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here

This one's for the mighty sea
Mischief, gold and piracy
This ones for the man that raised me
Taught me sacrifice and bravery
This one's for our favorite game
Black and gold, we wave the flag
This one's for my family name
With pride I wear it to the grave

This one means the most to me
Stays here for eternity
A ship that always stays the course
An anchor for my every choice

A rose that shines down from above
I signed and sealed these words in blood
I heard them once, sung in a song
It played again and we sang along

You’ll always be there with me
Even if you’re gone
You’ll always have my love
Our memory will live on

Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up

Brandy and eggnog, there's plenty of cheer
There's lights on the trees and there's wreaths to be hung
There's mischief and mayhem and songs to be sung

There's bells and there's holly, the kids are gung-ho
True love finds a kiss beneath fresh mistletoe
Some families are messed up while others are fine
If you think yours is crazy, well you should see mine

My sisters are wack jobs, I wish I had none
Their husbands are losers and so are their sons
My nephew's a horrible wise little twit
He once gave me a nice gift wrapped box full of shit

He likes to pelt carolers with icy snowballs
I'd like to take him out back and deck more than the halls
With family like this I would have to confess
I'd be better off lonely, distraught and depressed

My mom likes to cook, push our buttons and prod
My brother just brought home another big broad
The eyes rollin' whispers come love from the kitchen
I'd come home more often if they'd only quit bitchin'

Dad on the other hand's a selfish old sod
Drinks whiskey alone with my miserable dog
Who won't run off fetch sure he couldn't care less
He defiled my teddy bear and left me the mess

Are crumbling to the ground.

Maybe its already too late to tell if its luck or if its fate
Guiding the vehicle that couldn't keep
Our bodies heading straight.
Where are the answers that we need?
Why has it been so hard to see
That we had to lose ourselves
To find our whole lives waiting there?

But I gotta change it around...
Walked her in the bathroom at Snaz Crib
Beat the cock up like she was gettin her ass kicked
After that I got my ass licked, and passed it to my homie's
Once, twice, now everynight she want's to bone me
She think she own me, talkin to my nigga bout marriage

",Intro
Dru Down,"Man I'm outa cream 
Get your ice cream, ice cream
Not Ice-T not Ice Cube, ice cream
Thangs have thangs
Q P's, zippers what ever you need 
Hard, soft get your ice cream
Ice cream
Ice cream

Well its the ice cream bitch don't you hear the music
I got the shit fiends want, holla at me when they use it
I got shit sold, I pimp those broke ass nymphoes
Got them sukin dick in pintos
I guarantee its not a soda rock
You can bring cash money foo
Stamp so we can swap
Stolen goods for a fat ass dumb dumb
I sweep the things from they feet with a broom
I rush to the spot where schools of the dope fiends have seen
And they pass other fools up
Nigga jealous cause I got good crack cola
While their shit is packed with baking soda
I'm on the bandwagon why not
Niggaz sayin they got the same shit I got
Its because I'm takin the money
Cause I got my shit from bounty
With a little bit of cut in it
All you got is a couple of bucks
Go head and spend it
It's all good
But money ain't all good
Cause a raw deal will get your ass at the Wackerweel
My niggaz don't have any bucks wit em 
Cause of that I don't fuck wit em
I don't fuck with them homies
Cause some of them don't know me 
When they tell me what the deally
For a sack of buddha
A got that motherfuckin thing
Niggaz jump to they feet 
When they hear the music in the street
Get your can get your can can get your can
Rush to the van so you can catch the ice cream man
Bitch don't you hear the music


Well it's the Coca Cola man bitch 
Can't beat the feelin
One the real thing yeah you know I got green
So come on huddle
Give me ten or twenty dollarz
So I can give you rocks or do you want powder
What ever you get I bet it's the shit
Niggaz know I ripped this shit 
Up to the fullest
It keep the dope fiends comin and comin 
Now they runnin 
Up to a niggaz spot
Its making me hot
I'm about to go sit
I'm goin crazy wit this shit
I'm grindin 
I'm sleeepin trough the night
I'm watching tricky treats
Cause they might beat me 
Ugh, I look out my window with my glock
God damn damn I see holes in my van
Checkin them niggaz on a corner
You ponk ass niggaz 
That's why I'm in the house with tha Cola
And some cash stacked to the top
I got more money fool that will make me plock plock
No hesitation and no fear
My observation is to make a milli year
Yeah, and them some daddy will let me his doughtier
I'm bothered by this square nigga
Well I'm a work a 25 and you can keep that
Hand me a half sack so I can fill that
Nigga I'm a ride long and super fat jack
Cause I'm a dope dealer motherfuckin cream seller
People ask who I am 
Tell them tha Cola Man

I need to chop up some cream
Cause the sunshine is bright as fuck
Knocks blowin up my shit 
Cause they missed the ice cream truck
Cut up a half and rushed the post
UUU shit, but they don't sweat me cause I look like a school kid
But still I'm watching my back 
Cause they will gaffle, pressin my lucks
Slangin right by the hill castle
I got that cream and niggaz get jealous
But I don't play that 
I got my gap hittin it in the cut
My bundle hittin of quick
Shit, I got glamour
Takin the glock from niggaz with arm and hammer
Come hear take this glock
I'm sure the nigga will love it 
Bring my money up
I'm on alert when I work
But they forever try to get me
Cause I got my kids posted up wit me
That's what I got, I run in the spot, because I advertise
Plus I got the humongous rocks, soda for blocks
Nigga I got more locks then Goldilocks
It's time to make my rounds black
The cops are getting hopeful
I sense they jacked so I get mobile
I got two pop cicles and a cookie left
Shucks, I got myself nine bucks
Cause I give no credit, and I mean that 
You won't see that nigga until next month
And when he come to spend
For himself, but he be claming that he comin for somebody else
I had to let him underdstand
It's soooo haaaard tooo saayyy gooood byyyee to the ice cream man",Ice Cream Man
Dru Hill,"Feels like my last name is motherfucker, first name is you
Wanna love you while we fuck to show you I'm the truth
But you filled with despair and your heart don't care
If I died today you'd probably leave me right here
Oh girl, I ain't the one to fuck with
Oh girl, I ain't leavin' till you say you quit
Oh girl, I know we're gonna survive
No matter how much money it takes we're gonna get by

[Repeat: x2]
I'm just surviving her
She's just surviving me
We can meet up in the middle
Find the answer to this riddle
Until we both agree

Need an opinion, unbiased, someone to talk to
An outsider who understands what we're going through
Lack of communication's breeding the separation
And I don't want to lose you
Baby it looks like we gone need me some therapy
To get us back on track the way that we used to be
My heart is crying out but baby it's killin' me
That's why every night you see me down on bended knee

[Repeat: x3]
I'm just surviving her
She's just surviving me
We can meet up in the middle
Find the answer to this riddle
Until we both agree",Love MD
Dru Hill,"The reason why I pulled ya' over, is because your doin eighty five down the wrong way. so I pull ya ass over. Even though I hate to do it girl. I'm gonna have to arrest ya'. so why do you get up out ya' car, assume the position so I can search ya. I promise I won't hurt ya.

You have the right to remain silent.Anything you say can be held against you in this court of love. oh yeah... you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be held against you in this court of love.

I'm not gonna build your hopes and baby let you post bail. I'm gonna keep your body locked up in a cell. Have it all night girl, interigation. Baby hold on because I'm gon' rap this case up. I'll set the ruules that you go by. No room for public defenders your all mine. you've been accused of a love affair. So baby close your eyes I'll take you there

You have the right to remain silent. any thing you say can be held against you in this court of love. You have the right to remain silent

You have the right to remain silent. any thing you say can be held against you in this court of love.",Remain Silent
Dru Hill,"I don't know how much longer 
You're going to be here 
So I say my prayers 
Every night 

One for my mother 
One for my father 
And one for the love of my life
 
So if you decide to leave today 
Then leave tomorrow at the door 
And take only 
Half of yesterday 
And Forget all hope for the present 
Cause it just went away 

[Chorus]
We were 5 steps 
From eternity 
We were 4 steps 
4 steps past love 
And 3 wishes 
3 wishes from 
Touching the heavens above
 
Another day is gone 
Another night now dawn 
Waiting patiently hoping you'll return 
But not before long 

Why did you say goodbye 
I still feel your presence 
In my bed at night 

And what was reality once 
A love True in form 
Has now added pain 
For a man scorn 

Forced to wear the memories of pain 
Around an empty heart
 
Now I sit in silence and begin to think 
As laughter echoes through the air 
I can't get you off my mind 
But a whole new love 
I could never bare 

So now I lay 
Me down to sleep 
And I pray my Lord my soul to keep 
And if I die, before I wake 
Then I promise I'll be there for you always 

[Chorus: x 4]",5 Steps
Dru Hill,"I'm gonna stay to myself
Where there's no one else around me
I'm gonna stay to myself
So there's no one else to find me

That's what I'm gonna do
My baby love if I can't have you
Maybe I'm better off on my own

If I pray to myself
Maybe God above will hear me
And if it is in his will
Then he'll send you right back to me

I'll hold my feelings inside so that you won't see me cry
I hope it's all in my mind cause I'm scared.

I'm gonna chill to myself
Leave the stress of a world from inside me
I'm gonna walk all alone
And leave all my troubles behind

That's what a man has to do
In his life just to make it through
I'm gonna chill to myself

(All Alone)
Since you left me baby I've been steady cryin'
(All Alone)
Wonderin' if you ever really truly loved me
(All Alone)
I'll never give my heart again
(Baby I've got to be alone)
Baby can't you see just what is happening to me
(All Alone)
Won't you come along and baby rescue me
(All Alone)
I can't stand being all alone
(And I'll Never)
Be alone again

Another time, Another place, Another love
Maybe it will happen then, but I won't live my life on faith
So I'll keep my tears inside and drift away
Where I'm all alone

(All Alone)
Since you left me baby I've been steady cryin'
(All Alone)
Wonderin' if you ever really truly loved me
(All Alone)
I'll never give my heart again
(Baby I've got to be alone)
Baby can't you see just what is happening to me
(All Alone)
Won't you come along and baby rescue me
(All Alone)
I can't stand being all alone
(And I'll Never)
Be alone again",All Alone

 talked on the phone so long,

Tossing & turning wishing you were not alone,       
I've got to find a way to get you in my life,      
And if I do, I promise you I'll make you my wife.

No time for me, what was I thinking of,   
I got to find a way to get you back to me,

Well, I only dreamed about
I wondered what it was

And I never make a promise
That I can't keep
That ain't me

I gave you what you need
I told you that I love you

Since I held you in my arms
So I picked up pen and paper
And decided to write you a song

Things just ain't the same
Since you took your love away 
All I have is dark and lonely days
'Cause the sun don't shine my way

Wish that I could find the words to say
To show you love is real
The words just can't express the way I feel

[Chorus]
You're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together
Why you want to leave me now
Only you can ease the pain I feel
And wipe my tears away
Won't you fly back home and make me whole again

Baby not a day goes bye
That I don't want to cry
When I think of what we had
How you walked out of my life

All I had was yours to take
Till my heart you chose to break
Still wish that I could make love to you
Just one more time for old times sake

If only I could find the words to say
To show you love is real
The words just can't express the way I feel

You're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together

And wipe my tears away
Won't you fly back home and make me feel whole again
Come back home
Come back home

'Cause without you here beside me 
My house is not a home
Only you can ease the pain I feel
And wipe my tears away

Won't you fly back home and make me whole again
You're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together

Supermarkets, airports, and everywhere else in the world asking me, ""Woody when
You gon' do something, when they gon' let you sang?""

But then again you didn't notice me

And once your beauty is mine

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name

I'm hoping I can make you mine
For another man steals your heart
And once your beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

It didn't take much time to think about
But I didn't want to move too fast
'Cause I knew that when I saw you again
That I wouldn't want to let you pass

'Cause my eyes have seen the glory
In the coming of your smile
So I swear if you ever come round again
Please stay for a while

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same

And beauty is her name

I'm hoping I can make you mine
For another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine

You are so beautiful
When I'm down and out
I never seem to get tired
Tired of your love

'Cause you are wonderful

I'm just dying to make you see
Anything you want inside your heart

You can find right here inside of me

And tell me Master P got it all figured out
But if you say you with me, show you with me
You're so pretty, you stay shitty
Ain't no shorty over forty chillin' in the VIP with me
Damn right, game tight, 'cause that's how we do it tonight

[Chorus x 2]

[Method Man]
Yo, yo
Who got the best body on the planet?
I take advantage, then skate like the kissin' bandit
Leave of hearts
Got these shorties out after dark
We're lady killers
Then blow back apart, raw dealers
Tical! Dru Hiller, strange love, seven thirty
I'm like Herbie with a Love Bug
Then skip town like a Casanova Brown Mrs.
You look delicious like a two piece with a biscuit
What's goin' down?
In my mind I'm rippin' your clothes
Playing with your feet, girl, suckin' your toes
Go 'round with the Ghetto Sarano', mellow
Romeo, who like his women on the same level
Pay my bills that were due; all accounts settled
Now I'm relaxing like Pa, now with Ma Kettle
Baby laughing, earrings in both nipples
Like Janet Jackson, busting out her latest fashion
Or the smashin'
Honey, come on over here; I fuck feet cold
Throw them panties over there, you won't need those
You talk like sex
You walk like sex
Ya smell like sex
Ya yell like sex
And all ya want is Mr. Meth, hell of a man
That can sell an Eskimo a fan
I come equipped for any spot that you want hit
Or want licked; when my dick get the fuck outta here, ah, shit
I start to think back on how I go hump
In seven minutes to heaven at the age of eleven
Couldn't tell me nuthin' then, can't tell me nuthin' now
Honey child, milkin' the cow, lovin' my style
This is what we do, kid - me and them Dru kids
Take 'em blind, crimpin' them crazy, even toothless
Lastly, if you know me, don't ask me
Call me Method, Mr. Meth if ya nasty

[Chorus x 2]

If I move it on the left, will it be hot to death?
If I move it on the right, will you make it last all night? (Woody)
If I move it up and down, will you make a freaky sound? Come on
If I move it in and out, will it make you scream and shout?
Come on

Two lovers passing in the night 
A love that's left and hopeless 
That can never survive

What are they gonna to say 
Where are we gonna to go 
When they find out 
What are we gonna do

Got to get to know me too

See, we can't let them know 
Exactly what's going on 
'Cause they won't understand 

What we have between us

Woody, Woody, Woody, Woddy 
I know we may be rushing 
There's no time to think it through 
'Cause when love overcomes your heart 

There's nothing you can do

By now you should know 
People always have advice about being together 

When they're all alone 
I cry 
I cry, I cry, late at night baby 
Inside 

Inside my heart babe 
I was all alone 
Don't you let no God damn body come near 
And tear our love apart 

'Cause I love you girl 
You're all my world 
So what are we gonna do 
What are we gonna do 

I feel so afraid, babe

Stay out til the dawn

Dru Hill,"I can't believe, You were the girl
No one ever wanted to be with kiss, hold, or do a thing
Real thin so shy really not my type no
There was no future for us girl honestly

It's been a while I ask myself how could this be
This girl is hot she's looking so damn good to me
Tried to approach her but her feelings they have changed
She's not checkin' for me

[Chorus]
Hey there love
You're lookin' better than you did before
Ooh I never meant to hurt you
Sometimes I sit and wish I didn't ignore ya
Ooh I'd change it if I could

What do I do for you to even notice me
See me tryin' to hard to win your heart
Did I hurt you all that bad?
Been two years and you're still mad Shawty tell me

Never did I feel this way before 
So many dimes I've been through never thought that cupid had a bow for me
Til the day you passed my mama's door
I didn't really mean to hurt you baby
So won't you please come back?

Hey there love
You're lookin' better than you did before
Ooh I never meant to hurt you

Dru Hill,"In 1997, Beauty changed my life
Who would've known that she would be my future wife
Or the mother of a child so beautiful
What I had in love I lacked in self-control

See, I had to have them all to be satisfied
And on an average night, I'd take four or five
But the measure of a man ain't how many you can fuck
It's how you live your life so you can keep her trust

[Chorus]
Men always regret getting over 'Cause you don't know what you do
So, you're better off loving her from the start
Even if you're not sure if she's loving you
Men always regret getting over She'll hide her pain in her smile
And be in your bed sleeping with another man
While you're on the phone askin' 'bout your child

Remarkable, incredible, confrontational, yet irreplaceable
She wouldn't cook or clean, so I let her go (Oh no no)
But she's got the kind of love that you can't let go
But still I loved her unconditionally

I wish she had've told me that she didn't love me
Could have been better off on my own (yes, I would)
But then I never would have wrote this song

See, my girl is the kind that walks around with a smile
Kissin' and huggin' me like she don't even care, Oh yeah
So one day, I come home
Smilin', ready to say I love you
But then I walked upstairs
And all your things were gone like you were never there

Men always regret getting over 'Cause you don't know what you do
So you're better off loving her from the start
Even if you think she ain't loving you
Men always regret getting over She'll hide her pain in her smile
So, while you're in the bed with another man
I just want to talk to my child

Still can't understand
Why you let me get away with what I did
I don't want to hurt another girl
Knowin' I was sleepin' with another girl

While you were home sleepin' in my bed
I really can't be mad if you turn around and do the same to me
Please, God, give me the strength
Men always regret getting over
'Cause one day she'll leave

Men always regret getting over 'Cause you don't know what you do
So, you're better off loving her from the start

I'm about to lose my mind, girl I can't sleep no more
Can't eat no more, girl I'm falling down

I never meant to go that route

I tried to be the man you wanted me to be
But it just wasn't good enough
And I'm sitting down here alone
What am I to do...
 
She don't really want to talk to me
'Cause she said that our love is done
She don't even want to look my way
'Cause she said that I'm not the one

All she wanted was a faithful man
who can tell her just what he felt
Now she found love in another man
So I'm back here all by myself

She said that she would comfort you, through anything
Where did she go? (Where did she go?)
She said that she would be right here, never ever leave
Where did she go?

She said that she would comfort you, through anything
WHere did she go? (I don't know)
She said that she would be right here, never ever leave
Where did she go?

I guess I'm gonna have to tell myself
There will be better things ahead
And all I have to do is think about
All I had before she left

She don't really want to live alone
But she will if it brings me pain
And I don't want to have to sacrifice my soul
Just to keep love the same (She said)

Seems like we had so much fun
But when I really think about it
There's somethin' that you still ain't done for me

The only thing you haven't done for me
Is show me why your name is ecstasy
I know you get down
So girl, why don't you quit playin' 'round

2 or 3, it don't matter when
I only want you for my special friend
And there's some things I want to do to you
Girl, you know you want to do it too

I heard so much about you
I'm so curious 'bout what you do
Girl, you know I'm goin' down

The only thing you haven't done for me (I can see it in your eyes)
Is show me why your name is ecstasy (Ooh...ooh...baby)
I know you get down
So girl, why don't you quit playin' 'round

Baby, tell me why you want to get down tonight
You tell me you don't want to be a freak, uh
You tell me why you wasted so much time
Girl, you know that I
But what about the sexual things that you like to do
I'm waitin' here so patiently

That you can't take no more
Replace him with me

You need to learn how to show that feeling, (That feeling)
To someone who deserves it.
You can't figure out, what it's all about

It's taking everything in me
Not to kiss you over under
Feel your inside feel my thunder
How the hell could I not want you


Girl you don't have to be a thang
I'll wait for you, You wait for me (baby)
'cause true love's insisting
We don't have to rush at all (baby yeah)

These are the times we all wish for
The moment with less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not at all


Been thinking bout you all the time
Morning noon and supper time
Tear you up in little pieces
Swallow you like Reeses Pieces
Come on girl you know I need it


(I know) It ain't suppose to be a thing

(I know) I'll wait for you, you wait for me

(And I know) 'cause true love's insisting we don't have to rush at at all

Dru Hill,"I don't know how much longer 
You're going to be here 
So I say my prayers 
Every night 

One 4 my mother 
One 4 my father 
And one 4 the love of my life 

So if you decide to leave today 
Then leave tomorrow at the door 
And take only 
Half of yesterday 

Forget all hope for the present 
'Cause it just went away 

We were 5 steps 
From eternity 
4 steps 
4 steps past love 
And 3 wishes 
From 

Touching the heavens above 
Another day is gone 
Another night now dawn 
Waiting patiently hoping you'll return 

But not before long 
Why'd you say goodbye 
I still feel your presence 
In my bed at night 

And what was reality once 
A love True in form 
Has now added pain 
For a man scorn 

Forced to wear the memories of pain 
Around an empty heart 
Now I sit in silence and begin to think 
As laughter echoes through the air 

I can't get you off my mind 
But a whole new love 
I could never bare 
So now I lay 

Me down to sleep 
And I pray my Lord my soul to keep 
And if I die, before I wake 
Then I promise I'll be there for you always 

We were 5 steps 
From eternity 
4 steps 
4 steps past love 
And 3 wishes 

From 
Touching the heavens above",5 Steps [Radio Edit]
Dru Hill,"We started out together, rode a love journey
We said we'd be together till the very end
Ain't nobody ever made love, that we did; oh yeah 
I must admit we had something special
Almost perfect 'cept those things we didn't let go
You did you dirty, girl; and I did mine too
And now you want me gone away.
Sooo easy making mistakes
All broken down, beyond repair
We're being selfish, and had us helpless
Now it's better that we go away; away 

Never thought that we would be apart
And leaving with broken hearts
How did we let our love get away? (how did our love gave away)
What ever happened to our yesterday
Never thought we'd let it get away
The future we had faded away (away, away, away)",Away

How Many Kids Are We Gon' Have

I Remember We Used To Go Out Shopping, And How Picky You Would Be
I Recall We Used To Watch Bill Cosby And Say That's How We Gonna Be

Back To Every Single Time You Saw Him, You Saw Her
Even Though We Try To Stay Away
My Heart Is Still In Yesterday
Lets Go Back To The You And Me
Like We S'pose To Be
Back To The Future

I Reminisce About The First Time I Saw You
My Future Flashed Before My Eyes
I Often Think About The First Time I Called You

Travel A Road That Never Ends
We Need To Find A Way To Put It Back Together

But haunted by pain
It takes more than one sleepless night in the rain

All the people gather to see how he lived 
But tonight the poet sleeps with me
The poets sleeps

How sad is the loser's plight
Drunk in the streets
To see a flame in the dark gently move away

All the people gather to see how he lived 
But tonight the poet sleeps with me
The poets sleeps",Song for Pessoa

Drunken Boat,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",A Gift

J'aurais dû rester chez oim avec ma femme et mes mômes
J'aurais jamais dû faire croire à cette tasse-pé qu'j'suis love
J'voulais juste un soir par simple pulsion
Mais ce corps de rêve n'était pas qu'une illusion
Plusieurs jours passent, elle s'attache
Me dit que j'l'ai changée, merde, ça sent l'danger
V'là comment casser dix ans d'mariage
Parce que chez oim, ma femme n'a rien demandé
Hypnotisé comme si j'avais tisé
Dans ma bêtise, j'crois bien qu'je la kiffe
J'ai honte et commence à souffrir face à mes enfants quand ils me sourient
Et elle qui m'dit qu'elle veut s'poser
Sans savoir qui j'suis, qu'elle a des projets

Si t'as du biff, pas besoin d'lui dire : ""Oh ma belle
C'qu'elles sont douces tes mains !"", yeah
Tous ces ex te l'diront, après elle y a pas plus tyran
Quand Madame fait son caprice, impossible de lui dire non
Son amour est fictif
Elle prend les hommes pour des victimes
Elle s'vante auprès d'ses copines
De c'qu'elle leur soutire pour son lèche-vitrines

J'ai compris tes peurs et t'aimer

Ton regard de glace me renvoie le mal que j’t’assène
Et le ciel gronde, veut faire chavirer ma barque
À croire que Cupidon s’est empalé avec son arc
À bout de souffle, notre relation manque d’oxygène
Forcément quand ça dérape, c’est l’un ou l’autre qui gène
J’en garderai que des souvenirs, des bons, des mauvais
Au fond s’qui m’plaisait, c’était ta façon de m’aimer
Même pas le temps de crier ""Mayday!""
Que tu rappliques pour m’aider pour moi plaider
Je tombe, tu m’relèves, estompe mes colères

Entre regrets et rêves inaboutis
Devant les aléas de la vie, je me fais tout petit
Je croupi dans l'oubli, mes soucis
Me coupent l'herbe sous les pieds, quitte à tout perdre
J'avancerai, si le contraire m'arriverait
Je ne saurais que faire de ma vie
Et j'ai du mal à faire du mal, du mal à faire du mal aux gens
Et, quand tu fais du bien, tu finis écrasé par les gens
Insatisfait, et ce depuis le jour où j'ai vu le jour à Lariboisière
Les vestes se tournent, on se voit sous un autre jour quand il y a du khaliss à faire
Mais est-ce vraiment ma nature ? Est-ce que je suis cette immonde créature?
Est-ce que je suis né pour l'échec ? Croulé sous les dettes et être abattu
Mais j'essaie et je me heurte à la réalité, renié malgré mes qualités
Du mal à prendre des décisions, un peu comme si j'étais habité

Grandi avec une mère qui faisait seule le taf d'un binôme
J'me sens endetté, besoin de lui offrir tout un royaume
Pour ça, il y a pas de miracle, quoi qu'il arrive, faut pas que je chôme
Donc j'irai braver des océans sans craindre d'être noyé

Conscient que le courage ne suffit pas pour exister

Pour dire ""Bonjour"" à nos pères, on leur serre la main
Si on frappe nos p'tits frères, c'est pas pour s'faire la main
On s'aime à notre manière, on sait qu'y'a vraiment rien d'méchant
On marche en bande, car ensemble, vraiment rien n'est chiant
La jeunesse a changé, aime agir, peut songer
À l'avenir, veut tout tout d'suite, alors vend des 100G
Le respect disparaît, les anciens disent pareil
Ici, le vice paraît banal, on devient tous tarés
Mais on est comme ça, et plus tard, on espère tous devenir des hommes sages
Oui, plus tard, on aimerait tous devenir des hommes savants
Pour l'instant ça veut du rêve, donc, dans la zone, ça vend
Lève ton briquet
Si tu veux prendre le large, car chez toi tu t'sens étriqué

Mais grandir n'est pas si simple, même loin des bacs à sable

La misère m'a guidé, même si aujourd'hui j'suis ridé
Moi, j'ai pris conscience que le temps tue et m'suis fait à l'idée
Nos parents charbonnent tous, sans aucune reconnaissance
Et on a du mal à dire des ""Je t'aime!"", ça depuis l'enfance
Des cœurs de pierre nous sommes, juste bons qu'à faire des sommes
Mais quand le malheur assomme, ici, seul l'alcool console
On fait des sauts périlleux dans l'vide
Peu importe, on fonce tête baissée en période de crise
Miser sur la chance, jamais, car la rue n'fait pas semblant
Dur de voir l'futur quand le passé est sanglant

Dry Branch Fire Squad,"He packed up his guitar
And drove Wednesday through Sunday
And sometimes played three shows a day
The modern lone rider, he dreamed of Ohio
And his doe-eyed Arabian bay
And how they'd go racing out on the hillside
In the cool closing twilight of day
Old friends together in thunderous freedom
Just the man and the wind and the bay.
Well, sometimes they'd ride down by the river
And the bay always stopped there to drink
In the still of the evening
The horse seemed contented
And the man used the time just to think.

And in the cold winds of winter
He's drawn to the barn
By some irresistable force
With carrots and a blanket
There's nothing more binding
Than the love of a man for his horse.

The call of the highway, how it would beckon
He kept going back out of course
And in the deep of the night
When the miles were the hardest
He just figured he drove for the horse.

And in all life's relations one thing stays the same
Never take more than you will repay
So we count the score even
'cause the miles he had driven
Were for miles that he rode on the bay.

They grew old together, got too old to ride
But just look at the seeds that they'd sowed
They'd walk out in the pasture, stand side by side
And stare off at the hills where they'd growed.

And of all God's creations here under heaven
There's many I can't understand
One beautiful mystery that I at least witnessed
Was the love of a horse for a man.

And my sister was saved

There the angels were crowded and the sisters would shout out

It was there he took the weight off my load
And he freely removed all my sorrow and strife

As he told how the father above
Gave his only son Jesus all the lost ones to save

Come to Jesus he'll lighten your load
So often he preached of the life giving bread

Cause lo and behold! Your father had drunk all the fuel
You were a low moon, steady with wintry calm
Somewhere inside the fire of your youth went dark

You say ""My love, you take the cards that you're dealt
Cause there's no guiding light arching a line to Bethlehem
If it's dark outside you light the fire yourself""

With dragging tails of history walk.
Soon confuse the compass and the cross.
Carefully and cursively we fill our traveling diaries with loss.

Beneath an angry Bible flood,
Did you and I first learn to love.
In my father's car we came to know.
And shivered in our painted clothes and paired like every animal below.

As heavy as a history book can be,
I will carry it with me, oh Lord.
And maybe when the bitterness has gone,
There'll be sweetness on our tongues once more.
Barefoot in a rowing boat,
You lose your shoes and freeze your toes.
And say I wear my sorrow like a crown.
And throw your arms around my head, and see it there in gold and red and brown.

As heavy as a history book can be,
I will carry it with me, oh Lord.
And maybe when the bitterness has gone,
There'll be sweetness on our tongues once more.

We'll soon forget our parents' names,
Like dogs will drive the wolves away.
And weep with fingertips opposed,
Like a church where nobody congregates.

But sweetness sings in the pasture,
We throw ourselves on the mercy of the earth.
If sand and salt have the answer,
Then the act itself will be louder than the word.

And the gate don't creak for want of you

As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light

I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you

On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
Woah, we are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're making me to go, you're begging me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love, and I'm chained to your side

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

And if I'm losing control will you turn me away or touch me deep inside?
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this could die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing

Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your Figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you, are you smart? Are you smart?

Are you, are you smart? Are you smart?

Don't change a hair for me, don't
Not if you care for me

Dual Sessions,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love [C-Close Mix]

The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

You have found her, now go and get her

Is it love or is it me

From looking out to feeling free?

I sit here lying in my bed
Wondering what it was I said
That made me think I lost my head
When I knew I lost my heart instead

So won't you please read my signs?
Be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind
Please be with me

And of all the better things I've heard
Loving you has made the words
And all the rest seem so absurd
'Cause in the end it all comes out I'm sure

Livin was so easy and I felt so fine.
But, my, my, my right before my very eyes,
Satan came with fire to burn me,
Wouldn't listen when they warned me.
A dagger in my back while she's calling me honey,
Wouldn't stand back, for neither love nor money.
 
Thirty minutes after my ship set sail,
She put up a sign and my house began to wail.
But, why, why, why I couldn't see it in my little girl's eyes?
She had such a way to fool me, Lord she had a way to fool me.
And I would ask the woman, ""Can you find it in yourself to please stand back?
You ain't gonna rule me.""
 
Just when all began to fade,
I reached out, threw the Ace of Spades.
I put her on a train to the Everglades.
 
Now that it's all over and gone,
Somehow I just don't feel so alone.
But, lie, lie, lie it seemed like such a waste of time.
She did not ever seem to know me,
But, now it's much too late to show me.
But, if I ever see that woman walkin down the street I'll just stand back,

Became impatient to be free

Just how wonderful you are
And why I am so in love with you

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Duane Eddy,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony

And talk about their homes

And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, Brandy, fetch another round

Made of finest silver from the North of Spain

She saw its ragin' glory
But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man

Duane Steele,"The trouble with you
You're always looking down that highway
For a better place to go
The trouble with me
I'm always looking back behind me
On the shoulder of the road

The trouble with love is it has no sense of direction
Our paths were never meant to cross
The signs were so clear
But in a solitary second we were lost

The trouble with hearts
You never know where they will lead you
Until you're long gone
One day I woke to realize how much I need you
Though that may not be what I want

The trouble with love is it don't care what you were planning
Or what you thought you were waiting for
I'm shaking my head from side to side
But I'm still praying for more, oh more trouble with love

Love couldn't see we were a million worlds apart
It simply reached across the night, and baby here we are

The trouble with love is it has no sense of direction
Our paths were never meant to cross.
The signs were so clear
But in a solitary second we were lost

The trouble with love is it don't care what we were planning
Or what you thought you were waiting for

Don't try to make life on your own
Remember that jah jah's by your side 

For I was a soul who lost 
And my life was in dismay
For amongst evil forces in which I played 

Guns and ammunition 
Were my chosen way of life
With God fearin people I choose to strife

For all of the lives that are taken 
They can never be replaced
But still jah jah chose to remember my face

I'm still mindful of what he taught me
So now I beg and plea

Cause when my life got dark he was the only spark
He was the light at the end of the road...

Growin up in August town 
We ate from the same pot 
We were idlings all around

From corner to colour and corner
From rockers to jungle kentyre
Rising to dreadhieghts and river all around 

And then the footbal ground became my battlefield
And my life seems so surreal
People were fallin all around
But jah helped me to stand my ground

Oh father you rescue me, 
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I've lived and I've learnt, 
I've made mistakes along the way
Now I beg for forgiveness, 
Each day as I try to pray

So take it from me son 
You can change the world today

Duane Thamm,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

Dub B,"Friday night it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night

Would it turn out right
How to tell you girl
I want to build my world around you
Tell you that it's true

I want to make you understand
I'm talking about a life time plan

That's the way it began
We were hand in hand
Glen Miller's Band was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more

And the porter too
Made us dance across the room
It ended it all too soon
And on the way back home

I promise you, you'll never be alone
Hurry don't be late
I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old

We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing
Friday night it was late
I was walking you home

We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right
Now as the years roll on

Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing
Hurry don't be late

I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park and reminiscing

Dub Inc.,"J'ai envie de métissage pour des hommes vrais
Et tous ceux qui ont de la rage, vas-y laisse les
Ouvre ton rivage à la différence qu'on aime pour des hommes vrais

Car demain sera métis, nous sommes la première esquisse
Intolérance, racisme il faudra bien que cela finisse
Enfant couleur réglisse, ou clair comme de l'anis
Il y a tant de saveurs de quoi rester optimiste
Mais entre deux cultures comme un équilibriste
On marche sur un fil et on subit leurs lois
Ici face de paria, là-bas tête de touriste
Montre moi le bon chemin pour chez moi
Non ce n'est pas un fardeau
Même si parfois j'ai peur
Que la couleur de la peau
Remplace la vraie valeur
Pourtant cela coule de sens comme une évidence
C'est lorsqu'on mélange les différence que les cultures avancent
Donc j'en ai fait ma force, qu'ils restent dans leur ignorance
Car je sais qu'est c'est une chance, quoiqu'ils pensent

La France est métisse c'est pour ça qu'on l'aime
Faut qu'on réagisse sur le monde quoi qu'il advienne
Une souffrance, un supplice mes angoisses sont les tiennes
J'lève très haut c'foutu drapeau ma terre d'exil mes idéaux
Mes couleurs et mes peines pèseront sur vos fardeaux
J'métisse les styles, j'maîtrise les flows, mes origines et mon ego
Mes racines sont toutes celles qui porteront le flambeau
Mon nom est inscrit sur une pièce d'identité
Mon coeur a deux pays qui suis-je en vérité?
Bénin, France, Algérie, oh laissez moi chanter
Que là-bas ou ici je suis toujours étranger
Fraternité à fleur de peau est-ce une habitude?
Liberté, égalité trop d'incertitude
Comment guérir les maux? La haine en nous s'est forgée
Et tous deviennent raciste la France a changé

Libre de vivre en laissant en bas
Les regards hostiles, enfant de la terre regarde en toi
Ils ne sont pas crédibles, la génétique défie ces lois

Citoyens du monde, restons groupés

I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

How did love slip away

I am here to stay

Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

uh ha.....

[Verse One]
I grew up in H-town living life on the blocks
From then that's when I became unorthodox
I use to tie knots in ma socks
filled them with rocks And I'd swing your jaw if you gave bad looks

Now I, haven't changed still slightly deranged
Still slightly outraged and I feel insane
At way I contain so much pain
like a feen Life is real do you know what I mean?

Its like, ever since the days I was young
man was bussing full clips and the run of your tongue And
in my hood I see mans get worked
Then ah man would come back n say that man got murked

Yea, I can say that my live's been hard
Six of us lived in ah two bedroom yard
So I keep this in mind full well knowing I know where I've been
so I know where I'm going

[Chorus]
You don't know where I've been
You don know what I've been through
So how can you judge me?
You don't know about the life that I got
You don't know what its like to live in my slot.
this worlds gone mad and it don't seem right
every night I pray to god please turn out the light
that would be my one wish!
(that would be my one wish)
(that would be my one wish)
that would be my one wish

[Verse 2]
I got that H-A-see blood in me
I rep my east side I'm that ghetto gully mind chick
born in E5 And I've always moved
with mans ever since I was young
'cause these girls are too bitchy and their mind set is long

Yea I learnt how to move and stay wise on the street
'cause my older boy's showed me how a girl should roll deep
I saw moves get moved, watch man move what they move
To survive out here you got to do what you do

Hustling on the corner shotting work
'cause when your grinding you gota make shit work
'cause life is hard and life is real
And mans now ah days don't care when they kill

Boys young as sixteen
life's taken and gone and I sit back and sigh
what the fuck is going on This is wrong
to the families of lost ones I'm sorry R.I.P to babys Jessica and Holly

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse three]
The hood holds loyalty
the hood holds faith The hood holds struggle
and the hood holds rage
The hood holds haters that wana grudge me
But I don't watch you only god here can judge

So I don't care if you like me or hate
'cause lately a lot of heads wana vibe crazy
But I ain't here to make new friends
Shystie is jus here to make ah means to ah end

So, ima be the reason why you step up your pace in this race
Ima take every chicks fan base
And ima be the realist girl in the game
Ima be the reason people forget your name

'cause I'm big inner dis
big bad inner dis
And I don't care who likes me and whose pissed
'cause Shystie's here and I'm repping it for London
I'm never gona be ah pop Emcee, you must be dumb man

I suppose you were just stating your views
What was it all for?
For the weather or the battle of Agincourt

And the times that we all hoped would last
Like a train they have gone by so fast
And though we stood together at the edge of the platform
We were not moved by them

With my own hands
When I make love to your memory
It's not the same
I miss the thunder, I miss the rain

And the fact that you don't understand
Casts a shadow over this land
But the sun still shines from behind it

Thanks all the same
But I cannot bring myself to answer your letters
It's not your fault
But your honesty touches me like a fire

Will surely fade away
Like the love that we spoke of forever

But I can't give up without a fight.

On one hand

And I can never
Go back to where I was before
And I wanna run...

Duchess Raehn,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Duck Baker,"I met you in a garden in an old Kentucky town
The sun was shining down
You wore a gingham gown
I kissed you as I placed a yellow tulip in your hair
Upon my coat you pinned a rose so rare
Time has not changed your loveliness
You're just as sweet to me
I love you yet, I can't forget the days that used to be
 
When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip
And I wore a big red rose
When you caressed me, 'twas then Heaven blessed me
What a blessing, no one knows
You made life cheery when you called me dearie
'Twas down where the blue grass grows
Your lips were sweeter then julep when you wore that tulip 
And I wore a big red rose

Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours

And I was only thirteen
But he was my best friend
And he could make a guitar sing

On hot summer evenings
I'd play along with him
Settin' up on his front porch
While the june bugs beat on the screen and I'd say

Hold on
Hold on Elroy
Hold on Elroy - run that by me again

The ring finger of his left hand
Was buried out in texas
From the time when his work glove
Got hung in a cotton gin

But it didn't slow him down none
He could play like lightning
He'd fly through a breakdown
And then sit back and grin - when I'd say

Hold on
Hold on Elroy
Hold on Elroy - run that by me again

I said ""I've been workin' on that lick you played last week
I think it goes like this
He said, ""Sakes alive, son, I think you've flat got her down""
Now you can work on this""
And I said

Hold on

I play along with the best now
And owe that old man
For this good life of mine

Rain come down, rain come down

I see unnecessary death, I see life just gone away
I see souls out of control, I see the earth's pain, I feel the earth's pain
I see the powers of manipulation and I pass away
I see the sleep walkers who walks asleep doing it again

I watch how they do the music, I watch how they do the children
I see wars, I see famine, I see pestilence
I see disease, break, incest, racism, I see these things
I seen what the lack of knowledge can do to a civilization
I've seen what laziness can do to a civilization, lazy people
When you don't stand up for your own

Go ahead and keep beating around the bush, beating around the bush
I see with my own blue eyes also and take care for what I see
Believe me I've seen a lot, I participated in wars
I've seen so many, so many things
With the help of us could have been set right

Don't you wanna go to the moon also
Don't you wanna enhance your intelligence
Don't you wanna stand up for your own
Don't you wanna see with your own two eyes
Only you can lift you up, by the will of God
The powers that be, the energy within your soul

I hang on the edge of this universe, singing off key
Talking too loud and bracing myself to cushion the fall
I shall tumble into deep space never in this former with this feeling
To return to earth, it is not tragic

I shall spound to the black hole losing scared limbs
Internal organs, severing my naked soul
That in the next galaxy with only my essence embracing myself
As I fall into the ill minded mode

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Dudu Nobre,"Judia de mim, judia
Seu eu não sou merecedor desse amor

Se eu choro
Será que você não notou 
É a você que eu adoro 
Carrego esse meu sentimento
Sem ressentimento

É, a cana quando é boa
Se conhece pelo nó
Assovio entre os dentes
Uma cantiga dolente
Entre cacos e cavacos
Sobrei eu, duro nos cascos
Bem curtindo pelo cheiro dos sovacos

Judia de mim
E quem dança qualquer dança
A bonança não sabe o que é
Desconhece a esperança
No falso amor leva fé
Quem de paz se alimenta
Se contenta com migalhas
Não se aflige e corrige
As próprias falhas",Judia de Mim

Chi ha voglia di sentir parlare di problemi problemi
Volatili del malaugurio basta fare cucù

E dentro le palestre balleranno le signore
I pelliccioni in alto gli indici puntati al cuore

Poi tira su le mani esce il segno dell'amore
Per me per te nati nel paese degli innamorati
Ci vuole un cuore sodo e tondo
Una cena due gelati
Fare l'amore come scaricare gli MP tre
Pagano gli imbranati e gli sgambati lo fanno gratis
Lei è bella come il sole d'agosto
Ma si sa che l'amore ha un costo
Farsi un cuore così nove ore al giorno
Noi cresciuti con il mito del porno
E ringrazio di avere un posto
Nel paese più sexy del mondo
Dove sia il perizoma che il conto
Vanno rigorosamente in rosso
Perchè il mio treno arrivi fino nella tua stazione
Oltre al biglietto qui ci vuole il cuore cuore

Davanti a noi un mondo di strade che si aprono e anche se io sto cercando ancora mille scuse
È chiaro che ora io non posso più fare a meno di te

Io non voglio + bruciare nella cenere di una sconosciuta anche fosse venere
Io non voglio più saperne, io non posso più fare a meno di te
Ogni giorno farsi una ragazza facile non ha reso mai un uomo meno fragile
Non le voglio più vedere io non posso più fare a meno di te

Tipe mezze nude, mezze gucci e prada, sgamano I ricconi manco avessero il radar
Altre tipe invece fan le bigotte, se c'hai la tipa arrivano a frotte e tutta la notte
Ma queste pensano che non le vedo, ste reginette dell'eros sanno di plastica peggio che il lego
Ci stavo dentro e non nego, in pieno trip del mio ego, schiavo del piacere di un placebo

C'è ancora gente che parla di sesso debole, ma non ha conosciuto te
Però io so che hai un punto più sensibile che ti fa piangere per me

Tu mi hai tirato su dal fondo della cima, non è che salvi il mondo però è meglio di prima
Chi mi conosce da sempre ora si sorprende, mi metti a posto ma non sposti niente
Per me è un miracolo, ma quando mai è successo dopo tutto sto tempo tutti giorni videogiochi e sesso
E bevi tutto me stesso, liscio e non corretto, presa bene dell'affetto
E anche se sto cercando ancora mille scuse è chiaro che io ora non posso più fare a meno di te

Señores que paso en el barretal
Un hombre y una mujer ya se han muerto
En manos de un criminal

La luna se daba gusto brillando
Cuando aquel hombre llego
Su hijo estaba en la cuna llorando
Y a su mujer no encontró

Bajo las ramas de un árbol muy grande
Dos cuerpos se dejan ver
Uno era de aquel traidor y cobarde
Y el otro el de su mujer

Se acerca tan silencioso el villano
Que ni quería resollar
Iba empuñando una daga en su mano
Iba dispuesto a matar

Mas de sesenta ocasiones su mano
La daga lograba hundir
Y no dejaba de hundirla el villano
Hasta que los vio morir

Cuando vio a su esposa muerta
Le dijo traidora mereces mas
Que dios se encargue del mundo de tu hijo
Que tu pal infierno vas

El juez que dicto sentencia
Le dijo tu crimen probado esta
Al daño que ellos lograron hacerme
Que nombramiento le das

Yo se que voy a la cárcel
Por eso voy mi delito a pagar
Y si en la cárcel me dicen que han vuelto
Salgo y los vuelvo a matar

Oh so degrading, says Jimmy DaLancia

Mas y más me enamoraba
Andaba la noche aquella
Con una daga clavada

Me dijo una cantinera
Pues hombre a ti que te pasa
Ya deja la borrachera
Vete a dormir a tu casa
Le dije la suerte perra
La que a mi vida se abraza

Seguí vagando en la noche
Con mi botella en la mano
Aquella noche un mariachi
Tocaba ""El Abandonado""
Brotaba mi llanto a mares
Por ese amor desgraciado

Aquel diablo embotellado
Ya por mis venas corría
Y yo muy apasionado
Pensando en ella bebía
Y como estrella que era
Me la robo el nuevo día",El Diablo en Una Botella

With a picture of your face.

The magazines you left on the floor,

There's no smell of your sweet cologne.

And I'd build my house, baby

All wrap up 8s
I pick my load and I fill my truck
Before it?s too late

I leave the stars to judge
My every move
I'm not going to think of you, oh
I'd get the blues

There's no sleep on the journey
Away from time
A bag of songs and a heavy heart
Won't make me down

I'll give it all my strength and my mind
I'll make this decision with or without

I'd move to Rockferry,

Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone

And it would be so hard for me not to cross the line
The words of love lay on my lips just like a curse
And I knew oh yes I knew they'd only make it worse
And now you have the nerve to play along
Just like the maestro beats in your song
You get your kicks you get your kicks from playing me
And the less you give the more I want so foolishly

Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone

But I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone

all I ever did was call you names
I got kicks from teasing you

I break down and cry

Oh baby it hurts
Your taking my breath away

Now we've grown and I'm still here
On my own
I'll be tender with your foolish heart
Cause still it's me who cries

Now I fault
Still I wish I had you to hold
I don't suppose that you would
Come away

In the shadows of a place we used to go
Drinking cocktail after cocktail
Wondering if you'd show

My head started spinning
My mouth was feeling dry
Lost inside the music I,
I was trying not to cry

If they call it heartache
If they call it heartache
Why is the rest of my body aching
Why is the rest of my body shaking

Please Mr. DJ won't you turn the music down
Why can't you understand
I'm too hurt to dance tonight

I was sad there, looking solemn
He said I stood out from the crowd
He offered me a friendly face
To wipe away my frown

But I won't talk to strangers
There words are all the same
So I drowned inside this drinking glass
To take away the pain

If they call it heartache
If they call it heartache
Why is the rest of my body aching
Why is the rest of my body shaking

Mil botellas de esperanza

And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind
The summer wind
The summer wind",The Summer Wind

Duke Dumont,"We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding into the dark night, night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love, when it's never enough
As the silence filled the lonely air
Oh, they can hear now now now baby
We see a storm is closing in,
Pretending we're escaping

Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)

We're running all the red lights down
No way that we can stop, no no
A quarter tank is almost gone,
Pretending we're in love, when it's never enough
I wish we could take it back in time
Before we crossed the line, no now now, baby
We see a storm is closing in
I reach out for your hand

Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we danced with the devil
You brought the fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never

Duke Ellington,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Oh, what a couple in love
Frankie was loyal to Johnny
Just as true as the stars above

He was her man
But he done her wrong

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber-tired hack
'Cause there's eight men to go to the graveyard
But only seven are coming back

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

Now this is the end of my story
And this is the end of my song
Frankie is down in the jailhouse
And she cries the whole night long

""He was my man
But he was doing me wrong""",Frankie and Johnny
Duke Ellington,"Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
'Cause I got it bad, and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental
Not made of wood
I got it bad, and that ain't good
But when the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around
My man and me
We pray some
We gin some
And sin some
He don't love me
Like I love him
Nobody could
I got it bad, and that ain't good
Now folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him
I can't live without him
Lord above me
Make him love me

Like a lonesome weeping willow
Lost in the wood
The way I hug my pillow
No woman should
Because I got it bad, and that ain't good",I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)
Duke Ellington,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

When the voice that I heard, like the song of the bird

With a heart that is true, I'll be waiting for you

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

With memories
That never die

And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid

Send back my love

Duke Ellington,"Summer, you old Indian Summer
You're the tear that comes after June time's laughter
You see so many dreams that don't come true
Dreams we fashioned when Summertime was new
You are here to watch over
Some heart that is broken
By a word that somebody left unspoken
You're the ghost of a romance in June going astray
Fading too soon, that's why I say
""Farewell to you Indian Summer""",Indian Summer
Duke Ellington,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Duke Ellington,"My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

Not if you care for me

We had to part
The moment you had touched my heart
And with you went my dream

Was our affair
And you put all the sweetness there
What a shame that it's gone
All too soon

I knew the strange delights
That only you in love could bring
And as I reached the heights
The bottom fell from everything

You should know as well as I

When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock

When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one

Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room?

I think of you
Day and night, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me

Duke Ellington,"They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you, somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant

But, nevertheless, why stir up memories?

Been invited on dates
Might have gone, but what for?
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

Missed the Saturday dance
Hear they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Got as far as the door

I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero: ""Let's meet for a sweet fietsa""

High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios

Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido

The more I see you
As years go by
I know the only one for me
Can only be you

And my heart won't try

Is like the first time
Each time you're near me

And there is not a single thing I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you

April green, everywhere, April songs always there,
Come and hear, come and see, follow me.
To the tree where our hopes hang high,
To the dream that should never die,
Where our long lost tomorrows still are in the sweet bye and bye.
Time goes by, or do we, close your eyes, and you'll see
As we were, we can be, weep no more, follow me.
Follow me, follow me.

Duke Ellington,"Here's a dance you should know
When the lights are down low
Grab your baby, then go

Do the Hucklebuck
Do the Hucklebuck
If you don't know how to do it
Boy, you're out of luck
Push your partner out
Then you hunch your back
Start a little movement in your sacroiliac
Wiggle like a snake, waddle like a duck
That's the way you do it when you do the Hucklebuck

Everybody's looking for a-somethin' new
It could be cars, it could be clothes
Or just a stylish shoe
But if you like your dancin'
Better take my tip
Get set, warn the band, and let 'er rip

You go a little to the left
A little to the right
Get hold of your partner
Tell him, ""No need to fight""
Push your partner 'round
And then you hunch your back
Start your movement in your sacroiliac
Wiggle like a snake and then you waddle like a duck
And that's the way you gotta do it when you do the Hucklebuck

There you go
You got it now
It's the Hucklebuck",The Hucklebuck

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain, come shine

I meet you and to me the day is fine

What a sight to see
Something the eyes of mortals have no right to see
Am I on the earth or in the sky?
Lost in loveliness am I
When I look at you
I forget myself
I could go mad about you if I let myself
Should I let myself or pass you by?
Lost in loveliness am I
I know I'm reaching for a star
What's more; I know how dangerous you are
If I were wise
I'd close my eyes
Or walk away and worship from afar
In the lonely night
You would haunt my heart
And I would pray that someday you might want my heart
And I'd have to live my whole life through

So charming and gay

I hurt so bad
I almost cried

Invitation to dance

Head high, standing tall
Who else, who else could I be?

A fella who likes what they see?

And then in my ear
Someone said to me
Wallflower, my dear
How come you can't see
They couldn't care less?
They're not impressed
As you might have guessed
You're in excess

Imagine my frustration with no
Invitation to dance

English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it

When I go a-fishing, a minnow won't do.
You must be standout, a whirlwind wizard; 
Got to be the champ, or else you're through.

Kiss me long, strong, and consecutive, 
No short snort will suit me, Jack.
Long, strong, and consecutive; 
Hold me close like aces back to back.","Long, Strong and Consecutive"
Duke Ellington,"You left me a horse from Texas,
A house with installments due,
A letter with lots of x-s
Everything but you.

You left me some beans from Boston,
A bicycle built for two,
A memory to get lost in,
Everything but you.

Each day was so gay and so daring,
I loved every breathtaking minute,
For how could I know I was sharing
A kiss without a future in it.

You left me a dream to room with,
A coffee pot from Peru,
A knife and fork to spoon with,
Everything but you.

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Tell me a story
Big as a barn
Don't stop listening; I won't hear you out

Look at him shine
There goes a big one
That one is mine
Catch up the reel now; I've got the feel now
Hooked onto my fly rod I've got me a trout

Duke Ellington,"They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you, somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?
No, sophisticated lady

And when nobody is nigh you cry",Sophisticated Lady [Take 1][#]

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British museum had lost it's charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

Touching your hand my heart beat much faster
All that I want in all of this world is you

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights the star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Someday my happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are are mine",All the Things You Are
Duke Ellington,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Duke Ellington,"In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
With someone sharing a delightful chat
Of this and that
And cocktails for two

As we enjoy a cigarette
To some exquisite chansonnette
Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath
A serviette
With cocktails for two

My head may go reeling
But my heart will be obedient
With intoxicating kisses
For the principal ingredient

Most any afternoon at five
We'll be so glad we're both alive
Then maybe fortune will complete her plan

With cocktails for two",Cocktails for Two

Gave me Dinah;

Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame

Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?

Duke Ellington,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,

Can't you see that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.

Duke Ellington,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary
Duke Ellington,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You)
Duke Ellington,"I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain",Singin' in the Rain
Duke Ellington,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me [#]
Duke Ellington,"Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But some day the sun will shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine

Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But some day the sun will shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine

Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
But too much of that stuff is fallin' into mine
And into each heart some tears gotta fall
And I know that someday that sun is bound to shine
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine",Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall (Duke's Poetry) [#]
Duke Ellington,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me [#]"
Duke Ellington,"Sometimes I feel so weary
Traveling through life all alone
Sometimes I feel so weary
Traveling through life all alone

It's a long, long journey
And I can't make it on my own

There's seven million people
Living right here in this town
There's seven million people
Living right here in this town

I don't need but one person
So, baby, why won't you, please, stay around?

When the sun turns blue
And the moon shines bright all day
When the sun turns blue
And the moon shines bright all day

That's the day, sweet mama
I'll let you run away

When the rivers stop flowing
And the trees lay down and die
I said, when the rivers stop flowing
And the trees lay down and die

When the stars stop shining
Then I'll say my love's goodbye

Now if I've been misbehaving
I promise you I'll stop
But if you quit me, mama
I swear I'll blow my top

It's a long, long journey
But I'll make it before I'm blue
This world can't throw me
Mama, if I still have you","Long, Long Journey"
Duke Ellington,"Love it seems I just can't find
Love it seems I just can't find
Seems that I'm the one love
The one love left behind
I've searched it just won't come my way
I've searched it just won't come my way
It's love that I want now
So what more can I say
Women seem to pass me by
Women seem to pass me by
If I could find the reason
I'd know the answer why
Love it seems I just can't find
Love it seems I just can't find
Seems that I'm the one love
The one love left behind",Ready Eddy [Take 1]

And it's really dumping

Duke Ellington,"There is a gay lady in blue
Haunting my dreams all the night thru.
She seems to creep into my sleep
Day after day and nights without number
I see her rise right under my eyes
Out of blue shadows while I'm lost in slumber:
There in the dark she is so fair
But with the dawn she's never there
For with the bright morning's new light
I wake and find the dream I've had
In mind was a lady in blue
Shadows of the night.
There is a gay lady in blue
Haunting my dreams all the night thru.

Duke Ellington,"Through the trees comes autumn with her serenade
Melodies the sweetest music ever played
Autumn kisses we knew are beautiful souvenirs
As I pause to recall, the leaves seem to fall like tears

Silver stars were clinging to an autumn sky
Love was ours until October wandered by
Let the years come and go
I'll still feel the glow that time can not fade
When I hear that lovely autumn serenade",Autumn Serenade
Duke Ellington,"How can I tell you what is in my heart?
How can I measure each and every part?
How can I tell you how much I love you?
How can I measure just how much I do?

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?",How Deep Is the Ocean?
Duke Ellington,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you

Duke Ellington,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.
 

",Farewell Blues
Duke Ellington,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Duke Ellington,"Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling; I'll be true",All My Loving

It ended a moment ago
This is the end of a beautiful friendship
I know 'cause your eyes told me so

We've always been
Like sister and brother
Until tonight
When we looked at each other

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love
That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love",A Beautiful Friendship
