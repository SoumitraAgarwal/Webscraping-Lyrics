Killing Joke,"You'll need a bit of Holy water
And a little bit of
Knowledge
Invocation
To your Holy Guardian Angel
The Great Evil Around

God gave man dominion
Over fowls of the air
And fish of the see
Justification of desecration
Who wrote this madness?

Get UP! Wake UP!
Some-one's taking you for a ride
Get UP! Wake UP!
Dark Forces

They're printing up money
That doesn't exist
Then watch the wealthy
As they cash their chips
Economy's failed
Start a war machine
Devoid of moral cause
As we witness the end
Of international laws

Get UP! Wake UP!
Some-one's taking you for a ride
Get UP! Wake UP!
Dark Forces

I'm a inside man
Of the serpent clan
33 degrees
I'll do as I please
Power for power's sake
And 2 weeks off
In bohemian grove...
You wanna come?

All the banking houses
That buy and sell
They'd sell their own mother..
Just eat shit die
Like everyone else

Get UP! Wake UP!
Some-one's taking you for a ride
Get UP! Wake UP!

Get UP! Wake UP!
Some-one's taking you for a ride

Killing Joke,"Mark out the points, build the pyre
Assemble different drummers, light up the fire
Put on your masks and animal skins
Illumination, illumination

Listen to the drums
Between each beat, each beat of the drum
Oh beloved mother of liberty
Hold me in your arms

Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

And the day will come before the lights go out
Who will you turn to, who will you turn to
Choose the crucifixion or Osiris slain
Recurring themes, time again

Illumination, illumination
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

Oh, how ingenious the centuries of lies
Ezekiel?s chariots streak across the skies
Holy books and history texts forget because we know
Souls are recycled in the death and resurrection show
Oh beloved mother of liberty, come to me

Everything I'm taught, amounts to not
Everything I learn, the fire shall burn
Notions of myself that I'm not
Whoever I was is now lost

Illumination, illumination
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

Oh, how ingenious the centuries of lies
Ezekiel?s chariots streak across the skies
Holy books and history texts forget because we know
Souls are recycled in the death and resurrection show

Oh, beloved woman of liberty, come to me
Burn away all my impurities
Hold me in your arms

Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

Killing Joke,"As far as trying to go up against the government, well, 
Unless the whole country did it , I guess..

Now you listen to me..
Just enough water
For one third of the world
Oil baron running the government
So I'll start a war

Gonna carve up your wealth
Like pumpkin pie

Won't be told that empires run on the old black gold

It's conflagration

This our mission

We'll clothe your women

A Lesson In Trade

24 million people
Half a liter a day

Killing Joke,"Twilight open and you're on your own
Moon is shining, you want fun and games
Hear the voices inside your head
Let's play wild, volatile

Get out my way, we go
Take back those ways, you know
Fun and games come out to play
Fun and games for unknown days

Then you join your playmates in the street
And the night fires burning and you're on your feet
All the boys and girls look in their eye
Domestication lost overnight

Get out my way, we go
Take back those ways, you know
Fun and games come out to play
Fun and games for unknown days

Games get bigger all the time
Because the playpen's falling, stakes are high
And the child will conquer step by step

Killing Joke,"I am a child of folly
Now I want my way
And I don't know good or bad
But I dance all day
And my sense of humour
Getting out of hand la-la
And the diamond's sharp you know
All the harlequins they go go
Such a lovely colour
So the nasty taste won't show
And when I'm seeing bitter
Then the carnal feelings go
So if you guess my next move
Then that's more than me
So when I start to smile
Then the harlequins will go go
I am a child of folly
Now I want some fun
So I don't need good or bad
And we've just begun
So if you guess our next move
Let your sense of humour show
And the diamonds are forever

Killing the Dream,"I'm running out of distractions to keep me from the truth, and I'm running out of places I can go to stay away. This broken glass has only sharpened with the years, and I can't remember how it looked before it fell so fast. What will become of this when I'm gone? It's sad to say, but from here, there's not much left anyways. But tonight I'm staying in, it's warmer than outside. And thoughts can't echo off the walls like through the air. If you can't read this, it's because my hands are shaking from the cold of another night alone. So tell me that to dream about tonight, because I never got that far on my own. And God, hold onto me tonight. Pull me close before I slip away. I've truned from you, but it might not be too late. And maybe this is wrong, but if it all goes as planned, you'll never know I'm gone.




",The Escape
Killing the Dream,"And now you've come so far and climbed so high, and all it cost were the words we built ourselves up on. Another step. Just one more time. Why turn back now? As you're starting to forget something we lost so long ago. But we remember the taste of our blood, you taught us all so well. Exhale. It's gone. One breath and four years lost. Did you miss us as we fell through the cracks of your lies? But we found a home in the lowercase letters of words you'll never read and songs you'll never hear. And you'd remember, but we've bit our tongues for so long now that we forgot what we had to say. We're spitting blood and you can't see. But now we know tomorrow means nothing if we all die today. But we won't die today. This doesn't die today.




",Picking Up the Pieces
Killing the Dream,"It's been so long since it's rained this hard
So I'll drive with the windows down to remember how it felt to feel alive
The sky starts to clear as I'm passing by your house for the second time again
You're still away

And I'm still here
How long has it been since you've been at home with me?
I'm trying to hold on but I'm just keeping you away
You said ""I'm still standing, I'm just looking for a reason""

I'm standing right here
But I'm holding on too tight
You're looking right through me, or do you feel me at all?
And this will never be enough, but if you're going down...

This is all I have
Just fucking take it

I know that you doubt my words
I swear there will never be regrets

Can we start again
We thought love was everlasting
Can we start again

What we had just can't be wasted
Silence that were broken
And words that can't be taken back
But you mean so much more to me

Than anything
Anything I have ever known
And this is the hope for tomorrow
That today you will return

Can we start again
Go back in time to where we started
Can we start again
What we had can't be discarded
Can we start again
Do you remember
Can we start again
Can we start again
Go back in time to where we started",Starting Over

He died to save a wretch undone like me
Oh like me

He died for you and for me

I know I've crucified my Lord again
No, I've crucified Him again
If I'm lost, I have only myself to blame
Only myself to blame

Yes, it was Calvary where He purchased my salvation
It was Calvary, Calvary where my Jesus died just for me

It was Calvary where they crucified my Lord
Yes, it was Calvary where He purchased my salvation
It was Calvary, Calvary where my Jesus died
He laid there never said a [Incomprehensible] word

It was Calvary where He saved a wretch undone just like me
He didn't have to do it but He did
It was Calvary where He hung, bled and died just for me
For me, for me, for me, yes, He did it for me

I was sinking deep in sin far from a peaceful shore
Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more
But the Master of the sea heard my despairing cry
From the waters He lifted me now safe am I

When He laid his life down He did it for me

Cause I never ever felt this way, felt this way in my heart before
Because love has found His way in my heart tonight.

Once again cause I never ever felt, (never ever felt)

Kim Carnes,"(Kim Carnes/Dave Ellingson)

You're the poets finest song
And like a painter you can move me with your sunrise
Touch me with the look I see in your eyes
And I fall again

In the silence after love
With the words that go unsaid I'll understand you
Things may not work out the way we've planned them to
But I'll fall again

Loves been called a game
Winner takes it all
And everyone who plays
Plays knowing he could fall
And if love's a game
I'd rather lose to you
Than win with someone else
And still be loving you

When the love songs have all been sung
And time has taken down its last December
You will be the one love I'll remember and I'll fall again
For like the fool I am
I'll be the pawn again
Move me as you will
I've always given in
And if love's a game
I'd rather lose to you
Than win with someone else
And still be loving you




",And Still Be Loving You
Kim Carnes,"When does a lover ever learn to say goodbye?
When does a lover finally stop giving it one more try?
If holding you for a night or two is all I'm ever gonna see of you
You'd better love me up, and on the way back down
Give me something I need, something I ain't found

Just like a bad seed in the wind you keep blowing back again
When everybody's turned you out, I'll take you in
You're a bad seed in the wind, and you've just got to have a friend
Come on and take my love, and you can break my heart again
Darlin', come on and take my love, and you can break my heart again

I see the memories in your eyes do they keep you company
And I hear your temporary sighs callin' out to me
Givin' in is all I do, I give you more and you take it too
If that's the way that it's got to be
Come and take what you need, and take it good from me

Just like a bad seed in the wind you keep blowing back again
When everybody's turned you out, I'll take you in
You're a bad seed in the wind, and you've just got to have a friend
Come on and take my love, and you can break my heart again
Darlin', come on and take my love, and you can break my heart again

Damn, that ol' dream that you keep chasin'
So many things that I could have done
But I keep waiting, waiting

Just like a bad seed in the wind you keep blowing back again
When everybody's turned you out, I'll take you in
You're a bad seed in the wind, and you've just got to have a friend
Come on and take my love, and you can break my heart again

Time you found time enought to love
I found love enough to hold you tonight
I'll stir the fire you feel inside
Until the flames of love enfold you

Laying beside you
Lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door
Come with me

Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again

Loving so warm
Moving so right
Closing our eyes
And feeling the light
We'll just go on
Burning bright
Somewhere in the night

You'll sleep when the morning comes
And I'll lie and watch you sleeping
And you'll smile
When you dream about the night
Like it's a secret you've been keeping

Laying beside you
Lost in a feeling
So glad you opened my door
Come with me

Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again

Loving so warm
Moving so right
Closing our eyes
And feeling the light
We'll just go on
Burning bright
Somewhere in the night

Kim Carnes,"

(Steven Dorff/Milton Brown)

I'm waiting for the pain to go away
I though maybe that this would be the day
At noon I tried a little smile
Then I sat down and cried a while
Just waiting for the pain to go away

If I could only get you off my mind
But these old memories treat me so unkind
The way you laughed your gentle smile
Still makes me love you oh so much
I know that I can't get you off of my mind

I see happy lovers everywhere I go
Sharing dreams in a world for two
He holds her hand and she holds his
They never know how good love is
We lost the only chance for me and you

So I'm waiting for the pain to go away
But I'm afraid the blues are here to stay
Not many loves like ours around
So easily lost so rarely found
Just waiting for the pain to go away
To go away

Just before you go could we talk a while
Maybe my ol' face could make you smile
I know you haven't said all that's on your mind
We always used to keep an open line

People keep on changin'
So everyone's got to bend
I'll keep waiting
Love will come around again
You've already broken me down
And feelin's the way I do
I'm gonna miss you I'm gonna miss you

Try to hold the sun when it's sinking low
Try to keep away the lonely night
Try to make you stay when you wanna go
And nothin' that I say can make things right

People keep on changin'
So everyone's got to bend
I'll keep waiting
Love will come around again
You've already broken me down
And feelin's the way I do
I'm gonna miss you I'm gonna miss you

Just before you go could we talk a while
Maybe my ol' face could make you smile
Guess every dream is just like sand in the hand
Hold it too hard and it's gone

People keep on changin'
So everyone's got to bend
I'll keep waiting
Love will come around again
You've already broken me down
And feelin's the way I do
I'm gonna miss you I'm gonna miss you

You were drivin' real slow
And I hid from your lights
Was it bringing you back
I was hopin' it might

A pretty face reflected in a mirror
So perfect in every way
With every move
The picture's getting clearer
She's got it all
She's got it made

But when she smiles
Is she really smilin'
She's the only one who really knows
Emerald eyes so cool
And so inviting--hide the side
She never shows

She's a looker
That's what they say
She's got it all
She's got it made
She's a looker
With a beautiful face
Always on display

The magazines always show her smilin'
So perfect in every way
But in the night
I hear a young girl cryin'
She's got it all
She's got it made

She's a looker
That's what they say
She's got it all

See the face reflected in a mirror
With every move the picture's getting clearer

As if she didn't care

She's a looker
That's what they say

In the parking lot
I knew it was crazy

When nothing else mattered
But the fire in our eyes
And singing our favorite song

Just to break my heart
Cause I could stay here all night
Where memories are so sweet to me

But you've still got my heart
And if you're ever alone
I'm as close as your telephone

And I don't know what to expect
'Cause all the promises you made
You never kept

When you called to say you'd meet me here
What was going through your mind
Are you running to me
Or just running blind

'Cause if you're gonna set me up this time
I'll be ready for you
I'm playing it cool
I'm taking a long look back

'Cause I know I'll never forget
That I loved you a lot
And you tore my heart into pieces
How do I stop all the 

Feeling I've got
From doing me in again
I went out of my way
But it just didn't pay

If you want to see me again
Just open the door
And love me like you never did before
You thought you were clever

When you disappeared
And kept me hanging on by a thread
You left me drowning in tears so deep
Way over my head

You had to place yourself beyond my reach
And play so hard to get
You know you did some things to me baby
I'll never forget

I know I'm taking a chance
Letting you back in again
If you don't need me
There's really no use to pretend",Love Me Like You Never Did Before
Kim Carnes,"(Donna Weiss/Jackie DeShannon)

You run from surrender and your persona's clean
You stay away from mirrors
Cause the eyes just look too mean
You are young and you are ravaging your fate
Save me from desire you've got to much to hide
I remember when you could not swallow your own pride
Now you're married to your own uncertainty
And you're back again to off that to me

It's only lonely love
Only lonely
Only lonely love
Only lonely
You better give it up honey
Only lonely

All you gypsy cargo
They better run they'd better flee
They don't know how far you'll go
To cover your own need
You don't think that anyone can set you straight
You have landed on you feet and on the take

But it's only lonely love
Only lonely
Only lonely love
Only lonely
You better give it up honey
Only lonely

I got too much to lose and I'm not into being
Lost and abused it's too plebian
I'm giving it up
And you're only lonely

Only lonely
Only lonely love huh
Only lonely
You better give it up honey
Don't lean on me
It's only lonely love
Only lonely
You never get enough do you
Well not from me
Only lonely love oooh oooh
Only lonely love hmmmmmmm

And it's not the streetlight of some old street of dreams

And you know what I mean

Sometimes I try to tell myself the light was never real
Just a fantasy that used to be the way I used to feel
But you and I know better now
Even though it's been so long
If your memory really server you well
You'll never tell me that I'm wrong

Names and faces homes and places will have to be rearranged

And offered the one thing that nobody else had broken

I have broken every rule, the hard way for you
And I would do it all again
Just to spend the night with you

You took my love like a one armed bandit
Got reason to cry, got more than I can stand
And I'm going down for the third time over you

I was standin' still when I should have been running
As if you didn't know what I might do, I might choose

I have broken every rule the hard way for you

I would follow every road with nothing else in view
Just like the frozen willow bends I have

Do you just love to watch me ache
On the chances that I take

Kim Carnes,"I'm breaking in pieces and my soul is caving in
There's a hole in the sky and we can't fill it in
There's a place in our hearts full of love for all men
Just have to find it again

Look through children's eyes try to tell them why
There's oil across the water and holes across the sky
Look through children's eyes, hear the ocean cry
Hear the forest fall in ashes from the sky

Honey, you've not known enough to think it all
But here in your lifetime this is off the wall
We can save tomorrow for the children left behind
Let us all save the earth together

Look through children's eyes try to tell them why
There's oil across the water and holes across the sky
Look through children's eyes, hear the ocean cry
Hear the forest fall in ashes from the sky
Look through children's eyes

We glorify greed without counting the cost
Once man's happy ending is every man's loss
How long since we noticed how long has it been
And the innocent child is crying again

Look through children's eyes try to tell them why
There's oil across the water and holes across the sky
Look through children's eyes, hear the ocean cry
Hear the forest fall in ashes from the sky

If we look through children's eyes
Look through children's eyes
We can save the earth together

Kim Carnes,"Churning and burning it's a love attack
Don't run for cover it will turn you around in your tracks
Pull you right back

And once it starts it's like a thunder ride
Cover to cover it's the kind of a book I could write
Best seller twice

Don't want to show the look in your eyes
Getting too close for comfort

There ain't nothing better than love
Put out the fire and it still ain't enough
Fever to fever till it fits like a glove
'Cause there ain't nothing better than love

Head over heels it's not the heart that you lack
The force is over and you know you had to react
Don't have to look back

Don't want to show the look in your eyes
Getting too close for comfort

There ain't nothing better than love
Put out the fire and it still ain't enough
Fever to fever till it fits like a glove

Never will be and there never was
Nothing, oh, nothing
Nothing better for me, no nothing
Never, never will be, no nothing

But we strain the thread and it tears apart
So many people trying and they just can't stop
Living for tomorrow, trying to beat the clock

And the trying to change, the cycle going round and round
But the ink's run dry and the book ain't bound
You say, give me some direction 'cause I lost my way
But they don't make maps for the world we made

Maybe we would find love along the ledge
Where emotion still so far pretense
Remember how it was when it so easily came
Help me find the feeling again

Living on memories give it one more try
'Cause you never know until you show
What's there behind those eyes

Living on memories, living like enemies
Disguise it all behind the wall of broken hearts gone by

Now I'm running circles just to catch a view
But it seemed like love that's the way with you
So many people trying, they just can't see
That a captured heart doesn't want to be free

Maybe we can find love along the ledge
Where emotion still so far pretense
Remember how it was when it so easily came
Help me find the feeling again

Made you a faceless maze and you were forced to yield.

Don't break down and start to boo hoo

There's just one thing for you
La, la to la, la do la, la
Like Tallulah just
Give him the ooh-la-la

If Napoleon at Waterloo, la, la
Had an army of debutantes
To give the British the well known ooh-la-la
He'd have changed the history of France

When your favorite Romeo
Grabs his hat and starts to go
Don't reveal the fact that you're blue
Don't break down and start to boo hoo

There's just one thing for you
La, la to la, la do la, la
Like Tallulah just
Give him the ooh-la-la

The ooh-la-la

Don't be a fool, ah

Kim Criswell,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Kim Criswell,"Back in the days of knights in armor
There once lived a lovely charmer
Swimming in the Rhine
Her figure was divine

She had a yen for all the sailors
Fishermen and gobs and whalers
She had a most immoral eye
They called her Lorelei

She created quite a stir
And I want to be like her

I want to be like that gal on the river
Who sang her song to the ships passing by
She had the goods and how she could deliver

She used to love in a strange kind of fashion
With lots of hey-ho-de-ho-hi-de-hi
And I can guarantee I`m full of passion
Like the Lorelei

I`m treacherous, yeah-yeah
Oh, I just can`t hold myself in check
I`m lecherous, yeah-yeah

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,

Keeps me runnin', skippin', jumpin', like a little kid.
You know sometimes I can hardly keep it inside,
It overtakes me, overwhelms me, and I'm mortified.

And it's okay if they don't always understand.
It's very easy to get caught in circles dance;
It's even easier to break out in a dance.

Seeing only sun when there's a cloudy sky.
I know the trouble tries to surround me,
But I've been given something greater, deep inside of me.

And it's okay if they don't always understand.

When I'm facing opposition of those attitudes,
We come see notions, dispositions are completely rude.
When darkness thinks that it's outdone me,

And it's okay if they don't always understand.

'Cuz that's the key unlocking or receiving

I still have breath, so I got hope that love is on my side
And where I go, I know I need not look behind me

Precious redeemer and friend
Who would have thought that a lamb could 
Rescue the souls of man

Hopelessly lost our way 

Oh we've hopelessly lost the way.

You are the one we adore. 
You give the healing and grace our 
Hearts always hunger for 

Oh our hearts always hunger for. 
Oh mighty infinite father 
Faithfully loving your own 
Here in our weakness you find us 
Falling before your throne

Kim McFarland,"Lord, I come on behalf on my brother,
Even though I have needs of my own.
Real joy means You first, Lord, and then others,
I'm not here for myself, but it's for someone else.

Once You've met the needs of my brother,
I'll rejoice knowing soon You'll meet mine;
I have come on behalf on my brother,
Praise You, Lord, for You always bless on time.

It's not mine to question how You test us,
It's just mine to live by Your Holy word.
You allow sunshine to some 
And You allow rain for others,
Yet You're just, 
For we'll all have both in time.

In the midst of my gloom, give to my brother,
All that he needs just to make it through;
Lord, I've come on behalf on my brother,
Praise You, Lord, for blessings come from You. 

[Chorus]
Real joy means You first, Lord, and then others,
I'm not here for myself, 
I'm down here interceding for someone else.

Please mend broken hearts,
Change doubtful minds,
With Your finger of love, touch dying souls,
Make my brother whole.

Lord, I've come on behalf on my brother,
Real joy means You first, Lord, and then others;

Kim Miller,"I always knew you would come for me
And now that you're here, my whole worlds complete
You gave me so much more, more than I'd hoped for
All of my dreams are realized, girl, you made me whole

Just when I needed a friend, someone who would stay till the end
You came along and made me strong
There are no words to explain all the joy you bring

'Cause in you I found perfect love
That one of a kind most dream of
I never though it could be
But in you I found everything I'll ever need

There were some days, girl when I
I felt so alone thought I'd die
But now that is past, I know we're gonna last

Because we were meant to be, girl, you're all I needed
You'll never know what you've done for me
You've open my eyes, now I see

I'm not the same, my whole world has changed
'Cause you're an angel in disguise
And to me it's no surprise that

In you I found perfect love
That one of a kind most dream of
I never though it could be
But in you I found everything I'll ever need, oh yeah

Loving you is all that really matters
I finally found, everything in you, I found love
That one of a kind most dream of

I never though it could be
But in you I found everything I'll ever need
Everything I'll ever need in you

Kim Mills,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?

And I watched the sun set off for business west somewhere
And the sky turned water color pink and gold and blue

And I thought about you and I wondered why
It took so long to say goodbye

And left me so I couldn't see
That I was the moon chasing the sun
There was never a prayer of ever catching up
No matter how fast I would run
Like the moon chasing the sun
Just like the moon chasing the sun

And the evening breeze dropped by and brought some sweet relief
And in the silver light I finally let go of the heat

And I'll be there to catch you, baby

And I went outside and I
Looked up at the late night sky
And I saw a star fall down
And I thought as it blazed across the night
I remember fallin'
I remember fallin'
Best friend and lover
Felt like forever
Every fiber, every day
Nobody quite like you
Never a voice so true
Too bright to ever fade away
REPEAT CHORUS
The story's over and I've lived through the ending
But that doesn't mean I wouldn't
Do it all again
I remember fallin'
I remember fallin'
I remember fallin'
I remember




",Fallin'
Kim Richey,"I should be getting some sleep
I try and I try but I can't keep
From picking apart everything that we said
Yeah, I shouldn't be running this maze
Trying so hard to find a way to raise up the dead

I should fix the lock, feed the cat
Take the clothes to the laundromat
Pay some bills, and get a clue
Get up, forget about you
I know, I know

I shouldn't be spinning my wheels
Just to see how bad it feels
Just to see how far I won't go
I should be breaking this chains
Not dragging them round
Just to feel the pain
Never should've taken this road

[Repeat Chorus]

Yeah, I know
But I can't let go

I should fix the lock, feed the cat
Count my blessings, all of that
Get a grip, and get a clue
Get up and forget about you
I know, I know
Yeah, I know
But, I can't let go
I can't let go
",I Know
Kim Richey,"After all was said and done
There was nothing left to do
The hardest mile I ever walked
Was the one I walked away from you

So maybe I'm a little ragged around the edges
I've been keeping a little more to myself these days

[Chorus]
But I'm alright
Sacked down but I'm still standing
Yeah I'm alright
Little banged up from the fall
But I'm alright
Still shaky from the landing
Yeah I'm alright after all

You know its really not that bad
No matter how bad it might feel
Cause there ain't nothing time won't fix
And this ain't nothing that some time won't heal

So maybe I've been walking a little wounded
I move a little bit slower now but that's okay cause

[Chorus]

And every now and then I think about you
Oh every now and they I cross the line

[Chorus]",I'm Alright
Kim Richey,"When I'm a breath away from going down
A step away from losing ground
And the price for love has come due

And when I'm just barely hanging on
On the edge of too far gone
And I need something to get me through

When there's no reason to believe
And life ain't all, it's cracked up to be
Let it roll over me

When my last chance goes up in smoke
And I can't see a shred of hope
And the tears can't wash away these blues

And when my best shot keeps fallin' short
And I don't care much anymore
'Cause my poor heart feels used

When love ain't all that fair
I sing out a simple prayer
Let it roll over me

Let it roll, let it wash away
Let it all fall where it may
Let it roll right over me

When there's no place left to run
Yeah, if that day should ever come
Let it roll over me
Let it roll over me
",Let It Roll
Kim Richey,"I'd almost convinced myself it wasn't true
Till the very moment he walked in with you
Now I'm pretendin', I'm not staring at the proof
There's no denyin', inside I'm cryin'
As I watch you walk off with all my dreams

There goes my whole world up in smoke
An' I might be laughin' if I weren't the joke
There goes my whole world with someone new
There goes my whole world
There goes my whole world with you

Hope you never find yourself here in my place
Watchin' him with someone else while your heart breaks
Little bit of that sure goes a long, long way
An' I will remember this day forever
As I watch you walk off with all my dreams

Kim Richey,"Against a blue sky
A black shadow flies by
Guess he's got some place to go

Some mission's callin'
No high ground can slow him
The miles flash by down below

You know you could always count on me
I'm like the river to the sea
As sure as day follows night

But I won't run a crooked mile
And I won't wait for morning light
I'd come straight as the crow flies

Each night the North Star
Reminds me of so far away
From the one light that's true

But love's a strong tie
That binds you to my life
And will go the distance for you

You know you could always count on me
I'm like the river to the sea

But I won't run a crooked mile
And I won't wait for morning light

You only have to whisper in your dreams

Kim Richey,"It's almost sunrise
Hours and hours gone by
Candles are burned down
Turned into morning light

The time to go has come and gone
Why can't I? Why can't I say goodnight?

The whole world is sleeping
And still I can't give in
It's a love story
I never want to end

The time to go has come and gone
Why can't I? Why can't I say goodnight?

I'm using up all my strength
I can't tear myself away
It only gets harder as night turns to day

There isn't one place

You need to know
That I ain't fooling around
But if there's any question
If there's any doubt

Let me spell it out A to Z
Your kind, honey, is a dying breed
No one else ever done that to me
Not in a million years, not in my wildest dreams

All I had to say was
Right on my lips
It was so much more
Than just a goodnight kiss

Hey this ain't something
I would kid you about
But if there's any question
If there's any doubt

Let me spell it out A to Z
Your kind, honey, is a dying breed
No one else ever done that to me

Kim Richey,"I got good luck in my pocket
And a good shine on my shoes
I got a silk shirt in my closet
That I'm not afraid to use
A little fortune cookie told me
Help is on the way
The tables may be turning
It could happen any day 'cause
You can't lose them all
You can't lose them all
No you can't lose them all
I could go down in history
I could go up in smoke
Could be the center of attention
Or the butt of every joke
But everytime I get shot down
I justify the risk
Because I come a little closer
To a hit with every miss
You can't lose them all
You can't lose them all
No you can't lose them all
Outside my window there's a blue horizon
But it seems so far away
A ray of hope that I can keep my eyes on
If I'm playing on the be-team
Or I'm sitting on the bench
It ain't for lack of trying
Or a lack of confidence
When I reach my full potential
When somebody gets my drift
The stars are gonna line up
And the tides are gonna shift 'cause
You can't lose them all
You can't lose them all
No you can't lose them all




",Can't Lose Them All
Kim Richey,"I don't miss the good old days
I've learned a lot since then
I've changed my ways
I'm not bothered by those things that used to get me down
On the wind come around

I don't carry much regret
We all hold something that we'd just assume forget
I remember like it was to date
The love we found
Everytime you come around
Everytime you come around

Well I'm the first to see I should
Forget you and I wish I could
Sometimes wishes don't come true

Does it seem too much to ask?
To live a life that isn't caught up in the past?
But there's really no place else on Earth
I need right now

Why don't you come around",Come Around
Kim Richey,"You can try and fight it but you wouldn't stand a chance
It's out of your control, yeah
You don't have to like it but the weight of circumstance
Is gonna take its toll

It ain't fair and it ain't right
But that really doesn't matter, does it now
That you've seen it fall apart?
'Cause it hurts just the same
So it doesn't really matter who you blame
Maybe it's only gravity

When you're high and flying
Last thing on your mind is ever coming down, yeah
You can keep denying
Up until the time you hit the cold hard ground

'Cause it hurts just the same

So how 'bout you? Yeah, how 'bout those big dreams?

I forget, what was her name, ahhh, what was her name?
Ooo oo oo ooo ahhhh, good old what's-her-name

And is it me you want, or are you just lonely, well aren't we all
And I like the way you sound straight out of lost and found
Glad you called

Well, you made me smile, hell I laughed right out loud
And it's been a while, and it feels real good
You know what I'd wish, were I the wishing kind?
That you'd take a trip down to my neighborhood, ahhhh, my neighborhood

Kim Richey,"I made a bed of roses
Dreamed of islands in the air
Walked on Spanish beaches
Shook the petals from my hair, my hair

Freed some birds from cages
Let them drift into the blue
I've written lovesick pages
Stayed up late and watched the moon
Without you, without you

I rode on waves of incense
Nag Hamati, ancient bell
Freed my shrines of pretense
And of things too hard to tell, to tell

Laid on clover hillsides
Caught the scent of honeydew
Lay awake nights sometime
'Til blackness turned to blue
Without you, without you

I faced sun on water
At the end of my remorse
Became a laughing daughter
On a spotted stallion horse, ooh

I was a note that landed
On the shores of Xanadu
My wishes all were granted
What more could I do
Without you, without you
Without you",Without You

Toss it out the window, try and get your money back
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, bring along an extra pack

Well, don't be afraid to speak your mind

Doing dishes at the laundromat
And you smiled at me
You said, ""Let's hide and seek
I'm gonna count till three""
Where did you go?

One step forward, two steps back
So funny I forgot to laugh
You lead me down the garden path
And I will follow, I will follow

I saw you on a downtown street
Eating peaches in an apple tree
You said, ""Take my hand
And we'll be a marching band
They'll love us in Japan""
Where did you go?

One step forward, two steps back
So funny I forgot to laugh
You lead me down the garden path

Pretty as a summer rose
Picked in the morning

He held her hand like it was a mystery
One he couldn't quite believe
Was walking with him

They were high up on a hill
With something to say and daylight to kill
Time slipped away, way that it will

Around and around dancing round the question posed
Pick a coin and watch it roll
Down into the wishing well

Two step sunset, there goes another day
Another chance to give away
Secrets they keep to themselves

They were high up on a hill
With something to say, daylight to kill
Time slipped away, way that it will

Darkness falls without a sound
They come tumbling down
Tumbling after, tumbling after

She wore that dress like it was a Saturday
Pretty as a summer rose
Picked in the morning

One he couldn't quite believe

Kim Richey,"Some days I look outside my window
Wonder where the time goes
Why I throw it away

One day I'll tie up all the loose ends
Ring up my best friends
And have something to say

When all of the pieces fall into place

Where was I when the roof caved in?
How did I get here again?
Good intentions gone astray

When I get my head around
What it is that keeps me down?
Wouldn't that be something
Something to say?

Wouldn't that be something?
Wouldn't that be something?

Some days I look a little deeper
There's nothing to see here
No reason to stay

One day I'll rise to the occasion
Accept the invitation
Blow the cobwebs away

When all of the pieces fall into place

Where was I when the roof caved in?
How did I get here again?
Good intentions gone astray

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

So she's asking for directions
As she's asking for the cheque
And she feels the truckers staring
So she bums a cigarette
From the big one in the booth
And she laughs inside
Nothing to lose
And everything to find

She's not in love
She's not in love
And she's never been happier
Her heart's not broken
She's not hurt
She's not in love
She's not in love
And she's never been happier in her life

It's late at night on the highway
And the road is all her own
Fireflies and love bugs hit the windshield
And they leave a little glow
And she likes it

Ain't life sweet
Well not always
But it will be
If she can just get where she's going to

She's not in love
She's not in love
And she's never been happier
Her heart's not broken
She's not hurt
She's not in love
She's not in love
And she's never been happier
No she's never been more content
She's never been happier in her life",She's Not in Love

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue

Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Kim Walker,"He is jealous for me
Love's like a hurricane, and I am a tree

And tonight God wants to encounter you
And wants you to feel His love
His amazing love
Without it these are just songs
These are just words
These are just instruments
Without the love of God, it's just like we're just up here just making noise
But the love of God changes us
And we're never the same
We're never the same
After we encounter the love of God
We're never the same after we encounter the love of God
And right now if you haven't encountered the love of God
And you would know
Because you wouldn't be the same
You would never be the same again
And if you, if you, want to encounter the love of God right now
You better just brace yourself because He's about to just blow in this place
And we're gonna encounter the love of God right now
So God I speak to all the hearts
And I ask God that every heart be open right now
Every heart be open
Every spirit be opened up
To you God. To You
And a love encounter
A love encounter from you tonight
A love encounter from you tonight God

I'll give you all the love I want in return
But half a love is all I feel, sweet darling
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me no more
But I'm gonna change your mind
Some way, somehow

[Chorus:]

Da da, da da, da da da

One way love is just a fantasy
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life
Oh baby, don't you wanna care?
Ain't it lonely out there?

I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want me baby, just like I want you

Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you leave me

Why you wanna leave me?

Why do we have to part
Couldn't give my love to nobody else
You've got me feelin' sorry for myself
Baby, don't you leave me

Baby, I'm lonely
Oh, so lonely
When you left me before
That's when you promised
Oh yes, you promised
Not to leave me no more
You oughta hang your head in shame
The way you keep my little heart in pain
Baby, don't you leave me

Said you'd never let nothin' come between you and me
I'm yours and I guess I'll be yours till you set me free

Don't leave me

And blown into the wind
She was just heading for trouble
When they got her downstairs

Cut by the lights, strands of her hair
Just tumble from her cheeks
She's just another Caucasian in a crime worn day

Inside her heart was breaking
No-one knew what she'd been through
Inside her mind's escaping
To a world that no-one knew

Lost in the night, somebody said go easy on the girl
You'll never get a confession
If you treat her that way
Two pairs of eyes shout at her face and late into the night
They heard a softer whisper saying
""Let me go""

Inside her heart was breaking
No-one knew what she'd been through
Inside her mind's escaping
To a world that no-one knew

Wendy sadd has flown away
Wendy found her freedom
No-one else could follow there
Not inside the world of Wendy sadd

Somebody shouts, something is wrong and panick hits the room
They said she looked at the ceiling and the lights went out
Clutched in her hand
All they could find was a letter that she'd wrote
It said try and forgive them
For what they've done

Inside her heart was breaking
No-one knew what she'd been through
Inside her mind's escaping
To a world that no-one knew

Staring at broken glass

Now she can touch his face !

Kim Wilde,"We were dancing
Dancing in the dark
Sweet romancing
Something's gonna start

He stepped into the night
With his heart open wide
I was standing there
With nowhere left to hide
He looked to me like a shadow
Moving in the night
Then he took a hold of my hand
In the soft moonlight

And we were dancing
Dancing in the dark
Sweet romancing
Something's gonna start

I could hear his heartbeat
Pounding in the night
I could feel his body
Starting to be kind
With his soft red lips
Made up my mind
His soothing kiss
Was all I desired

And we were dancing
Dancing in the dark
Sweet romancing
Something's gonna start

We kissed and touched
But it wasn't enough
To stop this wheel of fire
One step at a time
And I knew he was mine
We were lost in the heat of desire

And we were dancing
Dancing in the dark
Sweet romancing
Something's gonna start

No way
No way at all
To stop us moving closer
Each look in his eyes
Made my heart beat in time
Over and over and over and over

Dancing in the dark
Sweet romancing
Something's gonna start

Kim Wilde,"This is your town, this is my place
This is where my whole world is lived in
Nothing much, and just out of reach of all the city lights
It's a high town, it's a low town
It's get here, come on you grow town
No-one does, but everyone thinks they're gonna make it soon
This is one place I respected
Now I feel it's really dejected
No-one cares and the people just stare
And a man on the box says
""Hey you, don't walk away, vote for me
You'll get more pay, keep working hard""
But they work slow

Here it comes now, Sunday morning
Just another sleepy town yawning
Down below everything looks just like another day
But, in the warm glow of the sunrise
There's a child who's searching with young eyes
Looking 'round and feeling inside he's gonna fly away
There was one time I was leaving
But the folks around me kept grieving
Friends said go, but my dad said no
And my mum kept saying
""Don't go, don't go away
Don't leave us, you've got to stay
Just raise them kids, oh mother no""

No prospects, just projects
Don't try to tell me we're living
There's no real need to try
Can't you see this town gonna die

Hail the new age, it's a rat cage
Join the place for breeding dumb spieces
All stacked up and doing whatever someone tells you to
Burn the place down, make it dead ground
Show the people just what they're missing
Wake up, wake up, can't you believe in what I'm telling you
There's a house where I was born in
Now it's changed without any warning
Cranes just crash and bricks just smash
While a billboard's saying
""Let's go, let's get away
Come fly me, you've weeks to pay
When sunshine calls, but I won't go

This is our town",Our Town
Kim Wilde,"I'm touching your face and I
Can't get very far
You travel a million miles
Always in the stars
And crossing the clouds
A fading moon
Whispered ""It's goodbye""
But as it starts to die

Stay awhile
Show your love
Child among the stars
Just stay awhile
Lay with me
Tell me who you are

I've never believed in much
What can I be worth ?
I'm always a shooting star
Falling down to earth
I prayed in my heart
You'd never know
Feelings wouldn't show
But now before you go

Stay awhile
Show your love
Child among the stars
Just stay awhile
Lay with me
Tell me who you are

And crossing the clouds
A fading moon
Whispers ""It's goodbye""

As the last song plays, everyone makes for home

You're just a dream that couldn't last

Take me tonight
Take me tonight
I want you, I want you - want me too ?

Who cares if it's wrong or it's right

There's a sound vaporising into vision
It's a sound in my head
That I feel and it shuts me in a prison

Say it will pass

Can you hear it

Water on glass running down again
Water on glass that sound
Water on glass running round again
Help me, the sound of running water's
Coming down

Dancing away
Like the lights on a moving coloured river
Sounds in my head seem to run
And again I feel a shiver

Well that's a different thing to talk about

You know I'd give you my love - if there were more

Do you remember when tears fell like rain
When hearts got broken again and again
The disillusionment after the pain
Seems everything stays the same

But time goes by and you`ve further to fall
You build your life like you`re building a wall
Then it surrounds you, and though you may call
You`re voice is so small

And all your expectations of how life should be
Have needed correction
There is no perfection but

Someday maybe you`ll stop living
In a world of fantasy
Someday open up your mind and see
live in a reality

Life`s in your hands but you`re closing your mind
'cause you`re afraid of the mess you will find
You`re scared that`s love gonna leave you behind
That you`re running out of time

And all your expectations of how life should be
Have needed correction
There is no perfection
But

Someday maybe you`ll stop living
In a world of fantasy
One day open up your mind and see
Live in a reality
Someday maybe you`ll stop looking
For a world of make believe
One day open up your eyes ans see
Make it a reality

Stop crying
Looking at life through bitter tears
And face your fears
To reveal the thruth inside
Just like a child

Someday maybe you`ll stop living
In a world of fantasy
One day open up your mind and see
Live in a reality
Maybe you`ll stop looking
For a world of make believe
Someday open up your eyes and see
Make it a reality

For the time we'd had
'Cause we'd been lonely far too long
Had enough of feeling sad
And no, it didn't take long
To right all the wrong
And hurt inside
And now i can't believe what's happening
Right before my eyes

Just look at the rain falling
Look at the thunder
Look at the storm in your hearts
Look at the waves crashing
Pulling us under
Helplessly lost in the dark

We could have lost so easily
And let it go
We had no reason to believe
That love was just about to grow
And we got given a chance
I'm so proud we didn't throw it away
'Cause broken hearts lie on the pavement
You see them every day

Our children will grow

Are we going to say that we weren't to blame

Let's think of the good things
Instead of all the bad
We mustn't give into
A world that's going mad
So hold on, we can survive
We've got to keep the spirit
Of destiny alive
Just say that we can if we try

Like the rivers need the mountains
Just like the flowers need the rain
Pleasure need the pain
However far away it seems
I'm dreaming for a world
In perfect armony

And we've got to face it
There's nowhere left to hide
(but we need) a determination
To change the wrong to right
The future's a baby born
Looking for us for strength
To keep it from harm
You know we'll succeed if we try

Like the rivers need the mountains
Just like flowers need the rain
Pleasure need the pain
How ever far away it seems
I'm dreaming for a world
In perfect harmony

Don't let your dreams escape
The future's ours to shape

I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance

Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind (kind hearts)

Got to get a brand-new experience, feeling right

You've stolen my pride
And I'm left defeated
And crushed by your lies

Savaged my soul and took over control
And then when you'd used all the love you found
You left without trace
Not a note or a single goodbye

Stop giving up, you know you can't refuse me

I've watched the old me disappear

Just don't mean anything anymore
'cause suddenly

You came, and changed the way I feel
No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place

I've never felt good with permanent things
Now I don't want anything to change
You can't imagine the joy you bring
My life won't be the same
And I'll be there when you call
I'll pick you up if you should fall
'cause I have never felt such inspiration
Nobody else ever gave me more because

You came, and changed the way I feel
No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place

I watch you sleep in the still of the night
You look so pretty when you dream
So many people just go through life
Holding back, they don't say what they mean
But it's easy for me
Since you came
No one could love you more

We'll pray the dawn could never break another day
Then we'll kiss, say goodbye
And tomorrow I'll be on my way

Been a long time down
Looking at the ground and feeling bad
Heaven knows I've tried
But the pain inside just made me sad
When you're looking back at yesterday
And find you can't let go
You need someone who can lift you up
To get ready for tomorrow

Baby I'm high
High on the love we make
That's what you do for me
Baby, I'm high
I am in ecstasy
Boy, what you doing to me
'cause baby I'm high
High on the love we make
Baby I'm high on you

Took me by surprise
When I saw the passion in your eyes
Now I've got you here
Life is is good and feel satisfied
Now I'm flying with the birds above
I'm floating to the moon
Got the clouds to walk on every day
And the stars shine when you walk in the room

Now I'm high
High on the love we make
That's what you do for me
Baby, I'm high
I'am in ecstasy
Boy, what you're doing to me
'cause baby I'm high
High on the love we make

Kim Wilde,"In the day I can smile though I want to die
I hold on, hold on
I can keep it together for a little while
And be strong, so strong
But when the sun goes down and I'm all alone
I haven't the strength to fight
That's when my tears give into the night
Tell me how, How much loneliness can one heart take
Without the chance that it will break in two
And why I'm holding on to a love that has gone
Tell me how to carry on

I believed that meeting you would be my destiny
Your love would come to set me free
So why am I left standing here alone
Won't you please come and take me home

Kim Wilde,"I can't help it when you're near me
I don't think straight, I get all confused
I just lose all my concentration
With no question at all I'd surrender to you
Standing here so close together
I can feel all the magic again
But I'm holding back the emotion
Couldn't take anymore of the heartache and pain
I know I should take it slow but,
The minute I see you I just let go

Chorus :
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise
I just have to look in your eyes
I'm in a daze, I lose control
Deeper inside my mind
I'm leaving the real world behind
I give to you my heart and my soul

It's a gamble, can we take it
Playing safe is no way to survive
There's a chance for us, we can make it
Give our love room to breathe to keep it alive
Admit that we made mistakes but
I know in my heart that it's not too late

Chorus :
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise
I just have to look in your eyes
I'm in a daze, I lose control
Deeper inside my mind
I'm leaving the real world behind
I give to you my heart and my soul

It feels like I'm falling in love with you all over again
And I'm trying not to let it show
But the minute I see you I just let go
I just have to look in your eyes
I'm in a daze, I lose control

Now and forever
I will always love you
Two words collide
Before we knew what was happening
Love crashed into our lives
So helplessly we fell so hard
Guess something had to break
We made our first mistake
We thought we'd found the answer over night
To all the problems that were in our lives
And now I feel the tears
And not a minute passes by
When I don't wish
That you were near
Time will never mend (oh no)
This broken heart
Now and forever
I will always love you
Pain that never ends (oh oh)
You can be sure
Now and forever
I will always love you
When you hear my name
Tell me how do you fell
Is it just like me
My heart fills up with pain
Just the mention of you makes me fall apart
But where is there to start
You sais we missed our chance and it's too late
But I believe there's one more chance to take
I know we said goodbye
But I still can't let go
Please give us one more try
Time will never mend (oh no)
This broken heart
Now and forever
I will always love you
Pain that never ends (oh oh)
You can be sure
Now and forever
I will always love you

No matter what you do

I'll be true
I won't lie baby
I'll never lie to you
I'll be true
Trust me when I say

Giving promises they can't keep
And after their hearts are broken
With words they both wish had never been spoken
And lies that they pin their hope on but

Yeah, it took a lot of time for me to realise

It's here, looking me in the eye
It's here, here all the time
It's here, I've always tried to find a way to go
But now I know
It's here

You can spend your life competing
In a world that talks too loud
You can lose your own direction
Getting lost among the crowd
Confusion - is it any wonder
That the road ahead's not clear
Well you can try too hard to find it
Now I realise

It's here, looking me in the eye
It's here, here all the time
It's here, I've always tried to find a way to go
",It's Here
Kim Wilde,"Well it sounded like a whisper
But soon became a cry
And the moment that I touch you
I know the reason why - we got love
No union is stronger than a woman with a man
I'm gonna give love in the natural way
With everything I can
Never mind if things go wrong
You and I will still be strong
And how I love you now

Oh baby, we're here tonight
We can make it last forever
Wen can make it last for life
Oh, baby, no matter what
I'm gonna give love in the natural way
With everything I got

All times it can be gentle
And at times it can be cruel
It can treat you like a stranger
It can treat you like a fool
But tonight I wanna hold you
Cos tonight you're gonna see
I'm gonna give you love in the natural way
And keep you here with me
Lovin' like you've never known
Now at last We're on our own
And I still love you now

Oh, baby, we're here tonight
We can make it last forever
We can make it last for life
Oh, babe, it's me and you
And it's a natural reaction
When you feel the way we do
What is left that's still unknown
Let's discover on our own

Cos when love's the culmination
Of everything you feel
Well it's the only thing that's precious
It's the only thing that's real",Love in the Natural Way
Kim Wilde,"(This I swear...)
Each and every way I can
I will prove to you
I've got a fortune in my hands when I'm holding you
Never want to let you go again
And that's the truth
I will try and answer all your prayers
This I swear

There's always a danger
There's always a fear
Love's not gonna make it out of here
I'm not asking for perfection
Just want a love that's true
And in return
I'll do my best for you
It seems the higher we climb
The further we fall together
But right here, I'll vow
Baby, I promise you know

Each and every way I can
I will prove to you
I've got a fortune in my hands when I'm holding you
Never want to let you go again
And that's the truth

This I swear

We each have our moments
Our times of doubt
But I know deep down
Don't want to live without you
You're the exception to the rule
'cause where love's concerned
I guess I've been a fool
I know it's a long, long road
But as long as we stand together
Right here, I'll vow
Baby I promise you now

Each and every way I can
I will prove to you
I've got a fortune in my hands when I'm holding you

Kim Wilde,"A long time ago, you promised yourself
They're all gonna know me someday
Well, you got what you wanted but look at you now
You lost something good on the way
So where did it go? Tell me, where did it go?
But you wouldn't know

Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are?

Now everything seems to be going your way
And everyone loves what they see
But you ruin it all with the things that you say
So tell me, how does it feel?
When you're all alone, how does it feel?
You're alone, nothing is real

Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are?

You believe a ridiculous lie
You can't see you've become all the things you despise
But I know who you are and you've gone too far
Just who do you think you are?

You can keep all your dreams
But you don't have to lose yourself
'Cause one day, you're gonna break
When the face in the mirror looking back at you
Is a stranger that you can't place, oh, oh
Just who do you think you are?

Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are?

You believe a ridiculous lie
You can't see you've become all the things you despise

When you came and took me over
Believing every word you say
You had me hypnotized

The dream we had is just a lie
And my heart is calling, calling

It's not me

No more lies, I won't cry for tomorrow

You need the perfect girl to fit inside your perfect world
It's something I'll never be

These days it always seems so hard
When it started it came easy
I should have know you'd play my heart

Anyway you please

Kim Wilde,"Written by m. tsuchiya & b. crunchfield

You lay me down in satin sheets softly
You're movin' slow
It's gonna be everything just for me
I know how you want to love me

Your love is sweet, I'm going down easy
But I don't know
What I'm doing here anyway, it's not me
I don't like what I feel
It's so oh woh unreal
You better leave

You go I call the stranger in black
But can't you see you're on the wrong track
Tonight I face the danger of love that knows no promises
Alive I know I'm not coming back

Bitter is better
I gotta stop and walk away
Bitter is better
Your kind of love is not for me
Bitter is better
Locked away in your lovin' sweetness
Lost the key and I just don't need this

I'm not the woman you were looking for anyway
High on a pedestal, lillywhite
Givin' me diamond rings
You're just too much for me
I'll lose my sanity
You better leave
",Bitter Is Better
Kim Yarbrough,"There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
Finally, I can see you crystal clear,
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare,
See how I'll leave with every piece of you,
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
The scars of your love remind me of us,
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
I can't help feeling,

We could have had it all,
(Your gonna wish you, never had met me)
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told,
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair,
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,

The scars of your love remind me of us,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all,
Rolling in the deep,
You had my heart inside of your hands,
But you played it with a beating.

Throw your soul through every open door,
Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all,

We could have had it all.
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),

We could have had it all,

Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand,

be a miracle waiting in sight

of the things that they missed
From the ocean and on the sand,
they built a building where
everbody sang
Gradually more people gathered
and the song grew
larger and larger
Enjoyed music breeze
from the sea
The view they dreamed to see
But all the 状況 changed
Everybody faded away
They walked, walked away
Now realized what they missed
from the list

Walk my way

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty

Kimberley Locke,"She was so attractive
Her parents so protective
Met a little boy with a Lexus
They made out on a mattress
She thought he loved her
But now he don't even bother
Had a little baby named Donna
But Donna ain't got no father

Seventeen, candy curls
All they saw was a dumb young girl
Spend a little dough, talk a little game
Look what that got you babe

All they show on the video

Always seemed a little different
Met another girl at the college
And came out of the closet
All her friends she had before
They don't come around no more
She feels so abandoned 
Won't even leave her apartment

Hates her life, hates herself
Just wants to be like everybody else
Can't go home, can't go home
What will they say

She gave in to prejudice
No one came to her defense

Even though I know you've had a bad day

You're doing this and doing that
Always putting yourself last
A whole lot of give and not enough take
But you can only be strong so long before you break

So fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you

Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here, baby, fall

Forget about the world tonight
All that's wrong and all that's right
Lay your head on my shoulder, let it fade away, yeah
And if you want to let go, baby it's okay

So fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you

Fall, go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear
Every worry, every tear
I'm right here, baby, fall

Oh, hold on, hold on
Hold on to me

And Barbara in Nashville says we're welcome to stay
I'll buy you glasses in Texas, a hat from New Orleans
In the morning you can tell me your dreams

You know I've seen it before, this mist that covers your eyes
You've been looking for something that's not in your life
My intentions are true, won't you take me with you?
Baby, you can sleep while I drive

Oh, is it other arms you want to hold you?
The stranger, the lover, you're free
Can't you get that with me?

Come on baby, let's get out of this town
I've got a full tank of gas and the top rolled down
If you won't take me with you I'll go before night is through

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores

That thrills and delights me, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core

Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

You wanna know what I really believe

There's a fire burning up in here
See the smoke coming out of my ears

Oh no, we both know
More trouble's gonna find us
If we're all alone
I wanna show you what I really mean
But you're always on the outside looking in

Oh won't you come into my head
Come inside, lie down in my head
Oh won't you come into my head
I just wanna have you up in my head

Look through my eyes, I'm your binocular
And every time you get a shock you'll learn
What's it like to be in my dimension
I'll be the center of your attention

Come listen to all the sounds I hear
The quiet prose and the crack in my snare
Make your mark on my territory
Carve your name in every cavity

I don't wanna be all caught up in your
Social scene

I don't wanna be
Be in your front seat girl

But I ain't gonna follow suit

You got Morrissey and Joy Division CD
But I don't go for them
I can't move to that beat

I like Marvin Gaye and gospel music
My soul and my heart
But you call it noise
You always spoil my favorite parts

I don't wanna be in your posse girl
It's not my scene
I don't need your company

You're skipping school 'cause it's cool
But it's not for me
I learned to dream
I learned to read at this old academy

You're out make every man
Your fleeting dream
But I'm a one-man woman
I'm all down with monogamy

You cuss and curse
So they think that you're rough and tough
But I like Shakespeare
And I find dammit heavy enough

You like new age
All the rage, philosophy
But I don't read my palms
I read the psalms
They speak to me

Don't wanna be in your posse girl
I don't wanna
Be caught in your social machine

Don't wanna be in your posse girl
It's not my scene, all of the aristocracy

It's not you
Maybe I'm just to pedantic
I'm a self-confessed
Idealist and romantic
You say join the gang
Be my yang and I'll be your yin

But try as I might
I'm not your type, I don't fit in

I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl

And I send my apologies

Kimbra,"There's a heartbeat in the distance, a flicker of light ahead
I've been down the street, where they offer good deals
I'm shaking hands with the man who says he'll give me my dreams
Reaching up for a taste from the hand that feeds
I feel it growing from a whisper, to a shout and a fist in the air
I could smell the fire from miles away,
But I was always going to run after the chase
I didn't leave you, I just went my way

I know I've been here before
It must have been years or more
Like the first the day that I got off of the plane
And nobody cared to know of my name
I think I've been here

I've grown out of my own muse
But my heart, it hasn't changed
Sally I can see you, you're not the girl you once used to be
I don't know how I got here
But my heart, it hasn't changed

There's a melody I'm missing
But your song travels out to me still
Like the eyes of the dusk in the hot of the glow
But I was always going to run after the storm
I didn't leave you, I just leapt out from the shore.

Ooh it's not like it was before.
My hair's short and my jeans are tight.
Time passed in the night time over my head
Suddenly, I'm in the sea, and I'm unprepared
I wish you'd been here.

I feel so light in my years
In my heart, it has no sense
Sally I can see you, you're not the girl you once used to be
I don't know how I got here
But my heart it hasn't changed

I let go of your hand, I knew our time was measured
I sailed out to foreign lands, just to fly together
There's a child that I left in the town I treasure
I'm running fast but I'm not running away

Sally I can see you, I'm not the girl I was
I don't know how I got here.

Sally I can see you, I'm not the girl I once used to be

I need a map but not the destination
Need a compass but not a conversation

Want the price but not the raise

I want the jump but not the height
Let me fall but catch me mid flight

Only went down for the company

I forgot to mention
That you would come back home when I call
Left no sign, nothing at all

I need the rules but not the regulations
Want the wisdom but not the information
Need the light but not the heat of the day
Need your hands to show me how to pray

Of all the dots and lines that took me higher
Away from traffic and smiles of tire
I like the nights but not the tangled wires

Need the pulse to feel alive
All the world's just made it seem all quiet
This has all become far too loud
I like you more when you don't make a sound

You're heavier than I knew

You stay inside that bubble

In your black hole
You turn from the skies
You dance with your demise
I'll be here when you come home

We've all gotta break down
Let me come and break down, there with you

Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out
Everyday's like talking in your sleep

Open up your heart, open up your heart
Open up your heart and let me pull you out of here

I've got high hopes baby
But all you do is take me down to depths that I never knew
You've got two arms baby
They're all tangled in ladies of the black skies posing blue
Let go of your mother
And turn to your brother
Not a long gone lover's noose
Sometimes baby the hardest part of breaking
Is leaving pieces behind you

Oh we've all gotta get by
Let me come and hold you high, with you

Took you on a waltz of hypocrisy
She broke your bones, now you're lying in the dirt
The shadow of a hunter under your torture

You've tainted every moment till death do we part

The pennies are cascading down your wishing well
I know you didn't mean it when you counted to ten

When did it get so damn cold
You're so seasonal
We flickered and swayed
Each time the winter soul came
I remember gold days
Under love's warm haze

Old flame, you're still the one that holds me
Can't you feel it burning
Can't you feel it burning still
Old flame, I fell for your inferno
Where did all the love go
Can't you feel the wind blow you closer to me

I went by your house today
When did you get so hollow
So closed, so overgrown
But I flicker and sway
Still dancing on the aftertaste
I remember gold days
Wrapped up in the warmth we made

Old flame, you're still the one that holds me
Can you feel it burning
Can you feel it burning still
Old flame, I fell for your inferno
Where did all the love go
Can't you feel the wind blow

Smoke skies, colors and cloud nines
Circles and straight lines and drowned eyes

From such heights, I fell into Fahrenheit
And time only fuels the desire

Long as he wears that plain gold ring

Nighttime comes calling on me
I know why I'll never be free
I can't stop these teardrops of mine
I'm gonna love him till the end of time

Kimmie Rhodes,"I've seen them down in the valley,
Wild roses that grow by the side of the road,
And they don't really mind if you pick them
And they don't really care if you leave them alone. 

Wild roses... Wild roses open their hearts gently by the by.
Wild roses grow unattended and nobody ever knows why.
When the sun goes down in the valley
There's music in the night that it brings,
And the roses quietly listen
To the song that the whippoorwill sings.

Wild roses ... wild roses open their hearts gently by the by.
Wild roses grow unattended and nobody ever knows why.
You won't hear the sound of them leaving
As they softly fade into the snow,
And they don't really care if you pick them.
Wild roses just grow by the side of the road.

Kimmie Rhodes,"Early this morning as the day began

I was sweeping on the porch.

I could hear the neighbor lady singing songs to Jesus

and the dog started barking the chorus.

I said to myself we've got a little band

and we're making a joyful noise

just like bells of joy ringing for the Lord.

 

Now the riverss , and the mountains, and the stars and the planets

go spinning through the sky

when God looks down on his creation

and he breaths the breath of life.

It stirs the soul of every heart

and every creature sings it's part

like bells of joy ringing for the Lord.

 

All God's children, God the Father

is listening from the throne.

The sigh of peace would be like a symphony

if we would all start singing that song.

We could all look to heaven and raise our voice.

Kin,"Did you see me fall away?
At what point did fate crumble to the ground?
I thought I found something to last forever.
Holding on with desperate tears,
I was screaming but you could not seem to hear me cry and now, I surrender.

Broken pieces all around

Better think of something fast.
Better off leaving with these last times
So you?ll keep remembering me.
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time
When you keep remembering me forever. Remember me forever

Tell me was it good for you?
Cause its what kept me glued to what I knew all along was going in the wrong direction.
I don't think I gave up too early.
I don't think life is long enough to go and waste it all on imperfection

Broken pieces all around

Better think of something fast
Better off leaving with these last times
So you'll keep remembering me
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time

I swim to the surface always

Yo, Step into reality, it's a cold cold world 
You got to learn to accept it, feels like I've been neglected 
All these bands coming out and they sound alright 
All these videos on tv and they look alright 
I spent my whole life spilling my guts between the lines 
Putting in more work than you will ever know than when I rhyme 
Tryin to press the people so I can reach the masses 
Give them what they want with this pen that's plastic (Life)
I got a message I'm a put it in a bottle 
Sign the bottom of the paper and let the whole world swallow 
Today can be tomorrow, ain't no telling when I'm leaving 
I'm a rock this microphone even when I'm barely breathin' 
When you start sleepin, D-loc starts creepin 
When you actin a fool, D-loc's always thinking 
Be clever when you play me because it's comin back to hull 
I can feel my heats rising and it's pissin me off 
And when it's pissin me off I got no choice 
But to crack snap back at you like a chain reaction 
I'm gettin older dog you better watch your mouth 
You better think before you speak on the mic or get knocked out 
It's been a minute and your shit better stop 
Bring your punk ass back to Cali, bitch ass get popped 
You ain't never in Cali, wonder why they don't accept you 
Your sound's getten flopped, plus you got a fuckin attitude 

Life
Life's a constant struggle 

I was never really understood, had a lot of misunderstandings 
Not too many saw my plan, so it left me standing in my own two shoes 
Now what the fuck was I suppose to do? 
Givin a fight, be a man or take my life 
To make ends meet I did more wrongs than rights
Couldn't hold a job, I can't handle being bossed
In and out of rehabs, from border schools I was tossed 
Started hanging with the wrong crowd 
Caught slanging by my pops and got thrown out 
On my own once again I had to make it happen 
That's just a little of my life before I started rappin' 
But I always kept in touch with my dog Dustin 
That's the one friend that I never stopped trusting 
Next thing you know I'm living over at his pad 
Me and him and Saint we was workin for his dad 
Drinkin tallboys after work every night 
Takin hits in the garage out of metal pipes 
Working long ass hours no 9 to 5 
But you gotta do what it takes to survive 
That's around the time that we met Daddy X 
And ever since then we've been on a new quest 
Kottonmouth was formed so it began a new chapter 
Of my life that I'm livin til I'm in the after after

Ain't gotta take it and no catch up, set my own pace
Can't even feel the fear now
Closer to the end now do what I feel

Feels closer, grip almost gone
I'm feelin' looser, so tired of tryin' to hold on
It's lookin' crystal clear now
Borderline is near now, I can just breathe

I'm headed for the brink of insanity
And I hope to get there soon
I'm tired of being sane in this world now
There's too much to be consumed

I'm headed for the brink of insanity
I can see the door not far ahead
I hope that they sedate me
And give me a rest

I don't know if I'll be back home, I kinda like it
I been caught up in life, work too long
I kinda like the idea, I can't even feel here
I can just be

Ignore me if I seem insane 'cause I
I'm so happy life ain't where I am
I'm headed for a world too deep for the to get to
Set myself free

I'm headed for the brink of insanity
And I hope to get there soon

God, it's been a whole lotta years

I can feel it, life is changed but I'm still here

Had many lovers and been in love
At least two times
Couldn't seem to get it right
On I keep movin'
But I'm still here in the same old spot

Happiness comes but passes by
I got everything I need
But alone I sit empty inside

'Cause I'm still here, still waiting on you
Right here, another man won't do
Still here, still waiting on you

I know it's useless, I hear you're okay
Cruel to know that you can move about freely
When I'm still caught up in love's cage

I don't want this love, set me free
Life moved ahead and it's fine but forgot me
Let me go, I got things I wanna do
I'm not whole but God I need to be

Spend days in many crowded rooms
But still I'm filled with nothing

Seems could finally come around, right

And I can see the signs
I think you better stop
The world could end before I be a star

Is everybody asleep? Life as we know
It is on the way to fizz out
Right, running to malls, catch markdowns
Ignoring life force breakdowns

You go and you go, yeah
Rushing and building your dreams
On such a shaky ground, I think you better stop
The world could end, she needs attention

I'm pulling weight upon my back
And I can see it's not much longer 'til
This weight becomes a burden making me stand still

And I can see another light on
Moving faster through this room
And I am waiting for your company
You say I'm not alone, well better let me see

Chorus:
You are what I dream
I'm breathing you, you're breathing me
It's better now that I can see
You breathing honesty

A conversation had
A void of silence grew
An overbearing aching in my heart led me to
Speak out my words, I trembled wishing that I knew

Chorus

Bridge:
And it was worth the silence worth the tears
That brought me here now to face these fears
Now I'm stronger, so are you
Here at this place we've gotten to

Kina Grannis,"Don't cry darling
You know it hurts to see your tears
Don't cry
I know you think you'll never love again
Darling all things take time

2 years 3 months 5 days an hour ago they fell in deep
And ever since the tie has grown so strong emotions steep
Said, ""I could spend forever in your arms, so can I please?""
The answer unexpected wrung his heart, fell to his knees

Chorus

This is the moment for so long she has been waiting
Benevolent no less becoming what it's meant to be
But as he passes no long glances she advances meets his face again
Not a smile not a tear no grin its over gone its sinking in

Chorus

Bridge:
Don't stop your fall, take it in, take it all
Watch your step, broken shards of your heart on the ground
Just keep the pieces safe for now, you feel that they could cut somehow
But soon I know you'll find a way, and piece it back again someday

Chorus
",Don't Cry
Kina Grannis,"Blue like my hands
Blue like my heart
I drown inside
So it came that I settled for
This raft in mind
Drift away, away, away down

You never fell I picked you up
I'm waking up early
No one ever feels like they're perfect
But I feel we're perfect here

I've got to speak
My eyes can't keep this secret down and gone away
I'm feeling it shouldn't be long until we both remember why
Why we kept each other around all this time

I sensed you'd come around, boy
And here we stand
It is so strange how we've come so far and nothing's changed

We are what we are
Come so far
To keep me down and gone away
I'm feeling it shouldn't be long until we both remember why
Why we kept each other around all this time
",Down and Gone (The Blue Song)
Kina Grannis,"Get beneath the bed it's another attack
But when the monster turns man don't know how to react
And then daddy named it the singing bridge
In memory of the ghosts that lived here
My timing could not have been better
She cried

Chorus:
Although she's gone
Although it's over
A memory hangs on
A memory

(Repeat)

As the dust settles and the dust is rising
Up above the clouds a dove is crying
I leave a trail of copper faces all around the town in different places
I'd like to think that they'll be happy
Or try

Chorus
",Memory
Kina Grannis,"Bright night and we chase the moon searching for adventure
Hush

Our feet gracing mountain tops skipping cross horizons
Silhouetted against against the stars

I've tried so hard I'm searching through layers and trying to make out the words
Delicate designs distracting me from what I'm trying to find
A melody so sweet, from out the the walls it creeps to my ears
Such a sound I have long awaited to hear

We breathe, making little clouds, smiling through the dark and cold
As the wind breaks we shatter to the sky

Chorus
",Night
Kina Grannis,"Sometimes it's hard to look you in the eye
The mess I've created it stands idly by
And I don't expect the dishes to do themselves
But that sure would be nice

Cause I am moving circles, falling back
My past has caught up to me, and I've lost track
Of what is history and what is a book marked page
I'd always hoped to come back to someday

Chorus:
Don't speak too soon
I'll likely shut my ears or shut down
I'm mostly floating
And I'm not ready to come down

Don't wipe away my tears so quickly
Do you even know if they're happy or sad
Maybe I need to let them fall
Clean me up and wash me out
And let me drown for a while

You don't have to hold my hand through this
You've got enough to carry on your own
I think you'll need both hands for that
I think for now I'd be better off alone

Chorus

Bridge:
I will be fine,
I need to grow
No expectations please
Because I don't know
Where I'm going or where I even stand
I'm just trying to find out exactly who I am

Chorus
",Too Soon
Kina Grannis,"There's nothing left to say when its over
Could wait another day, but there's no more
So please stop coming back to the matter
Let it be it will be better

Untie that little string on your finger
And let it swim away in the water
And please resist the urge to dive under
Let it be it will be better
Let it be it will be better

Chorus:
And walk on my friend walk on
There is no need to linger let it go
And go on my friend go on
And do what you need to
To get you to where you need

There's nothing you can do when you tire
Of things that you one loved but no longer
So please don't hide the tears with your laughter
Let it be it will be better

Release the little bird on your shoulder
It's hard now but its harder when she's older
And please don't change your mind she'll go faster
Let it be it will be better
Let it be it will be better

Chorus

Bridge:
Hiding under the table
Like I did when I was small and scared
It's a ways away from places I should clearly be instead
I've been busy finding places that exist inside my head

By a sovereign mind
Whenever I'm lost, it's my own intention

I have to think everything through

I have been talking with people at night
At night, people have told me that you've been looking my way
Why can't I see through the dark aura you cast every time?

I wish for a time when my soul would not fall
I have been wandering, watching, and wondering
If you, you will be with me tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I, why have I been out wandering through people?

Getting older, lying alone
You would think that I have been lonely
But you have no idea
You cling to me with my forgiving call and I wonder
Why I cannot venture to guess why I'm looking so down on myself
I have been wandering, wandering, and wondering",Wandering and Wondering
Kina Grannis,"Be it broken down or beaten up is what you'll have to offer
And not a moment short of time is like a medicine
They say it heals all wounds are deep and painful, I don't buy it
But I would sell it to you for a decent price

Never would I fall too short of expectations not expected
And never should you take to heart whatever I just said
A little birdie told me something
Really, birds don't talk, but his chirp was nice
I think I gathered what he meant

What's said is not always what is meant
Breathing this fire, leaves me with no desire to be read

Reading books, I've found my eyes, they like to wander off the pages
To play with many things impertinent to my mind
Sometimes I like to sleep, it's cool, but it is overrated
I'd rather just be singing nonsense through the night

What's said is not always what is meant
Breathing this fire, leaves me with no desire to be read

Eighteen years behind me, many more to come, I am excited
I hope I didn't jinx myself, please knock on wood for me
Or write a letter to a friend, tell them it's time to listen
To what I'm saying, but it's not said, don't let it get into your head

Just when you thought that you were sane
Like clever convicts, they came running, escaping from your brain
These words, they trickled out these fickle conversations so concerned
With rationale, I don't know how, but I think I am done for now

What's said is not always what is meant
Breathing this fire, leaves me with no desire to be read",What Is Said
Kina Grannis,"I was down by the water
And I was so scared
So frightend by the crashing waves
You were right there beside me
And you were so prepared, so unafraid
You were laughing in the rain
You always new what you needed
And I was so unsure
It shook the ground
I walked upon
So understandly you stepped away 
To give me a little time to look around
And catch my breath
No I don't wanna walk alone
I wanna walk together with you now...oooooo
Why can't we be eachothers wings
Carrying eachother away from unfortunate things
We were there when it mattered
And that is all we need to carry us away
So why can't we fly?
Why can't we fly away from uncertainty
And why can't we fly
Why can't I? NO
Why can't I know?
For so long 
Its been awhile since these clouds have been lifted
Why can't I leave it all behind? No
Rise aboove it all and Fly

Or what must be
Use your efforts for a cause

Is things are better

Kina Grannis,"I've been walking down this road too long, too far
And I'm thinking it's time that I turn back.
I'm losing myself in my own confusing rhythms
In the path from heart to brain I lack.

Wish the things I felt were clearer
Like the moonlight over me tonight.
You know all I want's to have you nearer
And a love so high that we'd take flight.

Chorus:
So long my ways, I won't miss you
I'll be all right this time.
Follow the lines and dreams can come true.
Just feel my way and shut out the light.

Don't understand how I can know
Just how and why I ought to feel
And then when it comes to feeling that feeling
My head stops it from being real

I wish that I could see right through you
To see just what you see in me
I get so scared someday I'll lose that, lose you
When you look inside and I'm empty

Chorus

Bridge:
But I won't forget
That first time I said those words
Though in my head, I know
It meant something more than this
Find my feelings, save them from the part of me
That confuses everything, when I knew all along
That my heart was never wrong

To where I can see it, there's no return
And I know should I be the one to fall
I might as well beat it, yeah yeah

Step by step she elevated
Climbing clouds and pulling with all her might
Closing her mind to the ill-fated, she sighed
Could this leap by overrated?
Could she prove she had control of her life?
She had for so long anticipated
This test of courage, this test of pride, no

If I tried to come back down
To where I can see it, there's no return
And I know should I be the one to fall
I might as well beat it, beat it

Is that I am real
Free to be just the way I am
And if what I am
Is troublesome for you

Kina Grannis,"Well I believe in a land
A land where fairy tales await
Kisses hang on hooks like bait
And swing slowly back and forth
Before the faces of two lonely souls
This land in which I'm speaking of
Houses such hatred, grief and love
So many wild and crazy things
Emotions you would never dream of
Yet they're tearing through
Your burdened heart, your soaking eyes

And I think it's time
I realized the strange reality
That this life, this land
Is here and now and this person is me
But I'm not gonna waste this moment next time

Now when the night has found its end
You're sitting with that special friend
A pause, it drifts between then and your departure
Don't walk away, that's unwanted space
Lingering between you and the other
Move in, move in, move in for the kill

And I think it's time
I realized the strange reality
That this life, this land
Is here and now and this person is me

You will not move gracefully forward, no

Kina Grannis,"Swarms of people they move in every direction
Some eyes they wander while others are just glued to their feet
And how I wonder what goes on behind those eyes,
There are lives, growing older and they're growing wise

So amazed by all the many different faces,
Searching for traces of emotion wondering places they have been
And on occasion, someone will take a look at me,
But do they see a unique person, or am I part of a vast sea

Chorus:
Sing me your song, solve my mystery
I won't do you no harm, just wanted to see
Sing me your song, solve my mystery
I won't do you no harm, just wanted to see
That you're a person just like me

They are they background of your everyday situation
Look all around you start to wonder really who these people are
They might be watching, wondering quite the same of you
So break this auto pilot path and try to start something new

Chorus
",People
Kina Grannis,"Try

Having nowhere else to go
He was lonely, she was cold.
Whenever they went out
It seemed as though the world began to grow
The two they both had not felt big enough
To take in something of their own
And they kept moving along, singing a song
A sad song, of how they'd never learn
And they'd never know

Chorus:
To try.
They've been paralyzed by fearful eyes
And realize you can move along
Write your own song
And be on your way

He had always dreamed to change
The world around him,
Rearrange the mess
Because through his eyes it all was beautiful
But not to all the rest
He had so much to say, he had so much to show
But he kept moving along, singing a song
A sad song, of how he'd never learn
And he'd never know

Chorus

She was unsure of many things
But disregarding all the others, she loved to sing.
But she was too scared to fail
Too scared to give it a go
And she kept moving along, singing a song
A sad song, of how'd she'd never learn
And she'd never know

If you start learning to stay and speak your mind
And I'll keep writing my songs
If you stop thinking you're wrong today.

Kina Grannis,"I heard it in your voice when your love died
On a telephone connection spinning miles and miles of wire
You said it was over and I cried and cried
You were gone before I said goodbye

And I don't like to think it is true
The distance came between us like a knife that cut through
When did we go wrong and let it all undo
The only one I ever loved was you

Would you stay just a little my love
Would you just wait just a little my love
Cause the hole in the middle of my heart needs fillin' up
If you stayed just a little that's enough

It kills me as I lay awake at night
Remembering the last kiss that we shared doesn't feel right
Is it impossible for me to win this fight
Keep you a little a longer in my life.

Would you stay just a little my love
Would you just wait just a little my love
Cause the hole in the middle of my heart needs fillin' up
If you stayed just a little that's enough

Whispering the places you have been
And I look back upstream

Everybody knows the river comes
The river goes but you stopped here
You stopped here for me
You took my heart in tow
How could I let you go

I doubt anyone can keep up
Keep up, keep up
Keep up, keep up with you
I doubt anyone can keep up
Keep up, keep up
Keep up, keep up with you

Rolling on dear river does it end
I saw you through the canyon and the bend
Did you look back for me

I could fight the flow
And tug of war the undertow
But I’d never, not ever succeed
So when you’re out to sea
I hope you think of me

Keep up, keep up with you

That it's been 3 weeks and no one talks about you anymore?

And so ready to surf the sink
'Til the sponges are flooded and we're all forced underneath
All I do is wait

It's so good for my weak ego
Can't get past what comes naturally to me
It comes natural to use

There's a new smell in the air

A hundred little baby fishes
With baby bottle mouths to feed
Crooners crawl themselves like whores

I hold her now that she's old

Oh look outside the window, there's a woman being grabbed
They've dragged her to the bushes and now she's being stabbed
Maybe we should call the cops and try to stop the pain

Kind of Like Spitting,"Oh, I am the Unknown Soldier who died in World War Two.
I didn't want to fight, it was the only thing to do.
I was the victim of a world that went insane--
Will you show me that I didn't die in vain.

Remember me, when the crosses are a burnin',
Remember me, when the racists come around.
Remember me, when the tides of peace are turnin',
Remember me and please don't let me down.

On the South Pacific Islands and the Iwo Jima sands
We raised the flag of freedom over many distant lands
And every time I killed a man my own heart felt the pain--
Will you show me that I didn't die in vain.

Remember me, when the crosses are a burnin',
Remember me, when the racists come around.
Remember me, when the tides of peace are turnin',
Remember me and please don't let me down.

And I carried my old rifle to the European shore
And every friend that died made me die a little more.
Have pity on the man who put a bullet through my brain
And show me that I didn't die in vain.

Remember me, when the crosses are a burnin',
Remember me, when the racists come around.
Remember me, when the tides of peace are turnin',
Remember me and please don't let me down.

When the Fascists started marching many millions had to pay;
We saw them rise to power but we looked the other way.
It happened once before and it can happen once again--
Will you show me that I didn't die in vain.

and you say that your pockets are bare.

Now don't tell me your troubles,

no I don't have the time to spare.

But if you want to get together and fight
           A             D       G
good buddy that's what I want to hear.

And you tell me that your job was taken away
by a big ol' greasy machine.
And you tell me that you don't collect no more pay
and your belly is growing lean.

Now if I had the jobs to give
you know I'd give them all away.
But don't waste your breath calling out my name
if you don't have nothing to say.

And you tell me that you don't have nothing to do
and you keep on wasting your time.
And you say when you want to get your family some food
you gotta stand in a relief line.

Now it's a sin and a bloody shame
'bout the way they're pushing you 'round.
But when you decide not to take no more
you know I'll put my money down.

'Cause I've seen your kind many times before
And I'll see 'em many times again.
Oh but every bad thing that's happened to you
has happened to better men.

So don't explain that you've lost your way
that you've got no place to go.
You've got a hand and a voice and you're not alone
Brother that's all you need to know.

And if you're still wondering what I'm trying to say
let me tell you what it's all about.
Now nobody listens to a single man
when he's walkin' 'round down and out.

So if you're looking for an answer
he's standing there by your side.
And you'll never really know how far you'll go
'til you join together and try.

And the sands will be shifting from my sight when I'm gone
Can't add my name into the fight while I'm gone
So I guess I'll have to do it while I'm here

And I won't be laughing at the lies when I'm gone
And I can't question how or when or why when I'm gone
Can't live proud enough to die when I'm gone

But she keeps them in her pocket
She hides them in the sand
I remember so well dark nights, spine to spine
So she has to stay behind to recover

I am thinking of Allison's trust
It's been so hard to find
I know I won't get it this time

I am dreaming of Allison's light
Coming into to bloom

I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
Now we're alone and I'm singing my song for you

I hoped your image of me is what I hoped it to be
I treated you unkind but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darlin' won't you see right through me
When we're alone and I am singing my song for you

You taught me precious secrets of a love withholding nothing
You came out front when I was hiding
Now I am so much better, if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Think of when we were together

Kindergarten,"Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons,
Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some grave sites, out by the highway,
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance,
I'm getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto,
I've lived all over this town

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey,
I ain't got time for that now

Transmit the message, to the receiver,
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas,
You don't even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading,
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime,
I might not ever get home

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no Mudd Club, or C. B. G. B.,
I ain't got time for that now
Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?
Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter,
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no
Headphones, ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send a postcard,
I can't write nothing at all
This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
I'd like to kiss you, I'd love you hold you
I ain't got no time for that now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock,
We blended with the crowd
We got computer, we're tapping phone lines,
I know that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives,
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now,
I don't know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender,
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving,
You ought to get some sleep
Get you instructions, follow directions,
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day,
Whatever you think is best
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? 
They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace,
The burning keeps me alive

Don't want to catch no disease
Try to be careful, don't take no chances,

I saw that people were smiling
I passed them by and said nothing

It really doesn't seem like it's been this long
But it turned out better than we thought
And they say us proved them wrong
'Cause we have held the promises that we made
The sun - it shines on us
Though people try to throw in shade
But with a son and two daughters later
Seven years deep like Will and Jada
Givin' our praise to the creator
Because I know he's greater than anything
That we could ever do
Ain't none of it would be possible without you

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together

So many said we wouldn't make it together
But still we say it's gonna last forever
But everyday we try to make it better
Flyin' over all the stormy weather
You told me you would hold me down
And though I really never show it
I know you love me, and I've always known it
There's nothin' left to prove
There's only one for me
And I'm the one for you

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together

Many will come into your life
But one will battle through this life
I found the love of my life, in you
In you
I see the future in your eyes
Stick with me long enough to recognize

They're for the family

We're not alone any more then
There are others there
And this dream's big enough
For all of us to share

So don't think you're going
We're not going anywhere
We're staying, taking our share
If you get afraid again, I'll be there

Branching out towards the sky

But I didn't have to say a word to convince you to stay
'Cause you know it and I know this thing is real
So we continue to learn and our love grows deeper still

Each day I watch you get better at this
Each moment I'm more and more convinced
We trust in love, we took the risk
We ran our own pace
We won our race
And I could never turn away

We've come so far
Stars look up at you baby
My heart belongs
Right here next to you baby

If I had just one wish
It would be to stay together
Stay together, let?s grow together
It's not much to ask of us
I know we can do it
I always knew it

Always look at me the way you do today
Treat me like a friend
Listen to what I say
'Cause girl I'm with you, with you
All the way

Mixed up, the sky's all gray

I don't feel like talking
Some things
I can't explain

Feeling cold, growing old in the night

Why we gotta end it on a very sour sour note?

Even though I always call you after every show
Going way outta my way to let everybody know
That I got a girl at home and that this girl she got my soul
Taking total control over my heart since the start
And now you wanna take my heart and rip it all apart
All because of silly ass rumors and stupid friends
You couldnt have let other people bring you and me to an end
Nah no way that shit just can't happen
I couldnt belive when I came home you was packin
I can't begin to fathem having to go at it alone

Come on baby we've been in it for a miniute puttin in work form the begging and this is how its ending
Were finshed it's sad to say but it's true
You've got to do what you do I've got to do what I do

Do you wanna hurt me
When I was only flirting
So why you trying to ruin my life
It's alright
And I, don't think that I'm deserving
I'm going through this hurting
Just wanna hear you say its alright
Its alright

King,"This is a Muddy Waters Tune:
The first verse is:
I got an axe-handle pistol with a graveyard frame
Shootin' tombstone bullets, wearin' ball and chain
I'm drinkin TNT, I'm smokin dynamite
I hope some schoolboy'll start a fight......
I'm Ready
An old blues song; I'm not sure who wrote it, but this version is
Performed by Albert King
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be
Now I'm ready for you,
I hope you're ready for me.
I got an axe-hounds face made on a graveyard frame
Shootin' tombstone bullets, wearin' ball and chain
I'm drinkin' TNT, smokin' dynamite
I hope some screwball...start a fight
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be
Now I'm ready for you,
I hope you're ready for me.
All you pretty little chicks with your pretty little hair,
I know you think that I ain't nowhere
But stop what your doin' an' look over here,
I'll prove to ya, baby, that I ain't no square
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be
Now I'm ready for you,
I hope you're ready for me.
I been drinkin' gin like never before
I feel so good, babe, I want you to know
One more drink, and I wish you would

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

Twenty-first chapter revelation
John talking about his new world
Said, I saw a new heaven and a new earth
For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away
And thou will no more see

And John said
I saw a new Jerusalem coming down
From God out of heaven
Prepared as a bride
A dawn for a husband
Amen
You know J is a city that's set on the hill
Cannot be here
Fair enough
Paradise little city
Amen

So let us humble ourselves, dear one
Get ready for the new world
Prepare yourself to live in that holy city
That same city
That same kingdom
That Jesus was talking
To his disciples about
When he left them and gone back to his father
Don't forget it
Amen
Said let not your heart be troubled
Believe in God, believe in me also

In my father's house are many mansions
Everyone not so I would have told you
I'm going to prepare a place for you
And if I go
To prepare a place for you
I will come again and receive you unto myself
That's what I am, that you may be also

Now, tell me, dear one, why was Jesus?
He was standing on earth
Talking to his disciples
Amen
Promising them
That he's coming back for them
Amen
To live with them here on this earth
Amen
He's gonna live with you
In your human body
And He and his family
Amen

So don't get the Bible mixed up
You just keep that same old way that grandpa and grandma had
They didn't know any better
God winked at them and said
And they was well blessed for what they knew
And you gonna be cursed for turning the word down

I said, your kiss is so inviting and your arm's so exciting
And I can't turn around, no

Say it again 
There's got to be a better way-yeah 
What is it good for? (war)

Man has a sense for the discovery of beauty
How rich is the world for one who makes you for us to show
Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, good god, now, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing
Say it again, war, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing, listen to me
War, it ain't nothing but a heart breaker
War, friend only to the undertaker, war

I searched for help instead I found oppression

Nobody has to like the things I do

I feel so low then I feel so high 
But when I play you make me feel alright

Don't even try to mess with me!

This person that I've become 
Music changed my life but now you changed my soul 

So, I don't care what people say 
I've found you and now it's all okay 
I was lost and then you showed me the way

Of what has gathered in the night,
Hang the villains and the crooks
High on butchers hooks
As they run from the sun in fright.

Oh the moonlight shadows are fleeting and scattered
Where memories and prophecies are slain,
Only the moment you're in can delight in sin,
So forget your regrets and pains.

Cold ash poured over the sun,
For the son to rise again he must go through hell
To see what the darkness has done.

Willingly surrendering,
There's a song to your soul while you bow to gold,
The song the angels sing.

But I couldn't stop the desperation fighting for my life

Losing faith in my convictions and the words that I have read
Saro-wiwa, each day so many lies
Conscience traded on the market while the poor are left to die
Today my courage failing as the bills replace the lines
That used to give me so much hope for stories to survive
Today I felt like dying as I read those lines again

The future holds out no more promises and history's reached the end

Half the world is dying while I'm waiting by the phone

They'd take you down if you ever show

Never take me down",Starvo

Strange, that the palms of my hands
Should be damp with expectancy

Spring, and the air's turning mild
City lights, and the glimpse of a child
Of the alleyway infantry

Friends, do they know what I mean
Rain, and the gathering green
Of an afternoon out-of-town

But Lord I had to go
My trail was laid too slow behind me
To face the call of fame
Or make a drunkard's name for me
Though now this better life
Has brought a different understanding
And through these endless days
Shall come a broader sympathy
And though I count the hours
To be alone's no injury

My home, was a place near the sand
Cliffs, and a military band
Blew and air of normality

Strangely why his life not mine

Make us the people we are

King Crimson,"I guess I tried to show you how
I'd take the crowd with my guitar
And business men would clap their hands
And clip another fat cigar

And publishers would spread the news
And print my music far and wide
And all the kids who played the blues
Would learn my licks with a bottle neck slide

But now it seems the bubble's burst
Although you know there was a time
When love songs gathered in my head
With poetry in every line

And strong men strove to hold the doors
While with my friends I passed the age
When people stomped on dirty floors
Before I trod the rock'n'roll stage

I'll thank the man who's on the 'phone
And if he has the time to spend
The problem I'll explain once more
And indicate a sum to lend

That ten percent is now a joke
Maybe thirty, even thirty-five
I'll say my daddy's had a stroke
He'd have one now, if he only was alive

I like the way you look at me
You're laughing too down there inside
I took my chance and you took yours
You crewed my ship, we missed the tide

I like the way the music goes
There's a few good guys who can play it right
I like the way it moves my toes
Just say when you want to go and dance all night",Lament [DVD][Version]

King Crimson,"I do remember one thing.
It took hours and hours but..
By the time I was done with it,
I was so involved, I didn't know what to think.

I carried it around with me for days and days..
Playing little games
Like not looking at it for a whole day
And then... looking at it.

To see if I still liked it.
I did.

I repeat myself when under stress.

I repeat...
The more I look at it,
The more I like it.
I do think it's good.

The fact is..
No matter how closely I study it,
No matter how I take it apart,
No matter how I break it down,

It remains consistent.
I wish you were here to see it.

I like it.",Indiscipline
King Crimson,"Well, first of all,
I couldn't even see his face.
I couldn't see his face.
He was holding a gun in his hand.
Umm, I was thinking
This is a dangerous place
This is a dangerous place

I said, ""I'm nervous as hell from this stuff.
I thought those guys were going to kill me for sure.
They ganged up on me like that.
I couldn't believe it.
Look, I'm still shakin'.
Weird.
There out in the streets like that.
It's a dangerous place.
It's a dangerous place.""

So, suddenly, these two guys appear in front of me.
They stopped.
Real aggressive.
Start at me, you know.
""What's that?"" ""What's that on that tape?""
What do you got there?""
I said, ""huh?""
They said, ""What are you talking into that for?""
I said, ""It's just a tape, you know""
""Well play it for me""
I said ""oh, no""
I put it off as long as I could.
And finally they turned it on, you know
They grabbed it from me.
Took it away from me.
Turned it on.
And it said, ""He held a gun in his hand. This is a dangerous place.""
They said, ""What dangerous place?"" ""What gun?"" ""You're a policeman!""
And the deeper I talked, the worse I got into it.
I talked, I told him, I said, ""Look man, I'm not talkin'""
It went on forever.
Anyway, I finally unbuttoned my shirt, and said,
""look, look, I'm in this band, you know, I'm in this band you know,
and we're makin' a recording, you know.
It's about New York City, it's about crime in the streets.
""The explanation was going nowhere, but,
Finally, they just kinda let me go, I don't know why.
So I walk around the corner,
and I'm like shakin' like a leaf,
and I thought, ""This is a dangerous place""

King Crimson,"The wall on which the prophets wrote
Is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death
The sunlight brightly gleams
When every man is torn apart
With nightmares and with dreams,
Will no one lay the laurel wreath
As silence drowns the screams

Between the iron gates of fate,
The seeds of time were sown,
And watered by the deeds of those 
Who know and who are known;
Knowledge is a deadly friend
When no one sets the rules
The fate of all mankind I see
Is in the hands of fools

King Crimson,"The rusted chains of prison moons
Are shattered by the sun.
I walk a road, horizons change
The tournament's begun.
The purple piper plays his tune,
The choir softly sing;
Three lullabies in an ancient tongue,
For the court of the crimson king.

The keeper of the city keys
Puts shutters on the dreams.
I wait outside the pilgrim's door
With insufficient schemes.
The black queen chants the funeral march,
The cracked brass bells will ring;
To summon back the fire witch
To the court of the crimson king.

The gardener plants an evergreen
Whilst trampling on a flower.
I chase the wind of a prism ship
To taste the sweet and sour.
The pattern juggler lifts his hand;
The orchestra begin;
As slowly turns the grinding wheel
In the court of the crimson king.

On soft grey mornings widows cry,
The wise men share a joke.
I run to grasp divining signs
To satisfy the hoax.
The yellow jester does not play
But gently pulls the strings
And smiles as the puppets dance

Farewell the temple master's bells
His kiosk and his black worm seed
Courtship solely of his word
With Eden guaranteed.

Make saffron sabbath eyelids bleed
Scar the sacred tablet of wax
On which the Lizards feed.

Wear your blizzard season coat
Burn a bridge and burn a boat
Stake a Lizard by the throat.

Go Polonius or kneel
The reapers name their harvest dawn
All your tarnished devil's spoons
Will rust beneath our corn.
Now bears Prince Rupert's garden roam
Across his rain tree shaded lawn
Lizard bones become the clay-
And there a Swan is born

Wake your reasons' hollow vote
Wear your blizzard season coat
Burn a bridge and burn a boat
Stake a Lizard by the throat.

Gone soon Piepowder's moss-weed court
Round which upholstered Lizards sold
Visions to their leaden flock
Of rainbows' ends and gold.
Now tales Prince Rupert's peacock brings
Of walls and trumpets thousand fold
Prophets chained for burning masks
And reels of dreams unrolled . . .

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Pictures of a City/42nd at Treadmill

King Crimson,"Someday you're gonna wake up singing
Someday you're gonna wake up tired
It makes you feel like a horseshoe
In a swimming pool
Cause you know you don't belong

I move left
You move right
I'm like a blind man on a motorbike
You say potato
But I say pie
Tell me why

Someday you'll be sorry
Someday sad
Someday you might even wake up
Just a little bit mad
Maybe tomorrow
Might be tonight
But in the meantime.
I was hoping you might
Solve this puzzle of mine
Someday

Is cracking at the seams
Upon the instruments of death
The sunlight brightly gleams
When every man is torn apart
With nightmares and with dreams,
Will no one lay the laurel wreath
As silence drowns the screams

Between the iron gates of fate,
The seeds of time were sown,
And watered by the deeds of those 
Who know and who are known;
Knowledge is a deadly friend
When no one sets the rules
The fate of all mankind I see
Is in the hands of fools

Confusion will be my epitaph
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh,
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying,
Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying",Epitaph [Live]

Strange that the palms of my hands
Should be damp with expectancy

City lights and the glimpse of a child
Of the alleyway infantry

Friends, do they know what I mean?
Rain and the gathering green
Of an afternoon out of town

But lord I had to go
The trail was laid too slow behind me
To face the call of fame
Or make a drunkard's name for me
Though now this better life
Has brought a different understanding
And from these endless days
Shall come a broader sympathy
And though I count the hours
To be alone's no injury

Ran to the day with tear-blind eyes.

Impaled on nails of ice
And raked with emerald fire

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

King Curtis,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her

Oo baby, I was made to please her

King Curtis,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe
King Curtis,"Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow

He looked at me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He said his name, Bojangles
And he danced a lick across the cell
He grabbed his pants
In fettered stance
Oh, he jumped up high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

He danced for those
At minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years
How his dog and him traveled about
His dog up and died, he up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

He said I dance now
At every chance in honky tonks
For drink and tips
But most of the time
I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit

He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him
Please, please

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!",Mr. Bojangles

Oh that book

From the candle of fate
