The Lumineers,"I stood alone, upon the platform in vain
Puerto Ricans they were playing me salsa in the rain
With open doors and manual locks
In fast food parking lots

I headed West, I was a man on the move
New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
Oh, I need somebody, I needed someone I could trust
I don't gamble, but if I did I would bet on us

Like the Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh Lord, like the Dead Sea

Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see,
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

You told me you were good at running away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
You took the rest when you took the map

Yes, there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live
It for yourself you felt, you just felt it was time
And I'm glad, 'cause you with cats, that's just not right

Like the Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh Lord, I'm your Dead Sea

Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

I've been down, I've been defeated
You're the message I was heeding
Would you stay,
Would you stay the night?

Dead Sea,
Told me I was like the Dead Sea
Never sink when you are with me
Oh Lord, I'm your Dead Sea

Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The nicest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see
I was born to be your Dead Sea",Dead Sea
The Lumineers,"The carbonation in my drink
The bubbles rise while my heart sinks
And I'll I tend to do is think of you

Was it easier to pack your bags
And book that flight to Paris as
The plane began to move that afternoon

When all the trains have pulled away
From local stations in decay
It's I who waits, it's you who's late again

And did you think of me when you made love
To him, was it the same as us
Or was it different, it must have been

And all the pretty dames
They'll hug and kiss you all the same
And when they go, they're gone
They're not run-ning late
Oh all, all the pretty dames

And the kids you hold in your arms
With promises to protect them from harm
But they grow, and they go
And you're all alone
All the kids, all the kids that you hold

And it's a shame that it ends this way
With nothing left to say
So just sit on your hands, while I walk away
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
When my hands begin to shake
When bitterness is all I taste
And my car won't stop
'Cause I cut the brakes
I hold on to a hope in my fate

Oh oh ah ah hey hey
May you return to love one day
Well I hope and I pray
You get what you gave
Oh oh ah ah hey hey",Morning Song
The Lumineers,"I feel her filth in my bones
Wash off my hands 'til it’s gone
The walls they’re closing in
With velvet curtains

Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

They’re makin' noise in my street
My blinds are drawn I can’t see
Smashed in my car window
Didn’t touch the stereo

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

Act like you’ve been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

And when she stood, she stood tall
She’ll make a fool of you all
Don’t ask for cigarettes
She ain’t got nothin' left for you

And when it came to love

The Lumineers,"Well, she was standing in the bar
I said, ""Hello, how do you do?""
She handed me a beer with a kangaroo

She spoke of places I had never been
That she had traveled to
And we slow danced along to faster tunes

And I made her laugh, I made a pass
I showed her my half-dollar ring
She said, ""That's pretty cool
But classy girls don't kiss in bars, you fool""

(No, they don't)

So, later on the crowd calmed down
And I believe it was as if something drew me closer to her lips

So, picture my surprise when I had tried to lean in for a kiss
And she just smiled and turned her head down

I asked her, ""Why?"" and she replied
It was nothing I was doing wrong, it's just what it is
No, classy girls don't kiss in bars like this

No, classy girls don't kiss in bars
Boys will break their backs and hearts
But it's alright, the hardest part is through

Oh, through!
Oh, through!
Oh, through!

Fleet of black, fleet of black limousines
Ah tinted machines, here comes the cavalcade
With the armored cars, armored cars like Barettas
Flags on antennae designed to keep me safe, keep me safe

And oh my my, oh hey hey
Here he comes, the candidate
Blue eyed boy, United States
Vote for him, the candidate

Diamonds cut, diamonds cut for the karats
Plaster of Paris, the floats fill up the street
And the beauty queens, beauty queens with the white gloves
All sick from the night clubs, they wave with pageantry, pageantry

Oh my my oh hey hey
Here it comes, the big parade
Marching bands and barricades
Make way, for the big parade

Canvas covered, canvas covered in resin
The violent men who dance the blood ballet
And the bookies say, bookies say it's the third round
Oh when Louie will go down, if he don't there's hell to pay, and hell to raise

And oh my my oh hey hey
Here he comes, the welterweight
Take a dive, for goodness sake
Or say goodbye to the welterweight

Catholic priest, Catholic priest in a crisis
Torn between romance and Jesus, who will win the civil war
And he says I'm in love, I'm in love with a woman
Yea this is my confession, I'm leaving, I can't a priest anymore, anymore

And oh my my, oh hey hey
There he goes, the man of faith
Left the church for a fiancée
Let him love, a man of faith

T.V. cameras, t.v. cameras and stage hands
American Bandstand, electric guitars
And he's singin' songs, singin' songs for the lonely
Well the girls with the room keys,
They know all his words by heart, by heart and they all sing

Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see

The Lumineers,"When we were younger
We thought everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair

Takes a boy to live
Takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little
And knew a lot
And now we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self assured

'Cause it's a long road to wisdom
It's a short one to being ignored

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
By in my eyes, eyeyeye
Be in my heart

So now I think that I could love you back
And I hope its not too late
'Cause you're so attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes

It takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

The Lumineers,"I believe submarines
Underneath deep blue seas
Saw the flags: Japanese
No one will believe me

Ran back to the town bar
And I told the people how
I had seen the submarine
And everyone laughed aloud

I did spy periscopes
Dead of night on the eastern coast
The police made them jokes
Told me I'd seen a ghost

Everyone thinks I'm a liar
No one knows the truth
If it was a bigger fire
I would be on the roof

Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay
(Let me go!)
No one trusts what I say
(I don't know!)
Oh my God, no one paid
(Attention!)
Overnight my hair turned gray
(Oh oh oh!)

In the end it boils down to credibility
I had none, so I will die with the secrets of the sea

And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant

And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

Holding the pain like you're holding your breath
I prayed you could sleep, sleep like a stone
You're right next to me
But you're a long way from home

Hospital gowns never fit like they should
We yelled at the nurse, didn't do any good
More morphine, the last words you moaned
At last I was sure
That you weren't far away from home",Long Way From Home

You opened the door
You gave him a ride
Too young to know, too old to admit

What did you do to my eyes
What did you sing to that lonely child
Promised it all but you lied
You better slow down baby soon
It's all or nothing to you

The glow of Hollywood signs
They sold you a bridge
They fed you the lines 
You always confused your servants for friends
But you couldn't see how it ends

What did you say to my only child

Their beds

And I said

I won't live, won't live like them
Everyone, they're all seeing red

I don't know
If it's alright with you, but I'll be gone
A ghost will be here in my stead, my stead

It is I, Jesus, Shock Jesus
And what brings you brothers to such an early fate?
	Man, no what the fuck man
	Niggaz just shot me man, what the fuck man
How dare you use such language in the face of the almighty
	Fuck you
You shall perish (beitch!!)
It is my judgement that you shall burn in hell

5150, feel me
Psycho disco just go Luni

I wish I had cot (what?) I wish I had some cot (why?)
So I could sky and have a place to lay my head and plot
A broke nigga boney
Quick to lick but I could never steal shit from my homies
I play acts and make scratch from table scraps
and always end up fucked watchin other niggaz backs
I broke hamps wit my folks and get pounds
but in the mist of funk
would they really bust rounds?
I get woozie when I inhale all the badness
I swear to the Lord when I was young I never had this problem
I stressed the fuck out gotta doubt my own niggaz
I try to solve my problems wit hamps and liquor
I used to swig a 22, graduated to a 64
and now I don't smoke weed no mo'
And I ain't knowin where I'm headin
Most likely it's the scene of creamery
I'm petrified of the whole scenery
The game is some shit ya either roll wit
Or give up because the game is quick to make a nigga stroke it
For less is what I was wishin for it never came true
So it came to plannin missions damn near shittin in my drawers
I gotta play my part though and take what I can
from the niggaz I don't got Scarface nigga I feel ya
By any means nescescary
That's why they find scary niggaz buried
Carried to a whole 'nother place
If youse a hard nigga die with a smirk on your face
So much drama, I put my best in it 
Peace, I'd rather live than rather rest in it
Where I'm from or where I'm headed, it ain't no love
I give thanx that I'm alive to the man up above
I'm still takin shit day by day
Survin off a nifty, that's why I'm goin 5150

Ripley's won't believe I'm shot, limpin down the block
Tryin to scoot out, carry the bloody glock
Cause niggaz they plot, it was a shoot out
Tryin to take the loot out my pocket 
But I'm quick to let the glock spit at his 350 rocket
Then I split runnin down the block 
No sense of dick made them bitch made niggaz whip out a gauge
Then blaze my ribcage, I'm dazed
on the ground hella bleeedin ass out
I remember seein somebody put me in a glass house, I passed out
Then my spirit arose up out my flesh, I'm old
No more bullet holes in my chest
A gold vest when I awaken for Mista Go-Tec-9 is awaitin
The Lord has no love for playa hatin
I'm facin Shock Jesus cause I'm the G-ist nigga to do the job right
Because I'm trained up in that mob life
Come back tonite strapped tonite
He said if I succeed he'll bring my family and dead homies back to life
A big ass eagle scooped me up then we bails out
Flyin through the cuts goin the secret hill route
The whole scene was a disaster
Friday the 13th the final chapter 
Lookin niggaz wit casper the ghost
But I float until I smoked the big man
Slipped in quick sand
He's gonna kill me but my spirit slipped in my body
I yelled watch out he's gonna get me
They didn't get me, huh, they labelled my ass 5150

How can I get blame for shit
That a nigga really didn't even do
One nigga did the dirt, but the blames on the whole crew
I feel like O.J., and Rodney
A little mayo, but still don't be havin'
No happy days like Potsy
Nigga's get blamed for every thang
From robbin you house, to ho stroll's
And the Tropicana cocaine
And if the sun turned black
""Yup a nigga did it Jim"" or
""Get a nigger over so I blame it on him""
Nigga's getttin' like the oldies
Played the fuck out, we only known for stealin' cars and drinkin' 40's
Or showin your whole ass crack on cops
They quick to do a nigga on the routine stop
Chopped rock's, in a nigga possession, a whole zip
Blame me cause I'm one of fo' grips
Now you can have mayo and a gang of triggers
Bit that ain't shit, cause they still gon blame a nigga

Boy I tell ya Jim, one of those black niggers took
The battery outta my car last night
I did see it, but I know those were niggers

Drivin' down the block, and what did I see
A police man tryna gaffle me
Threw down my rocks, so I wouldn't get caught
A high-speed chase for forty-eight blocks

I heard some shit was goin' down though
It might be scandalous, on the down low
Plus I get around ho, like Shock and Mon'
Walkin' to the lot, forgot I got the gun
In the bushes, more mayo then the rest of the pushers
Tonight a nigga might be readin' my Nike's like Bushwick
Chronic smoke like chimney, to lit a doobie
They knew me, let me in free cause I bee that Luni
Higher then the police sky waves off the blue
I partied two or three hours now I'm sideways in the sukra
To the hoopsta's, survival is the be-under
But I was in it, now five-oh's on my bumper
Ready to dump the forty outie, and weed baggies
They had me searchin' through my car, for what we have we here
A queer tryna frame a nigga, but shame on a nigga
That try to put the blame on a nigga

""Always gotta blame a god damn nigga
900 blame a nigga""
""Always gotta blame a god damn nigga

Uh, hello, this is 900 blame a nigger?
Uh, my daughter's raped, and comin' back from
A Ku Klux Clan meetin', and I know a nigger did it

Last night was the night before
Twenty-four robber's came knocking at my door
I ran out, they ran in, tryna blast for my cash
Wit ski-masks on they're chin

Take a puff from my hamp then bounce
I'm on a mission for scrilla, vanilla slugs by my zipper
Playa haters trippin' off ho's it seems that they plot
Snitch to the cops, and swear that I chopped O's of cream
Who stole the cookie out the cookie jar!
That's what they mumble
Now knowin' about the power of numskull!
Now I done had it wit all that static
I'm thinkin' I should load my automatic
And let all these faggots have it

One love, it's cocked backed, and then I bust slugs
Roastin' a motherfucker, so busta always suffer
Blood in the ghetto, other niggas try to run up
Wit they gun, and get done from sun down to sun up, punk
Dead bodies in the trunk, they kept on tellin' me
Oh I was sellin' P.D. I was sellin D, I caught a felony
As soon as I got it, had to pop out a nigga brains
I was the wrong nigga to frame

But them damn niggers take all the jobs nowadays

Blast that fool man, blast that fool, get him, get him

Bitch that's just like when that nigga
Took me to Vegas, his fat ass fell asleep
I got him for his Rolex, and his car keys(whaat)
When I initialed back to the town
Sold his triple gold for a playa's price(HAHA!)

My balls spin off the wall mic goes, psycho's
Therapy to carry me, and felt me
A bitch can't help less that bitch wealthy
Cause they ain't shit but ho's and tricks
So I goes and gives the bitch the stolen grip
That left on my nigga's clothes and shit
Vogues and shit, for my hooptie, gucci link
Me don't want to no broke ass hoochie
Cause they coochie stink
Think, while your fa sho sho, bitch is a no no

She got your ass licked at the mo mo
Don't no why ya trustin the bitch
Cause she suckin ya dick

Sellin but on Novero, make dinero cash
Or get the eight and half up yo narrow ass

The Luniz,"Player, give me some brew an I might just chill,
But I'm the type that like to light another joint
Like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it,
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s 
Never the less, I'm hella fresh, 
Rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it cross the table like ping pong,
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong,
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40,
And when it comes to get another stogie,
Fools all kick in like Shinobi
No, he ain't my homie to begin with,
It's too many heads to be proper to let my friend hit it
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
5 dollar bill on the real before it's history
'Cause fools be having them vacuum lungs
An if you let em hit it for free you hella dum-da-dum-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land like where the bomb at
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up the dank like a Slurpee
The serious bomb will make a niggy go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more Growing Pains than Maggie
'Cause homie, snag me to take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it, 
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it,
Messin' wit that Indo' weed
I got five on it,
It's got me stuck and knocked on back
I got five on it,
Partna let's go half on a sack

I take sacks to the face,
Whenever I can, 
Don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up,
Till the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand, bra
Hoochies can hit but they know they got to pitch in,
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension
'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no, you betta' bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that
Better pass the joint
Stop hittin' 'cause you know ya got Asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, an guzzle it,
'Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P-O
I know I failed 'cause I done smoked major weed bro,
And every time we with Chris that fool rollin' up a fattie,
But the Tanqueray straight had me

I got five on it, 
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it,
Messin' wit that Indo' weed
I got five on it,
It's got me stuck and knocked on back
I got five on it,
Partna let's go half on a sack

Hey, make this right man, stop at the light man
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I face, so let's head to the east
Hit the stroll to 9-0 so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rolling a two door Cutlass same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indoe
I'm in the 'land getting smoked wit my kinfolk

I been smoked, Yuk'll spray ya, lay ya down up in the O-A-K the Town
Homies don't play around we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm da roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a buncha sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, 'cause where I be's, we need half like a foo-foo

I got five on it, 
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it,

Til the joint be burnin my hand 
Next time I roll it in a Hampa

So the ashes won't be burnin up my hand, bra 
Hoes want to hit but they know they got to pitch in 
Then

Fuck that 
You betta bring your own shit chief 
Wassup

JOINT! nigga stop hittin 'cause you know ya got asthma 
Crack a 40 open homie

An everytime we with Chris

But the Tanqueray straight had me 
Lit to the fullest extreme

Bring me a bottle and I'm cool wit that

[Verse 3 *(Yukmouth)*] 
Playa 
Give me some brew an I might just chill 
But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill

But it ain't enuff on it 
Fuck wit the S the T, I-D-E-S 
Never the less 
I'm hella fresh 
Rollin joints like a cigarrette 
So pass it cross the table like ping pong 
I'm gone 
Beatin my chest like King Kong 
It's on, 
Wrap my lips around a 40 
And when it comes to get another stogie 
Niggas all kick in like Shinobi 
Nummy ain't my homie to begin with 
It's too many heads to be poppin to let my friend hit shit 
Unless you pull out the phat crispy 
Five dollar bill 
On the real before its history 
'cause niggas be havin' them vacuum lungs 
An if you let 'em hit it for free 
You hella dumb-do-dumb-dumb 
I come to school with the taylor on my earlobe 
Avoidin all the dick teasers 
Skeezers and weirdos 
That be fuckin off the land like Where tha bomb at? 
Give me two bucks 
You take a puff 
And pass my bomb back 
Suck up the dank like a slurpy 
The serious 
Bomb will make a nigga go delirous like Eddie Murphy 
I got more growin pains than Maggie 
'cause niggas snag me 
To take the dank out of the baggie

The Luniz,"Posted up in the cut
To make a buck I had to sell nuff drugs
Showed up, an rolled up, bubbled wit tough thugs that love to bust slugs
I had much love, from dope fiends
Plug 'em wit mo cream, my dangla
Used to sport Wranglers wit Pro Wings
Fa sho green-ery stacked up, that macked up
Quick to put the gat up an blast on niggaz that act up
Snatched the scratch up, quick hit the back fence loc
I been broke, rollin' through yo mutha fuckin' hood in trench coats
Wit double barrels get yo narrow ass on the ground
I'm not play, I don't play though
I'm out to get yo pay roll
Say hoe, you get yo monkey ass stomped wit the steel toe
Fucked in the game like a dildo
From the Vill hoe
To the mutha fuckin' Fil-Mo fo real though
None can get wit this sick wit it man slaughter
Practice lookin' harder than 40 Water
Niggaz all over claimin' they foldin' weight
I caught yo slippin', rippin' that duct tape over yo face an off the 
Golden Gate
Let go, I'm down to break jaws when I takes all's
Yo cash, blast that ass won't last fo' one mo day like Nate Dog
Break laws
Lethal weapon like Danny
Slangin' candy
Livin' lavish about my cabbage understands me.

[Chorus: x2]
Can't slang cream, can't lay low
Quick to pull licks for some paper to fold
It ain't me fuck gettin; fronted
(Gaffed and licks I done it, that's why a nigga always gets blunted)

I see what you see, but you don't see what I see
Mill an zips come up the whole grip like Kadafi
Twenty years of age, waitin' fo' the say someone say cap me
A whole line of felonies on my rap sheet
Any means to make loot in the East Oakland Bay route
It's all about makin' mail fuck bein' cute (woo)
That's the sound when it's time to lay down my hustle
Why there's so many bubbles, I choose to throw rocks like Barney Rubble
Can't lie back, wit a gang of top scratch
I gots to move on, an scoot on
Now mutha fucka can you buy that?
Lay low make no mistakes, make it successful
And if a nigga run up then make his chest full
I toss niggaz that try to struggle off me
Cross me
A gang of jealousy because I'm saucy
It's not my fault that I grew to become a licksta
Instead I say moms meetin' pops was a mix up
Pick up
Hennessy got my brain runnin' quicka than I can think
Adrenaline pumpin' about to faint
Ain't no shame
Can't be no nine to five nigga
The ""O"" is where I'm from, so I gots to survive nigga.

[Chorus: x2]

Nigga notice I'm broke wit a loaded four-fifth gat
The real nigga rolled an showed us where you hide yo doe an shit at
He did just that, showed me where the kicks at
An big scratch told Knum to come nigga lets get that.

Yuk pull over
Park the Nova
Tonight's the night, so I hope you write about the yola
I hold the Mag, lookin' for the attack
Search the whole fuckin' crib 'cause I know he got scratch.

Creep up the mutha fuckin' stairs wit the ski mask
On the second floor in the drawer there should be cash
But we laugh
'Cause we see task cars right next door
But we poor, no budget fuck it, so kick down the door.

Boom kick it once
Boom kick it twice
Three times it's breakin' an have the fuckin' building shakin'
Make our way through the house nothin' less nothin' more
(Where the kicks at?)
I think they in the third drawer.

There's more
An that's a fa sho-sho I got the doe, now we up out the door
Before the neighbors call po-po
To the mobile, to count the real deal bank roll
In my sock, I rub daily 'cause it's scratchin' my ankle.

It's morning
We unleash to the streets
Wit twelve G's a piece
Headed straight to the East
Better recognize this game is bought to be sold
That's why I pull licks fo' some paper to fold.

T for tech out to get the scratch, it ain't nuthin nice, Yukmouth let me 
Hear ya. 

Well it's the one of the mill nigga 
The Vill niggaz, that spill niggaz guts to the fullest 
Fill niggaz up wit bullets 
Kill niggaz, Yuk don't bullshit 
An I pull licks if I have to, no laughter 
Or chit-chat I juss clack my shit back an then I blast ya 
When it's the wig split 
Come wit big shit fo the 9-Feva-roo 
'Cause ya fuckin' either two 
Of yo baby ma'mas 
Got em on camera 
Doin' a tootsie roll wit a hammer up her coochie hole, an a 40 up her 
Bootsy hole 
Fo sho, I pimp nights like Gladis 
Niggaz better knock on wood like havock, when I'm in yo hood wit an 
Automatic 
So crack ends, givin me jaw, I be call fuckin' around wit mo ups & downs 
Then a see-saw 
Sometimes I feel like I'm broke, sometimes I'm shot calla 
Who got all the bitches lost in the motions like Pala 
Balla than shisty, mo betta blues then Spike Lee 
Might be off the 40 'cause I'm OG like Ice-T 
Ya dig? 

Smoke hoes, an coke hoes, are sumpthin' like the same 
One fo the white dope, one fo the nigga that's in the game 
Now I know bitches that say ""Richard, do what ya want to"" 
But like old Vogues them bitches cry when I hit the corner 
My 7-duce, produce, 'cause the zues was pissed off 
I'm still gettin' zips off 
Niggaz feelin' ripped off, an clipped off 
Until they told me, it was Knumskull, Yuk an Dru 
Now what you want to do? 
It's thirty five-hundred for the straight laced triple gold, wit the vogues 
That's what they cost in the store, yeah 
An you can reach, but you can not touch 
Ever figga, scared nigga that you feared too much? 
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts 
To find out, she works for me 
Brought me that Jeep 
That's why I, keep my bitch business in the cut 
That way I gets yo skrilla, plus I get to fuck, 
'Cause we. 

[Chorus]

I'm steadily stackin' up on the green 
Ballas will use the triple beam 
Shot calla use they words 
Hustlas will use they shoulders, playas sit back an get served 
Now observe the definition of the pimp-mode 
I take hoes, an break hoes, an hoes is stayin mobile, really though 
Doe is what I love, so what's up? 
Nigga who you tellin, that life always been tough 
Nigga I had it rough 
An nigga it ain't no bluff 
An potna I had my own mama sufferin', that's sumpthin' 
Yeah okay 
I turned straight into a hustla 
Crap on bustas 
Skrilla fo reala from them suckas 
I gave my mama half, me half, I'm out the door 
Ready to bubble 
I turned into a balla, shot calla 
Two for twamp 
With in a year I'm back on the spot 
Zippas in zipper, I'm ready to hit some fences, it's so wicked 
Bitch you jack rabbit call me Bugsy 
Four-four up in the Paddy wagon, to break my niggaz love me 
An I'll be sure the next time niggaz see me I'll be high 
Do or die, throwin up the 5, in the 5th lane right 
Side, I'm watchin' the rearview juss for po-po's 
I swerve to the curb, about 3 an you know that I straight broke that 
Hoe. 

Fa sho. G-A fo checks 
Pimp bitches fo sex, might as well go all out an pimp the whole block 
Wit 4 techs 
Niggaz on this, on the move in many 
Plenty taken, playa hatin', Caddy's

You want to make an effort towards paper, then bitch get crack 
So sick wid it 
That's why I shitted on raps fo luck 
I'm like what ever it takes to make a buck 
Could never be stuck 
I'm facin' a life of brokeness already 
Fuck the pain, it juss make sense fo me to stay on my hustle and game 
Blame no nigga fo my down fall

To bust a couple of caps up in they weak asses

An Yuk is down to lick up 
Do a stick up 
At an Armor truck pick up 
Then get tucked, 
Up out the scenery, 
Wit greenery, 
Stopped up, watch up, 
Sew the block up wit creamery, 
The cream, I sling, got fiends on my team, 
Like a fiend I dream, an hoes swing on my ding-a-ling, 
Sumpthin tremendous, 
They spend grip, 
Endless trips to Macy's, they trade me, 
So playa hataz hate me, 
I keep the safety off my four-fifth, 
Hold it in focus, 
Fools didn't used to trip on my dick when I was the brokest, 
But notice, I got a lil mail now, 
'Cause everbody bump L-you-N-I-Z like hell now, 
You juss a busta brown an blood you know,

Really though.

Keep my business to myself, 
'Cause hataz talk mo than get shot to spread rumors when it's loaded, 
Hatin' get yo grill exploded, 
Quick, 
Severed, 
The first thing I heard, 
I stole a credit card from Chris Webber, 
I never knew that, 
But's who's that, an next, 
I heard them ridin' around smokin' crack in the back of my homies Lex, 
It be them broke ass, no cash, 
Bustaz tryin to quote that's why the Town got rid 'o $hort, 
I think you busta browns need to wise up, 
Before we ride up, 
Stop, 
Sew up yo block, an sew them lies up, 
Once don't trip, 
Twice no grip, 
Three timmesss, will get you bucked wit the nine, 
I thought the hatin' would stop, but the rumors are passin' still, 
Sounds like that busta that plugged mo holes than mass appeal, 
You need to stop!! 
Hatin' on, 
The see-N-O-T-E, D-are-you, an the L-you-N-I-Z.

Break it down, oh yeah, 
Fo the Luniz an, they homies. 
I am here to let you know!! 
Gotta think for you so leave the Luniz alone. 
 
Let me tell yo ass a story, yes, 
They juss be hatin' to the fullest but you can miss me wit that B.S. that 
You stress, 
When you test the young Hugh Heff, 
The tech a spit up, 
Chest get lit up, 
Foo that's a rigg up, 

Now I think the whole world knows me, 
Not what they should know, 
It's like rap an sellin' crack is all I'm good for, 
Hangin' in the hood for so long, 
I see why they talk, 
Bitches, 
Snitch a bustaz home. 

(Can we talkkkk.... fo a minute??) 

You're wrong I won't be offended, 
I be there hand in hand wit the pencil, 
Can it all be so simple, 
Like Wu-Tang, spit true game, to get pootang, 
From a nimfo. 

Now I keep sayin, 
Don't get mad 'cause you can't bump me, 
But I'm still gonna spit it, 
'Cause you still don't get it, 
If it ain't noted, don't quote it, 
Hataz when it comes to common sense you ain't showed it, 
I don't understand!

Verse 1 *(Knumskull)*

I, spent hella time on the block late,
an I feel safe, as long as I can shoot the glock straight,
so come,
get the greenery,
rush to the bank collect yo doe,
make sho you got yo bucks in yo hand, 'cause the man,
(be comin around the mountian when he come!)
that's a rigg up,
I rather swallow my yay, an shit slugs,
fuck task, it's a must I bubble,
so many rocks in my jaw I feel like Barney Rubble,
I got my, pager,
an my, bus pass,
grab my Avion water juss incase I had to dust task,
it was about four otha niggaz on the spot grindin,
one was on my team smokin hamps an poppin leads,
(knock on weed nigga, fuck that knock on weed, you got a twenty??)
gave up two ten's an a bump 'cause I had plenty,
not even knowin what I juss did,
put the money in my pocket an headed back to the crib,
got a tingle on my dick feelin bad,
looked up an seen task cars comin at me,
so I bounced through a buildin lost all my cash,
swallowed my rocks, ditched my pager, I'm haulin ass,
then found myself by Blyman's house,
thinkin about juice,
hit the turf, sky out,
through the roof,
but that plan was cancelled,
betta give up,
betta throw yo hands up,
here comes the man,
the gloves on the other hand,
got on my knees, 
crossed my legs,
then threw up my hands,
one of them yelled ""Bitch hit the deck!!"",
Kevin Reese grabbed the stick an almost broke my neck,
I'm handcuffed on the ground wit a foot in my back,
then they asked me ""Hey where the fuck our money at??!!"",
now I'm stressin 'cause the dogs right beside me,
they took me down so that the under could identify me,
You got the right one BAY-BEE!!
Shot me downtown, 
threw me in a cell that's drivin me crazy,
so they booked me, 
walked me through the court door,
stripped me down, 
an gave me some drawls the next nigga wore,
I'm in my pad makin phone calls,
so I can post bail,
go home, 
an then put on my own drawls,
got in touch wit my nigga Yuk,
what's up fool??!!,
I got a quarter ounce hidden in the cut,
snatch it up,
get it off, 
come an get me,
before I go back to court an they judge can get wit me,
'cause the D-A, 
was talkin nonsense at my arraignment,
an think she's still talkin the same shit,
they try an keep me, 
locked up fo a grip,
an my public defender ain't sayin shit!!,
the deal is zero to twenty-eight days,
that shit is filthy!!,
now they got a nigga pleadin gulity.

*(Chorus)*

I ain't did nuthin wrong,
Why should I plead guilty??,
They caught me wit no work,
But they claim that we was filthy,

I ain't did nuthin wrong,
Why should I plead guilty??,
They caught me wit no work,
But they claim we doin dirt.

Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)*

It's like sixteen fiends get they welfare checks,
no po-po a 4-0 an some bomb,

The Luniz,"I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Nothing but a freak and no future in the front

[Verse 1:]
Bitches be lovin' how I dick em
When I get them in the mood to fuck
They hold up all my nuts and lick em
They break me off cash flow
Any damn thing I ask for
So a nigga paid up the asshole
Some fools be thinking they gotta win her like Bruce Jinna
But Joe Tenner is letting every nigger run up in her
Most of the tricks I pick up 
Like to get fucked 
As a bitch is a bitch as a hoe is a quick nut
Like this slut named Kim I knew
She fucked me, fucked him
And she fucked all of them too
So we worked the train on her
And left enough stains on her neck
Looking like a gold chain on her
No free high, the hoochie couldn't find two
Even though she popped that coochie like the hole from 2 Live Crew
So if you bump into this bitch on the streets
And you like the pussy deep, nigga speak
Because she's just a freak

I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Cause a bitch is a bitch as a hoe is a quick nut

I'll be rolling through your cup
Motherfuck, you what's up

And I don't give a fuck
Rolling through your neighborhood
Motherfucker, yo it's me

See this is for them hoes and the trick tramp sluts
All these stupid bitches on my motherfucking nuts
All up on my nuts cause a niggas getting richer
Didn't mean to hit ya, hope you get the picture
Back in 91' you was a little bit stuck up
Acting like you didn't have time for the fuck up
Trying to walk the halls wit that little switch
Trying to play that roll but you ain't nothing but a bitch
A bitch on my dick cause you hoes make me sick
Come and get a lick of the dicks do a trick
Caught you in the mix with a fix turning tricks
Fucking one nigga while you licking two dicks
She's a freak

I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Nothing but a freak and no future in the front

I fucked you, you fucked me
We had one fat ass orgy
With a dick in your mouth and one up in your cunt
Cause a bitch is a bitch as a hoe is a quick nut

Verse 3:
My dick up, but hick up bitch
But don't stick up your nose
Cause you don't look shit like En Vogue
Hoes taxi around them gold ones
Acting like they don't fuck no one
Be the master like Sho Gun
At the hot tubs making a gang of waves
Hoe in the cunt doing stunts like Super Dave
Ballas call her the human giraffe
No joke cause that ass be deep throating niggas on the quick fast
With no whiplash
You see me footing it but couldn't it be cool
Won't buy you assy food when we cruise, you lose
She give niggas blues like 505 don't ask why
I guess that stank bitch is a fall guy
You got no bucks, you can't fuck
We'll that's how I put it
C&H got that hole on tape, straight footage
The same bitch that wouldn't speak was on the TV screen
Sucking everybody mean
Because she's just a freak

I want to zoom zoom bumpin' Loonie Tunes 
Candy paint K 5 
Bitches I stay high 
Playa hate 
Callin me a balla shot calla 
'Cause I'm slangin' all the major weight 
Blam!! 
Close the door to my residence, 
Po-po start searchin' low, but found no evidence, 
They tryin' to wash me an our county like Downy, 
Quick to pick a nigga Nack up like Downty, 
Don't clown me, 
Bitch!! 
Dike hoes want to lick my clit, 
But end up gettin' stuck in the gut, wit a dick, 
Down fo my shit, 
Tricks want to get em up wit me, 
Because they heard their baby-daddy fucked wit me, 
But I'm out on you hoes, 
Wit the 10 g belt, 
The only thing I'm concentratin' on is checkin' my mail, 
What the hell??!! what the fuck??!! 
Do you mean, 
Your boyfriend is a dope fiend, an he smoked up all my ice cream, 
Oops upside yo head fo gettin licked like a lolli-pop, 
Let yo nigga cut, where's my shit, now you get lolli-hopped, 
By everybody on the turf,

Fuck around an trust yo underfolks,

Or this, niggaz add dirt to the list, 
Getaway clean, 
But one want to keep everything, 
He gots to cook it, 'cause we need the good shit to post, 
Tryin' to bake a whole thing, this fool claim that the pot broke, 
But here goes 5 g's an dubbs, 
You can probably catch mo 'cause I chop slugs, 
Blood bubbles, so I charge it to the game wit no shame, 
Even though we got away wit a whole thang of cocaine, 
I got fucked in the deal, sumpthin' cool, 
(Why meee!!) 
'Cause that 5 g's he gave me was boo-boo, 
Too much drama in the streets of the Oak, 
Niggaz will tell you what they want you to hear, 
Not what you should know, 
Instead of sellin' mo cream, 
Niggaz is sellin' mo dreams, 
Lyin' juss to kick it sellin' weight wit no fiends, 
Now this is sumpthin' that I don't understand, 
Why the fuck would that nigga Master P call himself the Ice Cream Man, 
Bitch!! Don't you hear the muzik?? 
That's jankie as fuck, 
He musta been off the fluid, 
Niggaz steadily tryin' to take shit from the next man, 
Don't playa hate, juss give a pound an let the best stand, 
It's too much skrilla in the Land, 
Fo niggaz to be hatin', 
Captain Savin, 
I juss don't understand. 

'Cause when I was a youngsta, money was so damn hard to find. 
But dealt wit my young comrads an we was deadly on the grind. 
When I wanted to bubble, fools start trippin' talkin' shit. 
They never woulda thought I'd be, the mutha fuckin' wit all of the grip. 

Check this out here you jive ass turkeys man. Hoe's slobberin-obberin' in 
The O. There's only one Mobb man, don't hop on the back of the Ice Cream 
Truck an get yo ass booted off. 

I can't stand punks on a man hunt, 
That destroy, 
Lay low, 'cause my four-four, 
Will make yo ass glow, like Bruce Lee woo, 
(Sho nuff) 
Since they bigga, 
Many figga that I can't throw, 
But they don't know about this bole-legged skinny nigga, 
Mad because I'm foldin' grip, 
Plus rollin' thick, 
Still up on that late night loadin clips, 
Holdin' shit, 
To myself, 
Shotgun bullets be bad fo them health, 
So save that gang-bang shit on somebody else, 
Where I peep thugs, 
Have drugs to sell you, 
Don't fuck wit the L-you-N-I-Z that's what they tell you,

This shit is to be to let go,
So welcome to the ghetto,
Got no love from my moms an pops had to creep an caulk heat wit my 
Fellows,
Niggaz from the Big O,
Always down to scuffle,
Had the hustle from the get go,
An didn't no body, give a fuck about Jerold,
Not when I had hella dirt an lint in my dried up ass curl,
Hit the dice game,
Hurled off the night train,
So hang that four-fifth at my brain,
If you want me to do the right thang,
Ever since my eyes open,
I musta really sell dope in,
The 6-9 Village of East Oakland,
Hopin',
My dad would come back,
But that fool vamp,
Now my mama spend the checks on woozy's an the food stamps,
That's why my ass was pumpin' gas, 
An shootin' craps,
So I can make me some rootin' tootin' scratch,
No dap from the school hoes,
Now why did I cut school,
Fuck school,
'Cause me didn't have no school clothes,
I had to go,
Hook up, a book up,
Now I'm a crook up,
On the late night posted,
Slangin' cakes like Hostess,
Sumpthin' ferocious,
Mo candy than Reese Pieces,
Fo human species,
That want to swap fo T.V.'s an V.C.'s,
I'm ready,
Like Heav D, nuttin' but love fo ya,
Fedi dubbs fo ya,
The only nigga would glove fo ya,
It's me,
The ice creamery,
So weasel down the Yellow Brick Road while I fold the greenery.

[Chorus : x2]

You wonder why I became the ice cream mMan,
'Cause I knocked straight hands,
But niggaz on my block didn't understand,
That I was born to be a factor,
If roses what I play, to get paid,
Then don't fade,
But first give a nigga props,
Fo ditchin' cops,
I couldn't work,
So I knew a nigga couldn't stop,
Slangin' mo yay than the next man,
If I come up, don't get mad,
Juss give a pound an let the best stand,
'Cause I done tried gettin' twenty off a note,
I been there, slangin' fo the next nigga still broke,
He flippin' shit, but you ain't,
You fuck around an crumble,
Then you come up short on yo bundle,
An plus the dope fiends be gafflin',
Rolled out all yo scratch,
You broke, so you whips up a dangle batch,
To get enough to cop a zip,
I'm stackin' up my grip,
Got my .380 out so I don't slip,
I need some real folks to come up,
Niggaz wit some guts,
Plots an set up shop, wit Dru an Yuk,
My lick mates,
Hundred percent hustlaz,
Games an heists,
Quick to lick a niggaz house on bikes,
Twice the game, bigga the endin',
Endin' rules,
Much shit, an tucked tens is what I'm sendin' fools,
I goes through all shit,
To lick a ball bitch,
To law shit,
Then I'm off wit the Lootchie,
My game is ready to be sold,
I got my stripes fo followin' the Yellow Brick Road.

[Chorus: x2]

Now I'm the ice cream man,
Bitch,
Don't you see the man sittin on gold ones,
Dishin' off half, zips, an whole ones,
No one,
Could stop the Operation Stackola,
A black soldier slangin' crack only fo scratchola,
I told ya,
I do it to fold ya,
Straight over nighter,
Then flag the driver down wit my flash lighter,
""He speak please g, please don't say no to me, fo the cream, I dream, I 
Fiend like Jodeci!""
Notice he had a G ready to spend it,
Splended,
Got my shit so I won't get apprehended,
Once again it's on,
I gets my bail on,
Weasel down the Yellow Brick Road wit hoes an my mail on.

I chops cream,
Seems like the whole block is holdin' now,
Broke my triple beam, 'cause the whole scene is rollin' now,
Hope I can get to break it down an hold thangs, wit my luck,
Num an Yuk, wit gold thangs on the ice cream truck,
Nut up wit nuthins,
Stroll down the Yellow Brick Road,
Quick to lick fo some paper to fold,
Stole my whole load,
What you want a nigga to get hurt fo??
My operation don't include spendin' on the turf hoe, (biatch!)
The quickest nigga to finish,

Can't be too dumb,
Sewed up the block,
Where you from??
So float on, an roll on, an understand,
Easin down the road,

Five, smoke a lot, all day

You know what I came to do
Came to drink wit a gold face same as you
Drop a fifty on the bar for a fifth of Hindu
Got freaks wit me, gotta get gin too

I know hoes think the same as me
Because they came to the club lookin' like freak nasty
Pullin' niggaz on the floor, dance nasty as you wanna
Rub a dub, dub, lap dance in the corner

Same old shit, same old hits, same old click, same old dick
Bitch, don't look in my eyes, 'cuz I ain't payin'
Ya shoulda known pimpy doo, niggaz, ain't playin'

Just pull down yo' drawls, so a nigga can see
'Cuz I doubt that the pussy is fuckin' wit me
Pop a coochie to the back, pop a coochie to the front
But damn, open yo' thighs, pick up my nigga blunt

What ya really want, what ya really need?
Pop the breaks on that shit and let's get keyed
Girl, I always pictured you in neon lights
Big 44, double D's, what a sight

You and me both, we can get respect
Two triple shots of hen and we'll be on deck
You my type, you old hoe, you my type, you know

Nickle and dime ass nigga to a top hat balla, big rigga like E-Fourtee
Niggaz know me, smoke a lot, only smoke weed, blow trees
Whole keys, see me in a E-3 dub, rollin' sweet up every time you see yuk

Peep us, only bad bitches beep us
Turn yo' main squeeze into a cheata, smokin' reefa
Took off my DK's and she fucked us up wit the whole sneaka
And her pussy, lift yo ass cheeks up so I could see

Mix the hashes up wit the back yard boogie, woogie
Bust nuts on yo' Donna Carra hoodie if it's all goodie
And be a ride a Benz wit my knees, what?
Breakin' trees up, rollin' weed up on my way to the V up

Wit my dime piece mommie, queen bee's keeper
When the bitch shake her ass, nigga, you should see her

Wit a taped on bracelet, diamond laced watches
Mossimo jeans wit her condoms in the pocket
The bitch is real bad in a drop top Jag
Sittin' on chrome shelf on paper tag

Slidin' off G-string off in a coach bag
Dolla sign eyes and a stash full of hash
Back to the side where niggaz blaze
Home of the crew and the booty shake

Straight packed club where the hoes be poppin'
Dick all hard, tryin' to shake a li'l sumthin'
Lookin' for the one that'll do me right
Who keep me cummin' all through the night

Ain't no pitty if you fall to your knees
Fuck me, suck me but nigga, please
Let a nigga hit it, bitch, I know you wit it
From the back 'cuz my dicks all in it

I stick it in like it ain't no thang

Hand cuff your hoes, that goes to all you Captain Save-Hers

I'm sigh now, clown that ass like Saturday Night Live (WHHHYYYY!)
Because I'm all between they wife's thighs
But all jokes aside I yoke the ride and roll the weed up at the same time
While I drive I cross my heart and hope to die
Hella high, it's the mobb blowin' greenery till we die
So haters do me a favor, handcuff your briide
I creep through when your husband's at the job
Many hunners got players, baby mammas feedin' me all kinds 
of hibachi shrimp and I don't even rock Versacci pimpin dudes
But when I'm through, you never knew I touched her
Got her screamin loud as hell like Chris Tucker (aaaaah!)

When I step in the house (niggas snatch they hoes up quickly)
Niggas start breakin' out (cause they all want to get with me)
Cause they know they hoes ain't faithful (and my eyes is on them all)
And I'll snatch them if I'm able (hey, put this lighter on the balls)
Olly-olly-oxenfree, don't hesitate to give your hoes to me

Uh, I'm used to stabbin' top notch and border coochies
Just big booty, firm casabas, preferably groupies (WITH BIG THIIIGHS!)
Makin' em ride they self up the wall easy
Off the expecting them, feel breezy
Do me a favor, take your hoes (HOME)
Before you find your breezy (GONE)
It'll be for life, only players when I'm beerin' at
I want the better things in life
Nice, he ain't hearin' that
I ain't the nigga to be buyin' bitches clothes
they know that and still keep
So handcuff your hoes (handcuff your hoes)

Me being like that no, no, no, no, no
I know some hoes don't want to be a dumb-dummy
but don't play around and disrespect my money
Like a gun I'll take you away
And if you niggas act a fool, I'll spray you with the AK
Just let me take the hoe (and go peacefully)
Let me skip into the sunset (like tweed-de-lee-de-lee)

Smokin sticky, and breathin until my breathe get stinky

I remember when we was hella broke dude
We just had a dream, right?
We made it happen dude

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs
Just me and you
Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang

We used to be short on the avenue so broke on the avenue
I couldn't afford to have a brew
How it happened dude, just me and you
I use to drink brew after you

You had your daughter first, my baby son was born right after you
Now we making cash with Dru, oh look what havin' cash would do
Playahatas come after you, if they blast at you
I'd be the first one to prove what the mass would do

One ain't better than havin' two, looney individuals off cash and brew
Lace the avenues boy I ain't mad at you
Hindu drinkin' glass with you, cheers
We lasted through years what we have to do

We finally here, I got 5 showed on the Billboard Live
Doin' songs with Too Short, courtesy of Jive
Front page of the Vibe, live and direct,
Rafael Saadiq freak that beat chorus and drumset
Make your ears wet like sex, who waitin to come next
With Pavey Rolex, just me and you

We risked it and killed in Cali before we make bread
Creating our heaven on earth but it's worse we cursed from birth
Now turn money and keepin' moms happy
Got me gladly livin lavelle, I say we blessed to have mail

Big Willie, I'm numb to the world baby
Don't speak among thangs unless it pays me
You never see Yuckmouth weighin circumstances
You never see Numbskull flossin takin chances

Advancement is okay doe and cheatin is alright
And it's best to have some killa's on the payroll, day and night
Stick and move pick and choose licks
Benet wasn't in it that's why Benet didn't benefit

Believe my story the tale of glory didn't make me believe
That in America I never had to worry
Cupid wasn't stupid but never was Numb and Yuck
It was all dreams and wishes, game and luck
Just me and you

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs

Ooh baby, coming way up out the game

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' change
Just me and you, oh baby, and the songs turn again
Don't worry 'bout a damn thang

It was gonna happen man
First we got 5 on it, now we got 5 on big beats
Rafael Saadiq, DJ Quik, G 1, that's how it happened man
Once you get large do your thang, big thangs man

Hey, when you saw my show in '94 you didn't know
We'd blow like Nitroclycerin, Girbaud, Tommy Hill, Timberland
Playboy, I use to rock a pendelton, officer arrests a gentleman
Now I'm spending big deusch marks on German women

In the red light district way out in Amsterdam kickin it
Adam and Eve coffee shop, purchase grams wicked
Disappeared like the grand wizard dig it
Trying to be the richest young black brothas in the business

I heard so many times it was hopeless, bogus
Accordin' to both of us the world was untouched
We had to focus, I had to explain thangs to the fullest
Figured out what we could and couldn't

And made plans to get the puddin'
There's too many rules to made and broke
The mail is to be made so lets fade a toast
Now tell these folks to let me be all I can be
So the L U N I Z will go down is history

Just me and you
We made it went from broke to havin' thangs

I knew you was scandalous, man-less, but I took a chance though
Now every time a nigga get paid, I see your hands hoe (ice that dough)
You stick the D.A. on me, and even worse than that
you got my little baby daughter thinkin daddy phony
But will she grow up; you tell her your faulty tales
When you took my essence, I check and spent all the mail
I was in jail, you told lies to my mum
Scooped the next nigga and sucked him at the prom
Now I'm, going to court for welfare-back payments
Because I didn't keep receipts and bank statements
I got the lead on ya, you only daddy's little girl
because I think your daddy's sweet on ya

With little surprises in their bellies
They use it to buy Christelly Chanelle jellies
and ounces of smelly al-greenery, smokin out the whole scenery
My baby mamma, the craziest bra since my wife
At night, she the type to go sleep walkin with a knife
like Jason Nikitcha, tryin to slit ya wrist and the bitch wit'cha
Did ya forget its been three years since I fucked wit'cha (bitch)
Quit fuckin' my high off
Quit showin up at shows askin for dough fuckin my life off
Listen my boss players' haters, let the playboy 
smoke-a-lot for nature, lace, modulate ya (hey)
Tie you shoes on these down-home blues

But nine times out of ten your baby mamma look like boo-boo nigga

Suck her up, but there's a million bitches just like her.

It makes me sick and upset when it's spit and silly.
Whenever you phillie, its all spitty and wet.
It doesn't matter, rich or po', I couldn't care less, bro.
It mixes when I'm out and let the motherfucker smoke no ho.
I shake the bud, mary-tramps, the one that tried to shove the weed up the fifth,
Without givin' up no cocker food stamps.
I know they want it, but smokin' for free, I don't condone it.
Don't put your crusty lips on it if you ain't got no chips on it.
I spent a grip on it, and girl, the cuffs out here.
And if you floss out here, you take a loss out here.
You're doin' too much catin' in the cypher wit'cha.

How many blunts do you blow on the daily?
Many money, I blow many, many, many.
I smoke plenty. (Well, won't your black ass quit being stingy?)
I'm not greedy. (Well, where's that weed fiend?)
(You better quit smokin' those beadys in my fo', hun.)
(Blow one for the po' one.)
(Nigga, don't you owe one?  Act like ya know one.)
No one does it better, break it down with my thumbs.
(Fuck the zigzags, and stack your lungs, make the runs.)
But no fund, no gas money.
(Well, even if a dummy has money.)
(He'll be a dumber dummy then bin his ass money.)
My blunt is my keeper, like cash money.
Blast money, stash money, the last money was considered.
Bombs, stick, green grass money.
Roll, but next time, I'm a put a little to the side. (Hash money.)

Hey nigga, I started smellin' weed and hella weed,
Then I started sellin' weed.
Bitch be tellin' me, they want to smoke.
To catch Mozik than a spellin' bee,
'Cause I smoke they ass under the table.
The hos' stable, pass me that cigarette or phillie.

I got that feelin' again, let's smoke that acrylin'.
Again, I said you willin' again, then we can walk the Poppa-ceiling again.
I storms in like a mighty blast of wind.
Inhale, exhale, the phillies rule my dome an'... (Aaahhh!)

(High powered shit, tell that nigga down the road to roll the shit up, man.)
(Man, why'all niggas need to quit this shit.)
(Nigga, you used to smoke too, more than me here, hit this shit.)
(Man, you already know do'.)

Fuck around and smoke the sprayed up.
Nigga be laid up, walk around like zombies, minds never made up.
Smellin' like ass hemp's and grine, cocky mouth.
Chap lips, fuckin' off all the poo-nanny.
If why'all gonna smoke, I'll be the designated weed roller.
Call me Numboy, the motherfuckin' seed roller.
But you gotta crack the window, though,
'Cause me and the lads like Whoopi Goldberg, in centerfolds.
Drink-a-lot, never like to think-a-lot.
Nigga, I don't smoke no more 'cause I don't like the stank-a-lot.

Nigga, I'm drink-a-lot, smoke-a-lot too, nigga.
Fuck, how you gonna say that shit, nigga, if you be smokin' cigarettes? (Fuck y'all.)
And me nigga. (I want to get blunted, my brother.)

Fuck you nigga, shitty ass niggas. (Fuck you, nigga.)

But this her baby dad and he don't live with her
And at his grandma's pad they left the kids with her
So that explains the pictures I see of this nigga
She says she's low on scrilla, she wanted gifts for her
So she can get her nails done and get her weave fixed
And I can't stand no nappy hair bitch
And so I break off bread, nothin but pocket change
She blew my socks again and then I hopped in the Range
And then she kept on askin for bread, like everyday
""My children need some aspirine, I got some bills to day""

Puffy sell millions, but Yuk, he love the kids

You've got to get some ale inside thee,

You've stopped buying flares,
Seen you drinkin' halves of larger,
You've even been washing your hair.

There was a fit crack in the corner but I knew her cunt was smelly,
She smelt of rotting fish heads and old and crispy sick,
Said her name was Charlotte and she wanted suck me dick.
Oh, I thought now lad, times are hard, and it's nearly closing time,
I'll put a bag on her head, and a peg on me nose,
And I'll grummage through the slime...
Charlotte is the biggest slag in Macc,
She'll do anything to get you in the sack,
With her legs spread wide she opens up her crack,
Spends her life just lying on her back.
Well, we walked along, up Buxton Road,
And strolled along the cut,
She said ""give us an inch and I'll take you a yard.""
So I slammed her half a foot.
Got me hand up her skirt 'cause I'm a Macc Lad,
And I knew just what to do,
I got me hand inside, and me arm inside,
I lost it right up to me tattoo.
Oh, Charlotte is the biggest slag in Macc,
She'll do anything to get you in the sack,
Coffee, sex and johnny bags come free,
So crabs and herpes and VD.
Oh Charlotte.....
And we ended up at her place,
And I waded through the johnnies,
She put another notch in her bedstead, while I watched ""The Two Ronnies"".
Charlotte is the biggest slag in Macc,
She lies in wait and then she springs her trap,
She's always got to take the upper hand,
And you are what you drink, and I'm a bitter man.

Stez Styx banging on shithouse door.

We're going to find some girls who'll give us a decent Alkaselzer.
Now Dan said he knew of this party, so we drove over there,
Belching and farting.
Stez nicked some cans of beer,
And Dan shat himself, he had diarheoa.
He said ""Oh lads, it's no fun to dance.""
And he goes upstairs to change his underpants.
Now he opens the window, wipes his ass,
And throws the offending bags on the grass.
He shouts ""everybody come and look at this,
They're streaked with shit and they're stained with piss,
But don't look at me, they're not fucking mine.""

Lock that fucking door,

Fast Fret found a cat,
It was in the road, all stiff and cold and squashed and thin and flat,
He wants to bring it back in a Tesco bag,

Then one day she made it big when she won Miss Macclesfield.
She married and Italian just 'cause he were posh,
And they honeymooned in Brussles and he played a bit of squash.
Next she wed an ale baron who come from Lancashire,
But he wasn't rich, he was just another Wigan queer.

And under the trees,

Trying to get anthrax,
And make sure they use trite.
Sunk to their nuts whilst their rodding a ram,
And they're just as well hung for a sheep as a lamb.
Sheep shit on their foreskin and all over their suits,
Little black berries in their wellington boots,
Sheep shit on their trousers and all over their flies,
Don't let the farmer pull the wool over your knob.

The Maccabees,"Left you there in the sunlight
In the sunshine by the windowsill in the kitchen
In light of what was to come it was not enough

Just like the cardboard that covered
The missing panes and cracks in our bedroom windows
We should have known they wouldn't keep out the cold

It was not enough
It's not enough
And it never was

And they'll call out with a name by which I'd never call you
And we'll grow out when it's time
And the skins we've known no longer fit us

It's not enough and it leaves you tired

Dirty toes un-showered
Unholy sight the state of you
And every sign that you're wired again

Just look at you in the trolley line

A little less and a little more
In the middle ground is still miles away

So hold me close don't let me go
I need you so
Tell me something I don't know
That I need to know
Hold those arms around my neck
I need you so
Somewhere sunk behind those eyes
A man I've always known

And if you go to sea again
We'll see it out to horizons
To see it all it's a little late
And better never but it's happening

Swigs a bottle to send him on his way down

Your best friends forget you get old

Said he wanted seasons
Miss red hot October
The Black Maria
Is where he finds his honor
The darker the corner
Now the summer's been and gone
No one says a word because it breaks a heart
The coming and the going
Blame it on the ocean
Or coastal erosion

And when the river froze solid you're still swimming upstream

Leave a singing bird silent, make a hummingbird sing

Him and some relatives is Gangsters, sellin' Pussy

Moms dropped him on the spot
Smacked me in the knot
Only he gave you was your name and these blocks
Yup, that's ya Pops

Still, that's me still
Keep it real
If it wasn't for him and his steel there probably wouldn't be a meal 
We in his Caddy siliconed out, zoned out

Three days away from home he come back stoned out
Coke on the table, pressin' redial
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
Yo, why you doin' that? but gettin' big

Half the niggas I run wit' gettin' jig
The other fifty cent balancin' a bid
Oh shit, got this bitch seeded
To God I pleaded

What should I do? knock your self off, but the God succeeded
And the most scariest part is you better have heart
'Cause the Lions and wolves will rip you apart
Have Faith in your God

Shoot joints, get involved
Put tints on your windows, whip cars
Yeah, all the giants revolve
Black Clarion, ready to die for the family hard

Alcoholic vultures with toasters
Sheep skins on
Leather sleek Bombers, bums with no coats on
We livin' financially fucked up, gotta have credit

Smoke a bag of wet and set it
The block we deaded
Society's grown too black and too strong to prolong
Got my Woman with a gun in her thong

It's kinda wild how we livin'
The Devil's force has risen
We travel from here to prison
A presidency shelter for my elders

That's real, 'cause we need them and they need us, that's love for ya
Leavin' on this moment
Meditatin' at Four in the Mornin'
Nigga you screamin'.....
 
[Chorus]
I got hustlin' on my mind otherwise I'm feelin' fine, I'm ghetto
I like black tint on my car, at the park a Superstar, I'm ghetto
See me cruisin' down the lane, two miles per hour Baby, I'm ghetto
I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto

[Madd Rapper]
Born in the gutter
A Black Pops and a Puerto Rican Mother
I kept a stolen whip and razor sharp box cutter
Known from Albany Ave to 98th and Sutter

My leathers was pleathers while ya'lls was butter
Robbin' and hustlin' anything for a profit
Thirteen years old 3 Months in Spofford
Crime, I couldn't stop it

Didn't pass the Tenth grade
School was cool but it didn't keep our rent paid
So every Wednesday me and my Dogs
Hop the train for a Ki in the Bronx

Knowin' all along the shit was wrong 
Ain't the first and damn sure ain't the last, 
It keeps goin' on, so keep movin' on
Same old story, my Pops left

Waves and Pony's and mock necks
Tre's and Forty's and hot sex
With around the way bitches, 
From around the way riches, yo, my block reps

I stay Brooklyn zoned, underground is how I network
Million dollar meetings in Timbs and sweatshirts
So pardon my appearance, everythings all good
Nigga I'm just like you except I'm from the hood. 

[Chorus]

I got bills and shit to pay, and another mouth on the way, I'm ghetto

[D-Dot]
This goes out to all my peoples in the hood, in ghettos all
Around the nation and all around the World, know what I'm sayin'?

Spend a dollar on some wine, hang my clothes out on the line, I'm ghetto
See me cruisin' down the lane, doin' two miles per hour Baby, I'm ghetto 
I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto

Does anyone mind the truth y'all?

Pockets fool of chips with the glass on the wrist
Got a mashion in the Hamptons that niggas would kill for but I'm never

Dipped in Sean John
Chilling in Justins and spilling the Sean Don
I roll in the Rolls on cruise-control
If you know what I know then you can go where I go
Got a whole a lot of dough and money in escrow

Let me take you back before the lights, before the crowd, before we made a sound

She told me son well from the side of town, no one even makes it out
Before we created, before they hated, 
before anyone anticipated, we just want to make it
They said your crazy nothing is ever changing 
So I packed up all my things and headed out towards the ocean

You know what I'm saying, if you ever wanted something
So bad that you can taste it, gonna sleep until you make it
And you know when you got it no one else could ever take it
When I met her she was easy, she was happy just to make it
She never wanted nothing just, something to believe in
When the storm start raging, and all the tribulations
When the five stars waiting, you've just got to recreate it

Saw a pair of head lights

I pulled over, asked the driver
Hey man, where you going?

But I need to get there

You see, this truck is all but broken

How I even left here?

I'm not trying to make excuses

Like cold water it hit me
When he opened up the door

To a small house in the country
There were pictures on the wall
Of places I remember
And people I recall

He said, son you're nothing like me
But I'm so glad that you're here
Then he cried and said, I'm sorry
And I've missed you all these years

And I don't know
How did we get here?

And this house of cards came tumbling down
Just scattered hearts and broken pieces
No hand to hold, no consolation
And suddenly,

Second chances, new romances
Conversations, good vibrations
Stolen glances, strangers dancing
Feels good knowing, life keeps going
Suddenly

Look at the colors around you, changing
Just feel the music that’s always playing
Right when you think that it’s over, baby
Somebody new comes along to save you
Cause loving, leaving, it’s only changing
Right when you think that you’re going crazy
Well, that’s the moment you know it, baby

Where romance blooms and fades,
A great Philadelphia lawyer
Was in love with a Hollywood maid.
""Come, love, and we will wander
Down where the lights are bright.
I'll win you a divorce from your husband,
And we can get married tonight.""
Wild Bill was a gun-totin' cowboy,
Ten notches were carved in his gun.
And all the boys around Reno
Left Wild Bill's maiden alone.
One night when he was returning
From ridin' the range in the cold,
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart,
Her love was as lasting as gold.

As he drew near her window,
A shadow he saw on the shade;
'Twas the great Philadelphia lawyer
Makin' love to Bill's Hollywood maid.
The night was as still as the desert,
The moon hangin' high overhead.
Bill listened awhile to the lawyer,
He could hear ev'ry word that he said:

""Your hands are so pretty and lovely,
Your form's so rare and divine.
Come go with me to the city
And leave this wild cowboy behind.""

Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched, then your smile turned to a blush
I had to get to know your name
Then I got your number
17 and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know cause there's things I got to show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you
Now your acting all shy, hmm I wonder why
Every time I look at you, you turn and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me loosing my mind
With your zodiac sign, my perfect match in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash

If I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi, met eyes when you passed me
Been inside of my head all day
What can I say?
All I can do is reminisce like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
And all that good stuff
Calling you bluff, now look at us
 
Just met and already talkin' 'bout trust
All the things we did
How we planned to live
How you got rid of that kid, who use to call you crib
Shut it down
Now look what you found state of dawn
You da bomb, plus you got props from my mom
Now it's all about us cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Think about you all of the time

I'm glad I made my move
I'm glad I stepped to you
Enough respect that my whole crew excepted you
Even my ex called you
She wasn't insecure
Feeling she got a little hurt but was being mature
Gave her blessing
She learned a valuable lesson
Now she's my best friend
Don't even stress, 'cause all I see is you and me
Like Latifah you're queen lets bring some unity
Ain't no reason to fight, We're always keeping it tight
Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike
Always on my mind with your Gucci design
Feel free to drop a line, yeah that would suit me fine

Making dreams come true, buying rings for two
Now it's all about us cause we're hooked like drugs

With the things we say

To the games we play

Dreams that awaken the fear
That we're left in doubt
Tears that come rolling
And rolling and rolling down

You wanted it all
You wanted it all

What keeps me broken in this world?

You gotta wait for her
But it's a wounded alibi
You gotta wait for her

If I fall asleep tonight
Will it all remain the same?
If I fall asleep tonight
Will it always end the same?

that destiny will be kind--
While they're digging for gold, diving for pearls,
& aiming for heaven from this man made world.
Come on down--the devil's in town
He's brought you sticks and stones
 to bust your neighbors bones,
he's stuck his missiles in your gardens,
& his theories down your throat--
& god knows what your gonna do with him
 'cause I certainly don't
CHORUS
Down by the river, I've been washing out my mouth,
'cause deep in the heart of me
 there's a frightened man breaking out.
Oh I was just looking for paradise
 anywhere in this world
While they're gunning for heaven--
 from this man made hell!!!

True feelings have turned to mere gestures
Words of love now all seem just lies

No use to keep on pretending
I know tht we've run out of time
It's no longer love, now we have to let it go

I remember, when I met you
How bad can you fall in love
When I touched you, when I held you
I'd never let you go

The memories could be never fading
They might force love to give us a new try.

And how did we fall in love

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

So sweet, cool and so fair

The Maine,"Photograph,
Remembering the summer
It takes me back, to Southern California.

Where the girls would all pass
On the boardwalk and laugh
At our desperate attempts and our sunburned backs
We never had a chance, I remember that
And no matter what we do,
Well never lose what we had growing up.

Won't bring us down.
Yeah, growing up,
It won't bring us down,
Growing up wont bring us down
Growing up wont bring us down

Graduate,
Whats a kid to do now?
Get away, (yeah-ah)
We've got so much to prove.
Cause its time to move on
And I start to let go,
But then Wonderwall comes on the radio,
I flashback to the night in your parents yard,
When we drank too much and we talked about god

Growing up, won't bring us down.
Growing up, it won't bring us down.
Were in this together,
Yeah, we'll make it somehow,
Nothings gonna stop us now...

The Maine,"Got caught running up a tab
Couldn't drive home so I had to share a cab
Introduced herself by her last name
The kind of girl you steal from the football team

Brought up a silver spoon mess
Always trying to tear off her Catholic dress
Told me she's over this place
Needs to feel the Midwest wind in her face

But the alcohol made its way down
She was the last thing that I saw last night before I hit the ground
Oh god I did the wrong thing to the right girl
My mind was only in it for a minute

Had a bad fling with a good girl
I was stupid and dumb not giving a
The blank stare out the window
If I could just sober up I could just admit

I did the wrong thing to the right girl
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
I've never been the best with my mouth

Try to stay smart but the dumb comes out
Maybe I'm shy, I drive an old car
Maybe I'm amazed that I got this far
And I got my stand-bys waiting on the line

But the hardest part is knowing that it won't be her this time
Oh god I did the wrong thing to the right girl
My mind was only in it for a minute
Had a bad fling with a good girl

I was stupid and dumb not giving a
The blank stare out the window
If I could just sober up I could just admit
I did the wrong thing to the right girl

It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back

Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back
She came back
Thought she had it all planned out

Went to marry some guy she had talked about
A tear in her dress and a tear in her eye
And just like that her whole life flashed by
She won't remember what you said last night

That if you ever needed someone to pick up the pieces in your life
Oh god I did the wrong thing to the right girl
My mind was only in it for a minute
Had a bad fling with a good girl

I was stupid and dumb not giving a
The blank stare out the window
If I could just sober up I could just admit
I did the wrong thing to the right girl

But it ain't comedy when one of they arms get broke

I used to sell hell sex love, lies and dope
What do I mean I used to? I just wrote this song
I put my pride aside, my inhibitions are gone

So you on punishment forever girl, are you feelin me?
I ain't dressed up tonight to argue and fight (uh)

'cause after you get this money, we puffin grass all night
Til we look irresponsible like we ain't got no job (ah)

Rip me off with my cut, ain't no sex involved (right!)

I ain't down with the dick, but there's some tricks who want to rub some
So I send them four hour to get paper and a lump sum
These tricks is holdin on my man, thinkin they get love, son!

Sure as sooky, that booky goin be lookin for his paper
And when you lose all your booze, then your crew gon' hate you
So much they probably lace ya dutch and then rape you (ouch!)
Talkin bein bitch, just think of it as lurid
When you come home, your mother's like
""You know how your friends is!""
Splendid, now y'all are startin to get the gist

Outside my window was a steeple
With a clock that always said twelve-thirty

And in the mornings I can see them walkin'
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn
And I can't keep myself from talkin'

To say ""Good mornin'"" and really mean it
To feel these changes happenin' in me

Vibrations bounce in no direction

The way I'm longing to
A thousand hopeful dreams I have
Are finally coming true
I used to put you on a pedestal
Where you became untouchable
But now we touch and now so much is possible

Just being near to you (So near to you)
Would be enough for me (For me)
The many years without your love have been so tough on me
But now a change has taken place in me
I found someone whose faith in me
Has given me the strength I need so desperately

Oh in my darkness you turn on the light
My illusions vanish overnight
The thought of loving you is now reality
The thousand dreams I have I'll know in the end how it could be
For as we melt in love so beautiful
I never felt so wonderful

It'll come back someday.

It's not the spotlight.
It ain't the candlelight.
And it ain't the streetlight
Of some old street of dreams.
It ain't the moonlight,
Not even the sunlight.
But I've seen it shinin' in your eyes,
And you know what I mean.

Sometimes I try to tell myself:
""You know the light was never real,"" 
A fantasy that used to be the way I used to feel.
But you and I know better now,
Even though it's been so long.
If your memory really serves you well,
You'd never tell me I'm wrong.

[Chorus]

If I ever feel the light again,
You know things will have to change.
Names and faces, homes and places,
Will have to be rearranged.
And you can help me come about,
If you're ever so inclined.
Ain't no rhyme or reason,
A woman can't change her mind.

The shadows climb the wall
The door is closing, now on to
Something more

And goodbye love
A whisper down the hall
The wind that's all
You still don't call

Maybe I'll drink too much 
Try not to think too much
And lie awake each night until
The dawn

We hardly ever flew
But I'll remember
At least forever
The time of love and you

It's 3 AM and I miss you so
Couples are departing soon they'll all be gone
Now another day is starting
Still I linger on with

Purple shadows and blue champagne
With the echoes that still remain
I keep a blue rendezvous

Bubbles rise
Like a fountain before my eyes
And they suddenly crystallize
To form a vision of you

All the plans we started, all the songs we sang
Each little dream we knew
Seems to overtake me
Like a boomerang
Blue is the sparkle, gone is the tang

It's your refrain,
Keeps returning, as I remain
With all the memories and blue champagne
To toast the dream that was you
I'm bluer than blue champagne

The Mar-Keys,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony

It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart

But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before

Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

Somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second
You may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I don't care if I can be here

With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control

The curse that flew right by you

Stained walks crutch in hobbled sway

A capulary hint of red 
Only this manupod 
Crescent in shape has escaped 
The house half the way 
Fell empty with teeth 
That split both his lips

Was he robbed of the asphalt that cushioned his face 
A room colored charlatan 
Hid in a safe

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

His lap danced lapel, punctuated by her 
Decrepit prowl she washed down the hatching 
Gizzard soft as a mane of needles 
His orifice icicles hemorrhaged 
By combing her torso to a pile 
Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse 
She was a mink handjob in sarcophagus heels

Spilling from morgue lancet 
Caressed your fontanelle

Panic in the worms

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more 
Let them see it has begun 
The others I've become 

If you should see the dice 
Charmed with it's snaked choked eyes 
You'll wear the widows weeds 
Because they're just your size 

Behind the snail secretion 
Leaves a dry heave that absorbs 
A limbless procreation 
Let the infant crawled deformed 

A bag replace the breath 
Of these suffocating sheets 
And now when the craving calls 
I'll scratch my itchy teeth 

And soon 
Come on

Sister flooded deaf tears 
That night tore a river 
In her baron womb mirror 

And his multiple sons 
With their mandible tongues 
Set crucified fires to petrified homes 
Let it burn 

And the owls they were watching 
And the owls did't care 
Then the owls came a knocking 
Placenta in their stares 

They will feed on all the carnage 
Leftover from the flood 
And in the corner of their eyes 
Fled sister L'Via

Reflecting all at dusk

Twenty five snakes pour out your eyes 
Yeah the icepicks cumming on the marble shrine 
Twenty five snakes are drowning 

You cant bend your crooked arms 
Or fold your punctured proof 
The air is growing cold 
And there's nothing you can do 

Soon there'll be no gauze 
Inside the confessional 
Only rows of crows 
Defrocking every breath 

And one day you'll remember 
Behind the melting cones 
I said one day you'll remember 
Behind the melting cones 
You've already had a family 
In the burial of your home 

Not forevermore

Peel it back let it all run

Gestated in his bed

Gutted at the nave, yes gutted and depraves

Mix it, a leak will rain

The Mars Volta,"Tell me it's over
Rusbel awaits
I've been to the surface
And nothing is there
Eyelids sank muffled
In the nerve aura sound
But when she awakes
Will she still be with us

My heart is darkclots
Leap year is late
How did you get here
Ask all but the bait
From a christ that went hissing
Constricting his cells
We summon by candle by book and by bell

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

Pricking it's hail
Slothful the child
That preys on the seed
Shall behead the drough
Wound under sleeves
I hope you have room
In a thicket of vines

Give me a moment
To clean what you've stole
The streets will hang high
Stretch ribs and let taste
We'll cover the smell with silver nitrate
Mending the cuts of your prosthetic faith

Then so long
Dear mnemonic
Assume the form
You've given me and I'll spill

Now hold on
Just hold my hand
Say that they made you
But you brought your own leash
Tell me no more no
Say I'm the last one
Outside
By the drift
You read my will
Of thread and itch
Failure to comply
As failure to decease
And still you won't know everything
I've built the fall

Sulking drained the fall of my pale will
Swarming by your steps
Licking the ankles of blasphemer guilts
It only meant to drape a plastic
Over the stuck pig scalp of head
To cover the sock where the flatline had spread
The kiosk in my temporal lobe
Is shaped like rosalyn carter
She says my map is home again
But torn face down
I have only but a million blemishes
To tell you all about
In the end they just gagged me
To make him come out

Gas me the hind
Of your five legged snare
Tooth picks the eye
But no things there
Down drags your waltz
Cross the alter top
From a sleep that
Depravation knew
Trespass your form
I'm void of dusk
I'd ask to look
But the mask stays on

You'll levitate
Teutonic print
Cruelty is the wrath
Of my instrument

In the end they just gagged me
To make him come out

You locked the cuffs
Arsenic erupts
Will you drink the shadow
Of my red hair

You and your false
Witness to God
You've one in the chamber
But your finger got stuck

Let slip the sound
Of a cry for help
But all was lost
On the night you walked

Palms speak through eyes
Serve your memory lost
I contaminate with insignias

In the end they just gagged me
To make him come out

I won't forget a face that left me

Just you wait
Till I get my hands on you
I can't
You won't remember

Unwrap my corpse
And let it thaw
In the eye of the needle
I can't get out

They'll check my wrist
I'll faint a pulse
I'm not the human
You thought I was

In your arms without light)

Stands in the way of you

Carry water in a basket
Where the hole was dug the first time
The head that carries the body
A blood that flows through veins

Do you need to repent?

The Mars Volta,"I should have always known
You'd scratch that itch
When you asked for safe passage
On my shoulders where we slid
And just before you laid
Dead weight upon its shores
I stung you in the face
For that's the nature of my core

Because
I got distance
Don't let it close
Gotta let me know
You just gotta let me know

Because
Forget which way
Is out now
Gotta let me know
You just gotta let me know

It knows that I am visible
I'm broken mirrors
And useless prayer
This lock is healing me
You know you came so willingly
Waiting is a vessel
That will take me to
Love, it knows no order
When you taste the truth
Because
I'm trapped in this cement husk
Gotta let me go
You just gotta let me go

Because
I paid with own touch now
I bought a little cut
There is blood for every month
In the way you used to
Call her wicked answers
Time is a plague
There's no time for this place
If you don't let me go
Heaven's made a cesspool of us all

I'm nowhere near
This place you wear
It's unforgivable
It knows that I am visible
I'm broken mirrors
And useless prayer
This lock is healing me
You know you came so willingly
There burns a kiss with serpent scales
There is no miracle
I lost your miracle

I wrap myself around
Your buried questions
Through blisters of confinement
I seek to drain
This broken shelter
To refill the pigment case
That I have left

Don't stay long
For teeth nurse
The first wound
Coats revolve
Hope to gain
What if we find
What tongue ties double Windsor
Invoke to no reply
Those that lie
Have froze
At the border
No implies
Close the frame
What if we find
The sunlight draws a curtain
Invoke to no reply
There's a place
Where this
Depth charge ignites
Where the soul has no purpose
I can't believe you
When your thirst won't let me go
I am the moment you were always speaking of
Because there's no fence will hold
The sentient culprit fall about it
Say where I can enter them
Culprit fell about it
One fell, the other taste won't lie
Make no doubt about it

How many cave into the pressure I apply
If you take this breath of mine",Agadez

What have you brought for my appetite?

I'll never perish with the albino horns of a thousand young born.
Will you drink to the depths of my seed?
And your arms will break
If you touch this fence
Praise them to this life comes to end.

What have you brought for my appetite?
What have you brought for my appetite?

I might not make it back again,
The burbane is on the rise
Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe they've got to open wide, got to open wide.

Psycho recycled and I'm next to nothing

I said help me come alive
Help me come alive
Help me come alive
Help me come alive

Am I living or am I dead?
Do what thou will tell them what I found
The steps of a ladder from a diamondbacks mouth

Corrosive I became
Where a scarlet bruise grows
Sprout the fault we own

Used insomnia's been cleansing with floods
I got a pain inside that'll rip through the very fabric of time
Cause I've been with you before god gave me sin
I've got to get born
Just so you know there's too many reasons

You set the silver down to guard me from the weak
You check the spelling for nothing
You sent yourself the flood

All of this time

Where am I now
That the music has faded

And I'm nowhere near the place
You sent me here to breathe
But I'm drawing closer to the present
And I'll find a space with no memories
I've got a second chance to inhabit the living

If goliath wont speak
I'm blinded by heaven
When will your eden come die
If the liars that blink are bound by the sender
Trinkets you gave have all rusted down

We came rewinding when
I foamed at the mouth while the lights winked at me
And now my shape is kept
The rain it can't hide, wash the pain from this hex
Is it so permanent?
Did she catch a left eye when it blinks three times
Or once just to seal you in
In your drunken breath did it stain like us
In place of poison heat
I gotta rid this world of your intention
Swap the corpse in the casket

[Chorus]
Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Does he make you feel alright?

When I seep inside your truth through suspicious little coughs
You sank your nails inside a key while the door you shut closed up
The black stockings you kept smell of wet cigarette
Torn of lust that you could not keep
I have slept inside your fault to have you keep me hear on this leash
For the rest of your pets I will feed to this theft
As we consummate the vows of defeat
And when you pray for an end to this I do believe this is eternity

Say it, say it, say it loud
Hold your heavy burden
In a pocket full of drink that I have drunk
Spit the remnants in your direction
This is the closest to any kingdom that you will come

I'm starting to feel a miscarriage coming on
It's numbing a stump clearing in my throat
And I just can't lose grip of it
She fumigated my mental hygiene
I'm all out of pulse but I know you can resuscitate me

The Mediam,"This is me

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
Woah, we are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're making me to go, you're begging me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love, and I'm chained to your side

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

And if I'm losing control will you turn me away or touch me deep inside?
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this could die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing

Give me the half-hearted smile
I need a place to come down for a little while
Give me the luck of the draw
I've done so well on my own
I need a face I can trust when I'm alone

Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Now that I'm lost and lonely
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me

I need place to call home
Give me a life to begin
I need a place when I'm tired and the skin is thin
Give me a face I can read
I've seen some terrible sights
Give me a reason to breathe when it's late at night

Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Now that I'm lost and lonely
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Now that I've lost control

If not the weight of the world
If not the trick of the light
If not the sign of the times
I could be somewhere tonight
Here at the end of the line
Here at the peak of my form
I'm at the prime of my life
Here in the eye of the storm

Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Now that I'm lost and lonely
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me
Is anybody gonna comfort me

I need a place to call home
I've left scene of the crime
I need a face I can trust with all this time",Comfort Me
The Melismatics,"Show a little inspiration, show a little spark
And show that things that drew me to you and stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean something to you
Our hearts are beating while we sleep, but while we're wide awake
You know the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Show a little passion, baby, show a little style
And show the knack for knowing when and the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us when fear obscures the path
You know we got this far, darling, not by luck, but by never turning back
Some will call on destiny, but I just call on faith
That the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, to what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Caught up in our little lives, there's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes; you're searching for that field of clover
So show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show the world a little light when you show it your heart
We've got two lives, one we're given and the other one we make
And the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard (everything we got, we got the hard way)
Everything we got, we got the hard way
(Because the world won't stop) hang on, baby...
