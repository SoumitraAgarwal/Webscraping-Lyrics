The Melismatics,"Suffocation, oxygen, DOA, born again 
Anesthetics numb the pain, new beginnings start again 
Pick myself up off the floor, and find the strength I had before 
I am digging deep 

Television, tunnel vision, execution and exhibition 
Narcissism, indecision, desperation, lack of vision 
Take the pleasure with the pain, find the strength to rise again 
We are digging deep 

Always hanging on, in the twilight sleep, never giving up, forever digging deep 

Poison air, breathe it in, let it bleed, heal the skin, desecration, revelation, medication kicking in 
What we're feeling will transcend the situations we are in 
We are digging deep 

Gentle leader, violent leader, expectations, limitations, killing time until I die 
I saw the future in your eyes, I know why you won't sleep tonight, I've seen you in a different light 
You are digging deep 

Always hanging on, in the twilight sleep, never giving up, forever digging deep 

Poison air, breathe it in, let it bleed, heal the skin, desecration, revelation, medication kicking in 
What we're feeling will transcend, situations we are in 
We are digging deep 

Always hanging on, in the twilight sleep, never giving up, forever digging deep 
Always 
Always",Digging Deep
The Melodians,"I could feel these trills walking over
When you held me tight
Now I feel those pain taking over
When you said goodnight

Oh, what sweet sensation
Lord, what strange emotion
You got love and devotion
And I won't forget your touch

Now there's nothing left for me to say, girl
Than stay in your world
You got someone's soul deep inside, girl
And love that's richer than gold

And I won't forget your touch",Sweet Sensation
The Melodians,"Hey girl, don't ask me for it's a long time now I've seen ya
Hey girl, don't ask me for it was love I gave ya

Let love begin my darling, let's start from beginning
I know you know how I love you more

For it was love I gave you, I gave you all
It was love I gave you, I gave you all

From the bottom of my lonely heart

I know I gave you my heart to hold
Or in the winter when it was so cold, yeah

For it was love I gave you, I gave you all
It was love I gave you, I gave you all girl

From the bottom of my lonely heart

We're gonna make things better
Just you wait and see
You for me and me for you
We'll find so much joy in the things we do
We can make our wishes come true

Oh, I say

My love is for real and you can feel the same way too

The Memphis Horns,"When I think about the good love you gave me
I cry like a baby
Living without you is driving me crazy
I cry like a baby
Well, I know now, that you're not a plaything
Not a toy, or a puppet on a string

As I look back on a love so sweet
I cry like a baby
Oh, every road is a lonely street
I cry like a baby
I know now that you're not a plaything
Not a toy, or a puppet on a string

Today we passed on the street, and you just walked on by
how my heart just fell to my feet
and like a fool I began to cry

Oh when I think about the good love you gave me

The Memphis Horns,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The Men They Couldn't Hang,"This train leaves when the sun goes down
When the lights are low in the northern towns
Starts without a whistle, leaves without a word
Just a light turned red and a driver on board
Through the mountain lakes it's a downward track
Into Lancashire and the cities black
Where the rose was red and the cotton wove
Where the chimney's hushed and the cotton mills closed
Midnight Train like an echo
Of heavy rain falling down
Midnight Train's carrying something
That's like a poison from the ground
>From Nottingham down to Bosworth field
Past canals and forest and the rivers still
By the rails there's a boy who begins to wave
Feels the sting of the wheels like the chill of the grave
Midnight Train like an echo
Of heavy rain falling down
Midnight Train's carrying something
That's like a poison from the ground
When the sun comes up then it's London bound
Over rusty junctions and the underground
Heading east to the coast it's the end of the line
A terminal glowing with nuclear shine
Midnight Train like an echo
Of heavy rain falling down
Midnight Train's carrying something
That's like a poison from the ground
Midnight Train like a chain
Around the body of the land
Seven boxcars full of trouble

And you say that your feelings might change too
And I don't want to hear o that nonsense ringing in my ears
And I'm not gonna cry because of you

I like it when you tell me what you're thinking
I love the way you kiss when you've been drinking
I love the way we wrestle on the floor to stand up bruised
But I hate the way I wake up feeling used

And my broken tongue and sad lips
Have nothing left to say
My tattered heart and torn parts
Are only in your way

I'd rather not feel pain than be your lover
I'd rather be your lover than your friend
I'd rather wrap these arms around

In amazing grace and a hacking cough

Took dictation, wrote it shorthand

I was young, that's no excuse
For the harm and the abuse

So what was it that you wanted
What would you've done if you had got it?
It was always ever gonna go so far

Accept no imitation, baby, catch a collapsing star
But it's your limitations that make you what you are

Where we both first learned forgiveness
By the moonlight in the forest
Where our lives spread out before us

So you wrote me in a letter
You can stay gone but don't stay bitter
It was always ever gonna end the same
'Til someone thought to push you 'neath the train

Took vacation in New Orleans and I held you on the shore there
Splurged your words, confused your thoughts
Spoke in riddles no one got
So what was it that we wanted and God forbid if we had got it

It was always gonna have to go too far

Now I am wondering
Is this the way it's done here
Are you ever gonna stop doing me

The 12th of May, a day of rain
He didn't come home
My husband dead
Without a service, without grace

Said the machine went down so hard
He didn't feel a thing
What were those knife wounds
What were those bruises on his face

Invisible guilt
Invisible shack back in the trees
If they ever even find me
I haven't had a name since I came

My stomach swells, the putrid smells
Even worse the past few days
My soul is leaving me
My heart is hiding in his grave

My fears turn to something worse
Jam the hole with your jagged key
Would you please push me down
Or would you spare the boy in me?

Could I have found my way out?
Could my two girls grow up to be free?
If you ever touch a hair on their heads
If you ever look at them the way you do me
I'll wash away my faith and stayed in red

First you, you gotta find her
If she's an airhead you never mind her
You search throughout every club in the land
It's better than using your hand
You find yourself a real dumb chick
Someone to get down on your dick
Then you know what you got to do
You take her home now for a screw

You got to 
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her

Then you, you got to feel her
Then you, you start to peel her
You feel up her booty and you feel her tits
Make sure she hasn't got no zits
Feel her body and you feel her ass
Make sure she's got a lot of class

Then you know what got to do
You take her home now for a screw

Then you, you got to fuck her
If she's got big tits you suck her
Then you fuck her for a little while
Ram it on home now doggy style
Rubbing and oozing and maxing
And squirting it right in her face
she's the biggest slut in the place
Then you ball her with her legs in the air
Or on a bed or over a chair

There she is,
That big ugly airhead
she's coming back,
What do we do men?
We find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Find her, feel her, fuck her, forget her
Then you, you got to forget her
Pretend you never met her
You point to the fucking door
And say get out of here,
You fucking whore
Pick up your bra and pick up your blouse
And get the hell out of my house
Pretend you never met her,
It's time to regret her

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it
And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit
Funny little gay Hawaiian Chant
Ow way tah tualan Me big bad fightin' man
Tho it started on an island down Hawaii way
It's as popular in Tennessee or Ioway
If you wander into any cabaret
You will hear this gay Hawaiian Chant",Ta-Hu-Wa-Hu-Wai (Hawaiian War Chant)
The Merry Macs,"Someday, when I'm awfully low
And the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely
With your smile so warm, and your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that smile that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it, 'cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Just the way you look tonight",The Way You Look Tonight

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
The Merrywoode Singers,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
The Merrywoode Singers,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

You can't kill him 
'Cause he's already dead
He's got the strength 
Of darkness now
The strength of twenty anyhow
He's got girlies in his mind
Scarred fingers and a
Rageous brain
Six bullets buried in his chest
We'll never stop him

He won't shirk
You won't laugh and he won't cry
On his anniversary you could die
He's wetted his chops and now he's out
But you won't see him move about
He's out for blood 
He's got a thirst
Goodbye to that happy

Slow down you grave robbing bastard
Stop right there I hear the constable scream
Slow down you grave robbing bastard

A crowd of locals heading my way
Why can't they leave me alone

Six hundred years ago
He ruled his world with a vicious hand
And he didn't fuck about oh no
Kings and queens and mighty rulers
Handed over money to stop him getting mad
And made sure they smiled has they handed over money
And had a drink to the good king vlad

With his bold army from Transylvania
Nearly just as black heart as he
They slaughtered all nations that would not bow to him
It was a bloody sight to see
Prince and paupers sons and daughters
Show him respect or he'll nail on your hat
So give up your treasure and don't be sad
Just have drink to the good king vlad

Fly the dragon flag stained in blood
Impale people every day
Long live the legend of this great king
His memory will never fade away

Fell to nothing and gave all they had
So fill up your cup with the blood of his enemy's

Ruby's tied pretty outside like a dog
With an old tow chain clamped to a log

His daddy tried to kill him thought he had done
Just to make sure he left him cooking in the sun

Stole him self a hooker just to keep himself warm

The Methadones,"

I've got too much going on and I don't know what to do.
The pace is getting frantic, everything is falling through.
I'm way over my head and the load is way too much to bear.
I brought it all upon myself.
I still keep going on moving as fast as I can.
Can't stop to pick up the pieces try to fill every demand.
Moving twenty directions simultaneously.
I lost my ehad along the way.

[Chorus]
Slow down.





",Slow Down
The Methadones,"I'm gonna hang out with myself.
I won't be in debt to anybody
Or have to worry about pushing anyone
'Cause I don't want them around.

And everybody around me has told me things that I don't believe
Seems like everyone around is pleased when I'm not happy.

I'm all alone again,
And I'm perfectly content for now.

As I dream of somewhere else,
I won't have to answer to anybody
Or have to listen to the moronic views that I hear everywhere.
As I wonder, I start to doubt that anyone would have relief
To a lie he's gonna say before I walk away
There's no use in trying to explain?

I'm all alone again,
And I'm perfectly content.
Yeah, I'm all alone again,
And I'm perfectly content for now.




",Solitude
The Methadones,"

You keep hoping someday you'll have it all.
It keeps your mind chasing dreams down it's slick and darkened hall.
You just can't be happy with what you got.
Unless you own the whole damn lot.
Think about what you have, instead of what you don't have.
And you would find that you're doing better than most.
When you finally hold the things you've been longing for, you immediately think about the next.

[Chorus]
Have you ever looked around you? Have you ever enjoyed the moment?
Have you ever let yourself just simply be?
Can you think of strengths that you have, instead of what you think you need.
Did you ever question what you believe?

The grass just gets greener on the other side.
While the moment keeps passing by.
And it will never be good enough to appreciate what's already there.

And if you'd take a look, take a look around.





",Take a Look
The Methadones,"There's a very peculiar way you see the world
You scan it through a pair of colored lenses
You package it neatly in your head
Choose to see it the way you want to

[Chorus]
Which doesn't reflect the way they really are
It's just a one dimensional view
As the truth unfolds the look of disbelief is in your eyes
It didn't turn out the way you thought it would

It takes a long time to really know anyone
Don't make your mind about what you think you see
You might always have some biases
Look at the facts to replace the skewed beliefs

[Chorus]
Which doesn't reflect the way they really are
Its just a one dimensional view
As the truth unfolds the look of disbelief is in your eyes
It didn't turn out the way you thought it would

Don't sell yourself a false bill of goods
Be more practical before you make your assessment
You're walking into a downward spiral
I wish you luck in trying to get out",Wake Up
The Methadones,"

You keep hoping you'll wake up and have the answers to your life.
The more you search, you find the reckless driver of your mind.
You think if you keep trying to figure out where it all went wrong.
You can move one step further to a place where you belong.

You keep asking yourself - who am I?

Trying to be everything to please everyone you can.
Don't know which way to turn to, but no one can hold your hand.
And make you find the answers that you need.
No one outside yourself can lead your destiny.

You keep asking yourself - who am I?

Don't want to believe that any of this is real.
Yet you can't turn off the emptiness you feel.





",Who Am I?
The Methadones,"I sit here waiting for you to acknowledge me with a greeting or a simple smile
These things I once took for granted now go a long way with me
They can make it all worth while

I hope you'll listen to what I have to say
You're so far away now
Everything turns into a game
You're so far away even though you're right here next to me
I keep hoping that you'll let me in

I've got this sick feeling in my gut that's been lingering for weeks
From the things that you have and have not said
Please don't turn away something I find important to me
Should I roll over and play dead?




",Far Away

As we passed each other by

But that was a long time ago

How did it ever come to this?

Take a walk
Think it over
While strolling beneath the moon
Don't say things in December
You'll regret in June

Ware your remark
Before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon,
Don't be erratic 
Be diplomatic
To keep your heart's in tune

Cruel harsh words
Often spoken

Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And you'll hear your sister sleep talking
Say ""Your hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
But your beard
Someday might be""

And she'll wake up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two cent coins that are no good no more
She'll lay it aside

Older father, weary soul, you'll drive
Back to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce
And a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings

And you'll find somebody you can blame
And you'll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And you'll find the peace of the Lord.

Grandfather, weary soul, you'll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
You've waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die

It was the only woman you ever loved
That got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread and it ran into her body and her blood
And there's nothing you can do about it now",Blood

And I'm afraid I don't got the cash,
To keep you happy, and I'm upset,
Cause you show me that your not free, that you need big fat limosenes,

And I kept you dry, and I took the tears fallen from your eyes, and the snow came down
And I kept you warm, and I kept you safe from your daddys dorm, when he said to you
That you can't see me, ""all those pools boys got nothing good to be"", now they got to you,

The Mighty Clouds of Joy,"I came to Jesus as I was, 
I was weary, worn, and sad 
I found in Him a resting place 
And He has made, made me glad

I asked the Lord, 
how could He love me, 
I have sinned against Your will 
But He said, repent and I will forgive you, 
The question's who will you serve? 

You might be dirty, messed up inside, 
You may even have lost your will to live; 
Don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel, 
Confess your sins and repent so you can be like me

The Mighty Clouds of Joy,"Sunday morning, very bright, I read Your book by colored light
That came in through the pretty window picture.

I visited some houses where they said that You were living
And they talked a lot about You
And they spoke about Your giving.
They passed a basket with some envelopes;
I just had time to write a note
And all it said was ""I believe in You.""

Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants.
The discussion was theology,
And when they smiled and turned to me
All that I could say was ""I believe in You.""

I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving
And a balded man said You were dead,
But the house would go on living.
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave
He shook his head and said I'd never find You.

My mother used to dress me up,
And while my dad was sleeping
We would walk down to Your house without speaking.",Hymn (Yes Yes)

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones,"I see my girl's been forced to hide
A brand new emptiness inside
I wish that I could fill the space
It's not my place to take the place

She's been hurt and she's been lost before
This loss has her alone once more
Even though my girl's alone
She stays together strong as stone

She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform
I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it
I've seen my girl forced to take
Pain, tragedy, and much heartache

The tears she hides, the smile she fakes
And through it all, she doesn't break
I don't know where she finds the strength
I'm only glad that she can

Just when I think my girl is down
She's on her feet again
She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform

I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do
So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen her world before my eyes
Get filled with evil, painful, spiteful lies
Still she fights, still she tries
And she will fight until she dies

Checked the clock when I got home
And realized I was alone
Sat for hours by the window
Wonderin' where did you go?
Couldn't eat or sleep at all
Took the pictures off the wall
Paced the place as time moves slow
And I'm wondering where did you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
I want to know
Lit a cigarette I couldn't smoke
Wound the clock until it broke
Went to bed then took a shower
Stared at TV for an hour
Did the dishes, made the bed
Read a book I've never read
Any minute you will show
And I'm wondering where did you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
I want to know

Where did you go? [Repeat x4]

And played a tape I couldn't hear
Emptiness began to grow
And I'm wondering where did you go?
Watched the sun come up from the back stairs
Thought about the last few years
I lost control, I screamed, I cried
I punched a pole and went inside
Packed my things called a friend
Wished this emptiness would end
Wrote a note then tore it up
Poured the beer into a cup
Sat on the couch, drank it slow

Which meant something
And that got them some attention

Once thought unattainable
The course was never charted
So don't look into the books
The secret's not the recipe
It's got to be the cooks
They made something
They played something
Blood, sweat, and elbow grease
If you can't stand the heat in the kitchen
Get out it will increase
Last train to where?
Hey get out of here
Nothing's measured and nothing's weighed
A dash of honesty

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones,"My father once told this to me
Boston's gritty history
Another ruthless battle
in a useless holy war
Handed down discrepancies
and tensions that'll never ease
One early afternoon on Broad street
It blew up down there for sure

Broad street's just not broad enough
and you just don't love God enough
and if that isn't odd enough
We've taken too much crap
You've pushed us round the sod enough
We'e scrapped and rapped and jawed enough
poked, provoked and prod enough
Something's gonna snap

The Boston fire fighting volunteers
On their way to fight a fire somewhere
Met with a funeral procession
proceeding way too slow
A brownstone burns out of control
We need to lay to rest this soul
Loggerheads on broadstreet
Eye to eye and toe to toe

Broad street's just not broad enough
and you just don't love God enough
and if that isn't odd enough
We've taken too much crap
You've pushed us round the sod enough
We'e scrapped and rapped and jawed enough
poked, provoked and prod enough
Something's gonna snap

Riot down on Broad street
Hand me a brick, a stick, a picket
Bottle, axe or cobblestone
Riot down on Broad street
And if I'm going down
Hell, I'm not going down alone
I won't go down alone

And when the fight was over
they retired to the Clover,
Silver Dollar, Thirsty Scollar
Whatever pubs they had back then
The Brownstone was in ashes
Broken Bones and bloody gashes
and a casket sat on Broad street 
'til the sun came up again

Broad street's just not broad enough
and you just don't love God enough
and if that isn't odd enough
We've taken too much crap
You've pushed us round the sod enough
We'e scrapped and rapped and jawed enough
poked, provoked and prod enough
Something's gonna snap

Riot down on Broad street
Hand me a brick, a stick, a picket
Bottle, axe or cobblestone
Riot down on Broad street
And if I'm going down
Hell, I'm not going down alone
And if I'm going down
Hell, I'm not going down alone

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones,"What took her to the city was some sort of scholarship. 
Some Fancy New York Fashion Institute. 
Her Junkie Boyfriend took to crime, which took up too much of her time. 
It only took a year till she took a different Route.

[Chorus]
What just happened?
She just happened?
She just happened to cross my mind?
Without warning she crossed my mind?
What just happened to me?

She moved into this building next to the one I used to trash. 
She lived there with this roommate I despised. 
We found a room against the tracks. 
Don't stay out late, and watch your backs. 
Make sure to lock the door we were advised.

[Chorus: x2]

Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!
Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!

From there it went nowhere, and after that it fell apart.

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones,"One day my skeletons appeared 
And I knew where they were coming from 
Hung by a rope I volunteered 
And I never thought the day would come 
Some boundaries I once overstepped 
Shortcomings I must now accept 
Secrets that could not be kept 
I wish my skeletons had slept

You're not being honest really 
You're really not and ought to be 
Take an honest look at yourself 
Try a little honesty 

To further add to my demise 
Demons never exorcised 
Appeared before my very eyes 
To no one's just my own suprise 
A scenario just so surreal 
Demons once so well concealed 
Were now throughout my whole ordeal 
So real and painfully revealed

You're not being honest really 
You're really not and ought to be 
Take an honest look at yourself
Try a little honesty 
You're not being honest really 
And honestly you've never been 
You ought to take a look at yourself 
Let the honesty begin 

In flew the accusations, the razor-toothed insinuations
Each ghost my own creation, and every monster my invention 
Beasts they came to burden, hell I let whatever stirred in 
And I couldn't get a word in, at this unearthly intervention

They let up when they knew they got through 
They knew I'd never be the same 
With little left to say or do 
They left as quickly as they came 
The life was scared half out of me 
Some way somehow I survived 
A part of me was proud of me 
The day my skeletons arrived 

You're not being honest really 
You're really not and ought to be 
Take an honest look at yourself

checked the clock when I got home

sat for hours by the window
wonderin' where did you go?

wound the clock until it broke

and played a tape I couldn't hear

thought about the last few years
I lost control, I screamed, I cried
I punched a pole and went inside
packed my things called a friend
wished this emptiness would end
wrote a note then tore it up
poured the beer into a cup
sat on the couch, drank it slow
wondering where did you go?
I realized I couldn't stay
grabbed my things and I went away

...well that's my story and i'm sticking to that. So let's have another drink and let's talk about the blues. Blues is about dignity, it's about self-respect, and no matter what they take away from you - that's yours for keeps. I remember how it was, how every medium - T.V. and papers and radio and all those people were saying: 'you're on the scrap-heap, you're useless', and I remember how easy it was to start believing that. I remember how you'd hear people take it for granted that it was true - just 'cause someone with an ounce of power said so. And that's a problem now, too many oddballs, too many pocketbook psychologists and would-be philosophers with an axe to grind. But there's a solution, it's not easy, but it's a matter of coming to terms in your heart with situation you're in, a matter of choosing how things go for you and not having things forced upon you. There are plenty of forces against you, forcing you against your will, your ideals - you've got to hope for the best, and that's the best you can hope for - you've got to hope against hope... I remember something Sal Paradise said, he said: 'the city intellectuals of the world are debauched from the full body blood-of-the-land and are just rootless fools'. So listen, when the smile, the condescending pat-on-the-back comes and says: 'we're sorry, but you're nothing, you've got nothing for us and we've got nothing for you', you say: 'No', and say it loud: ""NO!"", and remember, people who talk about revolution and a class-struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love, and what is positive in the refusal and constraint...since people have a corpse in their mouth.","Story of the Blues, Pt. 1-2 [*][Mix]"

Cause I'd like our little drama
To have a happy ending
And finally be fear transcending,

A love light or maybe two

And to when we were so free,

If you only know there's a someone who really loves you --
It's your heart and it's your soul
And it's you they want to know,
You've got to love yourself before you love another.

And if I play love's game to win,
Can I give up this bag I'm in?""

I was in love, but in vain I could tell.

One night a wild young cowboy came in, 
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love.

So in anger 

I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of Rose's I ran, 
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one; he looked like he could run,
Up on his back and away I did ride.
Just as fast as 

I could from the West Texas town of El Paso,
Out thru the badlands of New Mexico.
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
My love is stronger that my fear of death.
(Nothing's missing. It really is only half a verse.) 

I saddled up and away I did go, 
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart.
And as last here 

I am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
I can see Rose's Cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward, 
Down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
I've got to make it to Rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel 
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle.
I'm getting weary, unable to ride.
But my love for 

Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen;
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest.
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina goodbye.",El Paso

Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees

A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

The Mills Brothers,"A long time ago, about a million years B.C.
The best things in life were absolutely free.

But no one appreciated a sky that was always blue
and no one anticipated a moon that was always new.

So it was planned that they should vanish now and then
and you must pay before you get them back again.

That's what storms were made for
and you shouldn't be afraid for:


Every time it rains, it rains, pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town
Make sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

That's where I fell in love, where the stars above, came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture, in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed a smile, upon her face
'Cause it was fiesta, and we were so gay
South of the border, Mexico way

Then she smiled as she whispered ""manana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
Then I lied as a whispered ""manana""
'Cause our tomorrow never came

South of the border, I jumped back one day
There in a veil of white, by the candle light, she knelt to pray
The mission bells told me (ding-dong), that I musn't stay

A paradise where roses grew

The Mint Juleps,"On her way to work one mornin'
Down the path beside the lake,
A tender-hearted woman saw
A poor, half-frozen snake.
His pretty, colored skin had been
All frosted with the dew.
""Poor thing,"" she cried, ""I'll take you in
And I'll take care of you.""
""Take me in, tender woman.
Take me in for Heaven's sake.
Take me in, tender woman,""
Sighed the snake.
She wrapped him up
All cozy in a comforter of silk.
And laid him by the fireside
With some honey and some milk.
She hurried home from work that night
And soon as she arrived,
She found that pretty snake
She'd taken in had been revived.
""Take me in, tender woman.
Take me in for Heaven's sake.
Take me in, tender woman,""
Sighed the snake.
She clutched to her buxom.
""You're so beautiful,"" she cried.
""But if I hadn't brought you in
By now you might have died.""
She stroked his pretty skin again
And kissed and held him tight.
Instead of saying, ""Thanks,""
The snake gave her a viscous bite.
""Take me in, tender woman.
Take me in for Heaven's sake.
Take me in, tender woman,""
Sighed the snake.
""I saved you,"" cried the woman.
""But you've bitten me, but why?

He laughed loud like a general and a clevo went up and down
And the days where long and rosy with never a sight of regret
When in to the shop came Kafka, boy he was definitely back form the dead 
I need a butcher for my new parable, and you perfect one he said
You'll wake up soon as a pig my friend, and not just in my book
I used a cockroach once before but nobody understood
A mob will chase you trough the street and track you in the wood
In the forest you'll find a clearing where all living things are save
You'll … yourself on berry's and sleep in a nearby cave
A simple life for a simple creature the rest of your natural days

You better tell him about Kafka, you better tell him what Kafka did
He is a trouble making Czech clerk and he knows just where you live

The Mission UK,"I've felt the heat in the city of angels
Dust up on high and the worse for wear
I've seen the lights going down on sunset
Madmen running loose, there's murder in the air

So this is America

Love colder than death, working the streets
Love doesn't come cheap, so I learn how to steal
Religion for sale, buy my way into heaven
Sell my soul for a trick, it's not worth a great deal

So this is America

I remember her smile and her virgin heart
I remember her tears tearing me apart
I remember my hands, helpless and tied
As they led her away I remember I cried

I've put my life in the hands of a scream
Small talked and less with legends to be
But I carried a torch for the child forbidden
When the heat closed in, they crucified me

So this is America

Dreams don't come easy without any sleep
Laid wide eyed and weary on this damned bed of nails
I hit the freeway and step on the speed
Head for the desert when madness prevails

The Mission UK,"The sweat upon his brow and the dirt worked into his hands
The dignity of labor upon a mans own land
The soil of his fathers passes on down through blood to hand
A mans right of birth to reap the harvest from his land

The breaking of his back to keep his dream alive
To work the change of season his instinct to survive
The planting of his seed and to see his harvest grow
Gives a pride to a man to reap the harvest that he sows

The land of the free, home of the brave
The heartland of pioneers, the heritage of flesh and blood
And along come the winds that blow through the land
With a price to pay for the working man
Money talks and changes hands
And money reaps the harvest money demands
The grapes of wrath

They can take away his freedom they can beat him into the dust
They can burn his home, run him from his land,
And leave him out to gather rust
But they cant take away his faith and his honesty and pride
And the knowledge that he holds inside
One day they'll reap the harvest
The grapes of wrath

There's hope in a man that nothing can destroy
A man will endure anything for the dream that he holds dear

Spinning rooms in cities of rust

Of smoke and fire and steel and wire
And glass and spire and dust
On to the floor at dawn with lips taught and drawn
Sleepless nights I've spent with angels heaven sent

Speak of days and another place
I wander as the gypsy under a beckoning moon
Speak of time and another face
A wayward and languid cry a fleeting and furtive sigh
From the cradle to the grave a love to desire and crave

Passing ships in the night a touch distraught and light
Eyes that brightly shine, your love tonight is mine

This that, this that,
It's for your own good,
Its called, na na, it is, its called experience.
Bruv, you know what yeah, what experience?
What so you've gone mad over a chick.
Yeah I have once, and I'm not doing that shit again,
You're fucking crazy.

There's no point in telling her the truth,
Cos she's not gonna believe it.
You know what I mean,
She's just gonna listen to her friends,
Her fucking friends, you know what I mean.
So like, just like, forget about her, let's go get some drinks,
You know what I mean, go check some more yetis.

Bruv why did she hang up?
I know there's still anger
I put my hands up ? yes I was a wanker.
I did lead with Tanya, when I left Tantra,
She had one too many so I called a cab.
I don?t understand her, I never did grab her
She?s listening to Amber, and we don?t get on,
OK before, I did get caught,
But to jeopardise us again, I couldn?t do.
Her friend, ain?t talking sense,
See me and Tanya we?re only just breadrins
Her friend, never saw anything
We got in, I dropped her off to her rents.

This morning it got light, but I?d still not been to sleep,
Thinking of what to do to ease this grief.
I know I lied but I had a reason please believe,
I fold the pillow, and try n squeeze some sleep


{Verse 2 ? Mike Skinner}
Please don?t delete, my phone number please,
I know you don?t need, to mope about me.
I did go with Lis, she phoned to speak,
She wants me back, but I want you.
Don?t shoot through, you?re going to lose
A bloke who?s truly devoted to you
I owe to you, to know a few truths,
Home truth truths, you going to screw.
Your friends, are not talking sense,
Are you sure your head ignores them?
Your friends, never saw anything,
We talked then, I walked to my ends.

{Verse 3}

Bruv I?ll tell you this for free, Ambers chatting shit again.
She needs to go on Trisha, with all her fucking shenanigans.
She?s just sad and bitter, cos her and her man split up.
So now she wants her and the girls to be a gang of spinsters.
And bruv, huh, I told you, you cant be chatting to Tanya.
So when she calls you, just blank her.
That night I went to Ten Rooms after Tantra,
But I didn?t think you and her would jump in the same cab bruv.
Listen bruv, just give your girl time and space.
Maybe a couple of days, to get her mind straight.
Serious bruv listen, ?llow it for a bit,
And if she?s got any sense, she?ll know Amber?s chatting shit.

He was well past the line, past defense,
What the fuck are they saying?
Come on what's the delay?
Send him off to the, the bench!
What do you mean he was fucking offside?
Ain't you flippin' opened your eyes?
He was through on the ball,
And his right foot to score in the top corner to equalize.

That's fucking out of order ref, how come?
You were quick to book him, what has he done?
What do you mean for dissent and recent comments when?
I was just having some fun

He just shakes his head,
And fucking walks away,
There's ten minutes left,
It's always his way,

What is the keeper playing at?
Stay on your fucking line, Matt stay on his back!
Fucking tackle! What do you mean your ankle?
Ref's pulling your leg, I can see from this angle.
That's not a fucking card. Fuck off, never!
He's not fucking hurt, he's trying to be fucking clever,
Hold your tongue Paul son, keep it together,
Or that could be you in the fucking black book.
And that's far from a fucking happy look,
We dropped down the drain, fancy getting some hooks
Fuck's sake is he off, or is he off the hook?
Only a fucking caution, nearly had me shook.
But a free kick in our direction,
Right at the edge of the box we'll need protection.
Oh shit El Guerro takes it in discretion,
Come on boys sort out your fucking selection

He places the ball,
Then goes takes six steps back,
There's a hole in the wall,
Someone please fill the gap,
If he fucking scores,
I'll be facing the sack,
Not to mention my head in the Sun getting axed.

Fucking hell keeper, keep on your toes,
He's gonna swing it up in the corner, here he goes,
On your right son, shit I can read his flow,
Its curling, its curling, don't let it go,
Oh fuck no. I fucking knew it.
I fucking knew it. We've gone and blew it.
At five on the clock we had the game in the bag,
Was winning the nag, now we're heading out,
Must have had the right idea, we're scratching our heads in doubt
I've gone down the drain, and another round,
When me and the lads all meet down the Flushing Dam,
Two minutes left, might as well check the oven now,
Who? Us? When? How? I mean who got fouled?
A fucking penalty, now we're in with a shout.
I cant believe it, come on Jase do us proud,
Come on mate, come on mate, to your left!
To your left mate! Come on! You can do it!

Huh, the kind of girl that works in Harvey Nicks yeah,
Is the kind of girl that?s got fucking barely rounda bags (?),
And I don?t mean bags bags, I mean like shopping bags, serious.
I never liked Dry Your Eyes anyways,
The only person that liked it was my mum,
You know what I mean,
cos man had flippin overalls on,
the pretty bird behind the tills takin the piss outta man,
even giving man no help.

{CHORUS x2 ? Mike Skinner}
When I drop in Harvey Nicks,
to shop in Harvey Nicks
If I don?t look hardly slick,
or appear hardly fit,
the cashier don?t hardly trip,
the lady hardly flits,
unless im wearing barmy shit,
or garments that are the shit.

{Verse 1 ? Teddy Mitchell}
The last time we was in here, we just lined with despair.
The pretty bird behind the till was flipping thru Marie Claire
Flicking the end of her hair, fidgeting, all nervous,
Had us thinking ?where the fuck is the customer service?!?
Must have been the flippin shabby overalls we?re wearing,
And the batch of Classics that were on the verge of tearing.
Cos Aunty?s front room needed redecorating,
So we painted it light blue to make it look more radiant.
But today that aint the case (na mate!)
It?s Lionel Scott cardigans, that us man were dreamt in
The pretty bird behind the till?s grin is so blatant,
And suckin man?s bottom, cos she must think we got the papers.
So from this day forth, we must always recall,
Never ever to come back in here in overalls,
Cos pretty birds behind tills, they don?t like to smile and talk,
To brehs bowling down in fucking overalls.

{CHORUS}

{Verse 2 ? Tony Mitchell}
It?s as if she?s never seen our mugs in here before,
Cos as soon as we was about to make a move, she released the door,
Pointing her finger at her assistant to attend to both of our needs,
Chucking an opener on the counter, strutting towards Teddy and me.
Now its all a guided tour through the Lacoste new seasons,
Compliments on our retirements, mixing offering us greetings (?).
Not to mention the welcome ? and the private seating,
That they usually use for the service twats,
With the request to them to bring the teas in.
But the other day, that weren?t the case.. na mate
It was her on the fone to the security guard,
To follow us for no damn reason.
Lookin down at our watch, giving us the cold shoulder treatment.
Asking us if we could hurry up cos they were closing early that evening.
So from that day forth, we have always remembered,
Never ever to wear overalls, its just absurd.
Cos overall, all over, overalls don?t work
Cos now that we?re in London its got the bird flicking up her skirt.

{Verse 3 ? Sway}
When I shop at Harvey Nicks,
Everyone thinks I?m a star,
Cos I wear my rented blazer,
And I step out my rented car.
A little girl with a pen ran up to me and said ?I know who you are?
But when I gave her my autograph she said ?mum is this how u spell lemar??
When I shop at Harvey Nicks,
The security give me grief,
They must think I?m a thief, cos I don?t sound like The Streets.
Even when I?m just trying it on, they think I?m trying it on.
I said ?why would I steal from you? I?m loaded?
Then they called the police ? ?there?s a guy with a gun!?
Despite this, I like shopping here,
Cos it?s a lot quicker than eBay
I bumped into this Labour MP who was looking for a pair of CK,
I said ?Hi, I?m Sway, and I hope you?re having a nice day?
Then I slapped him in his face and said ?what type of party doesn?t have a DJ??
I remember the first time I came here,
I was shoplifting and got nabbed,
In the shop lift I got grabbed,
?Hey you! Excuse me, open your bag!?
I got put in a pair of handcuffs,
All for a pair of cufflinks,
I said ?please sir, don?t send me to prison, if its anything like Butlins?

{CHORUS x2}

{Mike Skinner}
It don?t mean anything anyway man,
Harvey Nicks is shiiiit!
I?m all about Selfridges,
Seriously Selfridges man,
Harvey Nicks is the kind of place Ted Mayern goes,
Don?t wanna shop in the same shop as him,
Cos that cunt looks like a fucking clown!

Maybe
I get a crime reference number for my most recent phone
The police code that's the code for a free phone
Take one camera phone
Tell em I got jacked of the phone

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

The Moaners,"Remember when there was nothing else to do, 
But lie and bed and, 
Wonder how it was always up to you, 
And no one else and,
Early mornings, made by warnings, 
What's the point of the alarm 
That I'm ignoring?
It's even raining, 
I'm not complaining, 
But waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head 
Its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone 
Ten times a day, 
Why get up 
When my morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

Remember when we would hang out every day, 
And we would rather,
Not be told what to do or what to say, 
Cause nothing mattered.
Never boring with slept in mornings, 
Not ashamed of bad habits that I'm forming.
Its not important if days are shortened, 
I can't make time when nothings new,
Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two?
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

What's a day when it all ends up the same, 
And lasts forever?
Can't complain 
When there's nothing there to blame, 
And things can't be better.
Summer evenings, teenage grievings, 
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading.
No concentration on hesitation, 
I can't make time when nothings new, 
Cause waking up is hard to do so

To bed with no delay,

The Mob,"Glass breaks in night of passionate dance
Splinters in hallways where the fools take their chance
But we're all fools and we all can't stand still
'Cause impotent lovers lose the love they lost
As they go in for the kill

Knives flash in half light at the top of the stairs
No one saw, no one heard, no one felt it, but someone
Was there
And we make ourselves blind to the skin, as it shatters
And tears
And impotent lovers lose the love they lost
As they go in for the kill

Screams color the night, blood colors the street
And those that can love keep warm by creating more heat

And those of no love seek revenge in the pubs and the
Street
And impotent lovers lose the love they lost
As they go in for the kill

Inadequacy bred from the cradle and raided the

By this simple process of... love 

I wish there was a way to show you 
My love is real 
But Webster hasn't found the words 
to express how I feel 
Well, just like a river 
Needs the rain to flow 
You've warmed a heart 
That once was cold, with your love 

And it turns me on like 
when the sun goes down 
And the moon comes up 
Sweet, sweet love like no other man 
Has been touched 
By this simple process of... love

cause I can not hold you tight 
I wish I could see you tomorrow 
To take all this sorrow

Can you feel it 
When I need you 
Can you give it 
When I look in your eyes 
Can you see me 
When I fall 
Will you catch me 
Catch me 
Catch me

Misery is what I feel, 
When you're not around, 
So I can heal, 
Misery is what I feel, 
Is what I feel, 
Is what I feel 
Misery is what I feel, 
When your not around, 
So I can heal. 

These tears on my face 
Are for you 
I wish that I could 
Hold you, touch you, feel you 
I'm waiting can't you see 
I wish you could hold me, touch me, feel me

I've been waiting for your sunrays to break through
How I wish that I could hold you
'Cause I need you
I hope this storm's just passing through

I remember
When your eyes and the skies
Always shined so blue
Now every time that we're together
It just seems like there is 
Nothing I can do

So I'm playing the waiting game (still waiting)
And all I see is rain (Still raining)
Rain, rain, rain

I don't know if you'll ever change
You've been raining since December
I guess it hasn't been all that long
But it seems like it's been forever.  
I can't stop it from poring down
'Cause you're just like the weather
But I'll be just fine
'Cause I know you'll shine
And until that time
You'll still be raining in my mind
(Raining in my mind)

When I'm dreaming
Every thing is shaded black or white
Whatever happered to the colors
They've been washed away
By the rain inside my life

Could only be told

Scratching unwilling
Sports cars are thrilling

I like potatoes
I don't like tomatoes
I'm goin' fishin'
'Cause I'm on a mission

I wanna live for today
I wanna roll in the hay
But I'm floating away
I've got nothing to say

It makes me slappy
To walk like your pappy
I need to improvise
Just lookin' at the pies

Boohoo, I'm dying
Ravenous sighing

And I cannot give or feel or even try""

Then her sweet young face looked old
And I whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

Could not help but wrap herself in sorrow (sorrow)
Through the endless days and nights
She waited for a shiny new tomorrow

And the moonlight kissed her eyes

The Monkees,"She looked at me
And the emptiness in her eyes was cruel to see
Then she turned away and said,
""Once i loved, but love is dead""
And i whispered, ""sometimes love is only sleeping""

She said, ""i cannot cry
And i cannot give or feel or even try""
And her voice was hard and cold
Then her sweet young face looked old
And i whispered, ""sometimes love is only sleeping""

Through the endless days and nights
Could not help but wrap herself in sorrow (sorrow)
Through the endless days and nights
She waited for a shiny new tomorrow
Love was sleeping, sleeping

She looked at me
And her smiling tears were warm and sweet and free
And the moonlight kissed her eyes
As it mingled with our sighs
And she whispered, ""sometimes love is only sleeping""

He was my mother's biggest fan
We used to walk beside the sea
And he'd tell how my life would be
When I grew up to be a man
Years ago we used to play
He used to laugh when I ran away
But when I fell and hurt my knee
He used to come and comfort me
And the pain would go away

Years ago I knew a boy
He was his daddy's pride and joy
But when the daddy went away
It was such a rainy day
That he brought out all his toys
Now the momma did explain
Trying to take away the pain
He just couldn't understand
That his father was not a man
And it all was just a game

Not back like in a race

How the pheonix of our love first flapped its silver wings
All the urgency and passion of each new day as it happened

And how you would turn to hide your smile
Then the hours of silence while the perfumed candle glowed
And both of us meandered on for miles

I remember the tears that filled your eyes
Then I touched your hand and told you that it really was a lie
And though you never knew I did, I cried

It's so hard for me to hide.

You've come so far, you're at my door,
You're knocking at my door.
Won't you come inside and talk awhile?
What I have to say may make you smile,

The Monkees,"Oh my, my, my-
In a dusty caravan
Was a girl with a golden tan
And she asked me if I was headed to the east
I politely stepped a side and said I did not need a ride
That I'd rather take my chances with the heat
Well, when she turned and walked away
I saw my big mistake
There were jewels on her body oh-so-rare
Had it been another day I just might have rode away
With that woman riding off to God-knows-where
So the years they came and went
And found me living in a tent
Far above a little marble stream
And it may have been the light that shone out through the night
That attracted the hand scratching on my screen
When I cautiously looked out through the night
There was no doubt
That the owner of that hand was that girl
So I bid her do come in
And I'll open up a tin
If you'll tell me 'bout your trip around the world
Well, she said,""If you think back
To the first time that we passed
I'm sure you'll picture me in all my jewels
It was shortly after then that I ran into another man
And I asked him the same question I asked you
But now he he didn't refuse
And he took off of both his shoes
And climbed aboard mu east-bound caravan
In the twinkling of the night
He knocked me off the side
And left me there for dead upon the sand
And I thought I was done
Lying naked in the sun
When much to my surprise, who should pass?
But this old friend of yours
He said he knew you from the wars
And I told him that I thought you'd headed west
Well, he said he should have known
'Cause you like to be alone
And that's the time I knew you were my one
So I asked him for a ride
Just to get here by your side
And stay here above this stream
Out of the sun""
Well, we sat quite for a while
And I began to smile
Well it's strange but I don't care
And some nights when I'm at rest
I wonder if I'd said, ""yes""
Would she have come to me from God knows where
Or would I have been the one to leave her lying in the sun

When I poured through the files taken off my mental shelf
I dusted off some memories of you

Then I thought about the times 
When all the world was green
How the Pheonix of our love first flapped its silver wings
All the urgency and passion of each new day as it happened
And how it all mellowed as it grew

I remember the times that our laughter would explode
And how you would turn to hide your smile
Then the hours of silence while the perfumed candle glowed
And both of us meandered on for miles

I remember the time I said I really had to go
I remember the tears that filled your eyes
Then I touched your hand and told you that it really was a lie
And though you never knew I did, I cried

It's amazing how time can so softly change your ways
And make you look at things that can't be seen
How the years that roll by can start you listening
Not just to what they say, but what they mean

So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied
If the razor edge of youth filled love is gone
But we're both a little older, our relationship has grown
Not just in how it's shaped, but how it's shown

On a giant toadstool sat a teeny tiny gnome

He was all involved in a game of solitaire
Said ""hello"" with a smile just like I wasn't there
I kicked dirt some more
He said ""please don't start a fight.""
Found a church key in his pocket, he opened up his pipe

He blew some silver circles,
Wound his fingers in his beard
And from that pipe came magic music
Like I'd never heard

As the notes came floatin' in I pricked up both my ears
I walked up to the drive-in, hadn't felt so starved in years

You gotta have love to love

Why do I love you?

You do things designed just to make me cry

Floatin' down the river with a saturated liver
And I wish I could forgive her
But I do believe she meant it
When she told me to forget it
And I bet she will regret it

She must have had another date
I didn't need this extra weight
I wish that I could see the way to shore
I don't want no more
Goin' down, I'm goin' down

And now I see the life I led
I slept it all away in bed
I should have learned how to swim instead

I should have taken her advice

If I don't drown, I'll die of fright
My pappy taught me how to float
But I can't swim a single note
He threw me in to teach me how
I stayed there floatin' like a mama cow
And now I've floated way downstream
Know this has to be a dream
If I could find my way to shore
I'd never, never do this anymore

Just floatin' here lazy on my back
I never really liked that town
I think I'll ride the river down
Just movin' slow and floatin' free
There's a river swinging under me
Waving back to the folks on shore
I should have thought of this before
I'm floatin' on down to New Orleans
And pick up on some swingin' scenes
I'm gonna know a better day
I'm goin' down groovin' all the way

You can't love someone 
If you find that all you get in return
A heart that's cold

CHORUS
They say you need love to love
You gotta have love to love
They all say it works that way.
But if it's true,
Why do I love you?
Why do I love you?

Seems like you keep trying to break me
You do things designed just to make me cry 
And I've heard if warm lips don't touch you
Love won't grow no matter how much you try

CHORUS X2

Why do I love you...?

",Love to Love [Alternate Mix][#]
The Monkees,"Now listen just a minute while I sing this song,
Don't you worry baby it won't take long.
I'm just about ready to draw the line,
So don't be surprised if I leave this time.

Well I'm goin' north and I'm goin' south
Don't want no more of your lyin' mouth.
I'm hittin' the road, gonna ring some bells,
Better know I can do it well.

CHORUS:
Midnight train, ramblin' ramblin'
All night long I'm gamblin', gamblin'
Been losin' all my money and it really is funny, umm badda dum.
Midnight train, ramblin' ramblin'
Al night I'm gamblin', gamblin'
Well tell you what baby, well you better be movin' on.

Well I really don't know where I'm goin' for sure,
Ain't gotta map, it ain't no tour.
Just headin' out to the open sky,
Who knows, might even die.

Well don't you worry your pretty little head
'Cause you never gave a dang what I did or said.
That's why I'm packin' to leave this place
Can't stand to look at your cheatin' face.
Well you treated me like a little boy
And played around like I was a toy.
Guess you thought I'd have the blues,
Look whose cryin', guess you lose.

CHORUS (twice)
It's about that time, better be movin' on

",Midnight Train [Demo Version]
The Monkees,"Throw a penny from the window.
Watch an old man play a song
On a twenty dollar violin, he bought before the war.
Though he screeches and he scratches,
And the notes are always wrong.
But he plays like he's in concert,
On the street outside my door.

Choose to suit your fancy.
Are there any requests?
I'll play them for a penny,
(play them for a penny)
And not a penny less.

He's the local virtuoso;
It's his only way of life.
Plays ninety-seven overtures,
And goes on home to his wife.
In the quiet of the evening,
While his frozen fingers bleed,
He counts pennies
On the blanket to supply his meager needs.

Choose to suit your fancy,
Are there any requests?
I'll play them for a penny,
(play them for a penny)
And not a penny less.

When there's frost upon the pumpkin,
In the weakness of the sun.
People stand there in the cold
Until his symphony is done.
In the early gray of morning,
He's sure to come around.
You can hear him through the window
When the pennies hit the ground.

Choose to suit your fancy,
Are there any requests?
I'll play them for a penny,
(play them for a penny)
And not a penny less.

They're playing penny music,
(aaahhhhaaahhhh)
Playing penny music.
(aaahhhhaaahhhh)",Penny Music
