Edmond Hall,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.",I Can't Believe That You're in Love With Me [Alternate MST]
Edmond Hall,"'Cause it's been so long
Since I held you tight
When we said good night
It's been so long
Honey, can't you see
What you've done to me?
I've been in a kind of daze
For days and days and days
Feelin' blue, missin' you
In, oh, so many ways
'Cause it was so nice
When we had that date
Every night at eight
It was so nice
Then we said good-bye
What a fool was I
Let me get back in your arms where I belong
'Cause it's been, oh, so long",It's Been So Long [Alternate Take]
Edmond Hall,"I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
The devil and the deep blue sea",Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea
Edmond Hall,"Don't even go to a movie show
If you're not by my side,
I stay home by my radio,
But I'm satisfied!
All my flirtin' days are gone,
On the level from now on!

Don't go for any excitement now,
Books are my best company.
All my opinions have changed somehow,
Old-fashioned as can be!
When you really learn to care,
There's a thrill in solitaire!

Keepin' ou of mischief now,
Really am in love, and how!
I'm through playing with fire,
It's you whom I desire!

All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me!
I've told them in advance
They can't break up our romance!
Living up to every vow,
I'm keepin' out of mischief now!

All the world can plainly see
That you're the only one for me!
Say I've told them, told them in advance
That they can't break up our romance!
Living up to every vow,
I'm keepin', keepin' out of mischief now!",Keepin' Out of Mischief Now
Edmond Hall,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner
Edmond Hall,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Edmond Hall,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say",Sweet and Lovely
Edmond Hall,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?
Edmond Hall,"Way down yonder in New Orleans
In the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a Garden of Eden
You know what I mean

Creole babies with flashin' eyes
Softly whisper their tender sighs then stop
Won't you give your lady fair a little smile?
Stop, ya bet your life you'll linger there a little while

We've got heaven right here on earth
With those beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New Orleans

You're gonna find heaven right here on earth
With all them beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New Orleans
I'm goin' down yonder to New Orleans
It's way down yonder in New Orleans",Way Down Yonder in New Orleans
Edmond Hall,"Hear me, why you keep fooling
Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Now, maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets,
Now, you know, my little coquette, I love you.",Coquette
Edmond Hall,"When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Every night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.",The Man I Love
Edmond Hall,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Edmond Hall,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.",I Want to Be Happy
Edmond Hall,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You
Edmond Hall,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Edmond Hall,"Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where the old darke'ys heart am long'd to go,
There's where I labored so hard for old massa,
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,
No place on earth do I love more sincerely
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born. 

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where this old darkey's heart am long'd to go. 

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darke'ys life will pass away.
Massa and missis have long gone before me,
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore,
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.",Carry Me Back to Old Virginny
Edmonia Jarrett,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon",East of the Sun (And West of the Moon)
Edmonia Jarrett,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as he

Edmonia Jarrett,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Edmonia Jarrett,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Edmund Hockridge,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew

Edmund Hockridge,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Edmund Hockridge,"When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand believe me, believe me
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand, believe me, believe me",You Don't Have to Say You Love Me
Edmund Paul,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Edmundo Ros,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere

Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday

It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesiÂ­ meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesiÂ­

A lovely senorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesiÂ­

She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?

And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesi?",Frenesi
Edmundo Ros,"Desert shadows creep across purple sands.
Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

You, Misirlou, Are the moon and the sun, fairest one.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

To an oasis, sprinkled by stars above,
Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.",Misirlou

Edmundo Ros,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills

Edmundo Ros,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

Edmundo Ros,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Que aún dentro de mi alma
Conservo aquel cariño
Que tuve para ti...!
Quién sabe, si supieras
Que nunca te he olvidado...!
Volviendo a tu pasado
Te acordarás de m? ..

Los amigos ya no vienen
Ni siquiera a visitarme;
Nadie quiere consolarme
En mi aflicción;
Desde el día que te fuiste
Siento angustias en mi pecho;
Dec? percanta, qu? has hecho
De mi pobre corazón!

Sin embargo
Yo siempre te recuerdo
Con el cariño santo
Que tuve para ti;
Why estás dentro de mi alma,
Pedazo de mi vida,
En la ilusión querida
Que nunca olvidar?

Que por tu ausencia no comía
Al verme solo, el otro día,
También me dej?

Now he's leaning on my shoulder,

Beside an apple tree did grow

Long long ago

The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined,

 I can see us on an April night
 Sipping brandy underneath the stars
 Reading poems in the candlelight
 To the strumming of guitars
 
 I will tell you all the books I've read

 And I'll ask you for a dance

Ednita Nazario,"Te hubiera dicho que la vida no acaba
A causa de un mal momento
A tanta gente le pasa
Hay días que todo es negro

Te hubiera dado más de veinte razones
Para cambiar de proyecto
Para romper en pedazos
Tu idea de irte en silencio

Te hubiera dicho que yo
Aun te seguía queriendo
Que no valía la pena
Rendirse en tan poco tiempo

Ahora es tarde ya, ahora es tarde ya
Ahora es tarde ya para poderte hablar
Ahora no te tengo

Ahora es tarde ya, para volverme atrás
Ahora es tarde ya, solo puedo llorar
Solo mirar al cielo

Ahora es tarde ya

Te hubiera hablado de mis propios fracasos,
De cómo pude vencerlos
De cómo hacer la esperanza
Mucho más fuerte que el miedo

Te hubiera dicho quizás
Que utilizaras mi aliento
Que no valía la pena
Rendirse en tan poco tiempo

Ahora es tarde ya, ahora es tarde ya
Ahora es tarde ya para poderte hablar
Ahora no te tengo

Ahora es tarde ya, para volverme atrás
Ahora es tarde ya, solo puedo llorar
Solo mirar al cielo.

Aprendere a repirar sin él a defenderme sin contra
Con sus palabras aprendere a creer
Solo en mi propia fé mi propia fuerza sin él

Aprendere, a no temblar como cualquier mujer
A no buscar refujio en otra piel
A despertarme sinn besos en mis labio
A recobrar valor para volver a ser la misma que vivio sin él

Aprendere a estar sin sus caricias
Compartir hasta volver a sonreir
Aprendere a vencer sin nadie junto a mi
Aprendere a vivir sin el

Ya no tender que compartir con otro corazón el gran amor
Que siempre llevo en mi tal vez mañana
Se cruce en mi camino la huella de otro amor
Que sienta igual que yo y mientras tanto

Aprendere a estar sin sus caricias
Compartir hasta volver a sonreir
Aprendere a vencer sin nadie junto a mi
Aprendere a vivir sin el

A que no te atreves a matar

No tengas miedo una entrega total
Es que somos uno para el otro una necesidad

Dime que no te iras de mi vida
Por que creo en la inocencia de tu amor
Para que ocultar tan bellos sentimientos
Desnudemos de una vez esta pasion

Toda la ilusion perdida junto a mi renacera
El corazon lo pide a gritos dame una opurtunidad

Ednita Nazario,"Era yo la que lloraba cuando desaparecías por una semana 
me moría de tristeza y desesperación 
era yo quien perdonaba y me callaba el odio mientras me engañabas 
cualquier cosa para no perder tu corazón 
pero como el viento todo cambia ahora me rio yo 

Lloras por mi 
te quiebras al partir 
tu que ni me mirabas 
hoy lloras por mi 
te doblas de dolor 
hoy lloras tu por mi y yo vengada. 

Era yo la que juraba que jamás había sitio para otro hombre 
pero un día mi tristeza se volvió pasión 
hoy lamento confesarte que mis sueños tienen otro nombre 
como un tonto te perdiste la mejor canción. 
Ya es muy tarde para amar nada queda mi amor. 

Lloras por mi 
te quiebras al partir

Tu risa al bromiar 
Despierto ante un espejo 
De nuevo sola.

Tratando de engañar a la verdad

Haciéndome el amor

Te lloro a solas

Como todo cambia, como cambia el clima en las ciudades 
Hoy entre los dos tan solamente habita el frío 
Tú quizás te niegas y me pides que luchemos 
Yo quizás llevo tanto intentando que no puedo 
Tu distancia me apago de a poco todo el fuego 
Y yo culpable en callarme 

No porque soy yo quien dice adiós 
No por eso yo te amaba menos 
No por eso soy la mala y vil de este cuento 
Solo de los dos soy la más fuerte 
Que prefiere ya no retenerte 
Y con mi dolor te envío suerte 
Que seas feliz 
Que seas muy feliz 

Hoy destruyo el nosotros y el todo se hace nada 
Nuestra historia fue grande y hoy son muchos los testigos 
Y tú quizás te niegas y me pides que luchemos 
Yo quizás llevo tanto intentando que no puedo

Ednita Nazario,"Llueve afuera y estoy en paz sin ti 
Ya pasó, ya sufrí 
No pesas en mi cuerpo 
Después de haber llorado un río 
Sin hallar lo que soñé 
Un día abrí la puerta y de tus brazos me escapé 

No, no llames que no quiero verte 
Porque yo ya me fui 
No, no trates de cambiar la suerte 
Estas fuera de mí 
Porque yo ya elegí 
No quererte 

Me llevaste hasta el borde del final 
(Me llevaste hasta el borde del final) 
Porque si, 
Tú probaste mis fuerzas, 
Me empujaste hacia la soledad 
Desperté, descubrí, entendí, aprendí 
A ver que más allá de ti existe otro mundo 

No, no llames que no quiero verte 
Porque yo ya me fui 
No, no trates de cambiar la suerte 
Estas fuera de mí 
Porque yo ya elegí 

Me quiero salvar, olvidarme de tu amor 
No, no llames que no quiero verte

Ednita Nazario,"Habrá momentos que tú sientes que la vida se para y no gira 
Y que el camino se desvía 
Ya las rosas no son flores, son espinas 
Y en la mañana sólo quieres ver la noche 
Y por la noche el sueño va y se esconde 
Pero aprendí que siempre tengo todo junto a ti 

Gané la guerra, porque te tengo a ti, porque te tengo a ti 
Me das la fuerza, porque te tengo a ti, porque eres todo en mí 
Oh, porque te tengo a ti, porque te tengo a ti 

Y cuando lloras, cuando gritas en silencio y nadie responde 
Y duele más caer al suelo, después de tanto tiempo en el cielo 
Y me doy cuenta que tu luz nunca se apaga, tengo todo en ti aunque no tenga 
nada 
En ti encontré la razón para seguir de pie 

Puedo contra el viento, puedo cuando nadie más 
Ya no tengo miedo, nunca miro para atrás 

Gané, la guerra, porque te tengo a ti, porque te tengo a ti 
Me das la fuerza, porque te tengo a ti, porque eres todo en mí 
Oh, porque te tengo a ti, te tengo a ti 

Puedo contra el viento

Ednita Nazario,"No puedo dormir 
La cabeza me da vueltas 
Mil preguntas siguen sueltas 
Me cuesta soñar 
Las memorias en mi mente 
No me dejan descansar 
Hace tiempo que te fuiste 
Pero sigo con el alma triste 

No puedo dormir 
Llevo un nudo en la garganta 
Tu recuerdo me atraganta 
En la oscuridad 
Busco sombras que no existen 
Pierdo la serenidad 
Tu sonrisa me da guerra 
No hay manera de escapar 

Yo quiero sentir que la madrugada 
Será la alborada en vez de esta amarga condena 
de anochecer en cadenas 
Yo quiero vivir 
Yo quiero volver a animarme a latir 
Arrancarle tu pulso a mis venas 
Saber que vale la pena 

No puedo olvidar 
El perfume de tu almohada 
Me mantiene desvelada 
Que contradicción 
Yo que te maté de frio 
Hoy me muero de dolor 
Me prohíbo arrepentirme 
Aunque tira el corazón 

Yo quiero sentir que la madrugada 
Será la alborada en vez de esta amarga condena 
de anochecer en cadenas 
Yo quiero vivir 
Yo quiero volver a animarme a latir 
Arrancarle tu pulso a mis venas 
Saber que vale la pena 

Cuando dije adiós me lo creía 
Pero no me puedo despegar 
Sin un punto aparte como continuar 

Yo quiero sentir que la madrugada 
Será la alborada en vez de esta amarga condena 
de anochecer en cadenas 
Yo quiero vivir 
Yo quiero volver a animarme a latir

Ednita Nazario,"No supimos amar
Esta noche acabará
Sin tus manos en mis manos
Nuestra história ha terminado
No voy a luchar
Tu ya no te debes quedar
No hay culpables, ya es muy tarde
Ya no intentes rescatarme
No

Duele que tengo que entender
Que desde hoy te perderé
Por no saber pedir perdón
Por olvidar el corazón
Duele que no te detendré
Por que no nos hacemos bien
Y aunque debimos ser mejor
Ya no merecemos este amor
Adios

No hay nada peor
Que darte cuenta de tu error
No saber lo que tu tienes
Hasta el día em que lo pierdes

Ednita Nazario,"Ella no sabe quién es la mujer del espejo
Al mirar siente miedo
Le has robado la vida

Las rosas que mandas a diario no tienen efecto
El daño está hecho
Ella está destruida

No hay vuelta atrás cuando el amor se rompe en pedazos
Te dolerá cuando al final ella encuentre otros brazos

Ella es un ángel de cristal
Un día de estos te vas a dar cuenta
Que la perdiste y vas a llorar

Ella es un ángel de cristal
Y cada mancha que lleva en su rostro
Es una pluma del ala que le hace volar

Ella no tiene por que suplicar de rodillas
Cada vez tu ego
Le provoca una herida

Dime qué te hace más hombre al romper su sonrisa
Será que te gusta arruinarle la vida

No hay vuelta atrás cuando el amor se rompe en pedazos
Te dolerá cuando al final ella encuentre otros brazos

Ella es un ángel de cristal
Y cada mancha que lleva en su rostro
Es una pluma del ala que le hace volar

Tu eres más fuerte
Si crees que al cantarle puedes obligarle a callar
Ella algún día se irá de tu vida
Y no mirará más hacia atrás

Ella es un ángel de cristal
Y cada mancha que lleva en su rostro
Es una pluma del ala que le hace volar

Abrigo nos seus braços
Pois sabia que ia encontrar
No seu olhar
Um colo um carinho uma palavra pra me confortar

E outra vez me vem você
Pedindo uma chance pra tentar fazer eu esquecer
O que me faz sofrer
Falando que faria qualquer coisa pra me ver te amar

Como eu queria te amar
Mandar no meu coração
Mas ele insiste em querer
Outra pessoa pra viver
Como eu queria te amar
É tão difícil entender
Seria tudo tão perfeito com você

E outra vez me vem você
Pedindo uma chance pra tentar fazer eu esquecer

Edson & Hudson,"Parece que ainda sinto os teus carinhos
E sua respiração sobre meu peito
Ai, que saudade que dá, minha linda
Vou procurando, mas cadê você?
Será que eu não vou mais te ter?

E cada dia que se vai, aumenta o meu desejo
Só penso em você

Eu quero sentir sua boca em mim
Poder te abraçar novamente sem fim
Tá mais que na cara que eu te preciso
Pra poder viver

Você foi embora com o meu coração
Deixou no lugar essa dor que devora
E só de saber que vou ter outra noite
Triste noite, solidão me apavora

Não posso acreditar que foi engano
Fizemos tantos planos

Se eu fui culpado, me perdoa
Sei que meu sentimento
Não trará você pra mim outra vez

Só de pensar, eu me arrebento
Amor eu não agüento
De alma me entreguei
E a minha vida, eu sei
Que cada dia que se vai, aumenta o meu desejo
Só penso em você

Eu quero sentir sua boca em mim
Poder te abraçar novamente sem fim
Tá mais que na cara que eu te preciso
Pra poder viver

Você foi embora com o meu coração
Deixou no lugar essa dor que devora
E só de saber que vou ter outra noite

The minute you let her under your skin

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Edú Lobo,"Mesmo que os cantores sejam falsos como eu
Serão bonitas, não importa
São bonitas as canções
Mesmo miseráveis os poetas
Os seus versos serão bons
Mesmo porque as notas eram surdas
Quando um deus sonso e ladrão
Fez das tripas a primeira lira
Que animou todos os sons
E daí nasceram as baladas
E os arroubos de bandidos como eu
Cantando assim:
Você nasceu para mim
Você nasceu para mim

Mesmo que você feche os ouvidos
E as janelas do vestido
Minha musa vai cair em tentação
Mesmo porque estou falando grego
Com sua imaginação
Mesmo que você fuja de mim
Por labirintos e alçapões
Saiba que os poetas como os cegos
Podem ver na escuridão
E eis que, menos sábios do que antes
Os seus lábios ofegantes
Hão de se entregar assim
Me leve até o fim
Me leve até o fim

São bonitas, não importa
São bonitas as canções
Mesmo sendo errados os amantes

Edú Lobo,"Como num romance
O homem dos meus sonhos
Me apareceu no dancing
Era mais um
Só que num relance
Os seus olhos me chuparam
Feito um zoom

Ele me comia
Com aqueles olhos
De comer fotografia
Eu disse cheese
E de close em close
Fui perdendo a pose
E até sorri, feliz

E voltou
Me ofereceu um drinque
Me chamou de anjo azul
Minha visão
Foi desde então ficando flou

Como no cinema
Me mandava às vezes
Uma rosa e um poema
Foco de luz
Eu, feito uma gema
Me desmilingüindo toda
Ao som do blues

Abusou do scotch
Disse que meu corpo
Era só dele aquela noite
Eu disse please
Xale no decote
Disparei com as faces
Rubras e febris

E voltou
No derradeiro show
Com dez poemas e um buquê
Eu disse adeus
Já vou com os meus
Numa turnê

Como amar esposa
Disse ele que agora
Só me amava como esposa
Não como star
Me amassou as rosas
Me queimou as fotos
Me beijou no altar

Nunca mais romance
Nunca mais cinema
Nunca mais drinque no dancing
Nunca mais cheese
Nunca uma espelunca
Uma rosa nunca
Nunca mais feliz",A História de Lily Braun

Porque no escuro não vejo no espelho meus olhos chorando
Não vou na cozinha pra não ver dois copos vazios na mesa

E este medo de perder você que amo
Me faz tão frio, indiferente às situações

Vou confessar
Renunciei você de tanto louco amor

Num quarto escuro do meu ego sem respostas

Não acredito que conheci você acaso do destino

Pra me mostrar que não sou nada sem você

E receber das mãos divinas o troféu do amor

La otra noche yo soñé (uh, ah)
Estaba en tierras lejanas (uh, ah)
Un lugar maravilloso donde no existe 
El trabajo y las mujeres dominaban

Y que un grupo de mujeres (uh, ah)
A su casa me llevaban (uh, ah)
Y como soy tan sencillo no le puse resistencia 
Y dejé que me secuestraran
Y que vivía debajo de una hamaca
Contando estrellas en eso me pasaba
Cada momento llegaba una muchacha y me acariciaba

Me daban todo cáñamo y guayaba
Mis masajitos toditas las mañanas
Vivía tranquilo gozando de lo lindo
Qué vida tan sensata

De pronto sentí una mano, ay 
Que la cara me golpeaba
Y cuando ya abrí los ojos
Que sueño más doloroso mi mujer que me buscaba

Levántate buen bandido (uh, ah)
Dime con quién tú soñabas
Mamita yo te lo juro que contigo 
Me soñaba que tú eras mi preferida 
Que tú eras mi prenda amada mi prenda amada

Levántate buen bandido (uh, ah)
Dime con quién tú soñabas
Yo en mi sueño te veía caminando por la playa 
Y yo tumbando coquitos para que te refrescaras

Oye negrita tú eres la única

Levántate dime con quién tú soñabas
Soñaba contigo negrita caminando solito de mano en la playa
Levántate dime con quién tú soñabas
Yo no quiero que tú pienses que estuve con otro en la cama
Levántate dime con quién tú soñabas
Si para mí sigues siendo tan linda mi preferida mi prenda amada

Uy
Dime con quién
Con Jennifer López
Dime con quién
Con Raquel
Dime con quién
Con la Taina
Dime con quién
O sino Michelle

Uh
Ajá

Dime con quién
Contigo negrita
Dime con quién
Fue quien yo soñé
Dime con quién
No fue con más nadie
Dime con quién
Tú lo sabes muy bien
Dime con quién
No sientas celosa
Dime con quién
No tienes porqué
Dime con quién
Tú eres mi reina
Dime con quién
Y yo soy tu rey

Sólo un sueño mamita fue sólo un sueño
No te preocupes negrita que tú sabes que te quiero
Sólo un sueño mamita fue sólo un sueño
Soñar no cuesta nada y de tu amor yo soy tu dueño
Sólo un sueño mamita fue sólo un sueño
Y repito sólo un sueño fue sólo un sueño

Pensar porque razón es tu dolor, tan silencioso

It almost did me in
She said I hope you didn't wait too long
I have no sense of time
I see you've written one Last Song
And I realized it's mine
Think of all the times we talked
Sing a nursery rhyme

Close your eyes 
I'm right beside you
Run for miles you know I'll find you
Cause it's all the same 
Change your lovers 
Change your name
If you need a friend 
Close your eyes 
I'm back again

She really came back home last night
Seemed as if she'd changed
Said that she go back to school
And try things once again
But you know it didn't take too long
Till she lost her way
And all the reason in the world could see 
She couldn't stay
As I helped her pack her things
It didn't hurt to say

Close your eyes 
I'm right beside you
Run for miles you know I'll find you
Cause it's all the same 
Change your lovers 
Change your name
If you need a friend 
Close your eyes 
I'm back again

That doesn't mean that it's OK
That doesn't mean that I was ready

It's true, you do 
We make the perfect blend, Don't wanna be just your friend 
I want more, from you 
Walk into my life. Take a chance on me. 
Will You? Will You? 

I still recall the night that you kissed me 
You gave me something to believe in 
Stealing time just to be by your side 
Waiting for the sign, a cheesy catchy line 

I feel the best is yet to come 
Destiny's on its way 
I'm full of passion, I feel alive 
What you got is way more than enough

I wanna live the dream, Cause I've been waiting for so long 
If you, want to 
You seem to know me well, Better than everyone else 
It's true, you do 
We make the perfect blend, Don't wanna be just your friend 
I want more, from you 
Walk into my life. Take a chance on me. 
Will You? Will You? 

Walk into my life. Take a chance on me 
Will You?",Will You

Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros,"Once upon a time I was the hurricane boy
There was no eye in me for you to hide
Head low don't show oceans in my eyes
As the waves clap goodbye to sorrow

Daddy's on the mountain yellin' at the bloody sky
Mama's in the mirror actin' out another life
Children in the schoolyard singin' ""everybody dies""
And I am on the corner with a sentimental eye
I am on the corner singin' sentimental lies

Hopped up on a gypsy train with tracks that you can hide
That way no storm could follow our tomorrows 
But shackled to a suitcase full of automatic thunder
Clap
All hail to death's boy-wonder

JJ's in the kitchen talking bout the end of times
Mo's thowin' Kerouac to Catch Her In the Rye
Tempermental yogis bakin' merry weather pie
And I am on the corner with a sentimental eye
I am on the corner singin' sentimental lies

Sometimes said it's sun time 
Let it sunshine on my mind

All the same its conscience waiting
Cross the line

Last night I dreamed myself upon a golden glade
The clouds passed in and out of my reflection
And everyone I've known held my hands till they were clay
And the storm finally bled from my complexion

Now Jadey's on the mountain singing ""We will never die""
The band is in the rainbow playin' love for you and I
Heath is riding shotgun aimin' at the paper sky
And I am only ""I am"" now I've opened up my eye
I am only ""I am"" that I've opened up my eye

Sometimes said its sun time
Let it sunshine on my mind
Healing I need healing
A good feeling I can shine
Feel it like you can see it
Like you can dream it in your mind
Sunny Hallelujah comin' to ya
Rain or shine

Cross the line

You will see be all that you need to be
Run to the desert

You were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you out to the hospital, you remember that?
Yes, I do, well, there's something I never told you about that night
What didn't you tell me?
While you were sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette you thought was going to be your last,
I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you until just now

If up to me might make her turn right, turn right
Lost another one but she still smiles, smiles
Black lovin' eyes and a stare that sees for miles
Says she wants to be, oh wants to stay a child, child now

And wonders why we ever ever have to die
And I say come on child and I say come on child
Just a touch I'm gonna carry, carry

And two dancing feet

I want the whole damn world
To come and dance with me

Yay, yay, come dance with me
Over heartache and rage
Come set us free
Over panic and strange

I wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun
I wanna know what we’ve been learning and learning from

Everybody want romance (romance love)
Everybody want safety (safety love)
Everybody want comfort (comfort love)
Everybody but me

I dreamed a wind that would sweep
Every castle made of sand
Out across the old far holy land

If this were free
We'd be free of the terror of the graves
And fear masquerading as the brave
Oh, if this were free

I woke upon a pig of red, white and blue
The circus got too heavy so we fell into the zoo
What did you feel?

I felt the fear that every queer does in his head
First thing to starting over, I made sure I was dead
What did you dream?

Edward Simon,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Edwin,"It feels so good to breathe the air 
Another spin around the sun 
On this spec of life 
In the universe 
The gift of love 
Is there for everyone 

Angels working over time 
Day or night to hold the hands 
That play all alone 
A baby's born pure to the world 
As the old man lays down his head and closes his eyes
With nothing said 

Every year another promise is made 
A pint of beer raised towards a better day 
Lets find a star, a star to call our own 
And make a wish, maybe we can make it home 

Ain't it good to be alive? 
To feel the sun, strong against your face 
Strawberry blond waves of silky hair 
Spills over me like the milky way

As the ground just broke away

Is there somewhere else to be
Oh, is there somewhere else for me

Tied to a bed frame
No one hears you when you scream

Rape of the body
And a little self esteem

Intoxicated by the strange days of fear and power hanging
Over me

Any place would be better than this 
All hurts hanging like a specialty fish 
Never been born you don't even exist 
Trade in your days to the night to find the light 
Comes through and haunts your brain 

So you walk on water 
To save your soul again last night 
Couldn't turn away your dogs who bite 
Hey I I must rise to face you 
Shakin' all over the world tonight 
And I'm stuck in this room

Pride that you can't hide becomes pretty wild

Don't you understand

Left behind a friend of mine

Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered

Edwin & the Bedouins,"Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture
Witty, witty, witty as you can be
Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free

Ever stop to think about a downfall

Just when you think you've pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Games are to played with toys etcetera
Love is to be made when you're for real
Ups and downs are caused by life in general
Some are yours no matter how you feel

Shady as a lady in a mustache
Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends

Somebody?s watching you

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon

The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed

Bring it in with one big sigh

Breeze through the window, it turns bitter chill

We volunteer to do nothing again
The world falls around us all we can do is whine
Living out the future of original sin

Dive right through the film
Swim in the madness, fulfill every whim

Forgive us our monstrosities

Well I don't mind if you hang around
Just don't start talking that love talk baby
Don't bring me down

Why you want to shoot me down
I'm just trying to be your friend now baby
But you lock the door, hide the key, hide under the bed
You're gonna hide from me

Come on baby, let me in...",Don't Bring Me Down
Edwin McCain,"After all the corridors are darkened
When the royal crown is off your head
To your chambers I will creep not a word we will speak
Just love me while the fire light dances 'round the bed
Well there is danger in this passion
Because the king can never never know
And on my blood I've sworn my allegiance
So I'll leave you when the sunlight comes and beckons me to go
And the silver shine is tarnished from my armor
And in battle I am paralyzed with fear|
And this poison in my soul is the love we'll never know
And it finds me playing Lancelot to your Guinevere
Well and Guinevere is sly enough to steal a little taste
And her laughter it peals into the night
Oh but forbidden fruit always stays sticky on your face
And without virtue I'm worthless in a fight
Stealing little glances at the table I feel that this is theater in the round
But far away chasing vixens in the meadow
Your love like wind, blows right by and sweeps me off the ground
Your love sweeps me off the ground
Well now it sweeps me off the the ground
And the silver shine is tarnished from my armor 
And in battle I am paralyzed with fear
And this poison in my soul is the love we'll never know
And it finds me playing Lancelot to your Guinevere",Guinevere
Edwin McCain,"Looking back on younger days the view stretched on for miles
We charged into our futures with laughter and smiles
As we traveled blindly the road became so thick
No chance to change direction and we've laughed until we're sick
Now I keep company with wicked evil men 
My generosity's brimming but I'm still inclined to sin
My friends think I am crazy and I know that may be so
But I'm as happy with a penny as coffers full of gold

And so for all of you I say, don't miss the forest for all the trees
And don't ever question Honor Among Thieves

The undergrowth has parted now the path is easily read
It's lined with all the doubters regretting all they've said
God bless all the dreamers and those who lead with soul
For how can you know virtue 'less you fought out of a hole

And so for all of you I say, don't miss the forest for all the trees
And don't ever question Honor Among Thieves

Trickle of a chuckle as laughter starts to pour
Bells begin to jingle the trickles now a roar
Pan floutist, cloven dancer
The mischief has begun
Laugh with me if it's funny, laugh at me if it's fun
And I don't know St. Peter but I know he believes
There's a place in heaven for Jesters, Dreamers & Thieves

Edwin McCain,"Sitting in the kitchen
Just staring at the cracks in the wall
I've been sitting here since yesterday
Just waiting on you to call
The cracks remind me of you and I
They're all up, down and split apart
And all the cracks in the wall lead to one great big hole
That used to be my heart
Now that I think of it
Nothing ever worked out right
All we ever seemed to do is just cuss, scream, bitch and fight
All we did was fight
The tears I cried
Fell on a cold and lonely floor
No one to wipe them away
The tears I cried
Will be my own and they'll follow me
And that's the way it's gonna stay
Now that I think of it
Nothing ever worked out right
All we ever seemed to do is just cuss, scream, bitch and fight
All we did was fight

I'm not made up of enough to be your man
Oh pretty baby, don't know what to say
I just want you to, go away
Well I'd love to sit and reflect on this
But I haven't got the time
Just tell me why you chose to be so cruel, mean, brutal so unkind
Now that I think of it
Nothing ever worked out right
All we ever seemed to do was cuss, scream, bitch and fight

Trying to show her all the pain you feel inside
Yeah and head all scrambled and the love is gone
And you don't know what went wrong

But I think I heard you hissing something about blue steel
But when you talk about something like gun play
Let me tell you it's a losing bet
But when the hammer falls all bets are called

And five to one you're gonna lose
When you talk about something like Russian Roulette

Yea was a brother of mine
We were imaginary comic book superheroes
Kids wasting time

We were prisoners of our youth
We were growing up strong
'Till the day he was taken away
For something he did wrong

Tim came 'round just the other day
And boy he had some stories to tell
His mama kept him locked up in a rehab
Although the doctors said he was well

He said yeah I been through the anger
And the hatred towards my mom
And I put all that behind me
Just tell me what was it like to go to your prom

He said thank you mom for fixing

And the kids they're doing the best that they can

Before you lock your kid up 
And throw away the key

He left me with these words

But my childhood is gone
And I'm not afraid of dying
I'm gonna grab the world by the horns

Looking for songs in a bottle
Talking with strangers who don't know my pain
Blurry eyed and burned out

Choking on more than I can swallow
Crack in a little voice called out my name
She said ~ Whatever happened to you
It's been two years where have you been

And I guess all my fears were true
The words were all gone the time's been too long
But I deserve to know what happened to my friend
Staring in her face

I see a past that still haunts me
The road where we split up is paved with the things I didn't say
We had wonderful times, but terrible timing
Now just leave her alone, I'll just be in the way

She said whatever happened to you
You took the coward's way out again
And I guess all my fears were true
The words are all gone, the time's been too long

Edwin McCain,"Thirty Pieces of silver screen
Deep inside our souls
How did we betray our imagination
Watching our futures unfold

Without a whisper for fear of intrusion
We have to see how this part ends
Time out for commercials
Time out to be good friends

But our generation's angry
We're so scared that we can't see
The answer right inside of us
If we can find the place in our hearts 

Where we're all free
Does it see that time works against us
Or does it just march on and on and on
Sometimes it drives me crazy

Proving Nostradamus wrong, so wrong
But we still have secret silos with buttons, 
Codes and keys
We can avert this awful disaster 

If we find the place in our hearts 
Where we're all free
And what a tall order
Far be it for me to say

Maybe I'll try a little harder
Starting here today
Or just throw in the towel
Lay down five up the ghost

And join all the cynics
Luckier than most
Maybe I'll check out with a bullet

Would it rattle you enough
Would it frighten you enough to...

The king stares softly to the sky
Will he ever see his home again
Deep from his heart he starts to cry

As his songs hit the air and young hearts are awake
Soon they join in the chorus sharing all his ache

There's a lifetime out there somewhere
Somewhere in the dark
And summer's on, the lion's song
Sung from Cleveland Park

And the high school kids ignore it
They have their own tune
They're just showing off the speakers in their ride
I know what I'm sayin'
I grew up too soon
And youth goes hand in hand with foolish pride

As their song hits the air and young hearts start to break
The lions join in the chorus sharing all their ache

There's a lifetime out there somewhere
Somewhere in the dark
And summer's on, the lion's song

In Cleveland Park trees breathe a sigh of all the summers gone

Edwin McCain,"Seven million years of progress handed down on silver wings
Of gossamer and protein still we haven't learned a thing
Are we caught up in our anger, locked up in our rage
In the opera of selection on this our earthly stage

And Charlie's spinning laughing, laughing in his grave
Laughing at the prophecy, the prophecy he gave
Can we spread our wings like angels, can we break out of the grind
Are we destined to be Darwin's children this time

The ribbons of our cigarettes vanish in the air
In the glow of our great teacher we sit and blankly stare
And the sky could open up and what would we have to say
Something cute about burning out, better than fading away

And Charlie's spinning laughing, laughing in his grave

As sure as the sunset burns

I slip another day
Start to lose my grip
Find another way

Graveyards for the sons of Ft. Sumpter

Burned my heart on a sweet southern flame
Like a hug from your mama saying it will be OK

Line was jammed I tried and tried,

And F series pickups and rusted out cars
And they're eating breakfast at the strip bar
Just to have a peek?

And the beer soaked angels spread their wings
And dream of twenties and diamonds and things
And somehow that might ease the sting
Of the company they keep
Yeah?

And the vets still talk about the Tet offensive
And the freshmen boys all look so pensive
Because living large is so expensive
Hope daddy fueled the jet?

And we'll all fly out to the Hard Rock casino
And we'll put on our neatly pressed and fine chinos
And we'll laugh at the guy in the El Camino
Is that the only car he could get?

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful life
It's just as advertised
It's all for one low price
Just read the fine print, and you'll be content
With your beautiful life

And record smoothies say ""What a sound""
You're the greatest thing we've found
But you're gonna have to lose a few pounds
We're gonna put you on TV

And don't think our place is so swank
Don't worry about that guy, he's high on crank
That's exactly why his last record tanked
And let that be a lesson to me

[Chorus]

And all our churches glow
Communion wafers trash TV shows
Say ""Hey, at least you don't have this strife""
'Cause you'll be warm and safe
In your beautiful life
Yeah?

And it's hard to tell what's true compassion
When it's dressed up in hair and nails and fashion
And the tabloids all rush to cash in on what we should believe
And I hope I never see the day

When there's nothing left on the planet left to save
And oxygen is the designer crusade
As we all fight to breathe?

My crepe paper bridges

Follow your heart where it leads you

Edwin McCain,"Lying here with you
Listening to the rain
Smiling just to see the smile upon your face
These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments I'll remember all my life
I found all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

Looking in your eyes
Seeing all I need
Everything you are is everything to me
These are the moments
I know heaven must exist
These are the moments I know all I need is this
I have all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I have's come true
And right here in this moment is right where I'm meant to be
Here with you here with me

These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments I'll remember all my life
I've got all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more

I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I have's come true
And right here in this moment is right where I'm meant to be
Here with you here with me

Edwin McCain,"The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
Stop me and steal my breath
Emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth
Tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

Rain falls angry on the tin roof.
As we lie awake in my bed
You're my survival, you're my living proof
My love is alive and not dead
Tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings with love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

I've dropped out, burned up, fought my way back from the dead
Tuned in, turned on, remembered the thing you said

I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your

I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

Yeah yeah

Edwin McCain,"Promise of you
It sleeps in the air
The air that I breathe
And I know that it's true
Don't have to convince myself to believe
What secrets sleep in the heart of a man
So much love wasted Slip right through my hands
See it in the eyes of the lonely
As they make their weary way
Shimmer in the eyes of longing
I hear it say
Promise of you
It sleeps in the air
The air that I breathe
And I know that it's true
Don't have to convince myself to believe
To believe...

What secrets sleep in the heart of the night
Dreams of salvation
Slipping out of sight
In the shimmering moments of twilight
Closing up the shine
Whisper on the wind of a rescue
Savior in time
Promise of you
It sleeps in the air
The air that I breathe
And I know that it's true
Don't have to convince myself to believe

Edwin McCain,"She's a Blue Ridge cradle
She's a mother to some
And home to the laughter
Of road weary ones
So we'll sing all the old songs
Sing to grandmama road
And we'll sing cause we miss her
And we're sad she had to go
If I could see off this mountain
Through the clouds in my eyes
I would see off this mountain
On the nights stars fell
And see off this mountain
Through the tears in my eyes
I would see off this mountain
And the stars fell from the skies
In the air I hear a fiddle
Down along Hickory Way
And the mandolin guitar
Like we used to play
And down on Dunn's rock
Brothers boasting a dare
We tell them they're crazy
And pretend we don't care
If I could see off this mountain
Through the clouds in my eyes
I would see off this mountain
On the nights stars fell
And see off this mountain
Through the tears in my eyes
I would see off this mountain
And the stars fell from the skies
The air tastes like moonshine
In the wind a carnival tune
It soars with our laughter
But we'll all leave too soon
So I raise a toast to family
Put thanks in my glass
In the arms of your loved ones
It's the only home that lasts
If I could see off this mountain
Through the clouds in my eyes
I would see off this mountain
On the night the stars fell
And see off this mountain
Through the tears in my eyes
I could see off this mountain
When the stars fell from the skies
When the stars fell from the skies
Going up to grandmama road
Going up to grandmama road
I'm happy as can be
'Cause can't you see
I'm going up to grandmama road

Edwin McCain,"Wendy's sittin' next to me
She's trying hard to drink it away
And I feel the rumble of the subway
Beneath the stage
And her eyes are screaming
And her lips are pursed
And this ain't her first heartache
But it feels like, it feels like the worst
And she says
Can someone tell me how this can happen
And I guess that God only knows
My heart used to be
The sweet shop of love
But now the sign on the door
It says sorry we're closed
And I hear myself tell her
Some old words I know they won't help
And then I feel guilty
'Cause I closed some sweet shops myself
And we all talk about timing
And lifestyles and such
But to a heart that's been shattered
Those words don't mean that much
And all of our pining
It just goes to show
Don't you enter a shop
With the sign on the door
Saying sorry we're closed
And she's been through all the pain
That one can endure
And her new man thinks she loves him
But he can't be sure
And his heart pines for Wendy
She says that's how it goes
How am I supposed to know
He can't read the sign saying
Sorry we're closed
Yeah we're closed
And she says
Can someone tell me how this can happen
And I guess that God only knows
My heart used to be
The sweet shop of love

There's a sign on the door 
There's a sign on the door
There's a sign on the door
One more sign...

Edwin McCain,"One little gutter town 3:00 in the morning
I whispered these words I believed
Said leave me alone girl
I'm so tied down and broken
It's too late it's too late to save me
Ain't no wish in this world slight of this moment
No dream I could dream that comes near
No heaven or hope that comes near
No wish in this world except you right here
It's cold and it's dark and I'm sure it makes you crazy
Runnin' to grass so green
Dangerous road but it's not going to change me
Paved with ten million broken dreams

The ghosts of miracles played upon the stage

I beg you for forgiveness

I dreamed that you were gracious, 
I dreamed you wished me well
I dreamed that you were vicious, 
You damned me straight to hell

And he will be your man

And I was just a boy for you

Traveling town to town

Don't amount to much
The wine and the women 
Are such a shameful crutch

World was spinning around the voices echo things that she said
I'm just coming down from this starry sky
I'm just glad to be here and most of all I'm thankful I'm alive

I hear the whispers in the crowd from jealous tongues
Shadows from the shameful light my ego's come undone
And your dignity has missed you and I'm sure your soul agrees
This fire sale has cost you your pace and sanity

[Chorus]

The path that I must take will lead me to despair
When I'm a million miles away will no one even care

Edwin McCain,"Wake up, Maggie,
I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May [*]
Edwin McCain,"Say anything, save everything
If we say nothing this love will die
Give me just one word, you can scream or whisper
If you want to stay with me, tell me why
Say anything

It's not the words aren't there but they'd only fail my emotions
Just want to feel this way without chaining you down to some old cliche
You want water in my hands and we stand waist deep in the ocean
It's bigger than the sea, it won't let me

Say just anything, because I feel everything
I'd rather say nothing than the same old lines
I think I give you more, something there's no words for
You don't have to hear me to feel me trying
To say anything

Baby I know you try but somtimes I still want to hear it
Even when the waters calm but lately it's just when there's something wrong
Why can't we splash around and hold on to that playful spirit
Oh like we used to do and won't you

Say anything, save everything
If we say nothing this love will die
Give me just one word, you can scream or whisper
If you want to stay with me tell me why
Say anything

This love is true
Even if you call it by a different name
And it's still the same, so we'll

Say anything, feel everything
I want to be with you so this love can fly
We'll hang on every word and we'll scream, we'll whisper
This moment is waiting for you and I

We keep it tied with a simple lock
We hold it close 'cause it's all we got

In a world that's starting to fade
A little love could pave the way
Don't keep it tied with the simple lock
You think it's ordinary but it's not

Maybe this life is just about love and tenderness
If all we are are shooting stars
Maybe we, we can fight
All of this pain and loneliness

Tired of hearing 'bout the bling-bling
We're so concered with material things
It's all cars and diamond rings
And do you think it's gonna to ease your sting

Cause that's a hole that you can't fill
Velvet rope overkill
Free your mind let your heart sing
And just remember that they're only things

Cause every moment slips away there's no denying
That I know, yes I know

Stop me and steal my breath
Emeralds from mountains and thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth

I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

I'll be love suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

As we lie awake in my bed
You're my survival, you're my living proof

I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips

I'm a drowning man for the third time
Twenty-one gun salute in your flag of mercy
Preparing my body for a burial at sea

[Chorus]
So put your tongue in my ear
Through this veil of tears
Whisper what's gone wrong? gone wrong?
The world, the world she's a Babylon

Coming in from the coast it's a bad nor'easter
Waves banging rocks with migraine vengeance
Build up the tower, unlocking the secrets
The pride of man is so contentious

Well I made a small fortune sellin used cars
And it's buried out back in a cookie jar
I raise a toast to Senior Escobar
For givin me a pot to piss in

Well I ran a little scam until '92
Now I hang around here for somethin to do
And I just keep talkin till I'm blue
To any one who'll listen

Yes, we're lost in America
And this land we're so proud of
We got the cars, the girls, the money, the drugs
To get you out of your rut
Yes, we're lost in America

She got a brand new lease on an Escalade
And a bumper sticker bout a whale to save
And she's burnin up gas like they gave it away
At least her kid's on the honor roll

She got a handful of pills to improve her mood
Liposuction, big, fake boobs
She got a Mexican maid that brings the food
To the birdcage made of gold

Bridge:
I'm droppin out
And I'm quittin this game
Yes, I'm washin my feet, turn off my phone
Changin my name, hittin the road
Don't really know where I'm gonna go
But I'm gettin the hell out of here

Edwin McCain,"I didn't reach out,
Cause I didn't need saving.
I wasn't drowning,
I was just waving.
I apologize, 
For the misunderstanding.
But I wasn't falling, 
I was just landing.
I'm not over,
Just getting started.
I'm not gonna be some,
Dearly departed.
I wouldn't shatter,
To the touch.
Baby you worry,
A little too much.

If you let me be,
Who I'm becoming,
Stop seeing me,
As everything I've been.
You could be free,
From the wondering.
Let me give you something to,
Truly believe in.

If I'm guilty,
It's not murder,
But is killing time,
So unkind?
And we take this struggle,
Further and further.
Only to find,
Oh no finish lines.

If you let me be,
Who I am becoming.
Stop seeing me,
As everything I've been.
You could be free,
From the wondering.
Let me give you something to,
Truly believe in.

We can chose to fight the war,
Or find the little things.
There's music in the notes,
It's in the space between.

If you let me be,
Who I'm becoming.
Stop seeing me,
As everything I've been.
You could be free,
From the wondering.
Let me give you something to,
Truly believe in forgiveness.
I truly believe,
We can begin again.
I truly believe,
I can fix this.

Edwin McCain,"All is quiet on the Western front,
There appears to be a lull.
John and Jane Doe are sleeping well tonight
With the little thoughts inside their skulls.
Salome she's undressed to the nines
Although a few pounds fatter.
She's got Pavlov's bells on her ankles and wrists,
She coming at you with her platter.
I stole down to the waterfront
To escape the desert heat.
What on earth you gotta do around here
To try and get yourself a drink
Heard John the Baptist preaching
""Make way for the King,
But if you wanna recognize him,
you gotta tell me all your sins""

They are building a new gallows
For when you show up on the street.
Polishing the electric chair,
They're gonna give you a front row seat.
Heard a sneer outside the garden;
Salutation so well-heeled:
""Welcome all you suckers to Struggleville""

I've been trying to negotiate peace
With my own existence.
She's gotta stockpile full of weaponry;
She breaking every cease-fire agreement.
Whole thing is full of decay
Just as sure as I'm made of dust,
And into rust I know the beast is falling.

They fill me up for a selfish moment
And I made them out to be more than they were
Now I'm paying, but throwing it around
I go unheard with what I'm saying
It's finally profound and you're sick of the sound

Of the boy who cried love
Nobody came running all the false alarms still hovering
Loved too many times too carelessly
And now it's true and you don't believe me
What can I do to change how you see me?
Don't want to know that kind of lonely
The boy who cried love, love, love

I'm sweeping up all those promises
That I will never make again
They were the kind you tell a trusting heart
They were just designed to win
Now it's you and I'm sorry, don't let me become
The star of the story have you heard the one

About the boy who cried love
Nobody came running all the false alarms still hovering
Loved too many times too carelessly
And now it's true and you don't believe me
What can I do to change how you see me?
Don't want to know that kind of lonely

Stings our eyes, steals the days of you

You're showing me just how to take advantage

I could use you up and not feel a thing
But tonight I'm not the same depleter

Raised to feel unlovable in your home, sick home

Well, the truth is cloudier than clear
I can lead you out of these woods
That terrorized me 'cause this is where I stood

I never measured up, I never made the grade
I can't heal your pain but the truth
Will help you set it down, set it down

'Cause there's so much love in the great big world

Edwin Starr,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free

And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.

Until they saw two lovers kissing
They knew just what was missing
So happy they were

Rocking and reeling
Because they added
That loving feeling

Now if they move you
Will it move you

It can groove, you, baby

Edwyn Collins,"Don't try so hard to be different
The cracks are beginning to show
You drift like a cloud through the festival crowd
In a frock coat from Seville row

You've just been to a all night party
Where I have to admit it takes pluck
To go out on the floor and proclaim, ?What a bore?
In a T-shirt that reads, 'Disco Sucks'

Yes, here he comes, the not so young
Pretender to the throne
He's singing rag, momma, rag
Won't you give that poor dog a bone?

And he's wondering why we can't connect
When he's sworn to us that he's totally wretch
On the rustic charm that he affects
On a public schoolboy whim

With a raggle taggle plastic gypsy
Robert Zimmerframe
With a synthesized accordion
A scramblin' up my brain

With a fiddle dee dee, a fiddle on high
Excuse me folks while I kiss the sky
Or at any rate give it one more try
Before I die, before I die

The overrated hit the stage
Overpaid and over here
And their idea of counter culture's
Momma's charge account at sears

And they're wondering why we can't connect
With the ritual of the trashed guitar
One more paltry empty gesture
The ashes of a burned out star

Yes, here they come, both old and young
A contact low or high
The gathering of the tribes descending
Vultures from a caustic sky

The rotting carcase of July
And ugly sun hung out to dry
Your gorgeous hippy dreams are dying
Your frazzled brains are putrefying

Repackaged, sold and sanitized
The devil's music exorcised
You live, you die, you lie, you lie, you die
Perpetuate the lie, perpetuate the lie,
Perpetuate the lie, just to perpetuate the lie

Edwyn Collins,"There's something intriguing about you, that's for sure
Seems like you walked right out of my past
Oh, you swore we never met before?
And I know the reasons why you're shy
Of these feelings that we can't deny

But it's not forbidden, why keep it hidden
I know your love is tender and warm
Caught in your head lights shimmering bright
'Cause you got it on and I've got it bad

Some kind of magic about you, I can't explain
And now you put your spell on me
And I know I'll never be the same
And I'm wondering is it self deceit
'Cause without you I feel incomplete

But it's not forbidden, why keep it hidden
I know your love is tender and warm
Caught in your head lights shimmering bright
'Cause you got it on and I've got it bad

And I can still see you when I asked if you would stay
Well you looked right through me when you turned and walked away
But intuitively I knew that someday I'd make you mine
And even though our pasts were a skew, I knew they'd cross in time

And it's not forbidden, why keep it hidden
I know your love is tender and warm
Caught in your head lights shimmering bright
'Cause you got it on and I've got it bad

You've got it on, I've got it bad
You've got it on, I've got it bad

Amazed at what I saw
Struggling hard to find the words
When words tends to stick right in my craw

I'm talking about seizing the moments
When the moment has gone
There's no telling me 'cause I'm holding on
Hoping against hope that you've got it wrong

Like I love you
If you could love me
Like I love you

Frozen in time and space
Yet I feel no need
To get out of this place

The planets grooved, I fell down on my knees
Someone whispered take your leave
You're free to go any way you please

You feel no need to settle down
In the crippled crook of your earth bound town

And you've been down this road before
Which is not to say you're bored
Or that you shouldn't want for more
It's just your expectations should be lower

There must be somethin' more than this
More than ideal homes or domestic bliss
What is there left for you to do
'Cause you've seen the future and it's nothin' new

And you've been down this road before

Or that you shouldn't want for more

If you mean to offend me then you're doing pretty well
And how convincingly you've shown me
That the love I thought was built to last is now an empty shell

Things can only get better
What's around the corner, who can tell?
I'll build a little place just north of heaven
I'm kinda tired of living south of hell

Don't assume you can ignore me
You'd best bite your lip in case I make it after all
And how contemptuously you've shown me
That all my aspirations were so paltry and so small

Things can only get better
What's around the corner, who can tell?
I'll build a little place just north of heaven
I'm kinda tired of living south of hell

Some mother's talking 'bout Guns 'n' Roses
As if I give a fuck, at best I think they suck
I'm too preoccupied with my memories
Not non-entities

As these four walls collide, as your whole world subsides
But you took it all in your stride
As a matter of course, not a matter of pride

So raise your glass, let's celebrate
'Cause we can force those hands of fate
No need to heed the call for greed, for acquisition
Now I ain't puttin' you on, this is my genuine position

You're lost in the ruins of your mind
As these four walls collide, as your whole life subsides
But you took it all in your stride
As a matter of course, not a matter of pride

How can I thank you?
We're forever in your debt
We'll bite the hand of fate that feeds us
Morsels of regret

From a shack near the swamp lands

Of New Orleans
 
Dime or a nickel any one could buy 
Voo-doo of any kind 
She had potions and lotions, herbs and tanna leaves 
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Early one mornin' into mucky swamp dew
Vanished Marie with hate in her eyes
Though she'll never return all the Cajuns knew
A witch queen never dies

Edwyn Collins,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in my
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch

Eef Barzelay,"If this war's ever over if it ever runs out
Maybe we can think about traveling
To those far away cities of drug stores and tans
On smooth, hairless Japanese bodies
On smooth, hairless Japanese bodies

If this engine turns over, we'll tear through the park
On donuts and milk of Magnesia
And I'll read you a poem of blue skies and eyes
In your sockets that bring them together
In your sockets that bring them together

And are your thighs ever tender
As they swell in my hands
And are warmed by the spit of my kisses
But I will just graze you like the sun does on grass
Pick at your flesh like an eagle
Pick at your flesh like an eagle

If this war's ever over, they'll separate us
Leaving video tapes to remember
And I'll go back to Texas and try not to think
Of Thanksgiving waves that can cripple

Eef Barzelay,"You put your hands upon it
But it only ever squirms
You're staring in the mirror
And you're counting every germ
I'm not surprised she left you
That she found the nerve to tell
The thing you claim to love so much
You don't do very well

I'm sure someone will love you
'Til the day that they must die
And someone will mourn for you
With bitter, tear-stained eyes
Will this be enough for you?
You got them in your spell
Because the thing you claim to hate
You do it very well

Was it written in the stars
Or in your mother's gut
Will you be as pure as snow
Or just some angry mutt?
The price of it has just gone down
And you did not think to sell
But in doing all these hateful things
You are unparallel
At doing all these hurtful things
You really do excel

The truthfulness must leave the room
If I ever wish you well",Well
Eef Barzelay,"Don't extend the solo
Lay the groove too deep
Try not to sing the words
As if you're mumbling in your sleep

Don't say that you won't do it
'Cause it's been done before
Don't start a revolution
Just because you're feeling bored

The girls don't care
That you ache to be free
You see, the girls just want
A sweet melody

Don't quote 'Five Easy Pieces'
'TiVo Cool Hand Luke'
Don't talk about how
God is dead and love is just a fluke

Don't listen to Frank Zappa
Late Coltrane, Faust or Can
Just take that twisted heart of yours
And lay it in her hand

That you ache to be free
You see, the girls just want
A sweet melody

Eef Barzelay,"If you're gonna lose then
Might as well lose big then
As always it was always it shall be
Do you really love me?

If you promise me you do
I'll take that job you want me to
And do my best
Swear that I can pass this test

Some girl told me last night
She found my rhythms so tight
I swear she only bought me one or two
I told her all about you

You should try to be more kind
You know how I need to unwind
When it gets dark
And I wanna see some sparks

Europe's gonna love me
All in different countries
There is no way that I could turn it down
And anyway it's for us

Promise I'll be home before
That baby's knocking at the door
I'll be right there
To let it in I won't be scared

Well, if we're gonna lose then
Might as well lose big then
As always it was always it shall be
Do you really love me?

Eels,"A monk with a hard-on
And a lavender robe
That scratches his thighs
Through the hat that he strode
As he follows a path
Filled with every desire
And mimics his footsteps
And sets his prayers on fire.

Well I too have chosen
That which left no choice
To sing without loving,
A solitary voice,
To observe with passion
Each careful denial:
The protrusions which give my life meaning
For a while.

Sometimes I see you in berries and weeds
You're brushing your teeth with liquorice seeds
Standing too close,
Pulling your clothes,
Smiling at god
And the meaning of life grows.

No and I'll never tell
And I'll never know
What candles you light
After the show
And I'll never tell,
And I'll never ask
The meaning of life after mass.

To keep defeating my own self,
And keep repeating yesterday.
I can't keep defeating myself,
I can't keep repeating,

There's no way to get around it,
I'm not the younger man.

A better road ahead

Headed for a dead-end,

Eerie Von,"And so I chose the night to be my dominion
Beauty, hope and joy all lay behind
All things good were no longer my companions
Buried with the soul that I let die

Then I sang the first hymn
And I filled a river red with blood
Drenched my whole world in sin
Left my city in dust

The few believers wanted to be picked
Praying to their God like some pious lunatics
Their sins were deadly, my lies, their truth
I opened up the gates and let them crawl through

To sing their first hymn
Filled their river with blood
Drenched their whole world in sin
Built their cities of dust
Drenched their whole world in sin
River red with blood
Built their cities of dust

I sang the first hymn
And I filled a river red with blood
Drenched my whole world in sin
Left my city in dust

I sang the first hymn
I filled a river red
I sang the first hymn
River red with blood

Once freedom came for me, and for my wearied soul
Prisoner of life I'd be no more
But the taste of blood had grown far too sweet
So I chose to walk the road that I was on

So I sang the next hymn
Filled a river with the death of love
And wallowed in my sin
Left my city in dust
Filled a river red with blood
Left my city in dust",The First Hymn

Egypt Central,"I close my eyes to no avail
Three days of aching sleepless
I wish these sheets would suffocate me while I wait
I love the cuts that make the lines
Arranged in beautiful designs
I fight with a sharp side of a razor blade
It's not right I can't escape the choice I made

One last chance to get me through tonight
One last dance with the lady dressed in white
I lost myself I lost my alibis
One last time to feed the enemy inside of me

It's getting harder to inhale
A quick fix to clear my secrets
Eyes die alit and stop the winding second hand
It turns the hours into days
Behind the sunlight my life fades to gray
Alone again with a razor blade
It's not right I can't escape the choice I made

One last chance to get me through tonight
One last dance with the lady dressed in white
I lost myself I lost my alibis
One last time to feed the enemy

It's quiet now
Like the moments after a murder
The younger me inside
Can't believe the things he saw tonight
Face to face I'm screaming at myself
Face to face I'm screaming at myself for help

Eiffel 65,"Some people suffer living alone
And feel the emptiness
Of a relationship that turned into dust
And some wait for all of their lives
Because they're too afraid 
And they let their train go by

and some will never say no
Living on the frailty
Of never letting go
Always hiding behind a mask
And though there's finally the pleasure of being always on their own 
While others waltz a perfect heart 
And a home 

It's because you are
Like a filter to me
That I'll see the future brighter
Than they'll ever see

And I know you are
All the colors I breathe
You have the pen that's writing down
The fairy tale that pictures 
You and me

Some people suffer poverty
In a love affair
And others like to live their love
In the rain
And some live a million affairs
Believing all the time that no one will feel or care
Some people wait
Holding back their faith
Because their wounds will never heal
Made by rumors building hate
Or someone who's in a sin
Some people find the pleasure of being always on the road
While others waltz a perfect heart
And a home

It's because you are

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

[Verse 1: MJG]
Pimpin hoes was some shit that came easy to a playa
Cause ain't no way in hell a bitch could get me to a bail
And how in the fuck I'll ever make some money if I'm pail
My hoes sell pussy at the party for the mayor
400 for the chewin, 100 for the mackin
1,000 for the fucking, 200 for the jackin
Soon as the day is over, my bitch is checkin in

Can't help it cause you don't know, ain't my fault that you stuck up
Ya parents didn't teach ya, the streets didn't reach ya
I'm makin easy money from the judge and the preacher
The mayor likes the bitches cause they beat him with a chain
The judge and the preacher love to hear dirty thangs
The governor was first on the bitch payin list
He busted a nut soon as the bitches touched his dick

[Verse 3: Eightball]
Comin out smooth, livin like a pimpsta
Gotta flee the bitches and they all call me mista fat mac
Pimp tight, what the fuck you want to do?
See me in the streets, sweep 'em off and down you and your crew
Gotta be ruthless, smackin hoes toothless
Suckas gettin dropped when I'm poppin with the glock bitch
And the niggaz that hide cap and act like hoes
When they see the 93 with the switches and the voes

[Girl]

The cops work for me cause I keep good stuff
And plus the government ain't never paid dem tricks enough

While I'm makin money off the shit that I done fronted
Nigga fell short, shoot 'em up yeah I done it
MJG Pushin real not cut
Got the feds in my pocket, and the chief by his nuts

[Verse 7: Eightball]
Roll a fat bud, smoke the bitch and then I'm chilled
Fall off in the club drinkin yak dressed to kill
Niggaz that be jealous cause dem hoes be on the jock
Don't disrespect my pimpin or you I will have to drop
No I don't be playin, what I'm sayin what I speak
Some niggaz don't understand then I have to go and teach

What, we through, pass me that joint nigga",The First Episode
Eightball & MJG,"8Ball: Now, I was broke as a muthafucka, my life at the end see
My so called friends, they had no ends to lend me.
My job at Mickie Ds was fuckin me with no grease
I worked so damn hard, but the money, it never increased.
I quit my fuckin job, I had no job nigga
Put on the mask, get the gloc, it's time to rob nigga.
I hit the streets, but no victim had been chosen
Damn I was nervous, but my fear wouldn't stop my strollin.
Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I was struck
I felt the burn of bullets, so I knew I had got bucked.
Reachin for my tech, the bullets hit me in my chest
My eyes closed shut, and I thought I seen death.
I woke up at the med still woozy from my jackin
T-Money walked in and he told me what had happened.
I knew him from the hood, but I did not know him well
He drove a red jag, and I knew that he was bale.
He said he was rollin when he seen me in distress
He said he killed the muthafuckin niggas with his tech.
He offered me a job said he'd front me what I needed
I said that I was with it dreamin one day I would be..

chorus: Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size.

Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size.

8Ball: I hit the street slaning ya-yo, then I sold up my block
Sellin 8, sellin deals, sellin $20 rocks.
Sellin dimes, sellin nickels to the junkies on my tracks
Gettin my dick sucked with the crumbs from the crack.
Some fool tried to jack me, but he only had a knife
A clip full of hollow tips took the bitches' life.
Standin on the track, my mobile rung and it was T
""Hello?"" -- ""Yo Eight, be the fuck aroung 3"" --""Aight!""
I met him at the park, he had a job for me again
Rob some Columbians, and get my ass in.
Hit for 30 birds, if I live, I'd get five
I smoked them damn Columbians, and then got what was mine.
All the time, my clientel rappidly increased
My bank got bigger, that's when bitches started jockin me.
Cars and clothes had me fuckin different hoes
A fat bank roll was keepin me cool with the 5-O.
I had niggas workin under me to take the heat
I never touched the dope, makin a 100 Gs a week.
I gained respect, I'm the biggest playa of all time
Don't ever fuck with me, cause I'm ...
Mr. Big!

repeat chorus:

8Ball: Chillin at the club with T-Money and J-be
Lil Adrian and Boo, and my nigga, MJG.
I had the bitches staring at the twinkle of my diamonds.
Drinkin on this Yak, makin my way to the back.
When I saw this little bitch lookin finer than the rest.
With a long black weave and a tight red dress.
I started conversatin, but she didn't want to talk to me
Straight up to the hotel room, now the bitch is suckin the
Dick of this nigga that is smarter than the bitch thank
Then she got up, now somethin in the air stank.
She went in the bathroom and locked the door behind her
I got off the bed and grabbed the tech from the dresser.
Stood by the door when it opened, niggas came out
Grab my muthafuckin gun, ""Hey nigga!"" *pow pow*
Then, I grabbed the girl cause some more niggas had busted in
Shot that bitch in the dome with my muthafuckin chrome
Shot up all the niggas, but I took one in the leg
When the cops busted in, I was laying on the bed.
Walked up out the room, did I go to jail?
Hell no! They can't stop me..
Long live Mr. Big Ho!!!!

",Mr. Big
Eightball & MJG,"(Eightball)
Ah yea
Eightball & MJG in the muthafuckin house
We came here today to talk to about this thing
called pimpin
It has been misunderstood over the years
so now we have come to set the record straight
niggas don't do this shit right
it takes a special kind of nigga
you know what I'm sayin
yeah

It takes a nigga dat hard from the start
you gotta have heart
to meet a bitch, mack hard down, then rip her apart
it's all in the game, a nigga can't change
if you don't break a bitch
then your game is lame man
see I'm from Tennesee
wit curls and gold teeth
so every were I go, bitchs strike up conversations wit me
about the way I talk, about the way I dress, about
how my gold teeth look so fresh
see how I bait a man, seen as a nigga speak
that deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
I'm in my cadallic, chillin like a fatmack
smoking on a fat sac, drinkin' on a pint of yac
I pick up my car phone, call the freak beat
It's my nigga baby mama, but sometimes I creap
that's just the way it is, niggas have to take a chance
when you ain't around, anybody could be in dat ass
But I just a young nigga, trying to make a dolla
and they way I live, to some it's hard to swalla
see livin' down south ain't what you think it be
nine times out of ten niggas like me
pimps

Ya that's right
we trying to teach all these lames, you know
how to do this shit
cause it's really a hard job
but them lame niggas
they make me get so high

(Chorus)

I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
I get so high
and I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

(MJG)

Now let me explain a pimp
a nigga about the m-o-n-e-why
see a hoe, break a hoe
and try to influence the bitch, to a trick the nigga who
persuaded her to sell ass like hoes suppose too
now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin
surrounded by all these hoes
that's going and givin me money
it's funny how a hoe can make you think she wit ya
when all the time
she's just another niggas gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
take care of your business
bring me the money, ya this shit is thick
hoe don't violate, bitch I know I taught you better
take all of cash, grab on his ass
write dat trick a love letter
train your woman to break a man
man meeting another nigga
just some shit in the game, same-o-same
to make you pimpin thicker
slicker the pimpin gets, freaker gets the bitch
MJG is rich, I'm coe-coe for this tricks
I pimp

Ya that's right baby 
I pimp
so uh, what you need to do is sat dat ass there
and uh, right about now, I bout to fire up one of these spliffs
and get so high

(Chorus) 2x

(Eightball)

Part 2
It's all the same G
trying to school fools, on this P-I-M-P
lession one
first you should pull a bitch, fuck her good
next time tell her no, the next time take her dough
oh, you better watch your back to man
cause there's a lot of bitchs in the world wit much game
lession two
watch dat hoe, don't trust her wit none of yo dough
never let a bitch know, how you much yo cash flow
lession three
if you don't tell dat hoe who is boss
bitchs like to run shit 
but end up getting smacked in the mouth
see a real nigga believe in beatin them hoes down
push they head into the wall until you hear dat crackin sound
drown in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
some niggas get pussy whipped and fall into them love bugs
buying hoes this, buying hoes that
then bragging to your friends
how you fucked her from back
never how you took they cash, never how you beat they ass
never how you pull hoes, fuck them, then dropping fast
I don't understand your plan at all man
but you should be around niggas like me 
pimps

Ya man
this niggas is a trip, you know what I'm sayin
but niggas like me, I have to smoke them spliffs
to get my mind off dat shit, and when I smoke um'
I get so high

(Chorus) 2x

Wherever there's a hoe
there's bound to be a pimp
the pimp supplys his bitchs wit some tricks 
dat they can tempt
a sucker will spend his money, till he ain't got nothin left
instead of blamming the bitch, he needs to blame it on himself
it wouldn't be hoe, if it wasn't for the tricks
but I suggest we keep em', so a pimp can keep his bitch
It needs to be understand, there wouldn't be one without the other
so why the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka
jealous suckers just mad!!!
they can't hang with the pimp thang, looking to sprinkle some salt 
in a pimps game
how in the fuck do you figure pimpin is dead when nigga you know it's alive
pimpin is misunderstood by those who can't, that's why they said it died
others tried pimpin, but were only makin chump change
one track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
rearrange shit dat they done seen in a movie script
dam ain't dat a bitch, niggas like me
pimp

MJ fuckin G, P-I-M-P
staying down on this pimpin bout' these hoes
but some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
and dat shit just makes me get so high

(Chorus) 5x",Pimps
Eightball & MJG,"[MJG]
1 to the muthafuckin 2 to the muthafuckin 3
The sound of the boom is sweatin ya hard like a mystery
Could It be
The pimps could rule the nation in '93'
And MJG is gonna start a new race
Replace the weak tapes we got in the first place
And chase that live on cops quick, out the hood
And beat that ass like a cop would real good
And keep that bud goin on like the Flinstones
And shake them bones when you feel the ? comin on
See up in the ground, down a hit and lean back
Look at ya self and see what I'm sayin is real fat
Society lives off what the media tells us
And niggaz be joinin up wit the shit that they mail us
See pimpin ain't dead yet, see pimpin can pay the rent
And pimpin is demonstrated by those in the government
The money they send you ain't shit but nickels and dimes
And you been stuck in the ghetto since 1979
But it's time to switch it up, unhook it and fix it up
Change it and rearrange it, complete and pick it
It's a book with hard covers that's packed with ideas
We rule the future years
Erase the black fears
And change the system, step up and dismiss them
Tricks from the White House
Move in and they move out
Now I'm runnin thangs, my workers walk wit a limp
My whole staff is bitches and all the judges is pimps
If ya weak in the game, thangs are bound to show
'cause a pimp got a stroke, and a wimp can't flow
And I ain't no muthafuckin fall guy, but Imma try hard
To let you know this pimpin ain't gone never die
M.J.G pimp tight
Young black nigga, no wife
No children, just hoes
Supplying the muthafuckin nation wit a dose
Of what, has been injected and now it's on
The muthafuckin pimp is in the house

And if so, what proceeds do we have to go through?

Well, check it out 
First here's what you have to do

{MJG:}
It's time to let the p-I-m-p in the fuckin front do'
One mo' nigga cuttin paper on the down low
It's so twisted in this white man's society
Why it be hard for a nigga when he try to be
Independent, on his own with a plan
You hate it cause you can't understand how I can
Rearrange and change how your daughter was raised
And teach her how to constantly get paid when she's laid
Ain't no use in bein the freak of the city, you still ain't got no ducats
You want a rolex or ride buckets?
Bitch, listen cause you gots plenty of competition from these other hoes 
Who think that you supposed 
To fall dead, short, lame to the game
Don't worry, put them bitches in your pistol range
MJ fuckin G settin your mind free with the type of knowledge

Alright buddy, check this out...

{Eightball:}
Once again here I come pushin that funk into your ear
Do you recall Eightball, the player of the year
Calm cause I'm cool, and I'm cool cause I'm calm
Leavin hoes shell-shocked like they fall in Vietnam
Mayn, some have game, but most of them can't handle this
Those that I think are stars, end up bein scandalous
Welfare recipients, crib full of rugrats
Boost a couple of shirts, and now the bitch think she all that
Freakazoids have a nigga noid steppin up to me
Hoes that'll fuck you fast might be packin H.I.V.
Me, I'm packin jimmy hats 
So a hoe won't give me that
Shit about she on the pill 
Knowin that her pussy kill
See, through my education illustrations were the key
See, where I'm from only bustas have to pay a fee
Now you might ask what can a nigga do to get started
Pull a hoe and go enroll in Break-A-Bitch College

Ah yeah 
Now that was a very nice lecture
And as I walk back over to the middle of the bulletin board
I - I kinda figured, I wondered to myself
And I looked at my class, and I
It seems that you have more questions
Is there any more questions?

Yes
Yes, Mister MJG
I have a question
Yes?
Ah - in 94
Do you think - ah
Any bitches are gonna come up?
Can - can any bitches be pimps?

Look here, look here
Let me tell you...

{MJG:}
Now these bitches got a lotta game for a nigga, so
That made me try to see how to break a hoe
What exactly would it take for me to make the bitch click
How damn quick could I make the bitch break a trick 
How fuckin long will it take to make my profit
And what kinda justice can this hoe do for my pocket
Talkin space-age pimpin, similar to the oldies
In ways like keepin our business tight, not by tryina be Goldie
These niggas gettin they game picked down to the bone
If you listen on what these hoes have to say, your money's gone
Nigga, focus on your own rhyme, make em follow your own rules
Don't be a fool, nigga, bring that bitch on by to school
I got a class for that ass, and it stars at seven
'I was a pimp' at ten o'clock, break till eleven
Future looks good for the smartest
Niggas in the school of Sir Break-A-Bitch College

Okay class, okay class
Everybody just needs to settle down
Everybody just settle down
We're gonna break in about 15 minutes
But we have one more lecture, one more lecture
Now ehm, eh 
Calm down, calm down
I'm gonna take one more question
I'm gonna take -
Are there any more questions?

Ah yeah - ah
I wanna know 
How can a ordinary busta like me 
You know, you know
...get in Break-A-Bitch College?

{Eightball:}
Not long ago I grew up as a youngster in this shit
When all I wanted to do is stick my dick up in a bitch
That dope made my ends, and my ends bought me weed
And all I wanted to see was them young bitches on they knees
Uncle Sam, damn, can I get a job, see
I don't wanna sell this dope, and nope, I don't wanna get out and rob
Today I was coolin like I usually do
I met this hoe after a show that wanted to chew me and screw
Now some busta-ass nigga woulda fucked the bitch
But at Break-A-Bitch College that's called trickin off your dick
On the corner ain't no pimps, real players are low-key
I'm on the verge of a splurge, settin up shop in Tennessee
Ain't no future for the lame, ain't no love in this game
Do you fuck them hoes and trust them hoes and love em with no shame?
9 times out of 10, trick nigga, if you do
Break-A-Bitch College got a scholarship just for you

Ah yes
Damn good class, damn good class
Wonderful graduates
I love em all, I love em all

Now class
Can you all join in with me
For our school alma mater
And let's sing it
I'm proud to be an alumni
From Break-A-College
I'm proud to be...

I remember the pussy but I don't remember her name G
Grab me Swisher cut it up and fill it with weed, hit that hoe
In the head, and tell her get out of my bed you damn freak
Hopped into the shower for an hour, it was hot as hell
Got dressed and ran a gold comb through my curls
Walkin out of the house slow, tellin that hoe come on let's go
First I crack up the music then, hit the switch on my six-four
Candy coated paint, got the bitches at the bus stop sick
But at the same time on my dick, thick
Beat a bitch quick I'm sick, full of Swishers and malt liquor
I'm a killa on them sticks, aggivated hallucinatin
Tryin to let go of my frustration
But some my luck, nigga gonna be a med patient
I gotta nine uzi AK, but that shit don't really matter

With bitches and prostitutes, pimps and killa thugs
Five-oh harrassin me, so Crime Boss is feelin slugs
A good guy gone bad, devious fuckin kid
Victim of ?, shit that my momma did
These dope beats comin up, I'm servin those clucker bitches

For dollars and sense, see I gotta have it goin on,

Eightball & MJG,"One nigga found dead in the bayou 
That's the beginning of this story that I'm telling you 
I was in the 9 tre smokin' a spliff on the strip 
Seen a little cutie with some bootie, stop to shoot the shit 
She was on my dick cause in the hood  I had a little rank 
She was the kind of ho tryin' to take a nigga for his bank 
But what she did not know  a nigga had a plan for that 
Take her out to dinner then knock that ass up in my Cadillac 
All of a sudden, my beeper started buzzin' on the side of me 
The code read 33, I knew it was MJG 
Step to the mobile phone, G was talkin' crazy 
This ho heard some niggas say them laws are out to get me 
That night, I was dumpin' that bitch in the ditch 
Did not know that I was doin' it in the presence of a snitch 
Got dope from the scenery, thinkin' I was scot-free 
And now, I'm ducki'n and dodgin' tryin' to keep it low-key 
Spliffed-out, ridin' in my hooptie on cloud 9 
Doin' about 50 when a nigga pass 1-Time 
Now they got a nigga faced-down on the sidewalk 
Talkin' all that punk ass rookie pig cop talk 
What was in my pocket, grabbin all my money and my beeper 
Ramblin' through my car, the pigs found my 9mm 
Now, I'm in the county callin' G to come and get me 
Wandering who is the snitch callin' these laws tryin' to sell me out 
Oh no! My mind is getting paranoid 
A nigga can't even trust his own homeboys 
As a result, I'm always alone 
except for some of the hoes I bone 
Most of the time, I watch the news while I get my smoke on 
Thousands after thousands on a lawyer who ain't doin' shit 
Locked up in this house a nigga 'bout to have a fuckin' fit 
Last night, I seen my face on the news G 
Some nigga who worked for me, slipped and lost an uzi 
Now, I'm on the run, livin' like a fugitive 
I thought to myself on the run ain't no way to live 
I thought I'd party hard and smoke and drank this century 
Now, I'm slowly dyin in this penetentery
No mercy, nigga",No Mercy
Eightball & MJG,"[ VERSE 1: 8Ball ]
Tell me what's goin on, damn, I need help to see
I have chains on my brain from the strain of the
Mental corruption eruptin through this industry
All I see is New York rappers back and forth on BET
See, I'm the first true southern funkadelic preacher
Drink a 'yac and smoke a blunt and watch it get deeper
But not so deep I have to perpetrate to gain respect
Instead of judgin me you need to get yourself in check
And I'm not gonna be the want to-be you want to see
Oh no, I cannot sell my soul

[ VERSE 2: MJG ]
MJG for the Nine-Fo, what's it gonna be?
Another year for the p-i-m-p in the street
Yes, it's me, the one who clocks when it's time to get explicit
It's comin from the truth when I kick it
So dear critic, you thinkin on terms of how it needs to be
I'm tellin you how it is and what I has to live and what I got to give
To the ears of the ones who want to listen
Some don't understand,, so they really don't know what they're missin
Hard times made hard heads in the South
You get respect bein real, no sell-out

[ VERSE 3: 8Ball ]
In '93 I was rappin about my curls and my Cadillac
The pimp blast, takin you fast, smokin grass and all that
Players got the message, busters didn't attempt to listen
Thinkin that we was talkin about that on-the-corner fake pimpin
Hell yeah, I'm that player from the underground
All-black assassin from the neighborhood of Orange Mound
They don't understand, why, they being society
The white people who run this nation got somethin against me
Me bein a young black male with an education
Teachin this pimpin, so the blacks will one day rule this nation
But every day another brother tries to kill me
Jack me because of the poverty in communities
Where you either have to sell crack or jack, man
What I'm tryin to stress to you is, don't step to the fat man
Because today I'm rappin, rockin shows and pullin hoes
But tomorrow I might be on the cut slingin dope
See, in the studio I'm killin fools vocally
But if it came down to it, I could do it silently
Fuck the President, the media can quote me
Listen to them lyrics, fool, I ain't sellin out, gee

[ VERSE 4: MJG ]
You gotta be hard in this business, ain't no suckers, ain't no sell-outs
It's the way that you go in it, that's the way you gonna go out
First of all: never break up with them hustlers that you started with
Long as this happens you and your click won't accomplish sh...
Should've thought about it real hard
Now how could any group that's meant to be together be apart?
And if you start with a strong mind, think with a strong mind
be	-you-s-i-n-e-ss time
I'm in the lab, chiefin hay, comin up with gold
Pimp mobile, hit the reel, let the platinum roll
See, I was taught, not the easy, but the hard way
Hustle after hustle after hustle each and every day
I gotta stay down to earth, cause I'm from Orange Mound
See, that's my hood, understood in the M-Town
Memphis-bound players, pimp type, black, strong, young 
Level-headed Tennesseee, hustlers got it goin on
Bad to the bone when I roam through the area
Carry a, automatic weapon for my burial
When it's all over what it is and what it's all about?
Stay true to your homies and your music, no sell-out",No Sellout
Eightball & MJG,"They told me to come clever, whatever
It don't make, it's on you
So I be who I be, and do what I gotta do
I'm one of the few, the proud and the pimpish
In this business I be the swiftest when I kick this
As if you didn't know it's Thorough from that Suave Camp
Best Vemp chimped, or get licked like a mail stamp
Amps and beats, technics is what I come with,
Gangsta's and pimps and balla's is who I fuck with

FUCK nobody safe when I see demons in tha mirror
Wicked as fuck feeling like a Murder & Killa
Witness I'm on the defense like Johnny Cochran
NOW GIVE UP YO THANGS MISTA, before this glock hit the proper spot
Blocks on phones, they won't leave they homes, peeping through cracks
'Cause blacks be coming back with all that past crap
Strap on your bullit proof vest and combat boots 
It's nigga nigga day
And this time we go come on you, 
Baby blue disguise that's wise, 
Made me loose my 9-5 got myself a 4-5 I'm,
Aimless spraying not playing with their vertabrates

So many niggaz must come wicked

9 witnesses reported all the shit the recalled
Everlasting, blasting, niggaz running fast when

I be the holder of the gat therefore it shall not run
A psychic couldnt see such a feature for my momma's son

Fake trick breaker, Tennessee earthquaker
Shaking grounds when I'm walking smoking fat onion
I get lit, and beat the shit out of Paul Bunyon
Fightin, Clash of the Titans on your dial
I'm gettin blitzed stickin on my tootsie doggystyle
Word G, you heard me
The wicked bitch served
Now I'm playing soccer, gotta kick'em to da curb G
But she's not with it, put a spell on the fat mack
I hate stikin hoe's but I can't help but to go back
I sound like a fiend, everytime is the last time
Could this be reality or all in my mind?

Spill 9's like fluid, do it like some G's
They know me from Columbian streets to Portugeese
(nigga how you figga)
I got mo scratch than flea's
I got mo gat's than these
High powered sour nigga's
Steady slangin crack to fiend's
At ease, take a look at some black G's
Scopin the president, takin over residents like black kings
Stack G's with phat key's
Rats ease on your properties poppin me for my black jeans

I had a cracker on my scope and my finger still itchin
Visions of killing and then the strap start spittin, hittin
The prez, plottin payback on the devil 
A rebel and a mason is what why'all snakes facing
Chasing traders with my data cause I hata should be corpe
And peep game when it's being taught, or to picture this of us lyricists

Spit the gift and got fam like Gotti

Breakfast being served by a hoe that look like Genie
She press my every wish and keeps a tight ass bikini tini 
Tiny as a Barbie Doll summer set
She all up in my house and I still ain't hit that pussy yet 
I gives props to my butler, cause he know
That I know on the downlow he's a chiefin muthafucka for ya
Now as I flips through the calendar I spots the winter 
If it ain't 3 mo freaky hoes want to have dinner
But I can't do it cause my schedule just to tight
I just phoned, Quincy Jones said he needs my help tonight
He wanted me to pick the strong from the wimps
Them playa's with the limps to make a song called We Are The Pimps 
I call's Ball, Ball calls the crew
We met up at the Penthouse, and Paris Round 2

Eightball & MJG,"Anyway it doesn't matter much how you feel 
You know what you got to do I'm here to do it  
How about you?  

Our age five years old 
We were young bucks 
Scrubbin' each others backs in the bathtub 
Babysitter would send you to bed 
But she would make me stay up 
So she could give the young playa some viscious head uh 
Early symptoms of 
Time of nightway 
Gigantic factor from the 
Caukenis bitch tamer 
Some had it all though 
But less unfortunate 
You had an alloy spoke Mongoose 
And I had a Huffy 
You owned a green machine 
Three different lunch pails 
I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails 
We grew up in the church together nigga 
Sunday school 
Now I heard you off into jackin' nigga 
That ain't even cool 
I used to be conned, racked, fucked around
And ripped bad 
Barking up on the wrong tree 
Talking about runnin' up in my past 
Niggas have hateful thoughts 
But they stop me from strivin' 
Suckas be shakin' salt 
All in his gameful so find 
Some fools be gettin' crossed 
Victims of 40-ness 
Man all that drama you come with 
I swear you on some shit 
Whether it's morphine or cocaine 
Doja or dog food 
They had these marks for Tre and Max 
Fuckin' off my high breakin' rules 
You got ya P's mixed up 
You ain't no pimp 
You's a forty 
I spit for major mix 
While you make tapes for ya homie 
And then you work up tha nerve 
To speak fair words 
The pimp, a traitor, we instigators 
That's why I wrote this verse 
For every youngster with his mind on his meal 
Young playa just chill 
And take a look at what these fakers call real 
Nigga 
I trust no man, 
'Cause man will let you down every time 
That's why I take it upon myself to thank god in every rhyme 
'Cause I've seen better times 
And I've seen worser days 
When some of my so called friends 
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say 
I quench my thirst today 
With righteous thoughts of mine 
'Cause righteous thought of mine will leave mark ass niggas far behind 
I seen it every time 
They come and go 
That's why I drop to my knees 
And ask god to distinguish friend from foe 
And what do you know 
By the time morning comes I can see the light 
And then I'm thanking god once again for making everything all right 
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene 
Countin' greens 
Straight from H-town to New Orleans 
New human beings puttin' it down like a mic or not 
Replace the slot open up shop 
We 'bout to make it hot 
Stop 
With ya devilish doins 
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin 
Friend or foe, you just will never know 
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold 
Playa hatin' is everywhere I go 
Friend or foe you just will never know 
Listen 
I'm tryin' to tell you my nigga to watch cha back 
And trust few 
Cause ain't no nigga goin' watch ya back for you like you 
When someone is broke and down and out without no clout it's rough 
At least you know who you can and who you cannot trust 
See let me explain myself and clear up the point I'm tryin to make 
Don't want no bustas around me 
Playa hatin' or actin' fake 
Don't ever be wantin' nobody to get to close 
I don't know if it's effects of 
From the marijuana that got me more than trippin'
See nowadays tha nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot 
But if my loot was gone would I be all alone? 
See, my partners who used to ride with me 
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes 
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll? 
Maybe they will, maybe they won't 
Who is to say what a nigga will do 
Who is to say if you help someone it's guaranteed that they'll help 
You 
See what I'm sayin', listen to me and see if you can dig this 
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people receive ends 
Now all of a sudden I'm actin' funny because my moneys loaned 
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home 
But I'm not tellin' a nigga nothin' you don't already know 
Personal business, you got to watch who you friends is 
I'm thinking about hard times 
Freeing my mind 
Who in the fuck goin' be my crutch? 
Holdin' me up, helpin' me out 
Makin' sure that I stay in touch 
Where do I sleep, who do I turn to? 
When I be low on my cash 
Who am I down with when fifty niggas be talkin' bout kickin' my ass? 
Who is my friends who is my foes? 
Who do I ask, when I want to know 
Somethin' about somethin' but I don't know nothin' 
My ignorance be keepin' me out in the cold 
Who do I call when I'm in need of a ride? 
In somebody elses car 
How do I get from point A to be	 if be is just to far? 
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone? 
Who's goin' to give me the permission to make a decision 
To come up in they house and live 
When will I drive a BMer takin' my clothes to the cleaner 
How can I know 
Will I forever be payin' my dues, will I forever be singing the blues? 
Where will I find a shoulder when I be wantin' to lean 
Know what I mean? 
When I be needin' some justification 
Stuck in the fuckin' same location 
Who is the friend that is helpin' me? 
Who is the busta that's hurtin' me? 
Who can I trust? 
Will you be there when the goin' is tough? 
Will I be hangin' with dick in the dust? 
Who want to share my load when it's too heavy to carry? 
Or will I go crazy pullin' the load alone? 
Constantly gettin' my hustle on 
When will I finally see, kinda suspect 
Or even actually know 
Who is my real friend thick and the thin? 
And who in the fuck is the foe? 
Friend or foe, you just will never know 
Who can you trust, in a world that's oh so cold 
Playa hatin' is everywhere I go

Young womans back then I take her
Home
The thrill is gone
I gotta jet, the set
Before I get my ass in some mess
Sippin hennesey, till I finish the whole cup of the cognac
Catchin contacts, put the blunts back
Supa fly mista goldy, 
Its getting oldy
So label me a young goody
Straight out the hoody
I'm able to lay my game down
In a single bound
Then while I'm in the same town
Smokin out on the pound
As I'm keepin an eye for tight hoe's, while I creep, through the streets
While you sleep put them D's on my Jeep, peep this
A hundred and ten percent, physical fitness
I lay the type of pipe that put the plumber out-a-business
Who is this, manipulata
Demonstrata
Pimp shit, top rata
Trick hata
Bustas can't comprehend, but then again
They never could, to busy fuckin off in the neighborhood
I'm a keep pimpin rhymes
I'm outta my pimpin mind
I'm here to say that I'm
A pimp in my own rhyme

I got to have you
But what will this lead to
Will it just be me and you
Tell me, you know I want you
Tell me how you feel

I'll be obliged if you step outside
Because my ride is awaiting our date and
Of steak and a night cap
We mating, awaking
By smells of perfume that I inhale
And then tell how well we raise hell on the dizzell
Satin sheets
Heat from your feet keep me warm
The mood is perfected by sounds from the storm
You came stronger, I lasted longer
Than I've ever lasted, your mouth was fantastic
The fuck test, you passed it
The way you made a nigga laugh, I had to getcha
And when I saw that ass pass, I had to hit cha
Ya making me fight against my will, what must I do
Would ya kill for me, ya if my life in danger too
Even steal for me, ya if that shit belongs to you
Then feel for me, ya if the way you act is true
Who knows, fine clothes
Lexus doors you'll be closing, when you become one of the chosen
Hoes in different places, different faces
Different cases, got me tied like shoe laces
No mistake this MJG, you ain't gotta be
Constantly trying to shoot that P, claiming that you ain't heard of me
Keeping it real, let me know how you feel when we communicate
We'll be straight, if you express your mind
Instead of referring away, some who can't do it
Lose women, but nigga like me used to it

Lick me, don't be afraid of what your friends say
Rappers get dat ass, then be outta here like yesterday
But not tonight, you look so tight
It feels so right, this indo got me perving
Let's go hop in my Suburban
And ride til we get to where you want to be, no matter how far
Just call me Oball baby, to me your the superstar
Ask me time and time again why did I choose you
Do I wanna be your man or just misuse you
I hear your partners dissing
When they think I ain't listening
Them hoes just be wishing
They could be in yo position
With me in luxury
I got to be everyday
Chief in hey would something stout wearing lingerie
Let's hit the hotel
Get a suite
An order something to eat
Tell me things about you
I'll tell you things about me
Then out the blue I'll be carressing you, undressing you
You start doing all shit you said you'd never do
Lustin busting all out of my boxer drawers
Fingers dripping slipping in an out in an out
Constantly telling me the things you don't do
Yet you do it like a pro and think I don't know
But I do that's why I'm here with you and you know this
Slip on the latex, and dive in

The name of the game is get no sleep
Mash on, niggas, and always roll deep
Non stop hustle means all profits double
Young nigga tryin' to see rocks like Barney Rubble

Vampire, circulate when the moon rise
Do dirt when most people got closed eyes
Rollin', livin' off garbage and scraps
Niggas wouldn't even fuck with me if I had rap

Thinkin' 'bout that man, that's just another trap
Another nigga dead from another nigga's strap
Space aging every thought and everything I write
Livin' for today, a nigga might die tonight

Just because a nigga think I'm a celebrity
They want to rob and jack and try to bury me
Forced entry embedded in my memory
Fightin' sleep like Freddie Kruger tryin' to get me

In the midst, I wanna see it, not hear about it
If a nigga wanna see it, gotta be about it
Can't do without it, sayin', till my life end
Every night, they like, ""Catch me up again""

You say, like daylight, it's gonna catch me up again
(Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again)
Some people like gettin' up when I'm just gettin' in
(It's gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again)

I look up, I can't see the forest full of trees
Destined to make it through, regardless of the seas
Of evil that been planted, sproutin' concrete walls
So everybody has stained deals
After all, you playin wrong

Now you havin' to climb so you can make it
Got the whole roll block, and too thick for you to break it
Don't fake it, you know it's kinda hard to try to shake it
The camel's tellin' you to come on, you had to cake it

Mr. Mistake It, Mr. Do Nothing, uncle, give me something
You mouth tellin' me, love, but I ain't feelin' none, stealin' some
Same positions I've been facin' for years
Now I'm about to put some steak in this meal, inflatin' my bills

Excusin' you hoes who want fame
Using you hoes for one thang
Fuck how you changed, bitch
It's funny why you stayed around
And patience how you laid me down
Now you expectin' the crown

I'm full time, respectin' the game
Checkin' out the girls in change
A turd in the hand is far worse than a turd in commode
Let that shit float on, 'cause that shit get old

It seems that daylight is gonna catch me up again

Eightball and MJG, been ten toes down in this game 
Since we were two young playas in a one-horse town 
Then hopped to a muthafuckin' grasshopper 
Nigga, my life would have been done got cut off
If my dues weren't paid

It's a thinnin' line between wrong and right 
Trapped in a trap till the mornin' light 
Ghetto ain't left me no choices; I had to fight 
My mama and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made 
Niggas dead, niggas gone; I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played 
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

In the middle of doin' crime; it never stopped me from writin' rhymes 
It never stopped me from playin' music
God, but it didn't mean I had to use it 
It was obvious: I had to give up the streets for the beats 
Not knowin', but havin' faith on just how long that it would be 
Before I made it, before somebody picked up my tape and played it 
With a remark like, ""Hey, played that instrumental, you cat's got potential."" 
In the process of doing talent shows, parties, and mix tapes 
We even put it down on some of our homeboys jail release dates 
I can remember in the past closin' down at fast foods 
Strictly stickin' to my dreams, but feelin' like I'd be the last dude 
Who can make it in this rap; I thought that they ain't gon' see me in Memphis 
It was like a time they looked over Tennessee
And didn't know hip-hop was in us
To all my vets in the game, I got love; stay on your toes 
'Cause back in the days, I used to use your 4-5 instrumental to do my shows 
And, look, I was seventeen when I signed my first contract 
And about eighteen and a half when I signed my worst contract; we hurt from that 
And till this day they still distributin' our first tape 
Before Comin' Out Hard, now can you feel it? 
Be humble and patient with whatever you should choose 
'Cause to get to where I am right now, I done paid my dues

It's a thinnin' line between wrong and right

Ghetto ain't left me no choices; I had to fight 
My mama and daddy was too young to raise me right

Niggas dead, niggas gone; I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played 
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

A c-note for a concert; I know that sounds preposterous 
Nigga, we didn't have a pot to piss 
So we got on stage, and we rocked the bitch
Fuck the cheese; I love to see my niggas in the front row 
Get buck wild, start a fight; the police make a nigga stop the show 
Niggas all in the parkin' lot, bustin' shots, fuckin' with hos 
Box Chevy with the spokes and vogues
Niggas didn't know shit about a twenty inch Mo-Mo 
Hard head, young nigga don't believe that shit till I see that shit 
See them heavyweight niggas; one day, I'm gonna be that shit

Pimp some hos and snorted a little coke, but, uh 
I'm space again, and we'll forever be

Turn the page from then to now, and we still grindin'
Small clubs and small towns think they bouncin', and we find them 
Put them on the guest list, make them pump their fist and get buck to this 
Make one of them weed smokin', gangsta bitches get fucked to this 
Expand, give all my true fans what they demand 
Do my part again and, uh, come out hard again, and, uh
Keep space again, and we'll forever be

Gone off of 'lucigens, clownin' in the big Benz

So get up, and get your mothafuckin' hands up 

Throw your hands in the smoke, cause there's smoke in the air 
Get close to me, I'll contact your ass like a flare 
As you stare, nigga you gonna come to term with what you see 
A primitive example of the shit you want to be 
And I ain't gonna be 
Persuaded, by blue sueded shoe wearin' 
Slick gun bitches, who get paid quick 
Trick niggaz stop all of that trickin' and shit 
If she come with a price tag, fuck that bitch 
Why should you switch? 
From one hoe, and love 'em all 
Cause she could suck the flavor out a dick? 
Hell nah 
One thing you gotta know about a woman 
Big dicks will be the reason for some shit known to get that pussy comin' 
Now who I be, before the G, MJ

But have a nice day

Riding down the strip on a trip in my 'Ham sammich
Started this shit and I'm gon' finish yes I am dammit
We gonna slam it down like to hit it, here its shitted
Here its time for them niggas in Memphis, Tenn to get deep within it
How deep? shit the devil stay right down the street
and why you mad? the rebels tied a brother by his feet
for what, for what I don't know they tied him to a pickup truck
then posted up and down like they didn't really give a fuck
I get rid of bigots with bad racial equalities
bust back at KKK's who try to follow me
these hollowties saving my ass in crucial situations
any other tactics I need, I use imagination
I'm ten steps ahead of your ass type of nigga
shit that I already know you try to figure
give up, put your ship up, don't try to sail
don't you see we got this shit built up, can't pry a nail
in my foundation my sound making too many bump all out the trunk
get crunk and blow blunts and buck jump
ain't no luck chump we come intentional with this dope shit
using a pen or a pencil back when I wrote this
space age, feel it perculatin' but all this hurt and hatin'
still keep on bringing people back to old situations
I change the stations but they playing the same list
we started the shit and we gon' finish the shit

Mental battlescars polluting my cranium
watered down fake niggas I'm draining 'em and training 'em
Claiming them Suave House niggas to the dirt bitch
cross the family and you gon' find yourself gettin hurt, bitch
peices all in a nigga mind it ain't reality
fuck reconciliation, niggas don't want no unity
born dyin every minute death is closer to me
its like I'm in a movie, except I'm feeling everything
pain when another motherfucker try to touch me
anger when a petty player faker try to fuck me
8-be	-A-double L, fat M-A-see
nice with a mic and I don't think you want to fuck with me
love head doctors and I don't mean a psyciatrist
bitches with that lip grip tighter than a gorilla fist
pimp shit, when is everybody gonna learn
Pimps and gangstas make the universe turn
poverty with the right amount of hustle turns to riches
but wrong situations turn hard niggas to bitches
I was born in the war zone fought for everything I got
learned about my hustle, nigga worked and made the shit hot
hoes started jockin niggas, boppin like they bitches too
other niggas mad cause they only sold a tape or two
fuck what you heard nigga fuck who you be
suave got the hookup cause suave got the cheese nigga

Ay dawg, check this out (uh)
Peep this..
I met this lil' chick the other day (yea)
Talkin 'bout some super stout
Super stout, she put it on ya boy
Yea I promise ya, she put it on ya boy

[Eightball]
It all started in the mall
She said ""Hey, ain't you Eightball?""
I said ""I'll be whoever you want me to be""
She was fine like a supermodel, Naomi
Out to the truck me and this ho bounced
Thirty minutes later we was on my couch
Remy, X.O. and green sticky weed
She hit it like a pro, didn't choke, didn't heave
We talked for a minute, you know how shit go
Two people get close and they jump off bro
I kissed her on the back of the neck, she got wild
Beggin me to hit it doggie style
Long story short, shorty got that fire
If I tricked off, I'd trick it on her
She said she got a man, but he ain't shit
He give her everythang but love and good dick
Time went on, we kept in contact right
But never really hooked up, and never got tight
I wish I coulda got with her one more time
Then maybe, I woulda never wrote this rhyme

[Hook - Eightball] 2x
She's always on my mind - I want to be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her
She's always on my mind - I want to be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her

[MJG]
She was 5'6, redbone and lye chick
Ain't no way she could disguise it
When her eyes hit, my eyes, it was a trance in it
Only thang that I was thinkin was in her pants
She was holdin my wood with a tight fist
I whispered, into her ear ""I know you like this""
She said ""I'm ridin wit'chu"" Damn right bitch!
I'm a pimp and I ain't got all night shit
I got a reserve ticket for a ho want to kick it
Get down lick it, 'cause I'm feelin you down wit it
She was certified, equipped with pussy grip
I ain't buyin a bitch a room, I'll fuck her off in my whip
Feel my rib-tipped, that triple bit Trojan
Fo' den hunnie, it's up in ho land
Up to the windowsill, knockin it off
Then I stuck it in your grill, I'll beat it up
Seein as how you, treated me - Knowin that I was pimpin
Before I understood what it meant, I broke women
MJG, breakin 'em in - mentally and physically
Mind, body, and money - shimmy shimmy

[Chorus] 2x

[MJG]
She was always right there, on the tip of my mind
Makin me look at other women blind
Every motherfuckin time I find myself lookin for a phone number
I'm gone, I'm alone, I want that women
When I see her, I'ma let her know how I feel about her
Be a pimp tight, real nigga with skills outta town
Lookin for the one that got me hypnotized
Hips and thighs, glimpsin eyes, trippin now
Go'on the same, ready to knock it off friend
When she admit it's time, I'm lock it in
Head straight to the hood, and snatch a six-pack
Tell the folks that I'm with, that I'ma get back
I think her name was uhh.. shit I can't remember
But I know she was a cute, lil', stout tender
Ready to put it down, whether rain or shine
She always, always, always..

[Chorus] 4x

[MJG whispering] 4x
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind

Nigga I clown fo' mine

If necessary pull shit and bust a round fo' mine
You know my sound design
For niggaz street encline
Southern niggas on tha grind
Shine and recline
I stay hard like fake tits
Dig like ice-picks
Disrespect the 'Slab' and yo wig I might split
You hide we find you
Creep up from behind you
And leave you with some heat that will always remind you

Because of that big trigget
You niggaz need to quit givin cheese out
You probably wear your knee's out
Yo' wife wanna leave out
But when she pull them keys out
A bunch of that please baby please
What it be'z bout
But what we be'z bout is big body 
When we roll up in ya after party
Been smokin wait but hold up, stop, don't tell nobody
Stage holda, mic controller, money gripper
Toe tipper, nigga big time hoe flipper

When I roll bitches
Lyrical lethal like it was dope hard Moonshine
Niggaz playin like cartoon time
He get tucked in the dark room time
To a busta who done died, why?
All because he tried
What? To tell the truth about some shit 
But that nigga lied
Talkin about he don't bump us in his ride 
Nigga FUCK you
And the horse you rode on too
You can't fuck with me
Unless you stressed to be an absentee perminately

[ Eightball ]
I don't bard no nigga talkin bout what he got
Until you show me somethin nigga you just talkin a lot
Niggaz love to start shit
Poppin that hard shit
Catch them alone and they convert to a broad quik
Where them niggaz at?
Who you said got yo back dawg?
[ Ball they all fake, they puttin on a act dawg ]
Yeah you niggaz be trippin thinkin shit is sweet dawg
We gon' keep it raw until all my niggaz eat dawg

I'm certified in takin bitces to school nigga
The rule is for MJG to stack paper
And fuck bitch niggaz up when they act hata

[ Eightball ]
Big ball, MJG
We do it for the streets
For them niggaz and them bitches tryna get up on they feet
Haters get a hollow tip deep off in they fo'head
All over some punk shit that bitch shouldn't have neva said

In all of the preferred sections
Potent elections fo' big playaz and bitches sexin

",Collard Greens
Eightball & MJG,"Eightball, the one you know from bustin' flows
Bout that real shit and bout these shady ass hoes
I hit the block when I was 12 and I ain't never leavin'
Kept a grip and kept on tippin' right through drought season
Never been a hater even at my lowest level
Some niggaz get some change and sell they soul to the Devil
I'm drinkin' Dom, man I'm chiefin' on some green sticky
Space Age Pimpin' and my real niggaz rollin' with me
Glocks and K's and Rugers with the rubber grip
Got 'Tel two-way transmittin' on my hip
Keep it real with them niggaz that be real with me
Orange Mile forever reppin' Memphis, Tennessee - MJG

Him and me, me and him, that's how we rolled
Over ten million records sold, Platinum and Gold
We broke the mold, ain't no duplicatin' the two
Who makin' hit shit in clutch situations
And demonstratin' the real quality of a team which consists of
Eightball & MJG, we do this shit 'cause it feel good
First of all, we sacrificed for it
But afford it, then motherfuckers sheist for it
In the jungle of concrete just within one beat
Of the heart you can be taken apart
Ain't no regret but scars from my battlin' hard tactics
I think I'll roll with the paper, you can keep the plastic

[Chorus]
I know you niggaz got doe
I saw you in them videos
I know you niggaz stay high
I saw you at the club right?
I know you niggaz keep hoes
I saw you with them freak hoes
I know you niggaz got it made
I saw you on the front page

I've seen a lot of niggaz come and go
Saw some shit fall and seen a lot of shit grow
Money here, money gone like a magic trick
Real hustlers hustle with or without that shit
I get my grind on daily 'cause I wanna see
Me and my niggaz gettin' paid 'til we elderly
And it ain't hard if we all put that work in
Keep it twerkin 'til they close the fuckin' curtains
We all dream and we all have fantasies
Every nigga wanna buy that house for mama G
But life is like a roll of the dice, right
Sometimes you win and sometimes you just might
Lose it all, fucked up sick and don't know what to do
That's when you find out who really down to bust for you
I rock and roll from my heart and let my soul glow
And don't worry about what a nigga think he know, ya know?

[Chorus]

Nothin' but 24/7 - 365
Eleven to eleven I be off in the fire
Of this revolution, the solution is what I'm spittin'
Fat stacks of green backs is what I'm gettin'
Jaw bones and microphones, that's what I'm hittin'
I'm hangin' on the edge of the cliff with no mittens
Thick flickin', chrome smokin', preferred potion
Man will never touch my flow, deep as the ocean
When you go down too far and you - can't seem to light
Best to look out for that pressure baby, it bust pipes
I got too much fight - in my heart, body, my insight
Is magnifyed a thousand times, more than the average guys
My status lies right before you with no disguise
The black mack is here to step up and so I rise
My shit has gone way past cold, it's freeze dry
One brain can't do what I do, you need five

Eightball & MJG,"(Word Up)

(MJG)
You might not know it but you
You gotta say it baby
The company you keep
It change daily baby
How did you get the Mercedes and the Escalade lately
How come its been trouble in the places you stayed lately
The black cat affair
A broken mirror
Two steps up under the ladder would bring me near her
To good luck that fucking with you
You make the sun rain
The same moment you left
that's when the fun came

(Eightball)
Always bumping like a bad lady ho quit that
Straight up ask a nigga to pay when he want to hit that
Always want to drank my Hennessey
And smoke weed
Take you out to see a movie
Hoe please
If i ain't got to get a room i don't get one
I could hit you in the car and it'll be just as fun
There's six lil letters that describe you hoe
I could sing it much better baby this is how it goes

Chorus: Repeat 2x
The J the A the N the K the I the E
What that spell
Jankie (word up)
Bitch why you so jankie (word up)

(MJG)
Wussup sneaky nigga
How come you running yo mouth
And talking about bout some shit that really you don't even know bout
The way i see it you a slick instigata
You thank you low key but you steamin like hot potatoe
In the middle of the fuckin day in Jamaica
Chocolate strawberry or vanilla couldn't shake a
Jankie ass nigga like you
You built with fly paper
Leave shit around you and its gone good-bye later

(Eightball)
Always got your hand stuck out askin for shit
Instead of working you be begging trying to get rich quick
Faking acting like you interested just 2 hang around
Tell a nigga you a part of this and know you ain't down
you lying trying 2 hang tryin 2 pull you some hoes
Tellin them about the famous niggas that you know
you worst than the bitch you need 2 slow down dog
For niggas like you me and G made this song

Chrous (2x)

(MJG)
When you was six years old you was hit
Everytime they played the damn game and shit

(Eightball)
want to hang so everybody know your name and shit
you's a jankie mothafucka if I seen one trick

(MJG)
I seen one to
When lookin at you
You fit the definition
The height the body size yep the full description

(Eightball)
Please nigga get you head on straight and stop trippin
Gotta brag and stunt for you to get a little attention

(MJG)
Plus I mention you know you be frequently big cappin
And anything that a bitch want you give rapid

(Eightball)
that's why hoes beg and broke and ain't shit
Gotta lay up under niggas and cook and suck dick

(MJG)
Not clean for a nigga and fix my truck bitch
But everythang that you do still ain't enough shit

This for niggas and hoes
This for all of those
If you know somebody jankie this how the song goes

Eightball & MJG,"[Chorus: x8]
Pimp hard, pimp harder

Big plush Cadillac seats holding me up
Bitches hatin' 'cause I'm always doing big boy stuff
Would will ill be grippin' in my big boy truck
Back then at the club gettin' this big boy sucked
Eightball, Mjg you know we can't be touched
If its 'bout Hennessy and weed you can link it to us
If I feel you disrespectin' Ima cock it and bust
And MJG gon be right with me if that eight ain't enough

If Eight ain't enough 
Don't worry I got eight in the clip
Eight for them hard looks
And eight for that lip
It was unnecessary
That sort of punishment was less than very ugly
Which was fucked up 
You wanted this you lucked up then
Oh well  some more shit I'm stuck up in 
Hey lets squash it  
Go sweep the dust up then 
Drink a shot 
I got a bitch you could drive a truck up in 
MJG pimp tight! And I got em

[Chorus: x8]

We handle this shit like a pimp should
I fuck with them niggaz who run the hood
From the south to the east coast to the west
I be puffin on that shit that gon be burnin' in yo chest
See them hoes want a nigga who got bread
These niggaz want a bitch you got that fire head
And all I want is weed and money
And mo' money
The streets don't respect a nigga with no money

Ya poor dummy  
You should be spendin' ya ho money
When she offered you some 
You probably tell her ""no honey""
You to slow sonny
What I'm spittin' gon make you know somethin'
So the next time instead of just talking 
You could show something
And most hoes is like casinos 
Pistol blow somethin'
So anytime a bitch approach me 
I see some dope coming
My main focus is tricks who be out ho huntin'
But they don't get that pussy for free
I make em owe somethin'

[Chorus: x8]

I like them yellow thick women giving love to me
Hugs and kisses disrespecting bitches 'cause of me
Always want to sex with me no matter where we be
All her friends do my friends and they do it for free
Okay we smoke with them hoes and get em something to eat
But any real nigga will just to drill baby
Pimp hard or pimp harder for the millennium
That paper out here for ya Ima get me some

Hit a liquid some
Tell my bitch to quick get the gun
We got some shit to run so shut up and cut off the grits they done
I want you up on your feet until they blitz the song
Bitch you understand what I'm sayin'
I'm the official one
Mjg I pimp strong until the reasons gone
Until it ain't no hojack left to spring the season on 
The niggaz who violated they still bleedin' on
I be packs and shit sacks and the leavings on

[Chorus: x16]",Pimp Hard
Eightball & MJG,"[MJG]
You can count on this pimpin', I got them Budweiser horse women
Black mack, make a rookie divorce pimpin'
I didn't read about it, I was born with it and exercised
First I came with a game plan (what) next I tried it
Now what you know about that money in her snatch
When she promised you that she was givin' you the whole stack
Can't be no lover slash pimp nigga, or a player slash good boy
You either be real or Mr. Goodjoy
Cause ain't no such thing as love at first sight
But it's a such thing that you was on them drugs the first night
It's mandatory for me to appeal to the women
Keep it real with the women, but let them tricks deal with the women
And when you in the field with them women
Watch 'em, they start talkin' love shit stop 'em
Cause ain't no hoe supposed to have no emotions
Her job is to keep a trick broken and hopeless

No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch

I bust nuts on the face of slut hoes
And hang at the club with dope dealers and cutthroats
Never been one of them niggaz that would save a hoe
Bitch you know the score, you can get your shit and hit the door
Never slippin', you trippin' if you think you pimpin'
Hoes comin' up if they in front of you strippin'
Trickin', that pussy wet lookin' finger lickin'
Tradin' big faces hopin' you can stick your dick in
And she will do whatever for a dollar bill
Suck dick and lick clit on them X pills
High heels and big thighs make a dick ride
Make a nigga spend a grip and think of plenty lies
Lookin' deep in your eyes and don't mean none of it
I got the pie, you got to work if you want some of this
Where you from bitch, don't nothin' come easily
I got somethin' for you if you got somethin' for me

For four and a quarter you can get a hoe and a order
A Barbie doll bitch or a hoe from across the border
A loose bitch, a tight bitch, whatever you like
With the certain group of paint brushin' bitches consider priceless
Nut drinkers, butt spankers, dominatrix
Most ain't really with that rough shit but some can take it
One hundred percent born and bred, pimp type
Hoes make my money off of goin' to bed

[Eightball]
Givin' head, hookin' niggaz like a cigarette
Niggaz plea and pay fees, just to get a hit
Skin tight, with no hair so you can see the clit
White hoes, black hoes and hoes that Hispanic
Pierced tongue feel good when she workin' wood
Platinum Visa, PIN numbers and them check books
Turn it in, help a nigga get a new Benz
Turn out your friend, let me be both of y'all man

Chillin' with these chick
Named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers
To spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind
My repratoir is Menage Trois
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stopping this

I said it before
I never the ladiez hyptonize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
'Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Make the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Cause I came too far
For me to be bouswar
It's a Bently to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me

We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit
My aim is winning
Got asian women
That'll change my linen
After I done blazed and hit em
But I just wanna rock wit you
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do
If it's possible
Cause I ain't trying to stop you boo

Come and dance with me",Baby Girl
Eightball & MJG,"And it's hard
Hard

Yea yea sittin' looking out my window the streets I see ain't pretty
Sometimes I wonder if I was born rich with plenty
Money, and everyday was sunny didn't no rain fall
Life was beautiful like the colors of a rainbow
Would I be the same prim row all my niggas know
If I didn't have to learn to beat them streets and get that dough
What if I never witnessed killings with my own two eyes
Bussin' leave they own folks layin' in the street to die
Life without respective if every second I was shakin'
Cause I injected dope in my veins
Divide and strain could I describe pain could I
Describe livin' life without desire mayne
Could I survive if I couldn't rap or entertain alive
And free you can't beat it
Who can you blame my world is like a picture and the frame
The picture might change but the frame stays the same

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

What if you was on the other end of the bullet
When a killer wanna pull it would it seem like
The light flash in front of your face
Or would you run real slow like I ran in my dream like
Just the other day I tried to be a hero but it wasn't the side of me
Or maybe it just wasn't the time to be but if the shoe had to fit then I would be
Ahead of the game playin' the part I bring it all into the light from out of the dark
I hit the bat into the ball and out of the park
And live with the question alone that's meddlin' hard
What if you had to live under the bridge and do anything just to feed your kids
Think about that and the deed you did the first thing that impress me kid
Oh yes you did and I ain't even tryna choke your chain or pull your leg
And I ain't even tryna fuck with your head and I ain't even tryna sweat this shit
Just spit these messages cause I'm blessed with it
What if you had the chance to be able to switch hands with me or anyone you see
And if you really wanna take it deep this shit not quanum to me
For one and each and each and all for the sci-fi mat more religious superstitious
Politicious and all the listeners with us this shit be cold as Christmas
So put your head to the sky say a prayer for the sick and the old the young and the weak
For the bombs and the single moms with six kids askin' for something to eat

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And when you get up they seem to hold you down
Down to the ground gotta stay focused with your eyes opened wide
See the sun rise I keep my hands on the steering wheel when I'm creepin' up 75
(woo woo woo) changing lanes on the regular talkin' on my cellular fast
Watching cause they wanna take me away
I'm just trying to feed my babies face
But I'm just hustling I'm waiting on tomorrow

Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And the only way is to keep your head on right
Oh yea",Confessions

Meat market, chop haters up who start shit
M.J.G., rippin' holes in body guards
Outta line, polices and boys who think they body hard
And when the party started, I thought we was all chillin'
I figured that everybody be leavin' here all livin
You standin' to close partna, you askin' too much baby
You need to get way from round me, before our clique goin' crazy

They many niggaz come round, talkin' bout
They hot, but they not, fuckin' with fat boy and MJ
Nigga we the truth, holla at a playa man
Streets are the booth, we poppin' at you hatas man
Soft ass niggaz make they chin hit the floor
Off bran niggaz take they cheese and they hoe

I got a 22, not much bigger than my finger
A Winchester pistol grip pump that's a head ringer
A two shot derringer, not little millinater
A big 40 glock, just call me the gun slanger
Some AK spray to kill the front line
One hundred and thirty dead from squeezin' off one time
All you muthafuckin' niggaz, that yappin that fly lip
Let it rip, don't slip, I'm workin' with fly clips

We fifty deep and every nigga with me got they ice on
Look, niggaz gottta brake your face like Roy Jones
Crush your bones when its on, we ain't never scared
Them Memphis boys, we so serious when its bout that bread
Kidnap family members, them niggaz don't leave no witness
They all love a gangsta, that shit be so addictive
When we pull up, they know who we are by the car
We blowin' big, and you know Diddy he gonna buy the bar

[Chorus]

Take your vest off, I'm blowin' your neck off and eyes out
High speed chase, I'll follow you to your hideout
Shoot your fuckin' tires out, don't try to ride now
What happened to the bass in your voice, you just cryin' now
Thought you was a man, you starting to look fine now
The grim reaper been lookin' for ya, and boy its time now
And blow the roll, shit out the right side of your head man
ain't no way for retaliation when yous'a dead man

Not a scared man, we keep it, out the frame
We stayin' away from lames, and run the whole game
I do it like G, you ain't, fuckin' with me
Eightball, MJG, we reppin' for Tennessee
With murder and homicide, and daily, niggaz die
And daily, niggaz ride, it don't mean with we you wise

Them boys that disrespect, with bullets they get showered

Heyyy

See a nigga like me gonna get money til I get rich
Ride with a couple hundred G's in a biscuit
Stay down for whatever forever hustle with my mystic hoes
And soon you gonna see just how crunk this shit be once we get rich
Til then its back to hustlin with my misfits
Deep, on a creep, fifty songs tucked under the prone
Fifty songs tucked under the prone

I keep a big old nigga beater heater
Its in the trunk of my four-door and my two seater
I'm make them say skeeter skeeter
Keep up and grab the ball back just like I'm Derek Jeter
I know you want to fuck my hoe but you too scared to meet her
See you ain't got enough bread to even start to treat her
The way a pimp did, and in the bed I'm even sweeter
I hustle, I got more Franklins in me than Aretha
If I had Oprah Winfrey I would marry her and keep her
I spit as much knowledge as preachers and teachers
Just as long as the message reach us we all fill up the bleachers
I'm the MJG, I get in yo' shit
I ain't trying to run yo' clique, that be your friend so quick
Come on, where my money, let me hit the stage
Fuck them long interviews, just give us the front page
Black G apostrophe S us, forever bust
Them lyrics that make the people say that he got nuts

Sticky weed kickin in, big Ball steppin in
Straight flying when I hustle, that's how I represent
Bounce, if you feelin what I'm spitting up in your ear hole
I been rocking mics since I was seventeen years old
Smoking up, drinking up, kicking dust, and fucking up
Everybody want a piece and we ain't got enough for us
Yeah, I touched a brick or two, pounds I done smoked a few
Got my bread and didn't do what the fuck I was supposed to do
Money blinds players, turns them into evil spirits
Niggaz die trying to live out these old rap lyrics
I try to give it to them just how it come to me
Real and unedited, not like it be on T.V
Be myself and don't be what those haters want me to be
Take the good the bad hit my knees set me free
Make the bad good, put that on my leather and wood
Cinderella with my fellas deep off in the hood

You need to stop sticking your hand out and trying to (?)
Turn around the broom handle and trying to hold it
It's plenty dirt to be swept, and leaves to be raked
Now you need to leave from my face, take heed to mistake
That you just made, thinking a player could get played
Thinking that a rapper could get wrapped and phone tapped
My whole life I learned the hard way to spot liars
And it seems like its usually the ones that's right by ya

Graphic how I got it illustrated, rated triple X

Still spinning and I'm still smoking heavy
Look at both of my grills, my motherfucking mouth
Looking just like the rims on the Chevy
Pimp twist I'm a playa still, ballin' in the game come major bills
Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill
Fuck a twist, fuck you bitch
I don't really want to have to bust you bitch
Roman gold shine so hard
Niggas out here know they can't touch that shit
I don't trip, niggas pull up
I be lookin' proud when I bust that dutch
Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Niggas try to jack you and loose my coop is by the kennel wheels
Mother fucker want to take my style
Cause niggas out here know I'm only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters want to see me fall
How can I let y'all niggas play me
Shitted on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball and MJG
Twista bitch and I from the shy
With my Memphis connect and I ain't going' lie
We be specializing in and up coming with dope shit
And pulling up in cool whips that's fly
Still drink, still blow, then I creep through the hood real slow
While I bump kamikaze shit, while I scream look at my grill hoe

Like a bitch that practice sucking dick and drinking semen
She screaming dreaming, wishing she can be my number one
Forever young, mama I just want to' to have some fun

Don't try to ever take my cash from me
You mine as well, jump of a cliff you fucking crash dummy
Like that's my last money
This for my niggas who be bussin' back to perpetrators
We don't discriminate, we'll hurt now hurt you later

What kind of nigga always run his mouth like a hoe
Like his jaw got a battery, this nigga always know
Who got robbed, got shot, who got put on lock
Nobody invited you and still you got up in the spot
Me, I'm not a witness, keep my distance, mind my business
You, somebody talk, you in they mouth like a dentist
We keep it gangsta, mommas love it cause they know it's real
Like UGK, ""we keeps it real"" mobbin' through the field
Big Ball, Fatboy, unload heat when my brain spill
You for it, images without no coke connect pills
We keep it crunk and poppin' real niggaz know the deal
We Bad Boys, anywhere we at we smoke and kill
You try to stop it, get yo' shit broke up in twenty pieces
We roll deep in brand new vehicles wit secret features
Game preachers move yo' pimpin' for you mamasitas
We players on the field, why'all niggas in them bleachers

You talkin' down behind my back (uh) you done shot off nigga
Fifty, four or twenty sack, you done shot off nigga

You know what you just done, you done shot off nigga

Man, come on now, you done shot off just like Mike Davis lost a knockoff
Or his tight-ass shirt when the button pop off
You standin' it's snowin' you got yo' shoes and socks on
Who holds the key? No fucking bout it, I broke the lock off
I grew the top off, took the comma, period, dot off
And ran on wit it and broke you a whole lot off
I'm gettin' hot and startin' to boil, don't turn the pot off
You just affected wit it, pimpin' yo, get yo' rocks off
Release some pressure, stop all that cryin' and wipe ya snot off
Excuses you be usin' for losin' it's cheap as hot sauce
Earn yo' position, stop hatin' because you not boss
M-J-G, pimp tight, I'm movin' yo' spot off
And I don't reach, stoppin' yo' plans, fucking yo' plot off
I go hard and I don't sheave and I'm not off
And livin' on the edge rebellin' I'm never dropped off

I'm only rappin' cause I want to, I got enough plaques
Needless to say, my favorite rappers told me to get on this track
And so I DID it, quickly wrote my sixteen down and SPIT it
By the end of the verse you'll say, ""once again, Ludacris shit it""
Then I'll wipe this wit yo' face and put yo' pride in the trash
My whole career is like my video, I'm showin' my ass
I keeps it, ""gangsta, gangsta!"" shooters and shanksters
Until you shot off motherfuckers, I'm a ""thank ya, thank ya!""
Runnin' yo' mouth behind my back until you run out of time
But at least yo' talkin' let's me know some millions stay on yo' mind
It ain't nothin' wrong wit that
Tell em grabbin' the thing and then I put it to yo' brain
And change everything you ever hope for (for) wit the .44

If a, bum run up hope he got his gun up
From sundown to sunup I keep it with me
And I end up be unloadin' on y'all when y'all hit me
It's a grand shame that you niggas come from it but can't walk through it
What is it? I thought you knew it
It was the streets nigga, my seat used to hit it when I didn't have no wheels to go get it
M J fuckin' G droppin' these bars with no regards for snitches and fake broads
You ain't hard from steroids, nigga you big fraud
I remember when them bullets was takin' your lunch card
I'm a real ghetto politician
and what I gotta give in to motherfuckers who willin to try to vision
When a nigga spittin', Quit all the whinin' and bitchin'

Money over bitches, man it still all good (Streets is watchin')
We makin plenty bread and we reppin' our hood (Streets is watchin')

What can I say about these streets that I be walkin'?
Not too much 'cause where I from niggas ain't motherfuckin' talkin'
We'd rather listen and watch
Tryin' to flex and guard their clothes and Baume and Mercier watches
Tryin' to get my gloss on
I paid the 'cause' to be the boss on these corners where ballin' niggas floss on
Haters get tossed on, 5-0 get ? and out of towners get robbed
and drop that, can't nobody gonna stop that
See it was like this before me
So if you think it's time to change, nigga show me
Obviously you don't know me It's time that you learned
niggas that try to hold me on my grind, they get burned
I'm down from P.A., man, West side to the east, fool
(Aw come on Bun be, dude what about peace?)
Fuck peace, fool
You want some love, ask your momma or the lord
Bitch I'm down with pimps see, UGK be goin harder

Dope crack that's going in the strip clubs tippin'

Fuck a blind date, oh no, I got to see her
The new millennium poet
Forever show it, can't blow it
If you reap it, you sow it

I, pay my, dues
And it's the rules that I play by
Carry the team like I'm A.I
I used to cook rocks, and hit the block

And gun in the bushes, and money in my sock
Shit, I had hoes way before I was nationally famous
I was in the hood strapped up good
Watchin' my anus

I'm a target splitter
The world strongest man hardest hitter
Even though you hate
I still elevate regardless nigga

Step to us boy, look what you done started
And we don't even care that your arsenal be the largest

You need to pump yo' brakes
Keep a heater nigga need for them restless snakes
Right in my face caught a case tryin' to defend my space

Dodging snitches police niggaz jumping state to state
What kind of nigga run his mouth and snitch out everybody?
The kind of nigga that's gone end up being a dead body
Yo' wife and children gone be searching for their dear ol' daddy

They found his headless body tied up in a dark alley
It's cold like ice and snow on a nigga soul
For bricks or snow, niggaz will fuck you like a dirty hoe
Kick yo' door and put and your babies on the floor

See you in public fuck who with you let the thang go
A nigga tell you don't let business turn personal
Fuck what they say cause for gram a nigga hurtin' you
Niggaz out here hurtin' fool

Nothing is for free mayne

Pussy like a little kitty back yellow as corn
I don't go around poppin' shit wit' niggaz who talkin'
Them niggaz ain't talkin' no more

Closed coffin
Not often do you see a nigga loyal as I
Like that boy from Best Eye nigga ready to die
For my bread and them niggaz that considered me family
Hold it down mayne I got you til we up there wit' granny

'Cause as soon as I start writing
I start going through physical
Deeper into my spiritual
I'm so fuckin' lyrical

Just call me the competition

I'm still working with Diddy, still fuck wit the hood

Rush with adrenaline, how long has it been again
to be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?

It's been a long time
Rakim, the microphone soloist
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Rakim

When I'm out propping, either, hanging or shopping
People see me stop and ask me when the album dropping
The wait is over, in-formation like a soldier
like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older
I broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge, is not to explode in violence
I'm Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit
At least once during the course of a day, it's automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharoah
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me
You know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recital, taught disciples
A sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that's trifle, I'm busting these for you
Hey yo, technical difficulties is through

It's been a long time
Rakim, the microphone soloist
It's been a long time
Rakim, the microphone soloist
It's been a long time
Rakim, the microphone soloist
It's been a long time
It's been a long time

When I float at night, I show em new heights, I go to write
They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
Critics and biters, don't know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now
cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
So be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb
Like, 3-D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom
Info kept like ""internet.com""
My note-book's my bond like the Holy Qu'ran
Since I came in the door, said it before
But no I ain't down with Eric B. no more
At night the open mic be inviting me to rhyme
So yo I'm online, it's been a long time

It's been a long time
Rakim, the microphone soloist
It's been a long time
Rakim, the microphone soloist
It's been a long time
Rakim, the microphone soloist
It's been a long time

It was some what early, I was on my way
To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I'm full of them trees
A dog want to hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please
These H-Town freaks be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin' on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin' machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin' grinnin'
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin'
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain't you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be
Imagine it, you and me, in the middle of the night

[Hook]
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really want to hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back

In the middle of the night

[MJG]
I was chillin' at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I'm bored I ain't did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That's a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what's up
She said (What's on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We straight ya ain't gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin' at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin' there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she want to romance, did she want to hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin' on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin' on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I'ma be a lil' late gettin' in)
Now I was feelin' kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these windows is around
Let's me and you do what we gotta do to get through
The rest of this episode, hold on tight
Let's re-write in the middle of the night

[Hook]
[MJG]
I'm on late night mission top let down
That's the way I gotta flip when I be
Feelin' 'ike I want to take a dip in the wind
Night-life livin' all the way to the end
It's just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin' in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I'm gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin' in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin' in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin' out the few tail I'd like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin' out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees in a fresh set of keys
Now I'm fixin' to break em' to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I'ma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin' me off from my flight

Hangin' like a coat rack
Gun in the bushes and
Work in the stash spot
Overtime, al night
Try'na make a fat knock
Swell in my pocket

Been around the world
But I still love local head
Got the shit to make 'em jump
It's hyper like a pimp rally
Give 'em just a piece it make 'em
Mime me like a skip daddy
Glock, Chevy parked in the yard
Wit' the double pipes
If I catch ya try'na steal it
I'ma get double life
I ain't wanna do it, I ain't even really hate son
That's a damn shame but tomorrow, I'ma make ???

Bury me with all that's hurt.
What luck have I found?

I found the feel. I found the flow.
I found what I've been looking for.

You entice this time.
Can't you see I'm teething?
Bleeding from inside.
For you I will not lust.
For you I will not bust.
Which way should I go?
Or should I know.
I can't take it back.
I don't want it back.
For you I will not lust for you I will not bust.
So lay me down.
So I can find my peace now.
So lay me down.
Let me be at ease this time.
So lay me down.
Can't stop the way I feel this time this cancer's eating me inside.
Can't stop the way I feel this time this cancer's eating me alive.

Take me out.
Make me out.

Where do you get your motivation?

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Eileen Farrell,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Eileen Farrell,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Eileen Farrell,"I'm thru with love,
I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.

Did you good by the spring

That you could ever care for me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Eileen Farrell,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Eileen Farrell,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,

Eileen Farrell,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

Eileen Rodgers,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Eileen Rose,"Angel falls in the water, wets his wings
He can't fly for a while, it's one of those things
He spends the downtime singing

So there's salt in the water, a bitter taste
Just one chance in a lifetime
But you're wasted, you waste it
You spend so much time thinking like they do

When there's so much out there you can't imagine, it's
Such a drag, but it's so much better than me
Trays up, wheels up, coming in
Come and sing now

Something caught in the engine, so down I go
With sunlight on the head of my hero
Well, it's forward, or fall

But there's so much out there you can't imagine, it's
Such a drag, but it's so much better than me
Same problems, the same old pain
I got Tom Waits crooning and he's so much better than me
Trays up, wheels up coming in
Come and sing Tom, yeah, and come again
In your hip black jeans, and your portable phone
You wanna tell me about America, well
What do you know?
In a cool, clear moment that image comes down
You're gonna laugh at me later, I'll laugh at you now

in the middle of the night, I'm wide awake
I'm covering it
I'm covering it",Tom Waits Crooning
Eileen Sharkey,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
Eileen Sharkey,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Eileen Socey,"Loving you is not a choice
It's who I am
Loving you is not a choice
It's not much reason to rejoice
It gives me purpose
Gives me voice to say to the world
This is why I live
You are why I live

Loving you is why I do the things I do
Loving you is not in my control
Loving you I have a goal of what's left in my life
I will live and I would die for you

You give me purpose

Eileina Williams,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune

Eileina Williams,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,
For the one I love,
Must come back to me.",I Cover the Waterfront
Eileina Williams,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Eileina Williams,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

[Chorus]",Sometimes I'm Happy
Eilen Jewell,"You’re tellin’ everyone in town that I don’t treat you right
You even say I stay away and don’t come home at night
I’m losin’ you and you are all I’ve got
Thanks a lot, thanks a lot

It seems you like to hurt me even though I’m good to you
I’d give you everything I own do anything you want me to
Now you’ve really got me on the spot
Thanks a lot, thanks a lot

Still I would forgive you if you’d let me
I’d be glad if we could try again
But it seems that you’re just out to get me
And it looks as if you’re just about to win

No matter what you do I always will love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
After callin’ me those things you know I’m not
Thanks a lot, thanks a lot

Thanks a lot, thanks a lot

",Thanks a Lot

Einsteinium Quartet,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A Foggy Day
