Everything is greater you know
Raghav
Kardinal Offishall aka celebrity face is on the place
Se that own that see me black chase is the chain stupid

Yeah Lisa likes my ride and all
Then there's
Sheri who I'd fly across
Just to
Get away from Cindy-Ross
We would meet up in Jamaica
Underneath the stars
Tamika likes 'em quiet and soft
So I'd
Tell her 'bout the puppy I lost
Yeah she would
Try to help me get over the dog
We were freakin' every weekend
Till the break of dawn
But baby

Soon or later
I knew I would change my tune
I've spent so long acting wrong
I didn't know how to be true
But sooner or later
I would find somebody who
Could show me then what I know now
I should have known it would have been you
Sooner or later

I remember we would drive around
Me and all the boys in town
There was no talk of straying or swaying from the playing
There was no talk of settling down
Now they keep calling on me
Saying brother where you gone
So I just
Say I'm with my baby now
That I'm leaving all the scheming
They should try it out yeah

Soon or later
I knew I would change my tune
I've spent so long acting wrong
I didn't know how to be true

Raghav,"Remember how
The way we were
The way we used to be
So hot to trot
I thought we could not stop
We would rock constantly baby

I know the clothes you wear
And every car you drive
All the people in your life
That whole vibe baby
But where I lost my way
I shoulda spent the time
With your soul and in your mind getting it right baby

And I wish that I had known this before
Instead of opening I closed every door
Shoulda known that I had lost you for sure
Wherever you are now
You must have so much more

I recognize that I'm a better man
'Cause of you baby
Let me take your hand
Oh I see you want it back
I guess that I'm too late baby

I know the grass is greener on the other side
Maybe someone's in your life
That's ok by me
Yeah girl you taught me that
There's so much more inside
It's so sad I've seen the light
In some bad time

If I had legs like you then I'd love to run
You know and another thing kid
Let me sit you down here tell you what I did
Well I fought the war
Got a kid, got a wife, got rich, got poor
Made it in my own time
All you need is patience and a peace of mind
So ease your mind my boy
Ease your mind my boy
Ease your mind
And the things you want 
Are the things you'll find
So long
Your ship may sink before it even hits the water
Your dreams may wind up at the bottom of the sea
Don't let the changing winds of time 
Define the man you want to be
You want to be

He said drink with me
Toast the good and the bad 
Feel the sting of your memories
Carry me to bed,
My foolish old age makes a wise old head
Let this be last
For the time has come and all things must pass
Let me hear you say
What a wise old man told you yesterday
So ease your mind, my boy
Ease your mind, my boy
Ease your mind
And the things you want 
Are the things you'll find
So long
Your ship may sink before it even hits the water
Your dreams may wind up at the bottom of the sea
Don't let the changing winds of time 
Define the man you want to be

Rep chicks on the strip, rep thugs on the street
I got what you want, I got what you need
Rep chicks on the strip, rep thugs on the street

Digga Digga, first name Rashia
Rock the mic crazy, wouldn't wanna be ya
Had a nice wing since my early teens
Now I'm grown rocking microphones
Sin, sin

Said I learned new ways
Gotta thank God for my chance to blaze
Next album gonna see a fat healthy raise
And he make mistakes, say that's the brakes
(That's the brakes)

True, hit 'em with the
(Wooo)
Fine young woman now, long time coming now
(Coming now)
Thank the fans for they love and affection
Heard me with the Fugees, still ain't making a connection

Fulfill my destiny wasn't nothing y'all could tell me
Ripping down the stage with a baby in my belly
Adding up to math, applying everything I learned
While a dummy kept going on tour and get burned, see

I got what you want, I got what you need
Rep chicks on the strip, rep thugs on the street
I got what you want, I got what you need
Rep chicks on the strip, rep thugs on the street

I got what you want, I got what you need

East Coast y'all, handle your B.I.

West Coast y'all, handle your B.I.
Dirty South y'all, handle B.I.
Up top y'all, handle your B.I.

Now make way for a sister little feisty foul mouth
Say what's that all about
('Bout, 'bout)
It's about one, two, three, four, five for the rating

A penny for the hating, y'all know my ways
Staying up in the game of this MC craze
Kind of wonder what if I'd of dropped back in the days, say

Rhymes I toss it, taking no losses
Let management tell you who your new boss is
People stay repping up on the West Coast
Word is bond to my flow, y'all got the best 'dro

Ain't seen nothing like it, ain't bring nothing like it
If my rhymes strike a nerve
Ain't mean nothing by it
Dirty Harriet

And I be stepping to the left
You bust for Diablo, I still bust for UCEF
Try'na see me on the MC tip, now, child please
Vocab for years and freak enough stylees, swing

Rep the thing for my Hip-Hop brothers
Take care of them before I take care of others
Juice Crew, Rakim, Prince, big influence
You saying I'm the dopest, but I already knew this

Say one check two check, everywhere check check
Check for me, we haven't ever even met yet
Gotta thank God I said I gotta thank God
I could look this fly and rock it this hard

I got what you want, I got what you need
Rep chicks on the strength, rep thugs on the street
East Coast y'all, handle your B.I.

West Coast y'all, handle your B.I.
Dirty South y'all, handle B.I.

(Hell yeah)
Do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Put it down for the bitches all across the map
All the real live bitches all across the map
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm on the roll like butter
Flow gutter, fuck what a bitch going through
Do or die is what you gon' do
I warn you it's gonna get you and your guys killed
With my skills stay on your toes like high heels
And handle bars like bikes 'bout to blow like innertubes

See me in the tube in the views to interludes
Never see me in the nude, Blade gon' bend the rules
Lock the street coming through with more rocks than Pete
I'm into jewels I will not repeat
Y'all obsolete, Sonya Blade y'all
It's murder when they drop the beat

I spit it once, I'm hungry spit at lunch
One take, I hate boxes so I don't punch
I got a hunch, y'all figure, y'all gon' stop my figgas
Get on some rah-rah with Eve and Rah Digga
But these my niggas so please my niggas
Stop the Blade from where you don't know nann nigga

Do the ladies run this motherfucker?

Put it down for the bitches all across the map
All the real live bitches all across the map
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

Yo, yo now why y'all wanna make me get raw
This bitch gon' split ya, get tha picture
Call yourselves emcees, titles don't even fit ya
How they gonna stop us Digga?
Tryna shine, the rest of them bitches
Is past tense and out of time
'Cause my time line consists of many dreams shattered
Trying to run up with two ryders deep as if it mattered

When real bitches get to rockin', heads knockin'
All dem chickens in their coupe gon do is get to squawkin'
All the hating do is feed my temper, let me live
Ice grillin' eyein' my clothes, I'm eyein' the crib
E V E spell it out when you speak about her
The only one out the bunch to hate
The rest gon' crowd around her

Majority rules, it's our time, back the fuck up
'Cause the shit you sayin' out your mouth
Make me crack the fuck up
Laugh hard 'cause we pass y'all so dash broad
Lay my shit by myself in the booth
While y'all need flash cards

Do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Put it down for the bitches all across the map
All the real live bitches all across the map
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

Yeah, check it out now, like that y'all
Watch me sink three points
Smash your whole LP with just my lead joint
It's the rhyme super bitch gon' stay forever wildin'
Smooth with the pen, Shakespeare, Edgar Allen
Hot chick, catastrophic, blast the hot shit

Your whole verse whack and bare no facts or logic
Smash your clique in, y'all niggas only heard tidbits
I put that on Gabana every rhyme I done spitted
One two, one two, your whole crew I dismantle
Rock fly gear and stay clear of sex scandals
With drogues to spark wait for shows to start

My put my niggas down if they know their parts
Caramel give 'em hell from Bricks to Anadel
Rappers tryna compete get ate like Samuel
By a sister who twist a few L's rip it dually
The song say It Ain't My Fault like Mystikal

Do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Do the ladies run this motherfucker?

Put it down for the bitches all across the map
All the real live bitches all across the map
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

Rah Digga,"[Chorus]
Flipmode the imperial
You know you love it when you hear us on the radio
Go cop the joint and play the shit up in your stereo
Or in the streets up in your Jeeps, or in the disco
And if you want the fly shit, my nigga, here we go
You know it's Digga lookin' pretty in the video
With Bus-a-Bus up in the cut, but you don't hear me though
Just when you think we done we hit y'all, we got plenty mo'
Blow!

[Rah Digga]
It be's the little mama, lip gloss and eyeliner
The only shit poppin' like White Castle or the Donna
Rah Digga make the joints that the DJs blast
Ghetto diva in the Source with the three page ad
Watch as the hood rat messiah climb swiftly
Labels scared to death to let their artist bomb with me
'Cause you can send your thuggest MC and watch me son 'em
The ruggedest bitch don't even rhyme about gunnin'
Got joints circulating like them old karate flicks
Buncha Rah Digga shirts on some big body chicks
Throw my shit in your hoopty or your luxury trucks
And make the quickest turn around like 'dro for twenty bucks
And I'll still be the greatest if this rap shit fail me
Back to jackin' bootleg flicks from out the deli
Livin' off the interest
Sippin' on Tequila with my logo on the side of fuckin' eighteen-wheelers

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
Ay, yo, yo, yo
Raze and dazzle niggas like y'all
Spread niggas like you and dismantle niggas like y'all
I got the thing that'll majorly handle niggas like y'all
Fight y'all; bust a semi and cancel niggas like y'all
I know some joke niggas who love to hassle niggas like y'all
Talk, and fix, and simply dance on niggas like y'all
Trample niggas like y'all
Make examples outta niggas like y'all
Grit their teeth and cock the hammer up inside the dance hall
Thugs - here's another sample for niggas like y'all
Or for the ones who pass and light a Roman candle for niggas like y'all
Fight for niggas like y'all
Grab the mic from motherfuckers like y'all
Blow the spot in the night for all my niggas like y'all
My get high niggas; I blaze for niggas like y'all
Stink the spot up with 'dro; now spray the fuckin' Lysol
You know we be the ultimate
We fuckin' with some other shit
And when we hit y'all
Yes, we sit and watch y'all niggas ride the dick

Aiyyo, clap and slap up a nigga for talkin' lots a whack shit
While I roll around with the Harriet Tubman of this rap shit

Black chick, with intellect; who want to match wits?
Write my own rhymes so can't no nigga tell me jack shit

Master shit, Flipmode exclusive across the map and shit
Presenting the first lady of the squad so give me dap and shit

[Rah Digga]
Sayin' peace when you see me; play the role like Ally Sheedy
And I ain't gon' join ya cipher if the weed's too seedy

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, make sure you see what we doing now; put on your binoculars
Then I gas ya like a paid Latino down at Banco Popular

[Rah Digga]
Rah Digga underground and gon' always blow the spot for ya
Longest runnin' shit since the Phantom of the Opera

[Busta Rhymes]
Bus-a-Bus, going down as one of the greatest spoken philosophers
Holding a 12-shot semi with a little red dot for ya

[Rah Digga]
First and only female unmatched by anyone
Rip it from old school to the next millennium

Rah Digga,"All my niggas y'all, Flipmode y'all
Flipmode y'all, hardcore y'all, raw shit y'all
Hardcore y'all, Flipmode y'all

All my bitches y'all, all my bitches y'all
Flipmode y'all, Flipmode y'all
Hardcore y'all, raw shit y'all
Hardcore y'all, Flipmode y'all

Never judge a nigga like the cover of a book
Fuck around and get shot back of the foot
Nigga, fall, stumble and look, nervous and shook
Dragged in the alley and book and beat down to a pulp

Shot up my cops, Dirty Harry
You stickin' me is like niggas fuckin' the Virgin Mary
Shit we carry will have you found layin' down
Somewhere damp and muddy, split your tummy
Puncture your kidney and make you piss bloody

So now I leave your body to rot
Where bitches sell they pussy for rock
Cook they coke in steamin' water, boil in a pot
Do you know niggas like us that clutter they watch
Invest in yo' block, like it or not, involvin' your pops?

You messin' wit a rhyme surgeon
Trade the GS for the excursion, heads is turnin'
Flipmode we still mergin'
Now we splurgin' in suburbans
Dirty Harriet rock the camouflage turbans

Said one for the money and two for mic check
And spit a million rhymin' words in 240 seconds
Get three to get your bitch neck and four to even the score
Graveyard shifter mister, y'all believe in the law

Flipmode like Mary Lou Retton
Suede ballet shoes steppin', do the best that I can can
Like Pointer sisters, who could join the wizard?
Talkin' outta place, I pick the knife up and cut the tongue
Right outta your mouth and fuck your life up

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

Before all the plaques and the Source Aawards
Y'all niggas wanna dick ride, so jump aboard
It's a first class ass whippin', rampage, I ain't trippin'
Check all the magazine clippin's

Yo, I pluck pigeons, get brains in expeditions
Cause friction, every chick I stick my dick in
I'm not trustworthy, like midnight, I'm pickin'
Spliff keep it warm like wool caps to mittens

Watch for me in a new milli, kick up dust with my shoe shitty
New Jack City, wicked ways move wit me
Holla mine, in these violent times crooks bear malice
White collar crime, Columbine, we clear classes

Burn a nigga into ashes, how I mash his ass like Cassius
Finger jabs, I got it mastered, fantastic
Writin’ half ass shit, splash kids
Poke ‘em with the bassinet in the neck, graphic

Can't tell I'm from QB the way that I talk
Speakin' in tongue with six blocks callin' my dun
Bogie collapsed lung, big and small gats we brung
Bangin' your drums with hot shit and more to come

But then we manifest the truth
The niggas fight predictions from The Bible
Betrayal for niggas is suicidal
Kick swift shit niggas rock harder than Limp Bizkit
Dirty Harriet floodin' all through your district

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

Call me conductor, I lead the way for ya
Underground vibe, status self-employed
R-A-H aka Harriet Thugman
Carry out the legacy with seed and husband
Now off with the head thingy
Watch flip to a genie
And I be a Mac like Beanie
Out the bottle, I turn thug super model
With rhymes that'll make ya have to settle for Movado
The dirtiest getting all the way live
Steady tappin' my shit, tryin' to eat while I drive
Speeding to a function to play the little actress
Three hours late and don't even know the address
Madness with the ill sexy flow
And the label spendin' g's not tryin' to let me go
Rockin' on the stage after me, you fool!
Cause I am so cool

Cause she's so cool, yeah oh

I aim high beat date in December
A million motherfuckers whose face I don't remember
Next to fall with the be	-girl ball
Tight gear little cousins
The store from the mall
Rockin' hardcore to some R&B shit
Kickin' rhymes for the round-the-way heads
That I'm at peace with
Love the ice rock silver as a preference
Taking writer's credit so offer a suggestion
So bust them heads who ain't real wit it
Who don't want shit in life and can't deal with it
I see you
Frontin' like you on my side
Switch sides thanks for the ride bitch
See me on the cover, (Say what?) strike a pose
Just know after that I'm making off with the clothes
Underground rule for real, so what's the haps?
Take it back like kids who fight in playing caps
Or Jacks ?N' Ball, freestyle off the wall
Tell em don't forget the stones when they make the Digga dome
Do away with styling you ain't even found yet
Blow the mic out and ain't nothing but a sound check
Writing rhymes like you wish you could
Tight breaking em down on behalf of sisterhood
Spittin' every time use my looks as a tool
Cause I am so cool

Shit tight, down to the coochie
Yeah, check it

cause a sista write rhymes all day and all night
Dwellin South of the Hudson, New Jerusalem
in seclusion, using fake pseudonyms [I'm true bad]
Mind travels like a skitzo on two tabs 
with doo rags hangin from my pockets
[Me] Me, the rap bitch that goes back to pediatrics
Early left rappers like you were straight vexin [So]
So recognize, I make a nigga eyes come alive 
off of five two fives; disguise the camouflage
I shoot a virus out of my spirals with mad priors
for takin mad niggaz titles!
Wetter than a resevoir; lurking in the bushes 
striking blows like Chesamar(?) code-name Hasana
Warmer than a bomber, hotter than the region of Ghana
Get loot like that Trump bitch, Ivana

[Chorus]
Now, who be writin rhymes all night
Rah Digga in tha house and plans is tight
[Tight] Peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

A black QUEEN, ya best believe my black jeans won't say Paco
I swing to the Vill' for some waffles and some beef falafel
Rap very tight liquor got me DIFFERENT
Dirtier than an overseas shipment of ki's
I write these TIGHT BUTTAS, creme de la GUTTAS
Call me Sheik Digga
Plotting over loops like the eight figures
Baby I'm hard, represent the feminist God 
[What?] that gets blunted - watch rhymers runneth, over
See me in the camel Range Rover 
[Chop] And I won't stop for Jake 
And keep heat by the waist for those that playa hate
[NOW] Show you the way to blow, better than I tell you
Word to my beeper and my cellu-lar [What?] Polo curls
Diggin all the rapper's shit like they go-go girls

[Chorus]

WHO THE TIGHTEST?  I rock with laryngitis
Gold's good for Midas, but I want the highest
So don't try me cause I be the bitch [I swear]
I'll leave you twisted like a thug with blonde hair
[Yeah] I blow up the spot like Dennis Scott
Go forward, your chance of defeatin me is morbid
'cause I get you open like the comin of the Pope 
when I group shit tighter than a 3 piece suit
[Peace, peace] Peace to niggaz I rhyme wit
My Outsidaz correspondents be more fluid than embalmin
[We pros] I decompose, any rapper to the bone
Down to they X and why chromosome
So SEE MY NAME tagged in bold or italics [Bow, bitch]
'cause I'll be the only one salvaged
Number one imported like Beck's
Tighter than three or more heads in a CRX

Tight, tight.. TIGHT!

I'm a show you easily for me to take mines
Pass my nickel plated nine, call me Einstein
Buck a shot two times and stick you for your rhyme
Put you in a pine box
You and your whole family's on detox
Hustlin crack for Reeboks
Holy socks, cut you with my ox
Rampage got the city locked
and your function, to the Flat Bush junction
Causin rambunction, watch me do you somethin

Baby Sham on some new shit
New and exclusive
5'3"", Caramel, tight grip on a four fifth
Leave em all stiff, blow smoke from this foul drift
Nigga with the 6 story, throw em off the cliff
As I speak the shit to put my name on the list
The small thug with a slug put a mark on his wrist
A tattoo of pyramids, puttin hollows in clips
Peeped your gat, jammed tight, Ross your lookin to riff (what the fuck?)
QB's type shit, cause we runnin your clique
See me in the drop, with your six, sayin she snitched
But never that, 'cause-o, high beam through the window 
My lookouts move slow, they heard you never blast though
Got a safe in your crib, sham, you know the code
Search, spoke out, 3, 2, 1, that's zero
Took the see notes and flip mode left on the quietest note
Swallowed these then cleared your throat
Bitch ass, you should have spoke

Closed coffin with flags folded in half
Triangular shape, blow out the candles with grace
For fabulous tastes, some will, battle for space
Pay the ultimate price, poltergeist
Put the holy ghost in your life, bring you closer to Christ
Focus your dice, when the vulture's in flight
Resculpture the mic, then smash heads like the opium bite
Prophet in vein, Metropolis claim body and soul
ID's controlled in the optical frame
Never stoppin the game
Remove your squad with steady plans

Rah Rah,"I used to have a guitar

To some old country song
That shook me to the core

And then I got an amp
I learned to make some noise
And I would play along
To some Crazy Horse songs
Until it felt right

Now I just want a life
Full of art and a wife 
Full heart 
Just a life 
Full of art and a wife 

And then I got a band
We drove around in a van
Play some shows
Made some fans
We crushed a few cans

I would sing for every girl
I used to want to make-out

In the gospel that I sung
In the poetry that I wrote 
Like a king behind his moat
The kind I hid away from everyone

To all my peeps in the penitentiary
Free eventually, spiritually and mentally
We had to rep essentially
While you was on dissin ground

We was holdin' fort down
Shit is so real I'm even back and forth to court now
We all struggle in the jungle for a bundle
Awaitin' the day, 'til the whole earth crumble

It's like a royal rumble in the streets now
When cats blow four pounds see trial nobody be around
Just the other day my brother Kwan got bagged
Three half ounces, three nickel bags in his ass

No doubt Son, shit is on smash, we want cash
To lamp like my cousin Thrash, with mad G's in his stash
So hold your head Dunn, and have no fear

Lendin' me dough for Pampers when it was twenty below

To shoot as many a clan concerned from Clue to Clutch
Who the fuck said that color matter? Your own brother 
Blacker than black'll leave you in the gutter splattered
It's automatic now with all the static

Only a coward or a faggot hides his flowers in the attic
I keep em close, to shine to blossom, try to floss em
Cried every time I lost one, fake niggaz come a dime a dozen
That's why I'm buggin, shorties is luggin heavy metal

Just call me a rebel cause I'ma keep reppin for every ghetto
For better or worse, up in the Jetta it hurts
I'ma keep reppin my niggaz til I'm dead in the earth

What's gangsta is knowledge

When we don't know our history
What good is the church for
When you can't trust the priest

Guess the lies are easier to swallow
Than it is to face the truth

Are the same ones as the past

Or perhaps just fade away
For brand new better day

And look outs were guiding the police

While they restored the projects
For the inside to remain the same

We won't feel the need for change

With fathers locked down with fake crime
For the sleep walking and blind chilling
On ice slain by the mind

I ain't gonna settle
No change is going to come
Each one reaches one

Raheem DeVaughn,"Question, can a smile lead to a hello?
And a hello lead to a first date?
And a first date to a can't wait to do it again?
Ain't no pressure can just let love develop?
Get to know one another from a sister to a brother?

I'm just wondering
I'm just wondering
If we start as friends
I'm just wondering

If you have a man
I'm just wondering
If I could be around, permanent
How can I get down?

I'm just wondering
What do you see when you look at me?
In your beliefs, do dreams come true?
'Cause I dream of you, of holding you
I'm wondering

Is it possible for you to see
That maybe you and I could be?
Is it possible for you to see
That maybe you said I could be?

Say it's possible for you to see
That maybe you and I could be
Is it possible to be logical
For you to see that we could be?

Patience, I was born with plenty
So if and when you're ready
Have some faith girl
And we can step out on faith

'Cause baby I'm not your everyday
Average man spittin' everyday average lust
Or rehearse girl, I speak the truth at all times

So if you're wonderin' this is too far fetched
If you're wonderin', this is no conquest
To love you, then leave you there
So I'm wondering, wondering

Is it possible for you to see
That maybe you and I could be?
Is it possible for you to see
That maybe you said I could be?

Say it's possible for you to see
That maybe you and I could be
Is it possible to be logical
For you to see that we could be?

Is it possible?
Oh say, say it, say it
Oh, baby
Baby, I want to know, oh

Is it possible for you to see
That maybe you and I could be?
Is it possible for you to see
That maybe you said I could be?

Say it's possible for you to see
That maybe you and I could be
Is it possible to be logical
For you to see that we could be?

Is it possible for you to see
That maybe you and I could be?
Is it possible for you to see
That maybe you said I could be?

Say it's possible for you to see
That maybe you and I could be

I wanna tell y'all about the beautiful love experience 
(hope you have time, hope you don't mind)

To my cousin I'm hoping you can hear this rhyme
When I ride through the bricks yeah
I think about you all the time
That cold day I got that phone call
It plays back in my mind
I can still hear your mother cry

Well at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

And to my first girlfriend
I know you probably married now
Reminiscing on our prom date
The way I did you yo was kind of foul
But I guess I had to wise up
So now I know better now (but at least I can say)

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

Like how it feels
When it comes
What its like
When it leaves

So to the woman that betrayed me
I think its unfair how
How you chose to deceive me
I thought that was my child
Now he's forced inside for now

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

To the faith I've lost (faith I've lost)
For the friends I've gain (the friends I've gain)
I'm thinking while I'm questioning change is a good thing
'Cause with dead weight you can't travel light (can't travel light)
Besides I was born to fight so I'm gon' be alright (born to fight)

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you
Like how it feels
When it comes
What its like when it leaves

To my momma,
To grandma
To my sister (to my sister)
And say good-bye (to my family)
After departure day and my friends told me what happened oh

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you
(I've experienced love)

I've experienced

You should experience

We are all, all experiments

Raheem DeVaughn,"Welcome to the Love Experience
A deep and tender, inevitable feeling of affection towards a person. 
Such as a rising kinship, recognizing attractive qualities, or a sense of undeniable oneness. 
So I propose a question to you:
Are you feeling loved today?",The Voice (Intro)
Raheem DeVaughn,"Should we just be friends, should we draw a line
Should we siege the times, take this thing further?
Or should we just pretend that love ain't closing in
Like I don't recognize, like you don't realize?

We're drawn to one another
Friends or lovers, it's time we choose
So fuck what your girls say and what my boys say
Don't even matter, all that matters now

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position,
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

To watch you fly away like doves do
And crush me, I need you
This air I breathe, like the tree's and leaves
We go together like hand in glove

So don't pretend that love ain't closing in
That I don't recognize that you don't realize
That were drawn to one another, friends or lovers
Girl, we gotta choose right now

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

I wanna take this further, I'm talkin' 'bout commitment
Our whole life, girl, I'm with it, I wanna put a title on this love
I hope you ain't feeling pressured but that just can't measure
To the way I feel about you and I love you
And I don't ever wanna let you go

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position

To curl my toes

I lose all control
And there's no need for batteries
Once you turned on your lights

I respond to her femininity

You make all my daydreams come true
I'm caught in your seduction
You make me less my more and more

I hope this rights the wrongs that I've done

there is good music but there is no goodbye...
so i'm finnin' to kiss that ass hello then praise high heaven, 
a scale of one to ten cannot appraise a fly eleven...
you're my ghetto queen like Thelma Evans, 
if you looking for a dude then i am Devin...
woman, you are ice cold holy water when i'm going through hell, 
and we are a provocative love story that i'm going to tell...
let me be so many cool breezes on the hottest day of the year, 
and you are holistically the topic of my discussion, 
not just your rear...
so please baby let me make love to you, my career, 
and then flip me into a hypocrite cause i beg for your moisture as i dry each tear...
damn woman, you sweet sticky thing...
i am drenched in your wetness so this kool-aid smile 
can change the attitude of gratitude that you would even let this happen, 
and thanks for not snapping when our rapping didn't reflect your worth...
so this is me tapping into your maple syrup and letting each drip, 
drop into my mouth so i skip downtown and slip down south, 
this way i can sip me some flow 
from the mouth of your mighty Mississippi until I am tipsy...
or till there's none left and if done right, 
you'll mention Malik and God in one breath...
i love you to death, nah i love you to life, 
love of my life, love you as my wife...
i don't even need a number to call you, 
sister, goddess, baby, momma, so blessed that you are my baby momma...
super thorough although they seem to trip when you young...
but woman you defy physics you crib out west but stay on the tip of my tongue...
so technically you occupy two spaces simultaneously...
you are God and body same as me...

And love is symbolic
So life don't get cherished,
So our babies perish, and your babies perish
Now tell me who's careless
Now who should I pray to
What should I pray for
You can't pay the preacher for your redemption

Cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I'm bulletproof cocking the glock and aim n shoot
My future's ever clear 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride and drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreaming of betta' days
Dreaming of betta' pay,
But we got our work cut out for us so we betta' pray
Pray to uphold the weak, not for eternal sleep,

Raheem DeVaughn,"She is the passion
She is my melody
And I amplify, amplify her sexuality 
When the lights go out
My bed is the stage
Her body is the pole
And we just lose control
And let nature take its course
Just like that I'm in the palm of her hand
Like a mike in the stand
Turn us up if y'all don't hear me

[Chorus]
Like the greatest show on earth known to man
Mike check one two
Mike check one two two
Like the whole world inside the palm of her hand
Mike check one two
Mike check one two 
Like the perfect song in the key of love
Mike check one two

Ooh oh oh oh when she's all on my microphone
Ooh oh oh oh when she's all on my microphone 
I'll make her ooh I'll make her oh
When she's all on my microphone
The greatest show known to man 
Is in the palm of her hand

What a work of art 
When she's all on my microphone

Verse two only gets better
Like the calm of a storm 
Before it get wetter
And when she does that sexy choreography 
It's like a pole dance trick
And she's on top of me
When the lights go out
Her body is like a speaker
Amplifies when I freak her
Loud as a siren
Falsetto dream
I make her body draw
Like an 808 form
Like a mike in the stand
In the palm of her hand

Her lips are priceless
Her body is priceless
Her technique is priceless
Like a sold out show
After paying all my dough
But now she's on my body like a stage
First the lights dim down
And I'm plugged in now
And the show begins
She makes the night seems so long
Like a never ending song

We the people speak, speak
We want to be free of this sick bureaucracy
No more death tolls with our morning coffee
Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life
It is war that you reap
But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep
The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak
Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak
Your lies are your destruction
Your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal
You are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow
Your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage
It rots and it reeks of death in the wind
The foul stench of men basking in their cruelty
Rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride
You risk all of humanity
You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know
People they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace
But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach deep
Deep down in our beings
Oh, this wicked, wicked system of things

Will soon be no more
Will soon be no more

Raheem DeVaughn,"It's beautiful like when you heard your first born
Heard your first born cry
Like fireworks in the sky
On the fourth of July
A term of endearment, cupid hearts and XOs
Memories like prom night and talking all night
Late night on the telephone and phone boning
It's fighting for something, never giving up
Cooking breakfast for your lady
Put a Starbucks in her cup
It's finding that better half
Someone to cry and laugh with
Money can't buy this feeling

It's easy to lose track of time
It's grinding with you husband

Rahel,"Dreams drift away like leaves on the water
They roll down the river and slip out of sight
Too many times we do what we ought
Put off 'til tomorrow what we'd really rather do tonight
And later realize

Time passes by, people pass on
At the drop of a tear, they're gone
Let's do what we dare, do what we like
And love while we're here before time passes by

Thoughts are like pennies we keep in our pockets
They're never worth nothing 'til we give them away
But love's like a promise in an un-opened letter
Where nights full of pleasure seldom see the light of day
When life gets in the way

Time passes by, people pass on
At the drop of a tear, they're gone
Let's do what we dare, do what we like
And love while we're here before time passes by

With twisted thoughts runnin' through my head
All alone in love and lazy
Cuz I'd rather be in your bed

Cuz you me lovin' so fine

As dawn approaches baby I shiver
Anticipating the new day
Cuz I'm sure to cry in rhythm
Thinkin' of the many ways

Growing oh so tired of the mystery

Rahsaan Patterson,"Gotta get away from you
Gotta make a change, I do
In too deep to lie, it's true
If I'm gonna live here's what I've got to do

Get over that feeling of wanting
Feeling and longing for you
Ignore the eerie haunting
That creeps and blazes through

Extinguish the fear that's stalking
Drawing me black and blue
Slay the abominable dragon
That's caused my mind to bruise

Deliver me of love

Caught up in the maze of you
Tangled in your web of doom
Will these threads untie and loosen
Even though the silk and splendor, it tends to soothe

Get over that feeling of wanting
Feeling and longing for you
Ignore the eerie haunting
That creeps and blazes through

Extinguish the fear that's stalking
Drawing me black and blue
Slay the abominable dragon
That's caused my mind to bruise

Beautiful, symbolic, majestic twilight
Orbit the galaxy transcending time
Disappearing hours go by, go by
Shifting and melting into nighttime nighttime

Escape to love, escape to love
Make way for love, make way for love
In space my love, in space my love

Deliver me of love, of love

People lust for fame like athletes in a game.

Some of us are downed, some of us are crowned
Lost and never found.

Have been let down and
Try to make amends without defending.

That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me"
Rahsaan Roland Kirk,"This love of mine, goes on and on
Though life is empty, since you have gone
You're always on my mind, though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day and all the night

I cry my heart my out, it's bound to break
Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

Rahsaan Roland Kirk,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh, what a hit we made
We came on next to closing

Love left the masquerade

B-B-B-Baby
Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun

talkin about desolation

you walk into desolation like that and suddenly out of nowhere comes a warm song you aren't about to forget it
thisis the first ime i've heard him at the airport
i know he moves along th epiers
he calls himself a journey agent
a eulipion
syas hi freinds the poets and the artists adn the musicians are eulipions 
too
listen to his tune
he calls it the duty free gift for the traveller

if there were no song
you would have this song
to give warmth at night
and to keep you strong
it would make love a guess
spinning round and round
and when meteors fall
love would reach the ground
if there were no moon
to control the tides
there would be these notes
as the sail goes by
we woudl make song??
and the praises soft
on the offer of love
may you live it out

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

So I lit a fire

Switch up speeds, without the weed, then I'll pass ya

I just got home from off another world tour 
I'm outside  in the rain  it's beginnin' to pour 
Can't understand why you changed the locks on the door 
Got all my drawers and socks outside on the lawn
 
What's right is wrong, we used to make love to this song 
Twice as long, especially when the nights were long 
Suga even in the dark, or when the lights were on 
Sista even in the park, lover my life is gone
 
I saw the flaws, now we both grabbin' for straws 
Over some love letters you found, in the top dresser drawer 
I'm missin' you more, the sweet scent of Christian Dior 
Kissin' you more, forever promissin' you more 
We need to communicate and start listenin' more 

Baby from experience, I've been through it before 
I found the message in a bottle washed up on the shore 
Signed from, 'sincerely yours', I can't take it no more 

[Chorus: ]
No I'll never turn my back on you 
I never want to do you wrong, Suga Sista 
No I'll never turn my back on you 
I never want to do you wrong, Suga Sista

Another episode, had the keys to the Yukon 
Tried to call her on the celly but she didn't respond 
Had my finger on redial now I'm callin' her moms 
Kept gettin' the voicemail now I'm losin' my calm
 
Though she's probably with the next man, wrapped in his arms 
Probably caught up in the mix, where she didn't belong 
On the topic of trust, misgivings was leading me wrong 
On the topic of us, misgivings was treating me wrong 

Reading me wrong, now we not getting along 
You never miss a good thing baby until it is gone 
The thrill is gone, you can hear my heart, spill on this song 

Wishin' once upon a time could stand still on this song 
If the feelings is strong, then a countermove would be wrong 
If the feelings is gone, then you know it's time to move on 
If the feelings is torn, then I was right all along 
If you think that I'm wrong, then pick my drawers off the lawn 

[Chorus: ]

At first I came to a halt, it was your fault 
Had me frozen on the avenue just watchin' you walk 
Up in your presence I was caught, breath, becomin' short 
I had to step to this to let you know you had my support
 
I said, ""I'm Black Thought, from out the 2-1-5th 
Maybe you heard about the Dynasty I do run with 
Me and The Roots done ripped, from Illadel' across the planet 
Ya see, we on some shit some find it hard to understand it
 
But back, to what you all about or how you are at 
What type of science did you knowledge was your mental intact?"" 
To converse, at first, let me know you knew the day and time 
I had to catch you, mentally makin' you mine
 
While I'm lookin' at you, physical chiseled that of a statue 
Type of shit to make you travel from Philly to the Big Apple 
It feels kind of crazy, reminiscin' back through 
No need to sweat the backturnin', keep it on the true and actual
 
As I get into your thought, for all infinity 
Shower you in masculinity, reinforcin' your sense 
Of femininity, bless you with this, the true identity 
Nothin' but respect in your vicinity 

Since, the Suga Brown from the level of Foun-dation of ground 
So together we forever bound 
We could make, heavenly sounds like a musical blend 
Throughout the bad times and beautiful things, it's like that

Nowadays we're with Rahzel, we're glad we waited 
Now we got you, right in the spot where we want it 
And every single negative vibe is confronted 
It's kinda ill when you let your music go free flowin 
Buildin' on improvised grounds and still growin 
People work hard, some want to escape 
But yo we gotta face the music with ease and with grace 
Sometimes we look to jams for an inner inspiration 
Cause the lyrics and the rhythm are the music vibrations

Rahzel,"Lyrically versatile
My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grased in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbred for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin' through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin' over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jasz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin' Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetratin is void

Ya leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
[he heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train honey dip and I'ma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?
Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone
It's like, summertime, laid back, to recline
In my La-Z-Boy chair

I'm the fuck up outta here","The Lesson, Pt. 1"

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

And it's too, too divine!

Raige,"All'inizio questa merda mi faceva anche sentire vivo
Felice senza un motivo.
Ma come ogni cosa quando la si idealizza
Prima o poi ti anestetizza
E non sai bene cosa sia né quando inizia
Come un bar mitzvah
In vita mio ho avuto modo di incontrare e conoscere mille persone
Ed è solo una garanzia di delusione
La gente parla chissà come
Qua basta poco e si cambia la faccia Ranma Saotome
Devo pensare a come andare via
Trovare un modo per farti di nuovo mia.
Beata gioventù beata l'incoscienza
Figli del caso non della provvidenza
Siamo con e siamo senza
Prendiamo fuoco ammanettati all'uscita di emergenza.
E tu vorresti dare un senso
Ma io non so più dare penso
Succede di sentirsi perso
Specie la mattina presto come adesso.

E' buia la città (cammino tra le anime stanche)
Sono ancora qua (continuo a sentirmi distante)
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante.

E' buia la città (cammino tra le anime stanche)
Sono ancora qua (continuo a sentirmi distante)
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante.

Qualcuno ha detto che la vita non ti carica
Mai di un peso troppo grande da sopportare
Tutte palle per quanto tu abbia le spalle larghe
Capita che non sia proporzionale poi ti scarica le batterie
Ci sono anche per l'anima le malattie
Non basteranno le poesie e gli aforismi dei saggi
Per sollevarti 21 grammi sono troppi anche per i giganti
In un angolo con mezzo fondo di beluga
Mi perdo come nel triangolo delle bermuda
La 8 in buca partita chiusa
Abbiamo mille vie d'accesso ma una sola via di fuga
E penso a quando tutto era più leggero
Più del cielo
Ma ad essere sincero ero
Io che lo reggevo anche se oggi non mi sembra vero.
E tu vorresti dare un senso
Ma io non so più dare penso
Succede di sentirsi perso
Specie la mattina presto come adesso.

E' buia la città (cammino tra le anime stanche)
Sono ancora qua (continuo a sentirmi distante)
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante
In piedi ma col mondo sulle spalle come Atlante.

E' buia la città (cammino tra le anime stanche)
Sono ancora qua (continuo a sentirmi distante)

Raige,"Se il mondo mentre gira fa girare le persone,
Allora c'è un perché a questa mia confusione
Ho la testa in subbuglio,
Il frigo vuoto io pure io e questa casa ormai siamo tutt'uno
Se ciò che abbiamo è ciò che siamo,
Io sono un divano, un lampadario, una tv e un centinaio di libri,
Perché chi non legge non immagina
E chi non immagina non è di carne è di plastica
Sono arrivato qui con tutti i miei sogni abbastanza,
Da vivere tre vite in tre mondi
E avevo fame, fame come un cane
Abbastanza da far male, abbastanza da sbranare
Ma che ne sa, un cane della libertà
Lui giura fedeltà, comunque vada resta qua
Dietro la staccionata e se arriva un estraneo abbaia
Per paura non per rabbia

Il tempo, cambia,
Gli uomini come il vento,
Piega, gli alberi
Questa città ne è la riprova
Perché anche se è così grande
In giro hanno tutti le stesse facce
Le borse sotto agli occhi, scavati nelle guance gonfi,
Di speranze perché ciò che non ricordi non ti tange
Ma qui abbiamo aperto le danze
Bambina usciamo a fare quattro passi come un Valzer,
Tra un istante

Ho scelto di gettarmi tra le fiamme,
Perché ho le palle, come uno stunt-man
Ma forse il mio talento non è grande
È pieno di gente come me nelle strade di Los Angeles
È come se ci fossimo imbucati alla festa tra,
Tutti gli invitati
Ci guarderemo in faccia e poi,
Ma dove cazzo siamo capitati",Buongiorno L.A.
Raige,"Quanta strada ho fatto per arrivare fin qua
Nessuno lo sa, nemmeno Dio lo sa,
Cambiare auto, cambiare città
Ma ogni notte è un altro strappo all'anima
Inizi a camminare senza voltarti e vai
Senza sapere dove andare
Un passo dopo l'altro che qua non si sa mai
Dove rischi di arrivare
Ho messo tutti i chilometri che potevo,
Io lo sapevo e no, io non volevo
Andare avanti e lasciarmi il cuore lì dietro
Piuttosto fisso il sole fino a diventare cieco

Quant'è lontana la strada di casa mia
Se chiudo gli occhi e provo a immaginarmela non ci riesco
Non ci riesco,
Non ci riesco,
Non ci riesco

Quant'è lontana la strada di casa mia
Se chiudo gli occhi e provo a immaginarmela non ci riesco
Non ci riesco,

Quanta strada ho fatto per arrivare fin qua
Nessuno lo sa, nemmeno Dio lo sa,
Un pasto caldo, un'altra città
Ma la notte ho questo strappo all'anima
Anche così lontana e senza saperlo sai
Essermi vicina ancora
Non esiste un tempo in cui tu te ne vai
Nemmeno ai titoli di coda
Dopo che ti ho sputato addosso il mio veleno
Io non ci credo no, non vado fiero
Cade la pioggia fitta finché cade il cielo
Scoppia il soffitto e io qui seduto che annego
Tu non ti sai nascondere
Tu non ti sai nascondere bene
Tu non ti sai nascondere
Tu non ti sai nascondere bene

Raige,"Per non dimenticare mai
Per non dimenticare che
Per non dimenticare mai
Per non dimenticare mai

Noi giocavamo sul balcone di una casa di ringhiera
Non smettevamo finché il sole non scendeva
Bastava poco, realmente poco
I pensieri di un bambino sanno colorare il vuoto

Non esisteva il verbo instagrammare,
Facevamo foto, io se chiudo gli occhi forte ancora lo ricordo
Mamma in casa col vestito nuovo
Papà in garage con le mani sporche d'olio, aggiusta la moto

Noi guardavamo rocky e ci picchiavamo
Per chi doveva esser rocky, prima di mettere i guantoni
Pranzo a casa dei nonni la domenica
Quando l'hai scoperto l'amore non si dimentica!
Le ferie giù in Sicilia, d'estate, al paese dove zia fa ancora il pane
Sorridevamo quando ancora sapevamo perdonare
Pensavamo che nulla potesse mai cambiare

Per non dimenticare mai
Per non dimenticare che comunque vada ovunque andrai
Sarai parte di me ed ogni volta che,
Impossibile, io penso a noi per non dimenticare mai

Ricordo mamma, le mani sulla pancia bella che dire bella,
Non e mai abbastanza
E sapevamo che ne sarebbe arrivato un altro
Stravolgiamo la casa per farti spazio
Ma tu di spazio, ne prendi poco,
Così poco, giusto il letto e qualche gioco
Poi casa si fa grande e papà c'è sempre meno
Un lavoro importante
C'è sempre qualche aereo

I soldi non c'hanno dato la felicità
Il contrario
Quasi quasi l'odiamo
Diventiamo grandi per necessità
Ma non siamo
All'altezza di quello che viviamo
Io ti tenevo in braccio
Come oggi tu fai con tuo figlio perchè hai avuto coraggio
Adesso insegnagli a sorridere, a perdonare
e a pregare perchè nulla possa mai cambiare

Per non dimenticare mai
Per non dimenticare che comunque vada ovunque andrai
Sarai parte di me ed ogni volta che, impossibile,
Io penso a noi per non dimenticare mai

Raige,"Siamo fatti, siamo fatti della stessa materia,
La medesima,
Ti spogli e ti sciogli su di me
Come l'ostia in bocca alla Cresima
Io l'ho pensato
Non appena t'ho vista eri di spalle
E con quelle gambe
Lunghe da perdere gli occhi anche solo a guardarle
Sono Alex Madame, tu hai un nome da Bazar,
Io lo so che corro Dakar, ma mi hai stregato Alakazam
Non vedo possibilità,
Se non insieme e via da qua,
Lascia le tue amiche al bar,
Troviamo un posto giù in città, uh
Il mare di notte ha il suo fascino,
Luci sull'acqua, io mi trascino come uno strascico,
Talmente ubriaco che sbiascico
E tu non te ne accorgi neppure ubriaca come me entrambi,
Senza forzature come se fossimo solo delle ombre scure
Togliamo le armature,
Sganciamo le sicure,
Ti prendo le misure,
Io lo voglio e poi tu pure
Ti si legge addosso baby,
Siamo uguali io e te, anche se, stiamo bene in tutto il mondo
Ancora non c'è, una casa o un posto veramente nostro

C'è ne di belli però
Come noi non ne faranno più
C'è ne di bravi però
Come noi ne fanno più
Forse è la sorte, forse le colpe,
Ma io questa vita non la cambierei
Ne per I soldi, ne per la fama,
Fuori dal paradiso ma insieme a lei

La strada scorre sotto le ruote
Poi sotto I piedi sotto le suole
Otto passate un quarto alle nove gente
Si muove fuori c'è il sole
Già ci spogliamo sulle scale e salire non è facile, (non è facile)
Trovare casa è un'impresa, la botta non ci è scesa
Chiavi nella toppa, apri la porta,
Entra di corsa, chiudi la porta. Tu
Fuori dal top. Io senza canotta,
Tu senza più tacchi, tolgo le Jordan baby,
Sa di Grey Goose anche il tuo shatush,
Ti prendo dai fianchi e ti tiro su
Come una touche
Ho le tue cosce sulle mie anche
Inizi ad ansimare ed io anche, anthem
Siamo meglio di cassa e rullante
Questa sintonia è sinfonia
Un intreccio di braccia e di gambe è una terapia all'istante
Su di me ne hai sentite tante,
Su di te ne ho sentite altrettante,
Ma niente corrisponde al vero
A letto anche meglio di quel che credevo
Siamo fatti, siamo fatti l'uno per l'altra,
Siamo sfatti, disfatti
L'uno sull'altra

C'è ne di belli però
Come noi non ne faranno più
C'è ne di bravi però
Come noi ne fanno più
Forse è la sorte, forse le colpe,
Ma io questa vita non la cambierei
Ne per I soldi, ne per la fama,
Fuori dal paradiso ma insieme a lei

Non riesco a farcene una colpa
Non sempre, ma capita
Dio li fa e il diavolo li accoppia
Due corpi, un'anima
Noi non andiamo in chiesa e non facciamo la spesa
Per la cena di domenica
Noi siamo in giro a bere oppure a letto insieme,
E ogni volta sembra l'ultima

C'è ne di belli però
Come noi non ne facc
C'è ne di bravi però
Come noi ne fanno più
C'è ne di belli però
Come noi non ne faranno più
C'è ne di bravi però

Raige,"Non ho bisogno di altri qui io sto bene solo
Non sono più quello di Tora-Ki vuoi che muoro,
Sta musica mi ha preso in pieno,
Quand'ero un adolescente
È stato più o meno l'incontro
Tra il colpo di fulmine e un incidente, wow
All'inizio era tutto, bello di brutto,
Più dell'amore in coppia, com'è l'amore in gruppo
Ma poi, scatta una molla gente si accolla chiacchiera e mormora
Come in un bar, vita da star, dentro una bolla finché non scoppia
Io ho iniziato a scrivere,
Per evadere, dal mal di vivere senza un piano e senza immagine,
Ma qua quello che conta sono le views,
Io non ci views più
Io proprio non vi views

Ho dato tutto e adesso che sono qui
Mi dici basterebbe tanto così
Così,
Così,
Tu vuoi che muoro come Joe Bastianich

Ho dato tutto e adesso che sono qui
Mi dici basterebbe tanto così
Così,
Così,
Tu vuoi che muoro come Joe Bastianich

Vuoi che muoro,
Mettiti in fila insieme alla gente che prima mi ammira
e dopo mi sputa alle spalle un misto di veleno e saliva, wow
Sto in questo ambiente da un po',
Prima ci si odia poi ci si spompina come il Geordie Shore
Per l'odio contattatemi pure,
Per il resto no fatti gonfiare le guance il Rap
non è la cosa più grande che ho
Perché è ciò che muove la penna a fare di uno scrittore
uno scrittore il resto è fumo e paranoie
A farti trascinare corri il rischio di dimenticare giri
su te stesso e ti allontani come una spirale
E io non voglio farlo
A me sta roba deve tanto
Come a nessun altro

Ho dato tutto e adesso che sono qui
Mi dici basterebbe tanto così
Così,
Così,
Tu vuoi che muoro come Joe Bastianich

Ho dato tutto e adesso che sono qui
Mi dici basterebbe tanto così
Così,
Così,
Tu vuoi che muoro come Joe Bastianich

Continua il Rap è serotonina,
è l'unica medicina che mi motiva
Anche se in fondo non mi cambia la vita,
Anche se mangio tutta la merda che mangiavo prima

Ho dato tutto e adesso che sono qui
Mi dici basterebbe tanto così
Così,
Così,
Tu vuoi che muoro come Joe Bastianich

Ho dato tutto e adesso che sono qui
Mi dici basterebbe tanto così

Raige,"Per come parli della verità
Sembra quasi una formula
Ma, qualcosa non va, non va

Scrivo di me,
Perché a parlarne sono meno bravo,
Se no col Rap manco ci provavo
Quando ho iniziato c’era spirito di aggregazione
E mi sentivo libero, immaginazione
Sta roba della musica era un salvagente
Tora-Ki ne è la prova vivente, si sente
Guardo i miei dischi e la mia vita mi passa davanti
In un niente come prima di un incidente
Uh, mi sono fatto da me, mi sono fatto uomo,
E nessuno mi ammazza se non mi ammazzo da solo
Come Kurt Cobain, ora che mi servi dove cazzo sei
Vado a letto tardi, mi alzo presto e dormo poco
Perché quando chiudo gli occhi comincia di nuovo
Sogno che cado nel vuoto senza fermarmi o schiantarmi
La maledizione di un eterno volo

Ammazzo il tempo ma alla fine lui mi ucciderà
Ogni secondo ogni momento è l’ultima chance
La gente che c’è qua,
Pensa di avere tutta la verità
Ma c’è qualcosa che nessuno sa
Tranne me (qualcosa che nessuno sa tranne me)
(Tranne me)

Faccio l’artista ho sempre voluto farlo
Uso la sinistra come il diavolo, come Picasso
Mai avuto una bella grafia,
Curavo solo il contenuto, solo contro tutti
Lontano dai cliché,
Come un asceta scrivo come nessuno su questo pianeta
E non aspetto che mi ammazzi il tempo
Qui nessuno mi dà ciò che merito, quindi me lo prendo
Quanto è difficile vivere facendo canzoni
Ma io non cerco scuse trovo soluzioni
Ho fatto i dischi senza mega produzioni
Tu fai schifo pure coi milioni, 47 Ronin
E mia madre sorride, quando vede la mia faccia in 16:9
Nelle trasmissioni
Ma è ciò che trasmetto nelle canzoni
A renderla fiera di me tutti i giorni, tutti i giorni

Ammazzo il tempo ma alla fine lui mi ucciderà
Ogni secondo ogni momento è l’ultima chance
La gente che c’è qua,
Pensa di avere tutta la verità ma c’è qualcosa che nessuno sa
Tranne me (qualcosa che nessuno sa tranne me)
(Tranne me)

A casa mia siamo schiavi come Once Were Warriors
Io come i miei avi ho solo palle e orgoglio
Voglio andare da mia madre con sei buste della Coop
Piene di pezzi da cento
E farle sorridere gli occhi,
Malinconica come mio nonno quando suonava l’armonica
Oggi la retorica ci gonfia come bodyguard
Ma i sani stanno solo in Paradiso e a Nova Gorica
Io non scrivo stronzo, ti faccio il film in testa
Scegliti un posto prenditi i popcorn
Pensi di saperne molto
Ma sul mio conto è più quello che non vedi come un soft porno
Non ho mai provato a mettere tutti d’accordo,
Con la musica che faccio o con quello che racconto
Finché rappo (come rappo),
Lebron Raige io vi schiaccio, tutti, sotto

Per come parli della verità
Sembra quasi una formula
Ma, qualcosa non va, non va",Nessuno
Raige,"Finalmente libero da quelle facce di merda
Adesso volo Icaro a quattro spanne da terra
Mi hanno tenuto appeso per un anno una tortura
Ma alla fine, ciò che non mi uccide me lo suca
Alex Andrea Vella nessuno più lo ferma
Se Dio vuole, e se non vuole pazienza
Non ho mai perso tempo, non ho mai perso il tempo

Tu sfrutti il momento e sto momento sta finendo
Chiariamo il punto, sono partito col mio gruppo
Che eravamo in tutto, meno dei reduci di Woodstock
Se adesso siamo centinaia, di migliaia,
Lo devi sopratutto al Rap di classe operaia
Vengo da Torino la Detroit italiana
Quindi non fare il figo non sei Tony Montana
Sembri più Hannah Montana,
Ti schiaccio quando rappo come in NBA
Puoi chiamarmi Lebron Raige

Sedici barre dieci metriche, se dici me, dici Rap
Vedi che, gli altri qua le fanno tutte identiche
Lucidi le Jordan, lucida la corda
E poi lasciati andare a penzolare dalla porta
Si dai per carità, gioco un altro campionato la mia è serie A
Un minimo di serietà
Io sono il Baggio del Rap, guarda che tacco fra
Sono sua maestà, tu lustrami le scarpe sciuscià
Lei me lo sciuscia, madame, me gusta
Ho il genio nella lampo se solo ci si struscia
Una cattiva cera e una brutta, sbronza
Questa è la mia era la tua è c’era una volta
Il meglio del meglio in circolazione
Sono tutto flow e cattiva reputazione

Raige,"Le panchine vuote, Facebook pieno
La tecnologia si muove, perdiamo terreno
Internet riduce le distanze
Parliamo con tutti dalle nostre stanze, ma le ampliate anche
Se mi affaccio sul pianerottolo non so il nome dei miei vicini
Se non fosse che i figli ascoltano rap e mi seguono sui social
Non saprei nemmeno il nickname di quei due bambini
Ci ostiniamo a vivere la vita degli altri
Che siano attori, calciatori o cantanti
Come se il mondo fosse tutto delle persone importanti
E noi sotto, piccoli e ignoranti
A conti fatti siamo tutti quanti politeisti
Nuove piramidi, antichi egizi
Più andiamo avanti più spegniamo il potenziale
Ma una stella per splendere ha bisogno di bruciare

Nel futuro breve più immediato
Il vero lusso è la felicità
Senza fiato, senza contatto
Con il cuore spaccato a metà
Io sono buono solamente a scrivere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa farei per vederti vivere

In questo nulla cosmico siamo granelli di sabbia
Attaccati a brandelli di speranza
Siamo fatti tutti della stessa sostanza
Al 70 per cento di acqua
Quindi se il sole fosse al posto di Giove
Brucerebbe le persone senza fare distinzione
Tra le ricche e le povere, sconosciute o famose
Senza nulla togliere, Darwin non aveva ragione
Siamo fermi al Medioevo con l’evoluzione
Lo sguardo verso il cielo cerca una soluzione
Ma a forza di guardare solo verso l’alto
Ci siamo dimenticati di ciò che succede in basso

Nel futuro breve più immediato
Il vero lusso è la felicità
Senza fiato, senza contatto
Con il cuore spaccato a metà
Io sono buono solamente a scrivere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa farei per vederti vivere

I giorni passano tutti uguali
Cambiano solo i numeri nei calendari
Dimentichiamo di essere speciali
Diventiamo stupidi, abitudinari
Diventiamo un’ arma, un’altra predica
Poi si guarda in alto, chi ci salverà?
Se le risposte piovessero, gli ombrelli sarebbero
Al contrario come per colpa del vento
Abbiamo i telescopi puntati sull’universo
E nemmeno una lente di ingrandimento per riuscire a guardarci dentro
Se il cielo si spegnesse tutto domani
E Dio dall’alto ci guardasse, noi saremmo li a nascondere
I nostri errori, il nostro essere umani
Pregando perché il mondo che conosciamo per corrompere
Non ci arriveremo neanche, lontanamente
A pensare che le luci elettriche
Viste al buio sono come le stelle
Viste da sopra sembrano come stelle
Sono come le stelle
Sono come le stelle

Nel futuro breve più immediato
Il vero lusso è la felicità
Senza fiato, senza contatto
Con il cuore spaccato a metà
Io sono buono solamente a scrivere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa darei per vederti ridere
Cosa farei per vederti vivere",Stelle
Raige,"Come Ulisse
Sarei capace di girare il mondo
Anche se il mondo finisse
Io tornerei come Ulisse

M hanno insegnato che in amore vince chi fugge
E quando c'hai una convinzione
Ti ci attacchi con le unghie
Infatti corro come Bolt
Sempre col cuore in gola
Non sai quanti padri in casa c'hanno una pistola
Io non volevo, finire impallinato
Come un trofeo in un salotto, un animale impagliato
Ma l'occasione, fa l uomo ladro
E da quando ti ho vista mi sento strano
Perche tutto cambiato

Se tu fossi stata qui dentro casa
Io quella porta non l'avrei aperta mai
È un dettaglio quando sei cominciata
Quello che conta è quanto continuerai

Sarei capace di girare il mondo
Anche se il mondo finisse
Se questa nave dovesse andare a fondo oppure il mare sparisse
Io per te giuro che troveró un modo
E tornerei come Ulisse

Guardo nello specchio, mi devo riprendere
Nel mio quartiere ho una reputazione da difendere
Ma poi ti vedo scendere, in tiro per la sera
E più che uno sciupafemmine sembro un anima in pena
Chissa cos è che fai, chissa dov è che vai
Come è che quando ci incontriamo non mi parli mai
Sei sempre cosi seria, ma bella anche da seria,
Sei bella da arrabbiata insomma sei bella vera, bella mia!
Le provo tutte per farti mia
Ti racconto una storia e dopo vado via
Parla di Penelope e della sua tela e di me stasera che

Raige,"Non so se lo ricordi
Per me è come se fosse oggi
Pioveva cosi forte che quasi non riuscivi ad aprire gli occhi
E abbiamo trovato riparo in centro
Le vetrine affianco, le luci dietro
E ci sembrava di essere a Londra
Uno stronzo e una stronza
Prima di allora era come se non ci fossimo mai toccati
Forse sfiorati come il cielo coi prati
Io ti ho preso la mano e ti ho detto andiamo
Nessuno ci da ciò che meritiamo
Noi ce lo prendiamo, non mi aspetto che mi credi, voglio che ti fidi
Corriamo il rischio di essere felici, che dici?
Se, se capitasse pure a noi di non aver paura
C’è differenza tra sollevarsi e volare abbi fiducia di me

In ogni attimo che c’è
In ogni attimo di me e di te
Fino a togliere l’ombra al sole su Londra, quando sorridi per me
Quando sorridi per me
Quando sorridi per me

Non so se lo ricordi, per me è come se fosse oggi
Riconoscerei i tuoi occhi tra un milione di altri occhi
E mentre camminavamo nel centro ho avuto l’impressione che mi tenessi più stretto
Soli io e te a notte fonda, che ci fotte di Londra?

Prima di allora era come se non ci fossimo visti mai 
Ognuno troppo preso a pensare ai suoi guai
E allora tu ti sei fermata sbarrando la strada
Mi hai detto la fiducia non si presta, va data
Quindi se vuoi che io mi fidi togli la maschera
Sei molto meglio se sorridi

Se, se capitasse pure a noi di non aver paura
C’è differenza tra sollevarsi e volare
Abbi fiducia di me
In ogni attimo che c'è
In ogni attimo di me e di te
Fino a togliere l'ombra al sole su Londra, quando sorridi per me
Quando sorridi per me
Quando sorridi per me

E tu mi hai visto con la forza di un vulcano
Gridare il mio coraggio fino a perdere il fiato
E poi mi hai visto piangere come un bambino 
Con la paura di perdere tutto, anche il respiro
Io ti ho vista con la forza di un vulcano 
gridare il tuo coraggio fino a perdere il fiato
E poi ti ho vista piangere, bambina
Con la paura di perdere tutto, come prima

Se, se capitasse pure a noi di non aver paura
C’è differenza tra sollevarsi e volare

Com o suor de nossos corpos chegamos onde estamos
Espalhando nossas idéias de norte a sul, leste oeste

Os filhos vão se criando sem pegar amor ao pai

Ele tem um headphone onde só toca ska

É por isso que o marujo nunca deve se casar

Vou contar uma estória para o povo sertanejo
É sobre um maconheiro que nasceu no Ceará
Ele veio pra Brasília e comeu uma mulher
Logo que teve uma filha chamou de Maria José
Mas o tempo foi passando e ele teve que se alistar
Escolheu logo a marinha pois nunca tinha visto o mar
Sua mulher desesperada não parava de rezar
É porque o Zé Pereira não sabia nem nadar

Você deve pensar que eu sou broxa ou que eu sou gay
Mas pra provar tudo que eu sinto
Estou sozinho e sem ninguém pra mim amar.

Eu queria ser o banquinho da bicicleta
Pra ficar bem no meio das pernas
E sentir o seu ânus suar
Eu queria ser a calcinha daquela menina
Pra ficar bem perto da vagina
E às vezes até me molhar
Mas eu não sei o que se passa nesta cabecinha
É claro que é a da minha
Você não pode duvidar
Fica quieto
Não me deixe envergonhado
Pois se eu ficar excitado a minha calça vai estourar

We weren't our problems, our age or our paychecks

That's when I know I should just drop everything and let her sing

She has never forgotten a name or a punch line 
She is the one that I have chosen 
I'm lost but she's found

War Chaos I'm Berufsverkehr

Daß schon so früh die Stoßzeit is

In the moment of the handgun, I'm waiting for you to come
The moment of trust when you turn into dust.

We're forced into a position of knowledge it's true
But you are lying when your claiming that this has nothing to do with you
And as the old rhyme runs stop selling those killing guns.
The importance of a reputation has gone way of the limits
You're in use of rehabilitation instead of a switchblade.
And as the old rhyme runs stop selling those killing guns

I'm singing this song to prevent a storm.. It's been in my head since I was born.
This is a great invention I'm doing it with a good intention
I'm singing this song to the everdawn... Cause I feel sad when you're gone.
This is a slug of friendship on our relationship.. On our relationship

I'm watching the picture tube filled with violence
I'm watching everyone answering this with silence
And as the old rhyme runs stop selling those killing guns
The glamorous surface that you're provided with is just disturbance and we're lost in the grid.
And as the old rhyme runs stop selling those killing guns

I'm singing this song to prevent a storm.. It's been in my head since I was born.
This is a great invention I'm doing it with a good intention

This is salutation to the prevailing pioneers

From all the nonsense that ugly mouths are spitting out.

I want to reside here
I think I want to die here.

To see you scamper brings me joy
To feed you with my thoughts brings me pleasure
It's hard to keep it up every season
But the support from you is pushing us hard

We are ready for a big reversal.
This is for real this is not rehearsal

I think I want to die here.

I hope we never fall into disuse
I hope the scene won't resolve.

",Reversal
Raised Fist,"Are you wasting your time taking care of everyone just to be nice.
It's time to turn into the average guy stupid and selfish and mean to everyone.
I'm wasting my time being nice feels just like disguise
To truly forgive your next takes a lot more than reading this text.

Be numb and dumb and nothing but a bum and at least you'll survive in this world of hate.

How shall we act curse at unknown and hug our friends
It's time to realize that war starts where friendship ends.

Remember that it takes two to make a fight
And if you continue to argue doesn't mean your right.
Why is it so important for you to show your anger
You don't have to finish everything in a second.

Roofed by wood put there for nothing
Breathing hot air threatened by the deadly sun
Let us set sail lets listen to
The screams of suffering and pain from you.

Don't listen to the things they've told
Rising knives in the search for more gold
Rituals strong as your death
Nearly wiped away in one breath.

To take care. To take care.
To take care. To take care.

Rituals strong as your death
Wiped away in one breath
Think of what you've done
The revenge will come with the sun.

And I'm so glad that you're not hostile, that you're wearing a smile & care less about style
I want to be just like you, just like you

Among all the places, a million faces but I'll never meet someone like you
Bleeding on the stage when we disengage the happiness that we possess
And I am so glad that you'll never turn into a stranger
I'm keeping you in my mind everyday, when I'm far away and when I feel deranged

I'm so glad that you're still the same, with the same name. I love the person you became
I want to be just like you, just like you

She was trapped to the shit like glue.
Infuriated by the problems at his work.

And let his anger run the way up her back, 
A disgusting attack and then everything went black.

Shut your mouth and feel the pain.
You're a prisoner at your domain. 
Where no one can hear you complain 
You're locked away in chains and emotions doesn't help you (now).

When he promise it won't be the same. 
It takes a couple of days then you feel ashamed again,

And your so called friends pretends like they can't see it, 
They defend the bastard until the end and when it hurts me 
I can only imagine how it hurts you.

With the help of Christianity
And a weak touch of insanity

Turn the music up and feel the groove

1 - Turn it up, and let's all groove
Turn it up, let your body move
Turn it up, let the rock sound
Turn it up, when it shakes the ground
Turn it up, when ya feel alone
Turn it up, let the volume flow
Turn it up, if it feels good
Turn it up, when you know you should

Why don't you just take a while to enjoy yourself, for yourself
Cause you sure deserve a break today
Don't put off 'till tomorrow, why wait another day
Cause every spirit needs some time to play

This feelin' feels so good, you don't wanna let it go
Step into the rhythm, let it flow
Don't matter who you are, the beat makes ya move
Just turn the music up and you will feel the groove

Repeat 1

Yo, this one's dedicated to them real niggaz

To my homies in the streets
Yellin' nella's in the trees
To all y'all fools gettin' beats
(Turn it up, turn it up)

To the cuties in the house
To the hatecha's at the mall
To the brothers playin' basketball
(Turn it up, turn it up)

To the playas and the macs
Gangsta leanin' in them cadillacs
And all them tricks on their backs
(Turn it up, turn it up)

To the pimps and the hoes
To the gangstas and the gigolos
Come y'all and all the rest of y'all nigga-roes
(Turn it up, turn it up)

At the beach in the sand
With a lover hand in hand
Come on yo, that sounds like a plan
(Turn it up, turn it up)

At the park on a picnic
To the fellow with the biggest dick
Don't thik about comin' quick
There's gonna be somebody shovin' in this motha fuck'

All the feaks in the club
Yo, y'all show the DJ some love
He's the one that you're thinkin' of

To the cronies in the 'hood
If you doin' like you should
Where Jimmy Brown on wood

Ho, yo nigga, I don't give a damn

Rakaa,"Moshpit rowdy, party people shouting
Crazy in the crowd but the silence is the loudest
When Babs cuts the beat my ears still ringing
The emptiness is deafening, the houselights beaming
And the fans start leaving and the man starts sweeping
It all seems surreal like I can't stop dreaming
Bartenders and the soundman cleaning
But minutes ago people were dancing on the ceiling
Fiending for that buzz 'til the dawn breaks night
I crash barely with the high but I still take flight
Fighting isolation but I won't chase the fame
But moths can't help it, born to chase the flame
Twists up and sips up and to erase the same
Darkness served with the bitter taste of pain
Raised in Hollywood but real life is more than stranger
It's the sun shining from my California manger

I never thought that life was gonna be this way
But every battle I fight makes me stronger ever day
And Lord knows I've been through some low valleys
Even though my clothes are torn, my pride is strong
I'm still king in my crown of thorns

I cipher to the team, mixtape to a family
I battled the hustler's hand with my life, gambling
Redirection is the key to fifty-two choose one
Baby born with black magic, maybe time to use some
Now I'm the only thing stopping me
Elders told me ""walk free"" when they gave me prophecy
But that option was not to be
Though I did know it can be difficult to talk to me
Yeah we could have done more probably
But we did what we did do properly
Now I'm older than I thought I'd be
I'm holding less property and money flowing awkwardly
But blessed with a spiritual empire
Inspired to purify em, I just fan the flames and fuel the fire
Tick-tock, no time to live life scared
Spread my arms like Christian Hosoi, Christ Air

I never thought that life was gonna be this way
But every battle I fight makes me stronger ever day, yes it does
And Lord knows I've been through some low valleys
Even though my clothes are torn, my pride is strong
I'm still king in my crown of thorns

In the room full of mirrors I sit and reflect
So I can correct any defects
Ev told me I could be more emo
Then I just laughed and said f**k that, we need more Primo
He nodded in agreement, ashes on the cement
Feet to the pavement walking on the deep end
Messiah footprints all over the industry
No love for the enemy, rappers are puppets
Look close just see the cables
Look up you see the hand
Look back you see the labels
De facto lawyer learn to read the fine print
Learned the Latin and Shakespearian that contract's in
Expansion team still scoring at will
Angel's the old Cristo Redentor in Brazil
Even so low the family that I brought is real
F**k the rumours, Dilated got it on lock still

I never thought that life was gonna be this way
But every battle I fight makes me stronger ever day, yes it does
And Lord knows I've been through some low valleys
Even though my clothes are torn, my pride is strong
I'm still king in my crown of thorns",Crown of Thorns
Rakim,"What yo 
Just when things seemed the same  and the whole scene is lame 
I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains till things change 
They strain to slang sling  I'm trained to bring game 
History that I arranged been regained by King James 
Go to practice  with tactics  when the track hits  theatrics 
Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's 
Stacks of mathematics took the ?ego-a-geatics? 
As I find out, what the facts is, for geographic 
No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is 
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers 
While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious 
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses 
Shine permanently only my mind's concerning me 
Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity 
Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary 
Determinedly advance technology better than Germany 
Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over 
I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah 
From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom 
Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn 
From the ancient Hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures 
I study I know the scriptures but nowadays ain't it vicious 
Date back I go beyond check the holy Qu'ran 
To speeches at the altar on, now we get our party on 
So being beneficent, I bless em with dialogue 
They expecting, the next testament by the God 
I blow em through battle zones with chrome for chaperon 
Blast beats with saxophones one of the baddest rapper's known 
Every country city and borough, side street and ghetto 
Isle and alley and meadow theories fertile enough to echo 
When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man 
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan 
Since the world's metamorphosis, and the plan is kept in orbit 
Turntables we spin off but the needles never skip off it 
Rhythms we expressing similar to our ancestors 
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message 
From the days of the slave choppers?, to the new age of prophets 
As heavy as hip-hop is I'm always ready to drop it 
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs 
And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme

Rakim,"""Once again back is the incredible""

Yeah, yeah
It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashing hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up, and play it loud
Hip-Hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dance floors just stop, the spot's scorching hot
Hoping I open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar smoking ten dollar cigars
While I admire midas, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catching diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slamming track
Rocking jams by popular demand, I'm back

[Chorus]
I control the crowd, you know I hold it down
When it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world reknowned
And I rock New York City all year around

Check it out
It's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open fill it with something potent to go in
And take a toke then, mental planes start floating
Hot science is smoking altitudes cause choking
Product is hypnotic you're soaking and still smoking
Showing better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumping
I'ma move crowds to 2000

[Chorus]

Yo, my rhymes and lyrics, find spirits like a seance
Since fat Cray-ons, I write and display chaos
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam
I take advantage, until the crowd go bananas
What a rush I hear cuts then I lust to touch
Microphones get clutched by the illustrious
Word spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be dropping this
Some of the things I know, will be in your next Bible
When I die go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt manifest was write rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic

[Chorus: x2]

""Once again, back is the incredible"" 
Word up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back, ya know what I mean?

Follow procedures, the crowd couldn't wait to see this
Nobody been this long awaited since Jesus
Who wouldn't believe this, I heard the word on the street is
I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
with Mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics
Cause new days is dawning, new ways of performing
Brainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning
On and on and, I got the whole world responding
Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning
The Emperor, well known for, inventing a sentence
full of adventure, turning up the temperature
Rush with adrenaline, how long has it been again
to be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?

When I'm out propping, either, hanging or shopping
People see me stop and ask me when the album dropping
The wait is over, in-formation like a soldier
like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older
I broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge, is not to explode in violence
I'm Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit
At least once during the course of a day, it's automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharoah
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me
You know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recital, taught disciples
A sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that's trifle, I'm busting these for you
Hey yo, technical difficulties is through

""It's been a long time""
""Rakim, the microphone soloist""
""It's been a long time""

When I float at night, I show em new heights, I go to write
They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
Critics and biters, don't know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now
cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
So be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb
Like, 3-D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom
Info kept like ""internet.com""
My note-book's my bond like the Holy Qu'ran
Since I came in the door, said it before
But no I ain't down with Eric B. no more
At night the open mic be inviting me to rhyme
So yo I'm online, it's been a long time

Rakim,"[Chorus: x2]
If you can see if you can solve the mystery
The answer revolves around your history
So carefully, I drop this degree
Scientifically, and realistically (Who is God?)

In eternal blackness, in the midst of the darkest night
Proteins and minerals, exist within specks of light
Solids liquids and gases, and sparks of light within
Infinite lengths and widths and depths and heights
No beginning or ending, the seven dimensions
Enough space for more than a million words and inventions
To travel through time within enough room to be the womb
Of the most high's great mind which he will soon make shine
With intelligent elements in sight that he will gather
In the realms of relativity electricity struck matter
Energies explode he below to keep releasing
Atoms by the millions, til the numbers increasing
Til it was burning he kept returning itself to the source
The hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force
He gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws
All caused by his mental intercourse, who is God?

[Chorus]

He began to explain his craft, the master in the attic
He dealt with measurements his language, was mathematics
His theoretical wisdom of the numerical system
The complete number nine which means born or existed
He gave birth to all planets, inorganic, and organic
So you wouldn't take it for granted
They rotated they own distance around the sun
And fully submit to the existence of one
And each one was promised everlasting perfection
If each one keeps spinning in the same direction
To the East, and each speak the motion of peace
And harmony, and each show devotion to teach
The universe is to come, the whole world must go according
Know your galaxies and mirages stars start falling
So stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound
Like the planets each cipher remains perfectly round

[Chorus]

From unconsciousness, to consciousness
By knowledging his wisdom his response is this
A understanding, which is the best part
He picked the third planet where new forms of life would start
He pursued show and prove every move in order
Back to the source he let off his resources in the water
Climb his climax, where the climate is at, high degrees
See he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas
And the plan is, to lay in the clays to form land
And expand, usin the same clays to born man
In his own image our origin begins in the East
Culture rise to breed, with the powers of peace
Deal in equality nature's policy is to be God
Build or destroy positively born life like Allah
And each one was given everlasting perfection
If each one keep living in the same direction
And life was life, and love was love
We went according by the laws of the world above
They showed us physically, we could reach infinity
But mentally, through the century we lost our identity
Life start and ending, we got trife and started sinning
Lost touch with the beginning now ciphers stop spinning
And what was once easy became confused and hard
Which brings us back, to the mystic question, who is God?
Sixty-six trillion years since his face was shown
When the seventh angel appears, the mystery will be known
Check Revelations and Genesis, St. Luke and John
It even tells us we are Gods in the Holy Qu'ran
Wisdom Strength and Beauty, one of the meanings of God
G.O.D. you and me Gomars O Dubar
Knowledge Wisdom Understanding Sun Moon and Star
Man Woman and Child, and so is Allah

[Chorus]

Bear witness to Allah, gave birth to all
For Allah was all, and therefore, life itself
And the universe gave birth to man
The universe was man, and man was the universe
And the universe was always existed
And existence was life
And life is Allah
And Allah had no beginning because he is, what always was

Hey yo, once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets, you see stress
Streets a matter of life and death, no regrets
Life's a test, strife, wit special effects
Neighborhood's full of reps, cities are projects
Where the young cadets get stripes from the vets
And comrades quest to be the next, to fitness 
Collect debts and select bets with death threats
Object, chedder, better your total net
Where trends are set from ways to express the outfits
Friends get wet tryin' to make ends connect
Avenues to check, boulevards to sweat
The smell of gun smoke more common than cigarettes

We got clicks for wreck
We like Pits for pets
We got Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets
We like much respect and sex extra wet
And high-tech dialect you ain't catch yet

The Bronx,
Ya out there?
No doubt
Brooklyn,
Ya out there?

Hey yo, we got blocks and glocks with
Big shots with big knots and big props
Yo this is where the bullshit stops
Where herbs get got, if you snitch you get shot
We get down and leave the town in a state of shock
We got dangerous hang out spots and slick cops
Place called Riker's Island where kids get locked
A lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops
Styles are top notch, this is the place to watch
So bust the box, the radio station is Hot
Ease your mind staring at skylines from rooftops
Flip scripts for chips, and new whips off the lot
Quick to call a shot, politic with thick plots
And the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got
To make sure the core of the Big Apple don't rot
Where seeing's believing, we be achieving a lot
Since disc jocks created hip hop, check it out!

Queens, ya out there? 
No doubt
Manhattan? 
No doubt
New York City, Staten Island
New York, New York, Long Island
New York, ya out there?

Hey yo, we got five boroughs of ghettos
With many places to meet, you get lost in city streets
The city that never sleeps
Mecca, Medina the population increase
The desert and the oasis, New York, the far East
With Gods and Sheiks, pretty Amazons for weeks
Player dons that fleece the family's black sheep
Icons that teach that we all act unique
We got stats to reach so we all have to eat
A mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece
The crafts elite, we going past the beat
The latest technique no other place get as deep
Who parks release some of the worlds greatest athletes
DJ's and MC's and graffiti artists
Who use walls and subway trains for marquees 
We go back to B-boys, break dancing, break beats
And it'll never cease, and on that note, we say peace",New York (Ya Out There)

Turn the beat up, I get lost in the mind come across
The rhyme kick my feet up, then I find myself in time
I was on a train, destination Marley Marl's domain
I entertained things'll never be the same
DJ's are conveyed if the label OK it
Teddy Ted and Special K was the first ones to play it
On the radio, with the crazy flow
I pay dues until it pays me dough to do a show
When I'm at the helm I cover the whole realm
In control and leave your soul overwhelmed
Another influence of beats and instruments
Lyrics make it intricate and elements are tense
When you was playing Pac Man it was the jams I packed
Peeps would swarm when I was perform in, black I'm all that
Back before they turned hip-hop to rap
It always a place to party at, remember that?

I remember the spots that used to be hot
Just like the roof top, a place that only few can rock
On a wild ass block, yeah you find me there a lot
Until you hear gunshots, that's when the fun stops
Here come the cops, time to go home, get in order
Cause I'll be back in Manhattan if somethings happening at the Latin Quarter
House of havoc when it came to fourteen carat
And if you had it yeah kids'd try to grab it
It's cool at the Red Parrot we was doing it there
I was the first one to rip it at the Union Square
Me and DJ Red Alert did work
A crazy concert, a lot of kids got hurt
I did encores at the Encore, they wanted more
I kicked a freestyle til I heard the crowd roar
Like the Funhouse, Bronx Center never ending black
Place to be was the Brooklyn Armory, remember that?

Remember that? [Repeat: x3]

Open the door, let the crowds in, over twenty thousand
Wilding music's loud and microphone's growling
Tickets are sold out, parties is packed and on tour
Ripping basketball arenas back then
Even after parties, posses of players and hotties
Everybody was Gotti, spreading bucks like shotties
Spending cash, to make a good time last
Thoughts that I had give me a blast of the past
Memories of unforgettable times on my mind
Dollar signs and melodies and incredible rhymes
The people I met, and the sets that got wrecked
All the mics I checked, most of all life's effects
And peace to all the people I grew up around
In the streets back when beats had a rougher sound
I used to be wild me and my crew sit back and we smile
Keep piles of pictures filed in case I go senile
Cause some things are just too good to be forgot
Like your neighborhood block or your favorite spot
Certain records always seem to make me reminisce
And when it hits, and then it clicks, remember this
My life flashed before me I'm there from the sounds
I hear pinpoint the year, it's perfectly clear
I like the way it went down and Allah that, in fact
It mean a lot, cause you can't bring it back, remember that

Properly push pens, and show quality gems
The horrors be grim, but yo maybe tomorrow we win
If we follow the trends and keep count of the dollars we spend
I want a mahogany Benz, I want lottery ends
I want property, friends, plus my hobby is skins
If I get sloppy and sin, then my prophesy ends
But the God'll begin, watching my artistry spin

Territory was made for me to pursue glory
Blast alone masses in zones have to be sewn

I'm the star in this, which means the author's authentic

My science existed, without the fiction
Every inscription is a special edition

Mega-thesis, blessing these kids with extra features
The depth's deep as, the deepest sea is
Telepathy increases melody gets speakers, telekinesis
Ideas appear as clear as, pictures in movie theaters
Lyrics you hear it, devastating the way you ear it
So stay tuned for sequels, part two's and more
So soon you and your peoples can bum rush the store
The names have changed the game remain the same
How one came to reign on his claim to fame
No stopping this I'm dropping this with hip-hop in this
And when the topic is topicless, then I'm writing the apocalypse

Yo, it's time to bring the day in, fresh out the crib sauteing
Around the way-in, swerve on, surveying
That's when I saw her, the kind you wanna see more of
The sexy aura, it made it hard to ignore her
Expression her possession of property skyrocket
I'm investing in her presence and in time it profits
I take a acre for you, fertilize the soil
And make it boil, til it produce black oil
The shorty sweet as, the flavor of forty divas
Photos and features, worth more than Mona Lisa's
It's lady luscious, tender touches my blood rushes
Smiles and blushes, on billboards and buses
And me, I'm just a bronze skinned calm gentleman
Slim fit and open arms mellow wit a don's grin
Ghetto disciplined, could be your confidant beyond friend
It's one of Allah's men, Rakim, show me love

Because this chick's, characteristics, mystic
Hips are thick, just a little bit of lipstick
Can't resist it, description Egyptian smile
Queen of the Nile, that means she dipped in style
She re-mind of Nefertiti, yes indeed-y
But it's hard to get it like hieroglyphic graffiti
Studied her exhibits and checked her colorful curves
Intellect with swerves I could of wrecked my nerves
That's my word, digging her enigma that exist
In a sister, carefully wrapped in her figure
We connect like a collision and hug, just to knowledge
Her wisdom, speed up my metabolism, show me love

[Chorus]

Your m.o. is hard not to notice, so my motives
Is to stay focused, body moves like aerobics
Attractions, vibes I caught came from your ways
And actions but mind frame hard to explain
No acting or mind games, but thinking of what can happen
Is migraines, the x-rated though remains
We relaxing, and you nagging me for the agony
To your anatomy, by the fractions
Your measurements, the pleasure's in every inch of your temple
I travel twenty-three million miles of your mental
Chemistry, between you and me, in harmony
Causing angles to meet, like trigonometry
Or pyramids, that's where your deepest, treasures are hid
Then it gets, odoriferous, cause I know where it is
I mastered that, cause it's easy when you react
The all-natural aphrodisiac, show me love

[Chorus: x2]

Promise you won't do me wrong
If I turn you on
Promise you'll stay all night long
Making love til dawn...",Show Me Love
Rakim,"Rakim, Clark Kent bring it on

[Repeat: x2]
What you wanna say to make me stay awhile
What you wanna say to make me wanna stay

Just me and my peeps we getting buzzed, looking for clubs
Misses with kisses and hugs, looking for love
She gotta be nice with hers, even with cooking some grub
Once I'm in I meet her friends, then I'm hooking my thugs
We'll be blowing hundreds, always knowing where the fun is
Roadrunners finding more spots than Columbus
Pocket full of phone numbers from some of the world wonders
I take my time, and find where the right one is
Smooth as jazz but more than a half, ready for math
And on a steady path, like Betty Shabazz
And when I see the whiz I'ma step to my biz
And there she is, let's see if she pass the quiz
It's appropriate we go get soaking wet
Toast, we met, become close associates
The place is ours by now I can embrace your style
So much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile

[Chorus]
Why don't you, stay a little while
Stay, stay a little while, child
Baby, why don't you, stay a little while
Stay, stay a little while, child
Baby, why don't you

We on the low mating, infiltrating, negotiating
We both be making moves and dough, M.O.'s relating
She ain't taking I want it but yo I know she waiting
I throw the bait in, and before you know we dating
I want the format, to the doormat
Contacts fast, callbacks and all that
Your deepest ecstasy see you wear accessory
Your secret recipes to your bear necessities
She real exotic body feel like Lucile Roberts
Name brand closets, culturized products
Claws like a scorpion caught me in deeper
But juice sweeter, enough to buy a two seater
Every mile I plan to have your mind beguiled
Til it informs me more than you would normally allow
Raised more than an eyebrow with a flagrant style
By now I can taste your smile, stay awhile

[Chorus]

Sometimes it's hard to fight it and not let her see me get excited
But she know I like it, she know the deal like a psychic
Mind is haunted, because I always find her on it
She know what I want, where I want, when I want it
Blowing up my Motorola, daddy you coming over?
She on the sofa, holding a remote controller
Candles burning lower, favorite dish getting colder
She hot as solar, cause I told her I wanna hold her
But her mission she sitting in one position like Yoda
A TV show is on to top it off she dead sober
Then I open the door up, and kiss her on the shoulder
She say I'm rolling, like Mr. Lover Lover
We had a hard day, ready to parlay
My thirsts they obey everything that God say
Okay let's play awhile and I'll embrace your style
So much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile

[Chorus]",Stay a While
Rakim,"Yes yes y'all, check it out y'all [Repeat: x2]

[Chorus]
(Yo) I find a show, rhyme til it's time to go
I'm designed to blow, my mind's inclined to flow
Yo, my M.O., making all kind of dough
From the info that Rakim show, ya know?

Yes yes y'all, I still fiend by any means
To flow, and I go through extremes don't intervene
My adventures show like a three dimensional screen
Cause I mention many things and I'm presenting many scenes
Guess I'm telegraphic, motions energetic
Better tell em forget it, cause I'm telekinetic
Crowds is screaming, I choke the mic and keep squeezing
Styles seeming like I used a thousand words without breathing
Busting techs like Russian Roulette I doubt you win
Freestyles like hand grenades without the pin
Composing, then leave the mic full of corrosion
Don't test this, or best to expects this explosion
At shows I spit flows with seven deadly venom's
Killing syllables with poisonous synonyms in em
Ideas is blowing, mics is blowing
From what I'm showing, see it, I keep it going when I'm flowing

[Chorus]

When I'm flowing, theoretically speaking like a drummer
I take you through the streets to the parks in the summer
Or illustrate, a time and place you never been in
And make you focus on the future after seeing the beginning
And my style wilds, like Miles on the trumpet
Volume dial was kind of low, need to pump it
Up another notch turn the dial til it stops
More watts you got, more things to watch
Third eye's wide open, you're focused on the theory
Keep scoping til you hear me, words is spoken clearly
It's no smokescreens on the scenes that I'm showing
Man I keep it going, damn I keep it flowing

[Chorus: x2]

Two pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic
Thoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic
Mic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet
I send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic
Now, I'm internationally known, mental capacities blown
I hope your microphone's accident prone
Raw footage is shown, but only showing scenes of my own
Leaving your peripheral vision in a zone
But not the twilight, from the insight that I write
And recite, in my mic'll be bright, cause I like
The night glowing, it's out of sight when I'm showing
Man I keep it going, damn I keep it flowing

[Chorus: x2]

Yo, accurate tactics ""Make Em Clap to This""
When I ""Move the Crowd"", my ""Rhythm"" still don't miss
Breeze through melodies cause ""It's Been A Long Time""
My ""Lyrics"" is ""Fury"" and rappers hate to hear me rhyme
Every antidote that I quote, is ""No Joke""
Nobody's smiling ""In The Ghetto"" from the notes I wrote
My high techniques wreck and disrespect beats
Have you ""Follow-in The Leader"" up and down the streets
So ""Kick Along"" as I rip a song with pull
As the rhyme goes on I get ""Paid In Full""
It's Rakim, I'm indicating rhymes for the showing
Check it out y'all, I keep it going when I'm flowing

[Chorus: x2]

Straight up, Rakim Allah the Fiend of the Microphone still flowing
You know? One love to ? coming through your living room soon, straight up
? one love
The whole tri-state, one love
Rakim Allah baby, ya know?
It's on, what, check it out y'all, check it out",When I'm Flowin
Rakim,"What are you giving them back?

I think what I'm giving them back man is 
What they been waiting for ya know what I mean? 

Skills",Intro
Rakim,"What is, the one, main thing that you have
That you would want people to remember you by?
Or not one but the, those things that are dear to you
That you would, want to be remembered as

I guess, I guess it's my words man, you know what I mean?
Just my words, and, if people remember my words
They'll remember me forever you know?
God by nature mind raised in Asia, you know?

But umm, it's like you know to live forever you you you gotta
Set you know, not not set trends but you gotta
Apply yourself a certain way and you gotta do certain things you know?
Maybe, maybe when I'm gone twenty years from now
Somebody might be tellin', tellin' they little son
""Oh yo you think shorty bad? Yo I 'member this cat way back
In like nineteen-ninety, kid named Rakim, bananas""

You know what I'm sayin'?
If that can happen man, I'm aight man, you know?
I got, I got, I got kids you know?
They gonna, they gonna umm, finish this for
Me anyway you know what I'm sayin'?
So regardless, you know the legacy lives
But umm as far as the masses just remember my words straight up

Rakim,"I'm back! The god remains, still at the end 
They sabotage the game, still I'm a win 
Rakim Allah's the name, and with a pen 
No one can dodge the rain, kill 'em again 
In a club or the streets I swerve, cool in the cut 
Looking to see what occurs, crusin' the truck 
Shorty got deadly curves, soothin' her up 
If I must explain with words, I smooth as a fuck! 
The world's most greatest, hip-hop's elite 
You obsolete, you cannot compete, drop the beat 
Keep ya ear to the ground when I rock the street 
Cock the heat, we deep, papi got to eat 
So cut on the mic and spit, I much rougher 
Plenty of ice and a whip, plus a crusher 
Because I don't like to stick, or bust a brother 
Long as they never forget I'm a ill mother fucker 
  
So if you love to get your party on 
And you feel that your game is strong 
And you get mad when the broads is gone 
You like it all-night-long 
And when they love it when the place is warm 
And they go out for their favorite song 
They hate when the player game is wrong 
They like it all-night-long 
  
My caliber's out rated 
Yeah, player, so why hate it?
My rhyme through, out of control when I say it 
Spit back with a rap or gat, can I spray it
How can I say it? I leave it dehydrated 
I take aim, and he keep the place flamin' 
Till the place cave in, hey yo, this ain't a safe haven 
  
The best is yet to come, so they stay in 
They keep the music loud, the lights is low 
The kid with a different style, I like to flow 
It's time to move the crowd, tonight's the show 
See what it's all about, they like to go 
Get Henny and Mo and Cris, the clothes, the platinum, gold, the wrist 
Plenty of dough, and chicks who pose for flicks 
Women who love roll their hips when I'm holding this 
  
My mic's equipped with a microchip, with a million megs 
Bite this I might flip, spread a billion plagues 
Put medicine in it before I kill ya dead 
You can get away if you can fill your legs 
Could you walk? No, at least you thought though 
Auto fours blow a hole in your torso 
Damage his brain with more flow until he talk slow 
Try to say something now? I thought so! 
I leave emcee's bleeding while I'm fleeing across sea, and 
Start breeding, double my Swiss cheese in Sweden 
Free on the weekend, come back see if he breathing 
They breathing, somebody left his brains beat in 
A deadly attack is rare, style will be raw 
Be ready to rap, you'll hear, as wild as before 
If I bust a gat in the air, watch the galaxy fall 
And the world will be splat on the floor, that'll be all",All Night Long

It's a must that we lust, plus we love to crush 
Women pose, from timberland's to feminine clothes 
Check there portfolios and put'em in centerfolds

I stay calm as hell surrounded by bombshells 
Careful as I get near'em, stand near and compare 'em 
Or all girl heir 'em, I'm the man with the serum

Hey yo what's going on?
The Mic Lebanon Teflon Don,
I'm back baby
The year of the 9's
And I'ma have to make these motherfuckers a offer they can't refuse
Ya know?

Ha, what's going on?  Yo c'mon, you know it's on
I wrote a song, test my flow on the Autobahn
Make sure the force is right, I floss all night
Get off the mic it'll smoke like an exhaust pipe
Keep em in the lie-bury, studying my theory
Ra theory get translated in Swahili
From the lands as far as Zanzibar
They understand the are, the man Allah
It's obvious why the copiers, they copy this
Soon as my data processes Y2K they floppy disk
Now who the hottest is? How can it not be this?
Baby who the cockiest? Papi is? Gracias
Hey , this be so, magnifico
Even my, typical, style difficult
Make a crowd go wild when I rip a show
Better stand back, this'll blow, you didn't know?

[Chorus]
They show me love when I'm come through
Yo any club that I come to
I hit a microphone check one two
And they know what I want to do - flow forever

You ever witness rapport like this before?
It's cause y'all kiss the floor, say this my Lord
It's the chosen one, with the golden tongue
Flow for the old and young when I'm holding one
In the front row sitty, we show no pity
Where kids get jiggy and girls are so pretty
The Wanderer, back from Casablanca
To stomp all, what next for Ra the Conqueror
So let's go, the best show will explode
No dress codes, they just pose in they best clothes
Girls get exposed when I show my rap expo
Will there be a next episode?  I guess so
Those that halved out, wanted to have clout
What they mad about?  Must be a cash route
MC's switch they style from they last bout
And I bet soon as they hear this they spaz out

[Chorus: x2]

Wherever Rakim go, it's the God temple
It's simple, my M.O., no problemo
Been all over the map, even know where Hell is at
I did the welcome mat, and then welcome back
My flow is raw, they treat me like Mr. Know-it-All
They want me to show em all my brand new protocol
Excuse-a-moi, I make a move for Ra
You ain't souping Ra, save the hoop-a-la
Let me find out you rhymed out designed out
Pulling dimes out then climb out, for time out
I'm at the free throw, playing ball, or cee-lo, I keep dough
Reloaded like Carlito, incognito
I be so, low key, women get nosy
I do a show they want to go see to get to know me
In the front row seat they cosy
Thinking I'm giving them the bo-bo-bee until they O.D.

[Chorus: x4]",Flow Forever
Rakim,"[Rakim]
Before the dough came, my whole aim, was blow like propane
Control the whole domain, and then show no shame
Make rappers go ? and they so lame, playing with no game
Put em on the lil plane til they can't claim no fame
I got, the range, better, stay in the slow lane
I make the flow change from hurricanes to a slow rain
Your thoughts are so plane, I rearrange your whole frame
Until my whole name grow out your brain like Rogaine
Letter by letter, I put words together
Once merged, apart never, they be heard forever
And then I grab a pen and stab him in his abdomen
And smash him in, throw his mic like a javelin
Then I explain verses, that remain on the surface
At times it get deep, but I never defeat the purpose
Never go out, to go the dough route, forever hold out
I never sold out, for any amount, no doubt

[Chorus: x2]
That's how I get down, so tell me how you like that
I hit the town, hold it down on a tight track
I start a party now, everybody like rap
Haters are mad cause they gave the are the mic back

[Rakim]
I like to hang where everything seem to happen at (ya know?)
It's Ra's habitat, I'm like that czar Arafat
And yes I have a gat, snap like a Israeli
A terrorist I never miss blowing up kids daily
I step to writers, and let my virus hurt the closest
I'm sick as hepatitis and worse than tuberculosis
Pull out a pen, like a grenade, and drop it quick
I strike again and I'ma get paid, exotic shit
You know the God ra be, hot as the Mojave
Swing like King Usabi, my posse be kamikaze
On the corners like I'm homeless and I, don't know where home is
The bonus, is where the next open microphone is
Me and my team, vision like a radar screen
Intervene and yo, cut the mic off, cause Ra fiend
To show the whole world some of the things I seen
Then blow it up, like Edi Amin, ya know what I mean?

[Chorus]

[Rakim]
I do a thing thing, I write the songs they sing
Make sure that they swing, from New York to Beijing
Put your thoughts in the sling and your brain is gangrene
Pull in the ring, repeating and saying the same thing
Xerox, zero, no match, you ditto
Copy machine, couldn't reprint my ?
My new style, that I produce now's beyond two-thou'
I knew how, since a juvenile, to make a ka-pow
When the night's falling, I can hear the mic calling
I like balling, I cut back like Mic Jordan
This is for y'all while I'm spitting literature's
Lyrics'll ball like Allen Iverson dribble the ball
They hopeless, whoever approaches my high explosives
My vision sadicious, and freestyle's ferocious
I wrote this, words flew over my head like a locust
I turned the beat up, sat back, and stayed focused

[Chorus]",How I Get Down
Rakim,"Aye yo, who's the most explosive one yet? 
The a roundest one left 
Who flows express to them rhythm drum set ain't done yet? 
Flow like a trumpet to your eardrum are deaf 
Who pose a threat? 
Yo, who's more ferocious, none yet 
To the night damn set mic trends and life ends 
In sight, I see the whole world through a tight lens 
Rhymes I write wins and kept a white Benz 
Spend G's like hundreds and hundreds like tens 
I get paid, Black, but laid back with mild manners 
When I flip it's the opposite of dark Bruce Banner 
Out the lab with soul and melodies in your ear 
And just when it all seem clear I disappear 
All you gotta do is holler 
Reappear like vol,la the street scholar 
I'm 40 deep like Ali Baba 
Give the mamas something to talk about in the beauty parlor 
Keep it hot like lava, yeah 
It's Rakim Allah 
  
[Chorus] 
I know you find it hard to believe that 
I am the genie of the mic an 
I can do anything you wish but 
Right now I'm commanding you to dance 
  
Ready to dance y'all, my magic carpet's the dance floor 
Last chance y'all even if you can't ball 
What part don't you understand? Your wish is my command 
And I'm a rock a jam by popular demand 
You gone love this, it's marvelous, baby 
It gotta thug's twist,it start to get crazy 
It's off the meat rack, can't keep my peeps back 
Speak raps and I freak tracks for these cats 
I got a fetish for puttin' together words and letters 
It ain't all about the cheddars and y'all know where my head is 
Ghetto scriptures for my little brothers and sisters 
And still get vicious for the thugs and the Misses 
What I don't do is talk about the same old thing 
When I come through, I drop it, and they gone swing 
I bring the ladies joy until they make crazy noise 
'cause the beat's bangin', I'm born to blaze, baby boy 
  
[Chorus] 
  
The editor,forever more the predator, I said it all 
I spread a war, like never before 
Spit lead at yours like a ghetto braud raw at a? 
She'll never pause 
With raw metaphors, I set it off 
But I just begun the best is yet to come 
Blessed with a majestic tongue since I was young 
But I was stressed for funds and obsessed with guns 
Test the one, let Allah protect your son 
Cause something musical magician, the ageiathic author 
The microphone magician when I have a magic marker, a mentor 
You can explore, every sentence is a tour 
The inventor is more than adventure 
You'll be blown away, and a zone? 
It's so ill, I still grab the microphone and say 
One of my own displays like I'm known to blaze 
And I bet rhyme pays until I'm old and gray 
  
[Chorus: x4]",I Know
Rakim,"[Chorus]
I will always be there
I always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll be there

I'm bout to meet my comrade on the busy Ave where we clash
Trying to see how much gritty cash this city has
Meantime harass every bitty that pass
And then here you come with your pretty ass
All petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street
Your for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete
You got your head on tight and when you talk I like
For me and you two different walks of life
I'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much
Put too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch
You try to get in contact I don't respond back
Where the god at come back smellin' like cognac
Baby beware I'm tryin' my best to be fair
Aye yo-the key here is repair this love we share
Cause if we care we would prepare to see clear
Eye to eye we here as long as you be there

[Chorus]

Yo, I'm startin' to understand it you like your evenings enchanted
Love is bond, organic, restaurants romantic
Want me to take your hand and take you around the planet
But I take advantage and take you for granted
Call collect explainin' why I ain't came yet
I ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check
Blow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again
Don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end
Talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear
Make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there
Somewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud
Open my file baby you should know me by now
Tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites
Find my place in life plus I like to hold mics
It might be seven whole days and seven whole nights
But yo it's gonna be alright just hold tight

[Chorus]

(3rd verse)
Who said something good won't last forever
I know too much of any thing is bad whatever
Long as we have good and bad times together
Bad times make the good times that much better
Peaches and cream, diamonds and ice
You like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night
Features of a Queen and your mind frame is tight
Timin' is right get ready for the time of your life
You speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds
Apparently we know it's no guarantee
But losin' you boo who smooth as you
You unusual this is for the cool in you
And for the chill I will forever come real
Your appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed
All it took was one look, one kiss, one meal
Now come feel, let's make this a done deal

[Chorus: x4]",I'll Be There [Featuring Nneka Morton]
Rakim,"If I lay low and let the day go it'll slow my payroll
Aye-yo I'm a terrorize charge and slay shows
Ra slay flows go as far as the Barbados
On the turntable sound like tornadoes
My style is performed like tropical storms
Your not to get on the whole spot will get torn
I keep the metropolitan hollering and bring the dollars in
Keep the models following wise as King Solomon
Come slow through the jungle like an animal
Invade any land I go like General Hannibal
From Long Island to Queens light up the New York scenes
All the way to New Orleans and everything in between
Left to go bless a show in Mexico
Next Thing I know it's extra cold I see Eskimo's
Time to rock get it hot soon as I get in there
Spit in they ear so flow they froze and I disappear

[Chorus: x2]
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me
It's inherited it runs in the family

They said I was a head of my time or either here before
To see the idea clear it takes a year or more
Now times that by the years I reign straight-seven
No hear for four years still multiplied by eleven
The silence's a set back make em regret that
One way to get back is violence and wet cats
But hold your head black or I'll never rap again
Just when I thought I was out they pulled me back in
Now that was two years ago and if cats start interfering
Then I'm a go back to the gat and racketeering
My sabotage is camouflage and espionage
You ain't having Ra so don't test the god
I'm takin' all orders I can't afford extorters
I hit em in the head with a hundred dollars in quarters
So warn a friend tell em it's on again
If it's a freestyle bust in a park I want in

[Chorus: x2]

I managed to get paid for a decade now add three years on to that
Perform with a knack yes I was born to rap
The mic Lebanon Teflon don is back
I strike with better bombs and armed to attack
So reload the van go ahead let em in
Every tours a war and I'm on the road again
Surprise a town the place it's live and loud
We vibin' now I go wild and dive in the crowd
Never hit the ground they catch me and carry me around
Then put me right back on stage to shut it down
From New York to Cali, Japan and I-tali
I'm known as the microphone Muhammad Ali

Keep the girls occupied lovin' diggin' me what
Ain't around when I come to town they mad glad
Like Saddam they even say I'm the bomb in Baghdad

Rakim,"Hey yo, it's Mr. Low,key, you need to go see 
The host by far a mostly O.T., with a brand new show, but 
You know how the flow be
'Cause when I swerve, you observe it closely 
If you smoke trees, smoke more than an O.Z.
Mix any kind of dope with me, you O.D.
You get the seed, LP, C.O.D. 
Poetry 'cause you to fully load the V
Drop place to place, be crazy over me
Even different nationalities, over seas
However, do a don't emcee, you know me
G,O,D. 
She know she D.O.E., so show me
Even with no jewelry she call me Goldie
Like a Jacuzzi, she overheat an O.G.
Like sushi swimmin' in a open sea, I'm comin'

She said it's the same since I came and reigned: it's still hard
You can stimulate the brain, feel the god
It's hard to go against the grain, it's real large
Drive 'em insane, leave dames in silk bras
Plus real cups spill, spill that bars
What's the deal? Kids with Hennessey grills , they feel charged
And you know what time it is? It's still Ra's
When I do a show real far, they steal cars
Stages of battle field reveal your scars
Train hard 'cause this is a game with ill squads
Play with pain and gain a couple of yards
And if you know the deal, you can deal the cards
And appeal to broads with jobs and ov,e,ods 
Body parts like buns of steel and spa's
Then we can kick tha blahzay blah, smoke a cigar
While I get ma massage
I'm comin'
  
From the inner city to the suburbs, the street poet
The most jiggiest kid with words, and peeps know it
They've read about it and heard, plus T.V. show it
So how do I reserve my swerve? I low pro it
Now they're eager to know just how deep the flow get
I don't know yet, sometime the flow be so wet
Spit a tech that will effect quicker than most
Or high as anything you smoke, yet go ahead, roll it
Any microphone I hold, my heat blow it
My E,M,O is make more dough till I can't fold it
Anything I see or touch, I want to own it
Drop a jewel in baby girl ear, now she my co,ed
I reload and she keep the candy coated
And when she know she can't control it
She tell me she about to blow at any moment
Well, go ahead, baby, I can't hold it
I'm comin'",It's the R
Rakim,"Yeah 
It's the paragraph ambassador 
The wild style fashioner 
It's the god Rakim, the master 
Feel this 
  
This is that lost ass track off-the-rack kind of a track
You forced to rap, remember that? It's that
You know where I'm at, there go the gat
Pass me a bat, the kill-or-be-killed kind of attack
Steamin', speedin', navigatin' the map
Negotiating with a chick, she got her head on your lap, ya hand on your gat
Premeditated plan of attack, with two of your most deadliest men's in the back
Comb the block, stop in the zone that's hot
Get out like you own the spot, home or not
It's that no mood to play, move out the my way
Yo, I been whistlin' this tune from throughout the day
Hey, yo, this is that ol' y'all niggas don't want to battle
Turn it up loud make the whole block rattle
Boom boom, this one is gettin' blazin' hot
Boom boom, make you bust another shot from the glock
  
[Chorus]
From the streets below to everything above
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues
From the streets beneath my feet to the sun
I'm number one and competition is still none
And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues
  
Here we come now
Turntable spin like a merry-go-round
Never slow down, depending on how good your stereo sounds
Set it, up in the hood where we go surround
Tearin' through towns, turn 'em into burial grounds
This is the track that made Theodore want to scratch
The track that caused the first kid to spin on his back
And then we saw, kids spray-painting the wall
While some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law
It's no antidote it's what you can't provoke
So just relax with your girls or your mans and smoke
And take a real hit, soon as it bang you feel quick
It's real thick, this is that ol' real shit
This is the description of designs for you to listen to
Reminiscin' the times and nothin' in particular
Keep you goin' just like a whole pot of coffee
Have you and your shorty doin' 80 in a 40
  
[Chorus]
 
You know what this is 
Yeah kid, give up your riches 
Vicious, visions is not for motion pictures 
Unstoppable, rollin' witcha sickest clique of niggas 
Or witcha missus, gettin tropical kisses 
Makin' faces, anticipatin' places her tongue hits 
Suck her neck or just peck, better to funk it 
The EP is in effect from dusk to sunset 
She want a rim shot all over her drum set 
Jump the bed rubbin' your head- it's rough sex 
50 ways to keep a love wet 
Down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset 
""Damn, baby, you ain't come yet?"" 
Hell, no doomstick big as a elbow 
Gel soft, well blow, give him a minute, he'll grow 
And all you gotta do is play the track again 
I'm ready and revived, baby, back again 
  
[Chorus]

[Canibus]
Yo! 
Check it, Yo! 
  
I'm faster than leopards running across the vast desert 
In twenty-two yards per second to catch me to daily delicatessen 
It takes me thirty minutes to eat 'em, forty minutes to digest 'em
And fifty minutes for it to pass through my intestines
So ask yourself a question (What question)
Can the Canibus rhyme
Is a fuckin porcupine half swine
No time to make up your mind, you want to run or die
Clip you while you're running by, trip you up from behind 
My rhymes, confuse niggas 
Like somebody try to gang-bang 
Wearin' a blue shirt and red pants, throwin' up signs with their left hand 
Standin' out on the corner of wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband 
God dam eggplants, niggas getting' me vexed man 
Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sav 
And I can't seem to get away from it
I dreamed that I stabbed leviathan through the stomach, and ate from it
In my past life I slayed hundreds, and in the life before that
I played trumpets, to warn you that I was comin'
There's one billion ways to die, and I already tried
Nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine
When I aim and fire my rhymes, like a hundred cannon balls flying
Striking you one at a time, in a parallel line
While the art of emceeing is steady dying
Canibus and Rakim Allah is still in their prime

[Chorus]",Real Shit
Rakim,"The state of hip-hop right now man, as far as the way I see it
Um I think right now, um, hip-hop is advancing as far as skills
You got brothers, namsayin', getting like more witty
Bringing out more styles, you got DJ's 
Doing all kind of crazy shit on the turntables
So you know hip-hop is definitely advancing
We just get, we just get flack because our lyrical content
But um, I like I like the way it's going, and I like you namsayin

Barbarian of the microphone,
""Rough enough to break New York from Long Island""
It's for y'all niggas

And the streets just a couple of miles East of Mecca
Where peeps touch nothing but style heat and cheddar
Compete with ya livelihood to eat better
And ain't nothing sweet but the ladies who speak wetta
With a torn smile, trying to get my song on file
It's on now, the whole town done gone wild
Kick rhymes off my heartbeat as a unborn child
Then developed a strong style on Long Isle
Won't be long now, I started rhyming young
I designed for fun, knowing my time would come
I started, paying dues DJ'in with crews
Learning the inner city rules, conveying the news
Soon as the jam start the man's art'll jam parks
Slam so hard it remains a landmark
The rhyme that I'm styling, smooth as a violin
But ""Rough enough to break New York from Long Island""

(""Rough enough to break New York from Long Island""(

Like any G.O.D., loose on a spree for new degrees
Things to do and see until nothing is new to me
A true MC usually be into a breeze
And I can still see New York City through the trees
My advance slams put you outside looking in
Or the other way around, that depends, look again
Took a pen so you could zero in on my book of gems
It extends from the Hamptons to Brook-lyn
Through every hoodie in town, to learn the Boogie Down
Til every DJ around, wanted to put me down
Rhymes got rougher til I was ready to blast off
And harass all from Suffolk County to Nassau
Where we keep the money piling, keep the honies smiling
Keep the heater just in case kids start whyling
The rhyme that I'm styling, smooth as a violin
""Rough enough to break New York from Long Island""

Grew up in Wyndanch, formerly known as Crime-Danch
Me and my mans we travel lands to find jams
Where violence usually ends in sirens
By all means, we all fiend for finance
We make cash on the street called straight path
We take class, build with the Gods with great math
Everyday true to the street, and never fronted
Along the way, learned from the best that ever done it
Being exposed to life's highs and lows
Got my flows ready for shows, I'm ready for the pros
I put it on a tape and then the city I tested
Then on the radio the are's requested
Now the whole world's whyling, all the girls smiling
You know, it's on, soon as they let the crowd in
The rhyme that I'm styling, smooth as a violin
""Rough enough to break New York from Long Island""

Yeah, it's just ghetto, kid test the devil to hit the next level
Wish they was a rebel with cerebral metal
Inflex the bezzle with the peddle to the metal
In a thug's paradise where love have a price
So we love for life like thugs love the night
They sell drugs for ice for the Benz with bug lights
Some hug mics to the world, hung like parasites
The likes lethal, the mics lead you
A sneak preview, watch what we do and what the hood teach you
I still see through the eye of a needle
So I can watch people cause slug backwards is evil

Yo, what's this? Yo bust this. Yo it's time to up lift
They think all we do is bust clips and puff splifs
And plush whips and clutch chips and touch chicks
Flont rocks like Fort Knox and hog blocks
Taunt cops with more props and we want not
Panhandling with your mans and them
Scrambling, gambling, plans to win
While the cops clock em, thieves flock em
Women watch em, traders wanna top em
Ay yo what's the problem
Before the narcs knock em opposite players plot to rob em
The ghetto got em, my man said it's rough at the bottom

We all should, from the woods to the big city and the small hood
Everybody should be welcome to the ball if we all could,
But we fall cause we brawl, yo it ain't all good
We need to play right, stay tight with ya air alight
Keep your game tight, no need to play trife
Get cheese from the daylight to the late night
And it's shouldn't take death to appreciate life
Before a lot parish, we got to cherish if Allah let us
Let's give prop and merits till the block flourish
In this metropolis, stay on top of this
You know what the prophet is, be prosperous

Now we networking
Respect the next person, it'll be less hurting
Or left lurking, while we kept our dreads working
Connect set for certain, total networking
Last chance to advance and stash grands
If you have plans to have fam and mad land
Own shine, condone crime or hold 9s
I know what the problem is, killing our own kind
To my flame throwers, train sober, remain soldiers
Stay sane so these pretty dames can hold us
Terror terrain rollers and Range Rovers so the train goers
Claim your fame, maintain, till your game's over

Yeah, it's the god Rakim
Word up, I'm blazin this out to all my comrades
Ya know what I mean? From the gslums of New York, to the gutters all over the world
This is for y'all,
Through my travels I try to take righteous steps
Because right or left could mean life or death
No matter how trife it get, my sights is set
But it's twice the threat when the ?nights is death?
My mental windows refuse to close, they get exposed
To the neighborhood info where the poison wind blows
A deadly plague spreading negativity, viciously
Unto every city be in ghetto misery
Don't let it get to me, the writer be left to die
But it get mesmerize if it catch your eye
Shines enormous, from pure revered cool's and garments
But it's torment, jealousy drug wars or warring
Tallying, slowly turning into barbarians
More scary when the whole boulevard's carrying
Living in the world of sin, my ghetto girls and men
Waiting for the world to end

[Chorus: x2]
""Trying to paint a perfect picture and excel""
""In case you didn't know""
""Never moving backwards""
""Complicated""
""Know what I mean?""

I see destruction, even little kids trust none
They bust guns, that's what they get a rush from
When I see em, we build and have a real discussion
""Yo Ra, what's the jewel of the day?"" ""What up, son""
""You got ambition?"" Shorty said, ""Man listen
I got demands for living, can't stand division
Make grands on my mission, till everything glisten
Women in the Expedition, no plans for prison
In a vision the city get, 2 milleni G
Sitting in my MSC sipping Hennesy
Getting high, and watch life pass me by""
So I asked him why, wit a fast reply
He said ""I'm living just to die without any feelings
So I wait here for my Maker till it's time to go
Wit this dime I know
Wit all of her girls and all of my men's
Waiting for the world to end""

[Chorus: x2]

Shorty was taught to keep his head to the sky, and never cry
But the streets left him to die, now it's death in his eye
Living a sin of hitmen, a sinister grin
From be-ginning to end, in it to win
Evil rebels, doing what we doing in the ghetto
Thinking if we was thorough we can deceive the devil
You can't win, your life be end, try again
Shorty said, ""Why we born again to die again?""
That's what I said when I realized I had a gift
To uplift and be one of Allah's advocates
Teach the youth and speak the truth
Show em what peace can do when ?ill? reach for you
And my reward won't be jewels or cheese, it's even better
I can be one of the greatest MC's ever
If I tell em they intelligent women and great men
And live, stop waiting for the world to end

Politic your dollars quick

Until the earth collapsed

I wanna find me a lovely hon
Crush me one
Bust a ?

Tongue touch me 'til I'm numb
But first the outcome is income and then some
Get enough to run and spend some for fun
Then me and my thugs
We come in the club
We swung lovely
Watch how big the buzz be
Trust me son
Every ghetto got game in it
Fame in it
We remain in it
Waiting for the main event
Like the days on the corner
We watch the world go by
On the nights that wasn't right
Like when a good friend died
Yo the street's got a deadly hum
Like a drug
We gotta find a way to fill the neighborhood with love
From the park to the block
To your favorite spot
It don't stop

[Chorus]

I spend the prowl
I been on since a child
It don't make sense to browse
It's intensive now
Women in crowds
I search for the gem in the ?
Who stay original
Even when the friends around
Since her style
Always commands a smile
And her femme fatale
Cause men to growl
I take precedent of principle
Then arouse
Still the treasure is rakim
The smooth criminal
Damn, it's on
Keep my hands on
This amazon
Legs for marathons
Voice like Sarah Vaughan
Precise, alright
I like when her ? entice
With a spice of life
Flow times twice as nice
And when she go shop
The show stop
Shock the whole block
She so hot
I clothes shop
Put it on lock
Body that won't drop
Bounce like hip-hop
It don't stop

I will always be there

I'm 'bout to meet my comrade on the busy ave where we clash
Trying to see how much gritty cash this city has
Meantime harass every bitty that pass
And then here you come with your pretty ass

All petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street
Your for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete
You got your head on tight and when you talk I like
For me and you two different walks of life

I'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much
Put too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch
You try to get in contact I don't respond back
Where the God at come back smellin' like Cognac

Baby beware I'm tryin' my best to be fair
Aye yo, the key here is repair this love we share
'Cause if we care we would prepare to see clear
Eye to eye we here as long as you be there

I will always be there
I'll always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll be there

Yo, I'm startin' to understand it you like your evenings enchanted
Love is bond, organic, restaurants romantic
Want me to take your hand and take you around the planet
But I take advantage and take you for granted

Call collect explainin' why I ain't came yet
I ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check
Blow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again
Don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end

Talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear
Make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there
Somewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud
Open my file baby you should know me by now

Tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites
Find my place in life plus I like to hold mics
It might be seven whole days and seven whole nights
But yo it's gonna be alright just hold tight

I will always be there
I'll always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll always be there baby

Who said something good won't last forever
I know too much of any thing is bad whatever
Long as we have good and bad times together
Bad times make the good times that much better

Peaches and cream, diamonds and ice
You like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night
Features of a Queen and your mind frame is tight
Timin' is right get ready for the time of your life

You speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds
Apparently we know it's no guarantee
But losin' you boo who smooth as you
You unusual this is for the cool in you

And for the chill I will forever come real
Your appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed
All it took was one look, one kiss, one meal
Now come feel, let's make this a done deal

I will always be there
I'll always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll be there

I will always be there
I'll always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll be there

One way to get back is violence and wet cats 
But hold your head black or I'll never rap again

Now that was two years ago and if cats start interfering 
Then I'm a go back to the gat and racketeering

Never hit the ground they catch me and carry me around

The sun'll shine
Make it feel like the summertime
Shorty's runnin' blind
Lookin like they just done a crime
Click's want they pockets thick
Cop a ___
Proper chick
Street scholarships
Politic your dollars quick(?)
____ we __
'cause we was the first in the pack
They say ""herb's a trap""
Now it's worse than that
So I observe the __
Let my words attack
Until it ___ the rap
Until the earth collapsed

-Chorus-

you know it seem like life's just begun
My lust is young
I wanna find me a lovely hon
Crush me one
Bust a _
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
Let her hug
And when I'm done
Tongue touch me 'til I'm numb
But first the outcome is income and then some
Get enough to run and spend some for fun
Then me and my thugs
We come in the club
We swung lovely
Watch how big the buzz be
Trust me son
Every ghetto got game in it
Fame in it
We remain in it
Waitin for the main event
Like the days on the corner
We watch the world go by
On the nights that wasn't right
Like when a good friend died
Yo the street's got a deadly hum
Like a drug
We gotta find a way to fill the neighborhood with love
From the park to the block
To your favorite spot
It don't stop

-Chorus-

I spend the prowl(?)
I been on since a child
It don't make sense to browse
It's intensive now
Women in crowds
I search for the gem in the ___
Who stay original
Even when the friends around
Since her style
Always commands a smile
And her femme fatale
Cause men to growl
I take precedent of principle(?)
Then arouse(?)
Still the treasure is rakim
The smooth criminal
Damn, it's on
Keep my hands on
This amazon
Legs for marathons
Voice like sarah vaughan
Precise, alright
I like when her ___ entice
With a spice of life
Flow times twice as nice
And when she go shop
The show stop
Shock the whole block
She so hot
I clothes shop
Put it on lock
Body that won't drop
Bounce like hip-hop
It don't stop

-Chorus- (2x)

Rakim,"Don't sweat the Technique
Don't sweat the Technique

Let's trace the hints and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul.
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass,'till MC's get weak.
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep,
'Cause when I speak, they freak
To sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
Wit a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits
wit' beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique

Don't Sweat the Technique

They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped in rep., but
Researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to last who observe them
They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
 
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens, are swords
Letters put together form a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, born with structure
Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the
Difficult styles that'll be for the technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique

But don't sweat the Technique

I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep and the weak then complete their
Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old techniques become antiques
Better then something  brand new 'cause it's radiant
And the wild style'll have much more volume
Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never  irrelevant: mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

Rakim,"It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashin hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up, and play it loud
Hip-Hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dance floors just stop, the spot's scorchin hot
Hoping I open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar smokin ten dollar cigars
While I admire midas, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catchin diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin track
Rockin jams by popular demand, I'm back

[Chorus]
I control the crowd, you know I hold it down
When it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world reknowned
And I rock New York City all year around
It's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open fill it with somethin potent to go in
And take a toke then, mental planes start floatin
Hot science is smokin altitudes cause chokin
Product is hypnotic you're soakin and still smokin
Showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumpin
I'ma move crowds to 2000

[Chorus]
Yo, my rhymes and lyrics, find spirits like a seance
Since fat Cray-ons, I write and display chaos
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam
I take advantage, until the crowd go bananas
What a rush I hear cuts then I lust to touch
Microphones get clutched by the illustrious
Word spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologist's, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be droppin this
Some of the things I know, will be in your next Bible
When I die go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt manifest was write rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic",Guess Who's Back?
Rakim,"Me and Eric be	 was coolin' at the Paladium
Seen a all-world covered girl, I said ""Hey lady I'm 
Sorry if You're in a rush - Don't let me hold ya up
Or interveen or interrupt, but
You got the look - I want to get to know ya better
I had to let her know - but yo, I didn't sweat her
'Cause if you woulda seen what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean, but European.
When she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory -
Even her body language told the story
Her name was Mahogony - twin's name was Ebony
I said ""My name is Ra - and this is Eric be	""
Since the music was loud, I said ""let's take a walk,
So we could talk and see New York.
Show time doesn't start until one o'clock
And once I entered your mind I wouldn't want to stop
Caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same
Calm ya nerves, massage ya brain
Each mic is a mineral, poetry's protein
Verse is a vitamin - Affects like Codine
So tell me how you feel and I'll reveal 
A pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause I'm real
She musta OD'd 'cause she couldn't resist
She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said

Chorus:

Over Me, She's goin' crazy
She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she'd have my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony . . .


Verse Two:

So I prescribed her, something to revive
And surprise her, she's liver and much more wiser
Than the light I shine when my brain cells spark,
Come to me so we can glow in the dark
And soon, you can represent the moon
As long as I keep ya in tune
I'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here
Take it in stride 'cause it might take a year
It's funny - how time flies when ya havin' fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go
fuck around and miss the show
So I told her to hold that thought real tight
We can finish where we left off later on tonite
Back to the scene of the crime on time
As they introduced the 'Fiend of the Rhyme'
She stood with a birds-eye view of me
Thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me
The back of the room I could see her eyes gloom
Patient, but hopin' that the show was over soon
As the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row
So I said ""let's go"" 
I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore
The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore
Besides I got places to go, ladies to see
And she could tell me how crazy she was over me
We drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed
And couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm', I said,
""I've been watchin' you, watchin' me
Looks I received made it hard to MC
I can take a hint, so I knew that she
Wanted my ""Agony Agony Ag-on-why"" in her bod-why
Showed her some sights, then I took her to the Condo
She was pipin' hot, but I kept my calm So
She asked how come I don't smile
I said, ""Everything's fine, but I'm in a New York state of mind!""
As we reached the kingdom, she said bring some
Champagne, she'll entertain then sing some
Sentimental, songs real gentle, 
It hit the spot and you know where it went to
As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin'
I knew she was in the mood for somethin'
So I laid on my back and relaxed
It wasn't the Perignon that made her collaspe
Over me

Rakim,"Ladies and gentlemen, ghettos all across the world

The man above been talking to me
He said he understands my view
He's always walking with me
Cuz he sees what I've been through
When the world starts kicking me around
All in my face, make me want to put 'em down
Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands

I'm from the hood that's forever sinning
Where life is took for granted here so death is winning
Nothing but blues around, feels like we're losing out
Times that spent in this environment confuse a child
As a juvenile I ran wild I ran out of blessings
Been in and out of prison as an adolescent
My goal was getting it, til something said to turn my life around
Redirect my hustle, and go legitimate
Til I get corporate and invest fortunes
With exec bosses sitting behind a desk at the office
I'm left jobless, nobody hiring ex-convicts
That don't mean I'm less conscious
It's so hard when they close doors
And when you looking like a so-called hip hoppa you get nada
Stereotyped, scarred for life stigmata
But still a kid's gotta get a dolla

The man above been talking to me
He said he understands my view
He's always walking with me
Cuz he sees what I've been through
When the world starts kicking me around
All in my face, make me want to put 'em down
Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands

I tackle choices every day that's hopeless
I hear a voice saying ""stay focused""
Fast money, cars, and broads will mislead you
Love backwards here is evol but it's legal
Multi-task I make a fortune faster
Keep rhymin til I'm climbing up the corporate ladder
In my community, you've gotta go out of your way if you're out to get paid
Than back up and wait for opportunity
I try not to blame society
I eat my pride cuz I know deep inside it's me
But not entirely, when a man try to live righteously
And propriety turn to anxiety
I thought I paid back the system when I stayed in prison
Left the stripes, see what success is like
But the way they set the price
You spent your childhood in the wild hood
You're in debt for life

The man above been talking to me
He said he understands my view
He's always walking with me
Cuz he sees what I've been through
When the world starts kicking me around
All in my face, make me want to put 'em down
Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands

They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good

I figured out what was talking with me
When I do right I feel him walking with me
So I'm adamant, some call it arrogance
I can cope it cuz I know I'm broke for having sense
But my back's against the wall, it's getting rough to get a buck
In a job with a minimum wage won't get enough
Faced with giving up, and my lady friend's beefing
Ends ain't meeting, we just an argument away from splitting up
It gets lonely, my fam disowned me
Called me the black sheep cuz I act street
Yeah it's that deep, I tried to change clicks
Homies flipped on me cuz I don't hang, we have beef
But I'm at peace so that cease, at least
I ain't got no ties on my Porsche ride
And no time for no crime, knowing that the most high
Is watching with a close eye

The man above been talking to me
He said he understands my view
He's always walking with me
Cuz he sees what I've been through
When the world starts kicking me around
All in my face, make me want to put 'em down
Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands

They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good

They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good

They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good

They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good",Man Above
Rakim,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnatize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line,
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
My rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So eric b, make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric b easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cuz to me, mc means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Saying indeed that I precede cuz my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
If they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
Because I'm better then the rest of them
Eric b is on the cut and my name is rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm,
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me

Funky...

Rakim,"Let the rhythm hit 'em

I'm the arsenal
I got artillery lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm
Then I'm 'a give 'em piano

Bring a bullet proof vest
Nothin' to ricochet
Ready to aim at the brain
Now what the trigger say

Tempos triflin'
Felt like a rifle
Massage 'n' melodies
Might go right through

Simultaneously like an Uzi
Nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady
Say don't lose me

So reload quickly
And you better hit me
While I'm lettin'
This fifi get wit' me

You steppin' with 007
Better make it snappy
No time to do your hair, baby
Brothers are bustin' at me

Beats and bullets pass me
None on target
They want the R hit
But watch the God get

Quicker, the tongue is the trigger
'Cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em
Let 'em feel the blast

Penetrate at a crazy rate
This ain't thirty-eight
Hit 'em at point blank range
And watch 'em radiate

Runnin' out of ammunition
I'm done wit' 'em
You ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

I push a power that's punishable
Better be a prisoner
The hit man is the
Brother wit' charisma

Showing you that I have
Powerful paragraphs
Followers will become leaders
But without a path

Ya mentally paralyzed
Crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred
Then it occurred that you heard I

Reduced the friction
With crucifixion
Let loose the mix
Then boost the piston

Eric hit 'em with' some of that
Cut like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back
It won't be none of that

I'm untouchable
You see me in 3-D
When I let the rhythm
Hit another M.C.

Lyrics made of lead
Enters your head
Then eruptions of a mass production
Will spread when

Music is louder
Full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery
When I see a crowd of

Party people pumpin'
Their fist like this
Ya hide in the back
Thinkin' that I might miss

But the R is accurate
Plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines
That I have to hit

Whatever I aim at
I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain
That time is up

You been hit with somethin'
Different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate
And nothing's equivalent

Nothin' can harm me
Why try to bar me
You couldn't come around
To rob with a army

You'll get wrecked by the architect
So respect 'em
I disconnect 'em,
Soon as I inject 'em

With radiation
Put 'em by the basement
Bust his chest open
Bash his face in

Let it split 'em
Since he brought his main man wit' 'em
He ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em

Let it hit 'em

Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass

Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance

The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here
Let me introduce you

Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy

Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a havoc

If ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention, follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose

Too many milligram
But what made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man

Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'em, he'll never forget 'em
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em

At least when he left he'll know what hit 'em
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm

Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know they'll blow the hell up
If I slow up, catch up, hell no

Wicked as I kicked it
Don't need to remix it
'Cause I prefixed it
Reversed and switched it

Perform to perfection
Section for section
Rhymes keep connectin'
Ya guessin' what's next an'

Blood pressure rise as ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbitten
'Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain hit a vein, then remain, let it radiate

Vibes will vibrate, why did you violate
Now I'm 'a have to let the style break
Moans now the tone is ingrown
After this here's thrown, gimme another microphone

Before I get that fifi I met
Whisper I wanna reach your intellect
Kiss her 'cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let my write reflect

Hold 'er, mold 'er, make 'er feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure whenever I'm wit' 'er
And you know how I did 'er
Me and the rhythm hit 'er

Raleigh Ringers,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll.

'Cause I am too young and too dumb to consider the terms
Of breaking the law and I'll curse the day that they return
With a smile on my face as their heads hit the floor
And they're done now, it's curtains
The bloodlust's a clusterfuck, it hurts but it's working
And even if you ask me to stop, it's too late
Because I've already decided their fate
It's not a distaste, it's pure hate and it pulsates
And it works its way around my brain anyway, what I'm trying to say
I'll protect you 'til the day I meet my maker

Ralph Blizard," 
  
I hear the sad howling of coyotes prowling
It sounds so mournful to me
It brings back memories of cherished loved ones
Of ones I'm longing to see

   I'm riding away out on the lone prairie
   The rangers are searching for me
   I'm riding away from my home in Texas
   A fugitive ever to be

I had a good mother I had a good father
They handed a warning to me
The men that I ran with committed a murder
And laid the blame on me

Little Maggie my sweetheart I know she's lonely
And longs for me to return
My happiness ended the night we parted
And now for her I yearn

How lonely how dreary with nothing to cheer me
My thoughts go stealing back home
My life of sadness will never know gladness
I'm branded forever to roam

 
",Fugitive's Lament
Ralph Burns,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Ralph Burns,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Hearing words that I have never heard

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Ralph McTell,"And once I walked a million miles
All the way to Yugoslavia
And I carried you all of the way
For where I was then there you are.

As the sun rose o'er the curb stones
By the road where I'd been sleeping
Them night-long trucks, as they roared by
They could not drown my weeping.

And it was me, and I alone
Who looked toward the far horizon
And I saw King Heron
On his dead tree throne
And I knew not which to keep my mind on.

Now I cannot speak for everyone
For they got their reasons
All on this road
But, Heron, would that I had your wings
For then I'd know where I would go
For then I'd know where I would go.




",Heron Song
Ralph McTell,"Now it's come to talking I don't have much to say,
It wouldn't come out right, and so I'll leave it out, oh it's best that way
And I want to get out now 'cause I need just a couple of drinks.
Can you lend me a little money till I draw my pay?

And I'm leaving like a thief in the night.
But I will try to write to you, or maybe phone
And I'll send you back the money,
But not the love you lent
I could never pay no interest on that loan

You really give me comfort I couldn't take more tenderness
My credit's overdrawn and I just slide deeper in your debt
And I want to get out now 'cause I need just a couple of drinks.
Can you lend me a little money till pay day next?

Chorus

Why don't you get some rest now you ought to get an early night.
I've got a key so you can lock the door and it'll be all right.
I'll just take my winter coat, it looks like it might rain.
Can you lend me a little money just for the night?

",Interest on the Loan
Ralph McTell,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Jenny Taylor/Je N'Etais La
Ralph McTell,"Thousands of miles without moving
In the silence and stillness we're turning
Who scattered the stars in the field of night?
Say it's all right, say it's all right,
Well say it's all right.

Ocean storm-thrown boats collide
With waves of no direction
With compass set up on a star
Head for the port's protection.

Faster than light we're not ageing,
So where does the time go we're saving?
Give me a sermon for sleep tonight
Won't you say it's all right, say it's all right,
Well say it's all right.

And the driftwood it collides
With blind boats on the water
Oh, sad I watched the moon fall down,
But the river safely caught her.

Confusion of stars where's the pattern
To chart us away from collision?
We are dust, we are spark, we were light before dark
It was all right, it is all right,
And it'll be all right.

Above, below, worlds collide
In the before and after
Oh happy to watch the sun go down
And join the angels' laughter.



",Lunar Lullaby
Ralph McTell,"Pity the boy who marries for money
Or wealth and position
Thinking his troubles will fade out of mind.
Pity the boy who marries for beauty
Only to find like a flower in the morning it withers and dies.

Better by far to marry for love,
Stay broke for the rest of your days
Than to settle down for the sake of
Ending your rambling ways
And they won't end
And thinking about them
Your time you will spend.

Pity the girl who marries for duty
Believing in time if she works at her heart
It will turn into love.
Pity the girl who marries for strength
And protection, she'll find
In the shade of a great tree nothing can grow.

Better by far to marry for love
And stay broke for the rest of your days
Than to settle down for the sake of
Ending the games you have played
They won't end
And thinking about them
Your time you will spend.

Bless the child that's born of a union
Grown out of love
He's richer by far, he's got more than enough
Bless the child who walks in that union
Grows in that love
His riches are more than the stars under heaven.




",Pity the Boy
Ralph McTell,"Give me sweet forgiveness
And I think that it might
If not relieve all the pain that I feel
At least help me to sleep tonight.

Come down like an angel
Come on down like a woman
Say that it's forgiven.
Give me your sweet forgiveness,
Sweet forgiveness
And it must be,
Must be the seeds of heaven.

When I'm weak and feeling guilty
And it's sometimes I do,
Give me strength to seek forgiveness
Come and help me to see it through.

Chorus

Well you walk in with eyes open
Say to yourself I am a man
But you end up with a heart broken
But somehow baby you still understand.

",Seeds of Heaven
Ralph McTell,"Don't care for gardenias
Rather have a dandelion
Don't like weddings much either now
And things that you can't rely on.

But you make me feel good
You with your run-down shoes and your shining eyes
You make me feel good
You can do what you want and I don't mind.

Don't much care for birds of paradise
Rather have a sparrow
Don't like flying much either now
Things you can't control.

But you make me feel good
You with your scruffy jeans and your run-down shoes
You make me feel good
You only do the things that you want to.

You make me feel good
You with your scruffy jeans and your tangly hair
You make me feel good
You can do what you want
And I don't care.



",You Make Me Feel Good
Ralph McTell,"Takes a glass of Tequila to raise up my spirits
When I get down I'm drinking them two at a time
'Til I swear that I feel like a poor drowning sailor
Salt on my lips and my tongue tastes of lime.

Tequila sunset, Tijuana sunrise
Let's put the light back in each other's eyes
And maybe tomorrow if the wheels can roll
We can take the road down south, babe,
Get to Mexico.

I don't wanna hear any sad stories
Hurt glances in mirrors joined in direct lines
I bought her a drink and we made an agreement
""Don't tell me your sad story and I won't tell you mine.""

Tequila sunset, Tijuana sunrise
Let's put the light back in each other's eyes
And maybe tomorrow if the wheels can roll
Then take the road down south babe
Get to Mexico.

Whatever we say it is just the booze talking
Skinny dogs howl at a Mexico moon
Kids wear no shoes, dusty streets full of dreams
Aim for the dance floor and maybe they'll play a slow tune

Oh Tequila sunset, Tijuana sunrise
Turquoise and silver stars hung in the skies
And maybe tomorrow the wheels can roll
We can take the road down south babe
Get to Mexico
We will take the road down south,
Get to Mexico.



",Tequila Sunset
Ralph McTell,"So you're finally over it now.
You thought you wouldn't make it,
But I knew you would somehow.
I guess I knew you could make it in the end
And it's good to have you round again old friend.

You weather the storm,
You weather the storm.
You weather the storm,
And you come up smiling in the end.

So, you're over all the disappointments now.
You thought you wouldn't make it,
But I knew you would somehow.
Maybe it still hurts to think of bad times that you spent,
But it's over, and you're back again old friend.

Chorus

Into every life, a little rain must fall,
And for sure it poured down on you.
An umbrella's no good in a hurricane,
But just like the sun in the end you come shining through.

Chorus

So, you see, it's getting better now,
You look a little battered,
But we all do anyhow.
When the break is mended it can be stronger than before.
Don't go round butting doors or punching walls.

Repeat chorus twice.



",Weather the Storm
Ralph McTell,"In my country garden, underneath the mountain
With dead-nettles growing all around the door
Early every morning the sun comes up the mountain
Setting in the sea in the evening once more.

Take some water from the brook
Wondering who it was that took the stones from the mountain to build the cottage here
Two up and two down, miles from the nearest town
I wonder who it was but the reason why is clear

Take a bunch of nettles, add a little water
Drawn from the stream running outside the door
Leave it for a month or two, bottle it and drink the brew
Watch the suns go down in the sea once more.

Ralph McTell,"I stopped a man the other night
Saying isn't a beautiful sky
And although he agreed it was just to please me
I could tell that by the look in his eye

And his look got bolder looking over his shoulder
At me as he quickened his step
So I didn't take his hand as I had planned
I threw a stone instead.

She was coming my way
So I picked a rose and stuck it under her nose
She said, ""What about my hay fever"".

Then this man came out and he started to shout
He wasn't very happy either.

I was happy and drunk as could be.

That night the cells would sober me

I said I ain't be in bars I got drunk on the stars
You can't pin nothing on me
Then she smiled and I said ""Oh, kiss me instead"".
She said ""I can't I'm on duty"".

Around the football pitch line.

I'd like to give it to you"".

Ralph McTell,"The lights have gone dim, and the people are gone.
And clown goes back into his caravan.
Hangs up his smile on a hook by the door
And lets his ragged coat slip to the floor.
With the sound of the children's laughter
Still ringing in his ears.
Laughing 'cause they're happy,
They laugh to hide their fears.
Clown loves the children
For, like him, they fear.
The world does not exist tonight,
And only the circus,
Only the circus is real.
As real as the elephants that trumpet in the ring.
Real like the trapeze, see it swing.
Real like the man who eats real fire,

Real like the lady on the high wire.
But the people have gone, his identity gone.
Clown peeps through he window of his caravan.
From the trees on the common
The town looks so small.
Clown puts on his coat and goes out the door.
And the distant neon lights
They shine above the town.
""It's almost like a circus"", thinks clown.

And half with delight,
Shivering, shaking.
Clown stands laughing,
Clown stands laughing,
Clown is laughing at the night.",Clown
Ralph McTell,"She comes riding early in the morning,
About four to seven.
No one's ever out at that hour.
With eyes that see her
Touch the morning flowers secretly.
And the leaves slow their comotion,
And the great trees gently sway,
Like an ocean on a still day,
And raise, in praise, their arms to the sun.
Who announces the day has begun,
At eight frames a second.
Velvety shadows in misty meadows

Are changing colours so softly.
With care, the sun puts colour in his drawing,
And rises to inspect his masterpiece this morning,
So perfect.
And as she rides the gold and silver miles,
Only the sun is sure,
What it is that she smiles for.
She leaves with no sign of what she has done.
Though her morning rise, known by everyone;
I'll tell you her name, and it's Dawn.",Eight Frames a Second
Ralph McTell,"Night stirs her inky finger in the water of the day,
The tired sun drops slowly in the sky.
And everywhere the gentle air hangs heavy with the day song
Evening calls the lamplight out to come 

Children's wooden hoops go clattering down the street
Soon they're called inside, it's getting late.
The grand canal 
Now splashed with red 

Reflects on swallows wings.
The lamplighter knows the song the evening sings.
But the gas-lamps stand like soldiers
Hiss warnings to the wind

Their evening vespers prophicy a war.
The world divides 
And men take sides
The spark bursts into flame

Nothing can be quite the same again.
Dog barks in the distance
Child cries in her sleep
Night waits for the dawn with baited breath.

The old school, the old rule
Rung out on a muffinman's bell
The lamplighter has made his nightly call.
Dreams of hope and peace

Sent clattering down the streets
Empty like the promises they made.
The wars rage on, and different wrongs
Will someone please explain

That peace is not the lamplighter 
'Cause he's not coming back again",England 1914
Ralph McTell,"Standing alone in the fairground at night
The world racing past on the streets
Only the stars and the highlights of cars
Light the fantasy world while it sleeps
And I looked around but there wasn't a sound
But the cinders under my feet
Candy-floss sticks spelt words on the ground
I tried to read them in vain.
Before it was clear the wind blew my hair
And re-phrased the sentence again.
I stopped to light my last cigarette
The fair was lit up in its glow
I threw it away but the light seemed to stay
Like 'twere moonlight shining on snow.
And I hardly dare breathe
I just couldn't believe
Then the music started to flow.

Slowly everything started to move
'Cept me and I stood quite still.
Then came a soft cry near the coconut shy
Will you take to ride on the wind.
And around and around the big wheel when spinning
Round and around until
I noticed although the fairground was moving
The rest of the world stopped still.
It was then that I realised that I'd have to get off
Although I would've much rather stayed.
Then with a jolt the wheel came to a halt
And the music started to fade.
As the lights went dim my head started to spin
Told myself that I wasn't to blame.
Looked at the ground at the candy-floss sticks
Now the message was plain
Behind me the wheel and the fairground were still
And outside it was moving again.",The Fairground

And the river's reflecting her bicycle, and the reeds whisper her name,

Standing on tip toes

Sending the two of them scurrying, 

Helter skelter for the shelter 
And feeling bolder in the big pagoda,

Smoke rising to the ceiling
The words just seem to float on by
Maybe you've had the feeling
Then looking into my empty glass
I noticed the bar clock was ten minutes fast
My beer was gone, and my money's spent,
And I think it's about time that I went.
I went walking along the main road
How can they call it High Street?
I said ""Hello"" to a face I know
But he had someone to meet.
Then I noticed that the sea was coming in
I almost felt like taking a swim,
But the sea gets wild so I've been told
And anyway it was much too cold.
I buttoned my coat up to my chin
Went walking along the sand
I thought I heard the mermaid sing
To the sound of a big brass band.
A seagull offered me a ride
And so as not to hurt his pride

I said I wasn't going far 
And I let him carry my guitar.
Then along come a mermaid, said ""Come sing me a song,
And I'll stop the band from playing"".
I was pleased and played with ease
To the mermaids gentle swaying.
I must've stayed there for an hour or two
The seagull said he'd have to go
And the mermaid said that she'd rather hear more
But she left me standing on the shore.

Right on the water line.
I shouted ""Goodbye"", but he didn't reply
I know he had no time.
Even my footprints had disappeared
And as for the road I steered 
Out from the sea there come a sigh

Caught in a spider's web, its broken wings beating, a butterfly dying.
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la,

And they in their wisdom say
""Michael's got something wrong, wrong, wrong with his mind"".
Well they must be blind, if they can't see what Michael sees.

Michael where are we,
We who see that there's something wrong with your mind?

At one with the insects, the flowers, and the trees, and the wind and the birds.
Oh la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

Oh Michael sees all
Behind the high walls
Surrounding his kingdom,
Whilst we in our wisdom
Still trapped in the spider's web
Far from the flow and ebb
Of life in the garden
But Michael has pardoned
Us for he sees
That really he's free
And there's nothing to mend
For his wings are not broken

And they in their wisdom say
""Michael's got something wrong, wrong, wrong with his mind"".
They've seen the signs, but Michael feels fine inside the garden.

Ralph McTell,"Sundays, as a rule, us kids went to Sunday School,
And Mrs Adlam said, angels stood round our bed.
To keep us safe from dark, right through to day begun,
And we used to lie awake, just to try to see one,
And though we never saw one anywhere,
We heard them softly singing in the air.
Sundays occasionally we were invited back for tea,
And bread with jam and cream, made Sundays seem a dream.
In the dingy mission hall, Mrs Adlam praying,

And down the street back home, all our mates were playing,
With Mrs Adlam's angels everywhere,
And we thought we saw a halo in her hair.
Sundays, for sure, ain't like that anymore,
Its getting hard for me, to see her face in front of me.
I wonder if her angels have their arms around her curled,
Keeping her safe from life, and guarding her from the world.

To hear Mrs Adlam's angels in the air.",Mrs. Adlam's Angels

And summer rolled o'er us with no complications

Waiting around for smiles from the man.

After the day, but before evening comes
Waiting for castles and kettles with roses
Painted on barges that sailed into the sun.

And nothing's betrayed, there's no disgrace

Nothing's betrayed, we'll both be unarmed
And both of us must come alone.

Does anyone get what they really wish?
A handshake, a heartbreak, maybe a parting with a kiss.

And the flames burn higher and higher.

Ralph McTell,"Oh, the traveller moving on the land, behold I give you, I give you the travelling man.
And he's very heavy laden with the questions in his burden.
Lo, and I give you the travelling man.
He has crossed the mountains, he has forded streams.
He has spent a long time surviving on his dreams.
Many times he's tried to lighten up his heavy load.
But his compromises fail him and he ends back on the road.

Oh the traveller he is weary, the travelling man he is tired.
For the road is never ending in his fear he has cried aloud for a saviour
And in vain for a teacher, someone to lighten up the load
And he's heard the sounds of war in a gentle shower of rain
And the whisperings of despair that he could not explain.
The reason for his journey, or the reason it began
Or was there any reason for the travelling man.

At last he reached a river so beautiful and wide
But the current was so strong he could not reach the other side
And the weary travelling man looked for a ferryman strong enough to row against the tide,
And the ferryman was old but he moved the boat so well,
Or did the river move the boat? The traveller could not tell.
Said the ferryman, ""You're weary and the answers that you seek,
Are in the singing river, listen humbly it will speak.""

Oh, the traveller closed his eyes and he listened and he heard
Only the river murmuring and the beating of his heart.
Then he heard the river laughing, and he heard the river crying
And in it was the beauty and the sadness of the world
And he heard the sounds of dying, but he heard the sounds of birth
And slowly his ears heard all the sounds of earth.
The sounds blended together and they became a whole
And the rhythm was his heartbeat to the music his soul.

And the river had no beginning, as it flowed into the sea
And the seas filled the clouds and the rains filled the streams
And as slowly as the sunrise, he opened up his eyes
To find the ferryman had gone, the boat moved gently on the tide.
And the river flowed within him, and with it he was one
And the seas moved around the earth, and the earth around the sun.
And the traveller was the river, was the boat and ferryman,
Was the journey and the song that the singing river sang.

Ralph McTell,"I went down to the hiring fair for to sell my labour,
And I noticed a maid in the very next row and I hoped she'd be my neighbour.
Imagine then my delight when the farmer picked us both.
I spoke not a word in the cart to the farm, but my heart beat in my throat.

My lodging was dry and my master fair and I gave him full measure,
But my envy grew like the corn in the field for in his house was my treasure,
And I'd watch her carry water, or drive cows from the byre,
And the heat from the sun made the corn grow strong and with it my desire.

Well I'd see her in my dreaming and in my dreams caress
Her eyes, her lips and her dark brown hair, the curves beneath her dress.
But harvest time it came at last, so heavy was the task
That the women and the men worked side by side and I had her near at last,

And I swung harder with my scythe, few words between us passed,
And I cursed my tongue-tied youthfulness and I hoped that she'd hear my heart.
When all was safely gathered in and we sat down to rest
My trembling fingers touched her arm, and she placed them on her breast.

And then she turned to me as the sun went down and all my senses reeled,
As we lay there on the scented ground and the moon rose over the field.

She was safely gathered in my arms when from the barn
Drifted the sound of a violin and we hurried back to the farm,
And all were dancing in the lantern light and music filled the air,
And I thanked my stars for the harvest moon and the girl from the hiring fair.

Oh all were dancing in the lantern light and music filled the air,

They're the hands that should work in wood
And they're the hands that should work a long day
Joseph he did all those things
But he also learned how to play

He would sing about joy, sing about faith
That the people wished they had
How he heard the voice of Jesus
When the rolling sea got mad
He's a boat in the harbour, he's safe in that love
He know some day he'll be sailing above

When they looked at Joseph's hands
They said, They're the hands of a stonemason
They're big and they're powerful and they're strong

But he also learned how to play

When they looked at Joseph's hands

And he's happy all the time
For they're working every day

Oh how they can play.

Ralph McTell,"I will never forget the walk to the station,
Me with your suitcase being brotherly strong.
And trying to make light of the whole situation,
In mild conversation we moved through the throng,

And above all the roar of the town was the blue sky,
I could here the birds singing for the joy of the day
And there was no support from the city forthcoming,
No sympathy numbing your going away.
It's hard to say goodbye.

And there was you with your bright eyes and best dress for travelling
And me in my work clothes, unshaven and plain,
Oh, I fully intended to put in the half day,
But my good intentions went with you on the train.

And I never looked back as the train left the station,
Crossed over the road and walked into the park,
And there in a bar an old man was singing,
And I sat there drinking until it got dark.

And outside the trees they grew starlings like apples,
Their hustle and chatter not dampened by the rain.
That washed down the pavements and into the gutters,
That soaked through my clothes as I set out again,

And above me the stars were all hidden by rain clouds,
The song of the old man still locked in my brain,
And all emigration, the curse of a nation
The setting now fitting his sad sweet refrain.

Just because he looks all right
I've seen him look like this before
And if he says he wants to be alone
At least try to walk with him home
See if you can put your foot in the door

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Just because he looks all right
He's only gotta pick up the phone
Now one of them guys in the car will be around
And give him just enough on account
They know that he'll be back for more.

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through.

Now he's trying to show he's cool, but I know him
I ain't fooling
And because you love him he's bound to lie
When this time he's got so close
Now's the time to be scared the most
He's looking everywhere but in your eyes.

So don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through.

'S endless coffee and cigarettes
Now don't take it hard when he says
He doesn't need you 'cause that's when he needs you most
He'll cry till he laughs and laugh till he weeps
And suddenly he'll fall asleep
Then you can let your own eyes close

Don't leave Martin alone tonight
Keep him talking until daylight
This time well I think he's coming through
This time I think he's coming through.

Ralph McTell,"This summer will be different I will move across the town
Promenade above the beach until my face turns brown
With my hands in my pockets and a casual stroll from the town beach to the dock
The girls they walk in two's and three's, their pretty cotton frocks teased by the breeze.
And I will find a long-limbed summer girl for me.

I will assume the accent of some Yankee sailor boy
Stranded between merchant ships with some time to enjoy.
A week or two down by the bay with tupp'ney ice-cream cones
And petticoats and sandy kisses, breasts smooth as stones washed by the sea
And I will find a long-limbed summer girl for me.

And her name will be Pam or Ruth, so I'll be Chuck or Wayne,
And we will know and love each other, then I will explain
Why I haven't found a ship and that I live in town
Before we share that cigarette, in waves of love, we'll drown down by the sea,
My long-limbed salt-teared summer girl and me.

She won't cry for my leaving, she will cry because I stay
She will cry for my deceiving that we can meet every day
This love affair it grew so strong because we'd have to part,
And now we will do anyway and she will take my heart and I'll be free
To find another summer girl who'll give it back to me.

But I said I've seen people with nets out there
You said they just throw out a line and dream.

Men out there trying to net the moon
Come on down to the river (the sun is going down)
The fish will be jumping soon.

You said it's only a track,
And I said I've seen people with trucks out there
You said they leave and they don't come back.

I say a road and you say a track
I seem to need you just to bring me back
From the edge of the earth where it touches the sky
Come on down to the road (look at the horizon)
And feel the trucks rolling by.

Chorus

I see a river, you see a stream
Wise men sleep, it is fools who dream
Men out there, trying to net the moon
Come on down to the river (the sun is going down)
The fish will be jumping soon.

Chorus

Ralph McTell,"Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet,
And eating her curds and her whey.
And along came a spider and sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, who do you blame ?
The spider soon finished his web,
And the rain came down, and hung it with diamonds.

And a bird flew along, with the stroke of his wing
Broke the web, he and the spider.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, who do you blame ?
The bird flew up high into the sky,
And the sun lit the tips of his wet wings with fire.
And a man with a gun shot him down to the ground,
And went home and sung in the choir.",Bright and Beautiful Things
Ralph McTell,"If I find another way to save you all this pain
I wouldn't take that evening train,
Or tell you it's goodbye again.
But it would be so wrong of me to stay.

If I find another way that couldn't be the same,
She'd never call me by my name
The way you do, but it's me I blame
And I'm sorry I must leave.

If I try and make you see that things aren't what we plan
And I say goodbye and touch your hand.
I know that you won't understand
The pain is just as great for me.

If I find another way that couldn't be the same,
She'd never call me by my name
The way you do, but it's me I blame
And I'm sorry I must leave.",I'm Sorry-I Must Leave
Ralph McTell,"Hurrying across the bridge before the siren calls.
This morning she's chasing her shadow, along the factory wall.
And through the gate, where she will wait in line.
To cross the yard, to clock her card in time.

And under her scarf, her hair set in curls,
The day begins for the factory girl.
For a while the girls try to talk, but their voices soon drown in the din.
Their eyes watch their hands do the work, and a new day's rhythm begins.

No change today, like yesterday, the same
But dinner soon, then afternoon, then home.
Then hurrying home in the fading light,
The factory girl is going out tonight.

Her momma says ""Don't be late, you've got to get up again before eight"".
""Yes"", she cries, but there's joy in her eyes,
As she runs down the path through the gate.
And out on the rainy streets hoping that the night will last.

No whispering palms on the beach, for her,
Just the swish of the cars going past.
And she believes no one could feel the same,
Touching and whispering in the rain.

And the rain takes away her beautiful curls.
The night is soon gone for the factory girl.
And hurrying across the bridge before the siren calls.
This morning she's skipping the puddles, all along the factory wall.

A starling sings, he shakes his wings, she smiles.
Then at the gate, she hesitates, for a while.
Then from inside the gates, the sirens roar.
And across the yard runs the factory girl.",Factory Girl
Ralph Moore,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"
Ralph Moore,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

Ralph Moore,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Ralph Moore,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Ralph Napolitano,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Ralph Napolitano,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember

Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?

I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

I was searching for fortune and fame
I found where the water runs deep from the hills
They call it the medicine springs

It was there that I met a fair maiden
Yellow hair and big eyes of blue
She told me one day she loved only me
That she'd forever be true

Well I wanted the best for my darlin'
But my pockets were empty and bare
My love was so great for that starlett of mine

I've seen trouble all my day.
I bid farewell to old Kentucky,
The place where I was born and raised.

For six long years I've been in trouble,
No pleasures here on earth I found.
For in this world I'm bound to ramble,
I have no friends to help me now.

It's fare thee well my old lover.
I never expect to see you again.
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad,
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.

You can bury me in some deep valley,
For many years where I may lay.
Then you may learn to love another,
While I am sleeping in my grave.

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face, you'll never see no more.

I'll meet you on God's golden shore.",Man of Constant Sorrow

With a dram glass in her hands
She's drinking away her troubles
She's a courting some other man

Oh how can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
A shining in the moonlight
Like two diamonds in the sky

Last time a saw little Maggie
She was sitting on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four around her
And a banjo on her knee

Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain

Down by a cold frosty stream
Set down on a bed of hemlocks and primroses
And gently I fell into a dream

I dreamed I saw a pretty fair maiden
Such beauty I'd never saw before
Her dress was bound round with hemlocks and primroses
So green was the mantel she wore

Her hair was of a dark brown color
Her teeth was as ivory so white
Her eyes they shined like sparking diamonds
Or stars than shine on a cold frosty night

I drew her near then I awakened
With two empty arms and you on my mind
Heaven seemed so near while I was dreaming
It hurts to know you left me behind",Hemlocks and Primroses

The woman I love she left me this morning

Ralph Stanley,"I was born in East Virginia
North Carolina I did go
There I courted a fair young maiden
But her age I did not know

Oh her hair was dark and curly
And her cheeks were rosy red
On her breast she wore a lilly
Where I longed to lay my head

Molly dear, go ask your mother
If you my bride might ever be
If she says no, come back and tell me
And I'll run away with thee

No I'll not go ask my mother
Where she lies on her bed of rest
In her hand she holds a dagger
To kill the man that I love best

The ocean's deep and I can't wade it
And I have no wings to fly
I'll just get some blue-eyed boatman
For to row me o'er the tide

I'll go back to East Virginia
North Carolina ain't my home
I'll go back to East Virginia
Leave old North Carolina alone

I don't want your green back dollar
I don't want your watch and chain
All I want is you my darling
Say you'll take me back again

At my gate I'll always greet you

Under the same old sycamore tree
Proud of each other and the land of the free

I go down to the ocean blue
Its just as close as I came to you
This old ocean might keep us apart
But it won't keep you dear out of my heart

So happy and free at God's right hand

And rose from the grave

On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore),
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)
Not one little grave (not one little grave),
In all that fair land (that wonderful land).
Not even a tear will dim the eye,
And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing His praise through endless days

When I must cross that rolling tide,
There'll be someone on the other side
Welcoming me to that fair land, made perfect by love
When I walk up the milky white way,

How great it must be for angels to see

When will I lay these burdens down
And when I die, dear Lord, in heaven
Please take my soul from 'neath that cold, dark ground

When late that night they came and told her

And when I die, dear Lord, in heaven

Ralph Stanley II,"Oh it's raining, raining, raining here this morning 
As I sit in jail and hang my head in shame 
With a smile I try to greet each early dawning
But they've given me a number for my name 

   Many a little raindrops are falling close to me 
   Makes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can be 
   It's raining, raining, raining here this morning 
   As the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

How I wish that I could see my little darling 
And hold her in my arms just as before 
I used to tell her every day I loved her 
But now she doesn't love me anymore 

   She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime 
   And said that she'd be waiting there for me 
   But she has found somewhere else to wander 
   Where the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

Its raining, raining, raining here this morning 
And I am just as weary as can be 
I wish that I could follow all the raindrops 
Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea 

   But there's no way to prove that I'm not guilty 
   So I will have to suffer all the shame 
   Go and tell her for me little raindrops 
   That they've given me a number for my name

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

And she broke your throne and she cut your hair

What's really going on below

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And Jesus himself would condemn us all to this self-made hell.

Hell is the sign of our times,

But now the victims,
They're rising,
Their numbers are multiplying.
They want their revenge for the years that they've been dying.

And old shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hold
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

for ol shep he knew he was going to go
for he reached down and licked at my hand
then he looked up at me just as much as to say
we're parting but i understand

Where the good doggies go
And no more with old shep will I roam

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"Come gather round me children, a story I will tell
Of Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw, Oklahoma knew him well.
Was in the town of Shawnee on a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in the wagon as into town they rode.
A deputy sheriff approached them in a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language and his wife she overheard.
Well, Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain, and the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed, he laid that deputy down.
Then he took to the trees and rivers to lead a life of shame.
Every crime in Oklahoma was added to his name.
Yes he took to the trees and timbers on the Canadian river shore,
And the outlaw found a welcome at many a farmer's door.
Yes, there's many a starving farmer, the same story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage and saved their little home.
Others tell about the stranger who came to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin left a thousand dollar bill.
It was in Oklahoma City, it was on a Christmas day
Came a whole carload of groceries and a letter that did say,
""Well, you say that I'm an outlaw, and you say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner for the families on relief.""
Well, as through the world I've rambled, I've seen lots of funny men,
Some rob you with a sixgun, some with a fountain pen.
As through this world you ramble, as through this world you roam,
You'll never see an outlaw drive a family from its home.",Pretty Boy Floyd

Railroad Bill took my wife, 
If I didn't like it, gonna take my life. 

Goin' on a mountain, goin' out west 
Thirty-eight special stickin' out of my vest. 

Buy me a pistol just as long as my arm 
Shoot everybody ever done me harm. 

Got a thirty-special in a forty-five frame, 
I can't miss 'cause I got dead aim. 

Railroad Bill, he ain't so bad 
Whupped his mama, shot his old dad. 

Early one morning, standing in the rain 
Round the bend come a long freight train.

Killed McMillan by the light of the moon 

McMillan had a special train 
When they got there they was prayin' 

Kill me a chicken, send me the wing 
They think I'm workin', Lord, I ain't doin' a thing. 

Kill me a chicken, send me the head, 
Think I'm workin', Lord, I'm layin' in bed.

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"My name is Juanano de Castro
My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game
To hell with those lords o'er the sea

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

I played in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn
I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

From [the] California to the [Staten] New York Island,
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters,
[God blessed America for me.]
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
And saw above me that endless skyway,
And saw below me the golden valley, I said:
[God blessed America for me.]

I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me , a voice was sounding:
[God blessed America for me.]

Was a high wall there that tried to stop me
A sign was painted said: Private Property,
But on the back side it didn't say nothing
[God blessed America for me.]

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling;
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:
[God blessed America for me.]

One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple
By the Relief Office I saw my people
As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering if

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"I hear the train a-comin', it's rollin round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since...I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on
But that train keeps a-rollin', on down to San Anton

When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
""always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shoot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folk eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison, if railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away",Folsom Prison Blues
Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"Oh my name it is nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I's taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that land that I live in
Has God on its side.

Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Oh the country was young
With God on its side.

Oh the Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I's made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side.

Oh the First World War, boys
It closed out its fate
The reason for fighting
I never got straight
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead
When God's on your side.

When the Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side.

I've learned to hate Russians
All through my whole life
If another war starts
It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side.

But now we got weapons
Of the chemical dust 
If fire them we're forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side.

In a many dark hour
I've been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you
You'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side.

So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell

I've given you my tomorrow
Love me only

If I worked my hands in wood, would you still love me

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"It was early springtime that the strike was on
They moved us miners out of doors
Out from the houses that the company owned
We moved into tents at old Ludlow

I was worried bad about my children
Soldiers guarding the railroad bridge
Every once in a while a bullet would fly
Kick up gravel under my feet

We were so afraid they would kill our children
We dug us a cave that was seven foot deep
Carried our young ones and a pregnant woman
Down inside the cave to sleep

That very night you soldiers waited
Until us miners were asleep
You snuck around our little tent town
Soaked our tents with your kerosene

You struck a match and the blaze it started
You pulled the triggers of your gatling guns
I made a run for the children but the fire wall stopped me
Thirteen children died from your guns

I carried my blanket to a wire fence corner
Watched the fire till the blaze died down
I helped some people grab their belongings
While your bullets killed us all around

I will never forget the looks on the faces
Of the men and women that awful day
When we stood around to preach their funerals
And lay the corpses of the dead away

We told the Colorado governor to call the President
Tell him to call off his National Guard
But the National Guard belong to the governor
So he didn't try so very hard

Our women from Trinidad they hauled some potatoes
Up to Walsenburg in a little cart
They sold their potatoes and brought some guns back
And put a gun in every hand

The state soldiers jumped us in a wire fence corner
They did not know that we had these guns
And the red neck miners mowed down them troopers
You should have seen those poor boys run

We took some cement and walled that cave up
Where you killed those thirteen children inside
I said, ""God bless the Mine Workers' Union""
And then I hung my head and cried ",Ludlow Massacre

I slept on the ground in the light of the moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind

Dig the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"Take a trip with me in nineteen thirteen
To Calumet, Michigan, in the copper country.
I'll take you to a place called Italian Hall
Where the miners are having their big Christmas ball.

I'll take you through a door, and up a high stairs.
Singing and dancing is heard everywhere,
I will let you shake hands with the people you see
And watch the kids dance round that big Christmas tree.

You ask about work and you ask about pay;
They'll tell you that they make less than a dollar a day,
Working the copper claims, risking their lives,
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives.

There's talking and laughing and songs in the air,
And the spirit of Christmas is there everywhere,
Before you know it, you're friends with us all
And you're dancing around and around in the hall.

Well, a little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights
To play the piano, so you gotta keep quiet.
To hear all this fun you would not realize
That the copper-boss thug-men are milling outside.

The copper-boss thugs stuck their heads in the door
One of them yelled and he screamed, ""There's a fire!""
A lady, she hollered, ""There's no such a thing!
Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing.""

A few people rushed, and it was only a few
""It's only the thugs and the scabs fooling you.""
A man grabbed his daughter and carried her down
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out.

And then others followed, a hundred or more
But most everybody remained on the floor.
The gun-thugs they laughed at their murderous joke,
While the children were smothered on the stair by the door.

Such a terrible sight I never did see
We carried our children back up to their tree.
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree
And the children that died there were seventy-three.

The piano played a slow funeral tune
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon,
The parents they cried and the miners they moaned,
""See what your greed for money has done."" ",1913 Massacre

Knew the train would roll that day, but I did not know what time. 

I did not know what time, boys, did not know what time.

Heard the radio tellin' the news: 
That the big Red Army took a hundred towns, 
And Allies droppin' them two-ton bombs. 
Started hollerin', yellin', dancin' up and down like a bullfrog!

Doorbell rung and in come a man, 
I signed my name, I got a telegram. 
Said, ""If you wanna take a vacation trip, 
Got a dish-washin' job on a Liberty ship.""

'Bout two minutes I run ten blocks, 
I come to my ship, down at the dock; 
Walked up the plank, and I signed my name, 
Blowed that whistle, was gone again! 
Right on out and down the stream, ships as fur as my eye could see, woman a-waitin'.

Ship loaded down with TNT 
All out across the rollin' sea; 
Stood on the deck, watched the fishes swim, 
I'se a-prayin' them fish wasn't made out of tin. 
Sharks, porpoises, jellybeans, rainbow trouts, mudcats, jugars, all over that water.

This convoy's the biggest I ever did see, 
Stretches all the way out across the sea; 
And the ships blow the whistles and a-rang her bells, 
Gonna blow them fascists all to hell! 
Win some freedom, liberty, stuff like that.

Walked to the tail, stood on the stern, 
Lookin' at the big brass screw blade turn; 
Listened to the sound of the engine pound, 
Gained sixteen feet every time it went around. 
Gettin' closer and closer, look out, you fascists.

I'm just one of the merchant crew, 
I belong to the union called the N. M. U. 
I'm a union man from head to toe,

A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.
It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say:

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen.

Yes, as through your life you roam,

Not one minute would she wait. She kissed my cheek and left my gate.

[Chorus]
Those brown eyes I loved so well. Those brown eyes I long to see.
How I long for those brown eyes. Strangers they have grown to be.

One night I met her on the street. I tipped my hat but I could not speak.
Another man was by her side. Soon I thought she'd be his bride.",Those Brown Eyes
Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"There's more pretty girls than one there's more pretty girls than one
Every town I ramble around there's more pretty girls than one
look down the railroad line
hear the train go by
the train drove by with the woman i love
hung down my head and cried 
look down across that sea
see the breakers swell
how many a love has washed away
no human tongue can tell",More Pretty Girls Than One
Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"It was down in Old Joe's barroom, 
On the corner by the square, 
The usual crowd was assembled 
And big Joe McKinney was there. 

He was standing at my shoulder.
His eyes were bloodshot red; 
He turned to the crowd around him, 
These are the very words he said: 

""I went down to the St. James Infirmary 
I saw my baby there, 
She's laid out on a cold white table, 
So so cold, so white, so fair."" 

""Let her go, let her go, God bless her; 
Wherever she may be 
She may search this wide world over 
She'll never find a sweet man like me."" 
Oh, when I die, bury me 
In my high top Stetson hat; 
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain 
God'll know I died standin' pat. 

I want six crap shooters for pall bearers. 
Chorus girl to sing me a song.
Put a jazz band on my hearse wagon.
Raise Hell as I roll along. 

Roll out your rubber tired carriage,
Roll out your old time hat.
Twelve men going to the graveyard
And eleven coming back.

Now that I've told my story,
I'll take another shot of booze.
And if anyone should happen to ask you,
I've got those gamblers' blues.",St. James Infirmary
Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"At my window, sad and lonely 
Oft times do I think of thee 
Sad and lonely and I wonder 
Do you ever think of me 

Every day is sad and lonely

And planes may fly the stormy sky

Ramblin' Jack Elliott,"Me and my brother was down close to the depot
When I heard the report of a pistol
I hollered, ""I wonder what was that!""

He run out and come back and he said
""That was a report of a pistol""

And I thought I was gonna faint when he said it
""Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low""

Lord, I knew the President was supposed to be down the depot that day
But I just wouldn't let myself believe that he'd been shot

Me and my bother run out there and everybody was all confused
And hollering' and running' round
And I stepped up to this one lady and I said that

""Ma'am what was it really that happened Ma'am?"", and she said that
""Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low""

Well, it looked like everybody felt just about as bad as I did
Everybody started drift off to home
Me and my brother did too

Then a few weeks later, I heard that the President was still alive
So I told my brother, I said, ""Hey let's get on a train
And go to that Big House up there and see how the President is""

""Let's go up there to where he's laid up hurt and sick we'd see him""
So we went on up there and that big White House
And there was a soldier boy standin' round upside, outside

And, I sidled up to him and I said to that soldier boy
I said ""Who was it that did it?
Who was it that shot the President?""
And he said that, ""It was Charlie Guiteau that shot Mr. Garfield""

And I said, ""Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man, good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man, good man""

That soldier boy said that
Miss Lucretia Garfield was always at his bedside
In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot

And he said just that mornin' that he had been at the window
And he'd overheard Miss Lucretia and Mr. Garfield talkin'
And Mr Garfield said, ""Crete, honey"", he called her Crete

He said, ""Crete, honey, if somethin' worse would happens to me""
He said, ""You get yourself a good man""
And she said, ""Now James"", she called him James

She said, ""James, I won't hear to that now
'Cause I love you too much""

And he said that ""You'll make some good man a good wife, good wife
You'll make some man a good wife gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life, good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life""

That's what he said, ""Don't pull in single harness all your life""

Well a little while later, we come back around there
And things have changed
The flag was hangin' halfway up the flagpole

And everybody was cryin' and standin' 'round sad
And I walked back up to this soldier boy and I said
""Soldier boy, is he, is Mr Garfield?"" and he said, ""Yeah, he's gone""

Gonna lay him by that cold lonesome branch down low
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low
Oh, Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low

Have you heard the news?
Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low, Lord

Ramin Karimloo,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey to a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight

Time crawls by
Night steals in, pacing the floor

Yet I can't bear to sleep
Till I hear you sing

And weeks pass, and months pass
Seasons fly
Still you don't walk through the door
And in a haze
I count the silent days
Till I hear you sing once more.

And sometimes at night time
I dream that you are there
But wake holding nothing but the cold night air

And years come, and years go
Time runs dry
Still I ache down to the core
My broken soul
Can't be alive and whole
Till I hear you sing once more

And music, your music
It teases at my ear
I turn and it fades away and you're not here

Let hopes pass, let dreams pass
Let them die
Without you, what are they for?
I'll always feel
No more than halfway real
Till I hear you sing once more",Til I Hear You Sing

Und hat es wieder glatt gefegt

Wozu er diesen Fächer braucht

Zögernd hab ich dann gefragt

Hat er bevor er starb gesagt

Erst wenn es glatt ist, wirst du sehen
Wie viel Märchen dir noch bleibt

Die Eltern waren beide aus
Da sah ich plötzlich vor mir stehen
Ein Schächtelchen nett anzusehen

Warum werd ich nicht gesund

Es beißt sich fest es schmerzt mich sehr
Ich spring im Zimmer hin und her

Die Jacke brennt es leuchtet weit
Es brennt die Hand es brennt das Haar

Que ardía en mi pecho cuando fuiste mía

Y tal vez me querías como te quiero 
Pero fuiste cobarde en aquel momento
Y me dejaste por otro echando al olvido

Me dejo la mujer que tenia ahora pierdo también a mi hijo

Por que yo andaba siempre borracho

Para que yo siguiera tomando

Llego el pobre hasta donde yo estaba

Ahora si que no me dieron nada
Tengo hambre y también mucho frio
Por favor hoy no me digas nada

Pero yo ciego de tanta ira
Le golpeé hasta casi matarlo
Y le dije te vas a la calle
Ya no pienso seguirte aguantando
Ya no tienes ni casa ni padre si no traes

Y llorando por lo que le dije

Sabrá Dios que tanto lo maldije

Desperté casi ya amaneciendo
Al abrir la puerta de la casa
No creí lo que yo estaba viendo

Allí estaba mi hijo tirado
Había muerto de hambre y de frio
En su mano le halle dos monedas
Que me traiga pa comprar mas vino
Y yo briago no oí que tocaba
Y así el pobre murió en el olvido

Por borracho perdí yo a mi hijo

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking

Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows

Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows

Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes

After I met her, her teacher said ""Best wait five years.""
I ask my neighbors, they said it's wise to wait five years.

'Cause she fears that no man will ever desire her so bad.
How dare I feel this and do naught but sit on my hands.

I visited Russia and I started folding
Until in one precious doll I had hoarded
All of Siberia; I said, Love, here ya

Until I finally found the spring brimming
With God's purest water from Abba the father
To heal her
She said:
Too little too late

I sailed to Komodo, I fought with the dragons
When it was over, their tails were wagging
I taught them tricks, said Sit, dragon, sit
I brought her a pet

And I lapped it seven times, which caused it to fall

I couldn't help but drink in

I jumped ship, you couldn't see me
You thought I had breathed my last
I started swimmin' towards the shore

I couldn't pacify
