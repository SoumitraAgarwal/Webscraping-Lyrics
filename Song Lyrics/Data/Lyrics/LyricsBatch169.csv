Hiram Bullock,"I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
I came back to ley you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
And they may never find what they dream of
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everthing 
But you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

And though I only want the best it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do
",What You Won't Do for Love
Hiram Bullock,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Hird Family,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.

Hird Family,"Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through

Hird Family,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Hiro,"AS TIME GOES BY 時はゆるやかに
哀しみもやがて流すだろう
AS TEARS GO BY
たどり着けるよね
眠れない心あずけられる場所
あたりまえに入れ替わる昼と夜
ドラマもスリルもそれなりで
イイんじゃないマジで語れる
ほどのもんじゃ無いよね
感じなくなる傷みなんて
戦うことじゃなく優しさなんだよね
バランス悪いハートが叫ぶよ
HEY YEAH
AS TIME GOES BY もうやめようよ
憧れや夢に瞳そらす事
AS TEARS GO BY ゆずれないモノ
遠く小さくてもいつか手にいれよう
はしゃぐ写真思い出せない日付は
あきらめ失くしかけた夢みたい
派手で退屈しなけりゃいい
それってなに
リアルに何かたりないってわかるよ
もういいんじゃない
いつも気付かないフリ
やりたいそう言えればいいのに
HEY YEAH
AS TIME GOES BY 時はおだやかに
苦しみもやがて溶かすだろう
AS TEARS GO BY また逢えるよね
月日の流れに失くした誰かに
SO どうでもイイどうなってもイイ
白でも黒でもどっちでもイイ
だけど楽しいゲームで飛ばしたい
HERE WE GO 街をただようみたいに
今日も明日も SO 歩きたい
上げては下がるルーズなテンション
ダブダブしすぎがちょうどイイ
かすかな星の光も届かない
聞こえるのはベルと心の振動
街の時計が今日を昨日にかえてく
その時フイに涙あふれた
タイムリミットだね
捜し始めてるのは
いまという替わりのない時でしょ
HEY YEAH
WE CAN SAY BYE BYE 微笑みながら
過ぎて行く昨日に手を振ろう
WE CAN SAY BYE BYE
歩きだせるよね
踊るようにまた来る明日へ
TIME GOES BY 時はゆるやかに
哀しみもやがて流すだろう

Hiroe Sekine,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love

No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love
Hiroe Sekine,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life
Hiroko Kokubu,"Talking by the pool of light, language from America.
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
They are not a melting pot, say no, say no tapestry
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd

She takes his hand and she says you'll stay
She's lost in the crowd
King
Wire them up, fire them up
The life and times, the art and talk
Wire them up, fire them up
The life and times, the art and talk

Lovers run camp Africa, Bars in town are civilised
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
Panorama, Citylife
Youth's dance proud from the waist down
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd

Shot from where the action is, a rhapsody in black and blue
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
Love lies under western eyes, powerful yet transient
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd

Hiromi,"Searching for answers
I'm trying to find
Peace for these wars
Going on in my mind

Circumstance holds me
That leave me at Your feet
I'm praying for mercy
Lord, can You hear me
I know You can hear me

[Chorus]
With all of my heart
I am calling to You
With all of my heart
I am reaching to You

I know there are millions
Searching for Your ear
Sharing their troubles
Their questions and their fear

But I know that You have
A place reserved for me
So, Lord, I come, unworthy
So shed Your grace on me
Won't You shed your grace on me

Repeat [Chorus] to end",Do Mo (Children's Song #12)
Hiromi,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Hiromi,"Yeah, oh
You count every word I say
Over again you might find a way
Seven verses to magnify
Drop the feathers you will never fly

[Chorus]
Tapestries of black and gold they're crying
Looking through the windows I am watching you
You as you go by

Turn on a wave of fire
Your pale skin can't turn any whiter
Grab a wheel sing a bitter tune
Never stops to forget you've seen

[Chorus]

Walk along a lonely mile
Saw a bird falling at my feet
Crawling like a wounded child
Moving farther out of reach
Don't want to be alone, no
Come on, come on, come on

You count every word I say
Over again you could find a way
Seven verses to magnify
Drop the feathers you will never fly

Hiromi Kanda,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
Hiromi Kanda,"I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new
Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you",I'll Never Smile Again
Hiromi Kanda,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Hiroshi Kubota,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

It's too late.",It's Too Late
Hiroshima,"Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon in the sky for our love

If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love

We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry

How can I make you see that it's cool

It's alright I hope you understand

So come on
Why can't you let me be your baby

There's so much that I won't to way
Something inside that makes me turn away

But won't you hesitate

But you don't know what's going on inside my heart
If you let me in then we can begin right now
Knock on my door and we can make a start

Imagine talking to a tiger, chatting with a cheetah

If we could talk to the animals, learn their languages
Maybe take an animal degree
We'd study Elephant and Eagle, Buffalo and Beagle
Alligator, Guinea Pig and Flea

We could converse in Polar Bear and Python
And we could curse in fluent Kangaroo
If people ask us, “Can you speak Rhinoceros?”
We'd say, ""Of courserous, can't you?""

If we conferred with our furry friends, man to animal
Think of the all the things we could discuss
If we could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals

If we consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we’d have asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions, walruses or sea lions

We’d learn to speak in Antelope and Turtle
Our Pekingese would be extremely good
If we were asked to sing in Hippopotamus
We’d say “Whynotamous?”, and would

All she talked about was dressin Express and her favorite lines
But little did I know she had a million other guys

Had to switch to her hips, carried herself like a lady

Hittman,"Once long ago, I held onto a pride
Something inside me died, cast my memories aside, long ago
Far beyond the dome, where time's wind always blows
Your people chose to run, to breed beneath the sun
They're home

Deep inside the glass I peer out through your eyes
For you I'd compromise, live my life in disguise
Anything

[Chorus]
We live behind the lines where no one knows
We live behind the lines

Far out from this place, my father he awaits
Not for my life he prays but yet my bravery he raves

Hittman,"Locked up inside behind iron doors
Solitary in stone
Taken by force, a prisoner of war
Time lets us know we're alone

Time, wearing my life down
Inside the walls surrounded
Destined to be damned, by the iron hand

[CHORUS:]
Breakout, breakout
Breakout, breakout

Held in a state of motionless time
Determined to find my way out
Fighting to live I'm fearing to die
The choices are clear but I can't decide

These chains holding my life down
No longer keep me bound
Destined to be damned by the iron hand

[CHORUS]
Gone is the pain
But still in my mind are the memories
And scars that remain
For once I had lived as a slave, a prisoner enchained
But at last I have found my way out, it's so good to be free!

[CHORUS]",Breakout
Hittman,"I call your name but you're not quite there
You feel the same, who said life was fair
Turn the words around, shattered heart burns inside you

Locked in my dreams it's all I've learned
And from what I've seen it's got to be real
That's when my feelings start to spill

I gave my love, I tried before
To fight those tears, I can't wait anymore

Will you be there, will you be there
It started again, all the love and the time I've spent
It's over and then, you come on strong
Until I give in

It hurts sometimes, I cried before
To fight those tears, I won't wait anymore

Will you be there, oh, to share, my love...
It hurts sometimes, I cried before
To fight those tears, I can't wait anymore

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Hoagy Carmichael,"I gotta gal that's mighty sweet
With blue eyes and tiny feet
Her name is Rosabelle Magee
And she tips the scale at three o three

Oh gee, but ain't it grand to have a girl
So big and fat that when you hug her
You don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a way and chalk a mark
To see where you began

One day when I was a huggin' and a chalkin'
And a chalkin' and a huggin' a way
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way 'round the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Nobody ever said I'm weak
My bones don't ache and my joints creak
But I, I grow absolutely limp
Every time I kiss my baby blimp, oh

One day I had a yen for some one leaner, she was meaner than a
Mink in a pen. So I left her now I'm happy as a fella could be
Huggin' and chalkin' in once a gain 'round my Rosie
Huggin' and chalkin' in once again

One day I was a huggin' and a chalkin' and a beggin' her to be my bride
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' a round the other side of the mountain
Comin' around the other side

He sprinkles their hearts with his magic
Then he steals away to sing another day

You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,

And Mister Reginald De Koven

Or they're gonna be corny too.

You'll begin to hear swing,

That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.

As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed

A shady veranda under a Sunday blue sky
Memphis in June
And cousin Amanda's makin' a rhubarb pie
I can hear the clock inside tickin' and a-tockin'
Everything is peacefully dandy
I can see old granny cross the street, still a-rockin'
Watching the neighbors go by
Memphis in June
With sweet oleander blowing perfume in the air
Up jumps the moon to make it that much grander
It's paradise, brother take my advice
Nothing's half as nice as Memphis in June

Hobbit,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Slayer and saviour
Leader and player
Player hater, how you unworthy of the presence
Infold or bow to the essence
Bend to the blessings or die by the weapons of creation
Visions by the seekers of the nation
Spit this vibration
Spread him through the depths of the darkness
The nucleus of all that evolves
Warriors, for the war we win
All the way to the way of the wind
The illusion is in

It is he that holds the key to places heaven and hell
When all hell breaks loose, the heavens prevail
Water signs and stars aligning, I just sat in a cell
40 acres and a donkey, I'm a pin on the tail
You done followed me and my mind but who are you in the shadows?
Speaking shallow, hallow's prepping evil plans in the gallows
Centred in the desert lies an oasis and swims a tadpole
Oh now you're creeping out the backdoor, devil use an asshole
You've casted me away from my temple, plain and simple
Popping quizzes worse than pimples, far from gentle
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
Oh Lord forgive me, forgive us
This world is fading, it's crippled
Draw up the contract in the stipulation
When it's storms, I'm receiving precipitation
I'm told my name's linked to foul litigations and hatred
I'm the hierophant, holy sacred
Last release your least favourite
My ancestors stare inside of me for rivalry, the native
A pope, they label me the only hope
What happens when a demon meets the one and only G.O.A.T

It's an exorcism, cut demons off me like a circumcision
Exorcism, cut demons off me like a circumcision
Exorcism, cut demons off me like a circumcision

The wave, the wave
The wave, the wave
Ooh the wave, ooh the wave

Lately my powers have been rising higher
Fighting off all the demons below me
And whatever the case may be, a Mophie
My batteries on full charge and I'm paying attention closely
I've learned that ball is life and I'm the goalie
My pride is my treasure
My ego is stashed away like a goatee
My pen is pointy, start provoking
Pain's what I harbor mostly
And who I talk to openly, impartially ghostly
My ancestors are keen, conversion and poetry
I'm glad they know me
For the most part mostly
The past, the present, and the future, I'm Jodeci
I'm glad they know me

Hours turn to days as I grow in age
Existed in my emotion standing before my rage
Burning intensive sage

Ooh the wave, ooh the wave

Can't get away from the waves, they are humongous
Washing away everything in sight
And just as you thought you could run away
The wave will be here today
Brace yourself, here it comes

A man could fall but never on all fours like a Daewoo
A Prelude, bowing down to Jesus
A community having communion
Sharing crackers and grape juice
A spider's on the pew, kill it
It's H the recluse
On the loose like alcoholics with Grey Goose
I'm Boston babe like Babe Ruth
My steel toed Nubucks suede too
My future's a mirage
Experiencing deja vu
And out of all of my siblings I'm the voodoo child
Was a voodoo child as a juvenile
Grown up nigga, I'm a mutant now
Throwing flames, spitting butane now
Got the cutest smile

At the table of death is most likely where the beast eats

Letting go of your promises
Promises lead to consequence, when you commit to something and do the opposite
Sick to your stomach, you're vomiting, a Ramadan
No food for children you're fathering
The possibility of your family surviving this shit is kinda slim

Every time I speak
I speak to you
Every time I reach
I reach out for you baby
Every time I breathe
I feel your heart beating next to mine
Is it real
What I feel
This time

I am distracted often
Running to meet you somewhere
Hoping the flowers never die
And then you leave me breathless
Rushing to look in the mirror
Surprised to see the face is mine

So what is wrong with me
I know I should be happy
I don't feel right in my own skin

You were eating a burrito
With a girl-some brunette
At El Torosco's.

Like you knew
That someday we'd be together.

For a while.

Ever since you walked
Away from me.
I miss you for real,
Everyday of my life.
How do I feel'
Now that it's over,
For the thing that I miss the most
Is missing you.

I was lost
For a while
Every place brought back a memory
Of a kiss, or a smile

That you gave me.
Now it's changed
Well I guess.
More and more

I miss you less and less.
Sometimes it's hard
To let go.

Sometimes you get trapped
In the time of your life.
But you know
It gets a little easier
Over time.

How do I feel'
Now that it's over.
For the thing that I miss
The most.

I miss the moody
Walks in the rain.
I miss the poetry.
I miss the days.
I miss the sad songs
I used to play.

For the thing that I miss the most,
How do I feel'
I miss you for real.
How do I feel'
Now that it's over,
For the thing that I miss the most

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you

I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

Well you, you don't fuck with the fabulous four
Or you spend the rest of your life
Picking things up off the floor
She's still alive but I am sure
That all the stars belong to her
On California king-sized beds

Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past

Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow
And dancing all night to ""Baby, Please Come Home""

May I give him the star you gave to me""

A voice that was heard throughout the world
""Go down little angel girl and give him your star
Tonight he'll light the world"", 'cause

Everyone will be happy everybody but me
Tonight I'll be there by myself I won't be with somebody else
Cause the one that I love has been stolen away
Cause there'll be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight
And every Saturday night bitter tears I will fight
All the songs that I will hear will just bring sadness to my ear
Cause there'll be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight

Cause there'll be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight

There'll be no more joy and songs for me you were the only one

What's poppin?  Smokin on veggas and kill switches
Homies twisted and fitted in EB and Hilfiger
Real niggas on my side ballin out of control
And all the hoes know we got the north financially sold
On the road, doing shows, backstage with hoes
Nobody knows what goes down once the doors is closed
Playa clickin on the scene, smokin Sacramento green
Leave as we sweep down your street in something clean
On a mission pimpin, flippin up chips to make a livin
Concentrate on millions, and sick of dealin these killins
It's another hustle everyday but I maintain
Caught up in this struggle, so I refuse to gangbang
Got my mind on bigtime, that this whole world owe us

Dry my eyes from all the rainy days 
And slingin yay, now when we parley
Gold things spin to the bay
And to the day we close down shop
We got tapes to sling $50,000 knot
Sippin expensive drinks, 18k links
And more sophisticated than a top notch can think
In the industry risin, and we still high siden
Something fully equipped, Nautica and diamonds
Thought I wasn't sliden up in um cause I'm hollow
When Rimmie Marks swallows out the $30 bottle
When the Lexus roll up, babygirl hold up
Because I'm down with high side my whole clique fittin to

I'm on a mission about my mail, million dollar clientele
Nationwide I'm satisfied, but decide it was hell
I had to struggle hard to be financially stable
But now I'm in the light with hundred spokes on my label
Loungin in condos, sittin on leather and brass
Lookin at big screens, my Tommy Hil's full of cash
Can you imagine it, my whole crew havin it
Tuxedos and Benzes and automatic clips
On a rise to the top it's a trip nonstop
We in this game for the millions, scrilla over props
Gold things touch the ground, like green crush it down
Let my 15's hit till the hoes say must it pound
I'm the man across the land, pay my bills by the grand
Hoes rush me, tryin to touch me, got top notch fans
Now the struggle is over, no more jobs only your love
All these haters still talkin but they can watch a nigga

Holly Brook,"Unlocking metaphors
Caches that were safe before
Lost their secrets to the wind

It isn't everyday
You can see the other face
Watching you I'm watching me who could this be

Your wounds begin to sing
Red melodies that sting
Like ice bury me twice

Running from the heat from the lines that break me
I'll give another try

Fallen angel
Your terminal high
Feeding the hunger of your sky
Take all the poison that I give
Just to live
For the feeling
Use me again

Your stuck in a centerfold
Written in capitals
Bake the time talking through wine

Young boys that you tantalize
Sipping on your pretty eyes
But you kill just to feel real

Lately on this vine the showers have been steady
Are you ready for this flight?",Again & Again

Around this crazy place
Nobody seems to understand me
Till you came along and told me this

All will be forgotten
Every tear you've cried
As soon as you awaken
To what's right in front of your eyes
Standing by your side

Sittin' here I'm thinkin' 'bout the weather and
The countryside around me
Simple little things like these are good to keep
My silly mind from wondering
I feel the summer breeze wash over me
Oh I know the laughter know the love and
Maybe I've just got enough to give

All will be forgotten
Every tear you've cried
As soon as you awaken

Cellar door, are you open to find me
Iron ore shields remorse
When I look, I look to your beautiful name
And find you're not the same

Cellar door, what's the case
Are you locked in your shadow's embrace
Do you feel so insane
That you don't, you don't want to show me your face
But I, I can relate

Holding on to everything
That makes us bleed

Overflowing underneath my pretty face
With the presence of the haste
Now they're sayin' don't believe anything
But I do believe, I know you well

Cellar dooroligist
Your therapy is the one I love best
You give me strength to confess
That I, I will not last very long
So soon, I'll be gone

Oh, these walls know everything
And I'm tired of being lost inside

Overflowing underneath my pretty face
With the presence of the haste
Now they're sayin', don't believe anything
But I do believe I know you

Overflowing underneath my pretty face
With the presence of the haste
Now they're sayin', don't believe anything

Coming between me and waking

Underneath the corset of your mystery
Piece by piece undress you from your history
I'm sleeping with seclusion in sweet disarray

You can go heavy on me
And I will not weigh you down, down, down
You can be steady and clean
I can take it
Heavy on me
And I will not weigh you down

Born unto this pride
Silence is something you can't hide
You can't deny us

Each moment has got a lesson for the day
Take something with you
We can't drag our heels in yesterdays
Oh these Saturdays

In the haste in the grace I've had up to my waist
It isn't real what you feel when you find love in a chase
I've been waiting for the day when someone takes me away
And I'd never get replaced
But I have got time

Stop pushing all your tragedies away
Each moment has got a lesson for the day
Take something with you
We can't drag our heels in yesterdays

These Saturdays, oh

As I sink one more drink I am running out of ink
I'm feeling void paranoid about every little thing
And I wonder if I tried to give up and say goodbye
If I'll have the strength to leave
Cause I don't have much time anymore

Holly Brook,"You drank a bit down, spilled the rest of it in me
And that's the minute, I let go
Your direction with the bending of the light
If I remember it right

It carried on just fine
But tonight I will cry myself to sleep

Every rain makes its way into somebody's song
As a way to relieve the pain
This one is calling me out of my shelter
To face the truth but I still love

More than one time this color has been mine
To consume the energy
To be a painter and cover all the blue
I would give up wanting you

But still the morning sun, yeah
Will leak into my window when I'm done

Every rain makes its way into somebody's song
As a way to relieve the pain
This one is calling me out of my shelter
To face the truth but I'm still

Searching for my intuition
Even though I recognize
Myself in all these silver walls
But as I stare they all break me down

Every rain makes its way into somebody's song
As a way to relieve a pain
This one is calling me out of my shelter
To face the truth but I still love

So I can remember how to live again

Make the Yuletide gay

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Holly Cole,"Hark! how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say,
""Throw cares away.""
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

Ding, dong, ding, dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air

Oh how they pound,
Raising the sound,
O'er hill and dale,
Telling their tale,
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

On, on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone
To ev'ry home",Carol of the Bells

I count my blessings instead of sheep
And I fall asleep counting my blessings
When my bankroll is getting small
I think of when I had none at all

I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds

Just count your blessings instead of sheep
And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings

The curtains drawn,
And I at least pretended
That love was dead and gone.

You come to me as before
To take my heart,
And break my heart once more.

Before it's too late, my love.

Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm

And when you are near,
Close to me dear,

And your pockets are jinglin'
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a 6
And you're looking for the heart of saturday night

Shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace

In the week you know that this'll be the saturday
You're reachin' your peak

Stoppin' on the red
You're goin' on the green
'cause tonight'll be like nothin'
You've ever seen
And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of saturday night

Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin? 
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye? 
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'cause you're dreamin' of them saturdays that came before
And now you're stumblin'

Holly Cole,"Well she's up against the register with an apron and a spatula,
Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes,
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues

And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore
You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue

She said ""How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?"",
You say ""Anyway's the only way"", be careful not to gamble
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues

But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java,
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey
But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind
And the dream that I was chasing, and a battle with booze
And an open invitation to the blues

But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy,
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things
He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't 'cept at night,
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared
So they took the registration, and the car-keys and her shoes
And left her with an invitation to the blues

'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring,
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose?
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay? now I gotta choose,
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues

Holly Cole,"I got no time for the corner boys
Down the street making all that noise
Don't want to horse on eight avenue

Tonight I'm gonna take that ride
Across the river to the Jersey side
Take my baby to the carnival
Well I'll take you on all the rides

Everything's Canada dry
So watch your behavior and rattle your cage
With a bottle of bourbon Good-bye

Now ain't it peculiar that she's finally cooled your
Big wheels just like all of the rest

They're always get played for a chump
So mark and strike it, she's history now

I'll wait up for you dear

Not a lot

Santa cutie, there's one thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine

Santa baby, I'm filling my stocking with a duplex, and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line

Holly Cole,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand

We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling

Holly Cole,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
and my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee,

You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul

Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, 
My old car froze up last night.

And I brightened at last

With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

With those blues on parade

Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made

Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings

Without even turning around
It was just like the feeling I had before
On the night that I watched you walk out
I saw your shadow pass over the wall
And I had to get out of it's way
I'd know that heartache anywhere
I've felt it so many times
I know when it's there

I recognize the signs in your eyes
And so I won't be buying your lies
When you try to tell me you care
I'd know that heartache anywhere

I hoped through the smoke and the neon light
I could slip out the way that I came
But just as I stepped out into the night
I heard you calling my name
There are some things in life
That you'd like to forget
But they just keep coming around

But don't they all
That Silver Eagle's slowing down
Maybe there'll be time enough to call
I don't want to wake him 
But if I wait later then
I'll miss my chance

I just want to hear his voice
I've just got to know he understands
I send my love across the line
The road leads back to us
Until then I send my love across the line
I wish that I could be there to show him

That he is where I'd rather be
But for now these words along the wire
Will have to take the place of me
I wonder if we ever know
The reasons why we take the roads
That drive us on
When all that really matters

Are the ones we always leave behind at home

Holly Dunn,"Billy was born in a one room shack
On the Tennessee line by the railroad track
Caught a bad fever and he went blind
And his Daddy ran off about the same time
His Mama didn't know what to do with the boy
So she gave him Daddy's old guitar as a toy

Billy used to sit on the front porch swing
Pulling off licks and bending those strings
Playing to the rhythm of the south band train
Notes flying off his fingers like a hurricane
Couldn't see nothing, never said a word
But he could sure imitate anything he heard

He could rock, he could roll
(Rock, rock, rock, rock-a-billy)
Cry blues, with soul 
(Rock, rock, rock, rock-a-billy)
Never went to school one single day
But oh that boy could play
He could rock, rock, rock, rock-a-billy

One day a man came to Billy's town
To hear that boy and his guitar sound
He said ""Son, you should be a star""
Now Billy's riding around in a big long car
Making more money than he'll ever spend
'Cause he still has what he had back then

He could rock, he could roll
(Rock, rock, rock, rock-a-billy)
Cry blues, with soul

You sure have a way with words when it comes to us
But before we get carried away
Let's get something straight
What kind of love are we talking about

I gotta know for sure what you really mean
There's love that will never die
There's love that will make you cry
What kind of love are we talking about
What kind of love are we talking about
When you talk about forever
Do you really mean tonight
Or do those four little letters
Mean we'll be together

Tenderly set him free it just might last a lifetime
Yeah if you try to hold too tight it just might be too much
Don't break the wings of the one you love

You can never get enough or give too much

You're determined on turning away

You'd better know just what that means

Holly Dunn,"Here's where I should say goodnight call me up some other time
A little kiss by the front porch light that's what I should do
Anyone with sense at all knows how far and fast to fall
The world is full of brokenhearted fools
That never stopped me no I never hold back
I go playing on the railroad track
Even though there's a good chance that a freight train is bearing down
That never stopped me from falling in love
Knowing better ain't good enough
I see the light but my eyes are shut when a boy like you's around
Never stopped me before it won't stop me now
When I look into your eyes I see all the warning signs
It's too soon to cross that line I will anyway
Fools rush in where angels stop guess which one of them I'm not
Even though I know I'm tempting fate

That never stopped me...",That Never Stopped Me

We've got the love to take it all the way
If we got us to lean on
We've got enough to keep on we're here to stay

We've got the love
I don't know anyone who knows what's down the road
But when the hard times come our love won't go

Asked me how I'd been since he'd been gone

While I wondered where and when we'd met
I hope that I once loved him like he claims

I nearly broke my neck to sneak a peek

Lose their taste for kissing?

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

It's not all it's cracked up to be

My body feels long
And my legs are as smooth as candy
I'm as liquid as the sea
I'm as liquid as the sea
A place for you and me

Completely covered in blankets
Don't really know what to wish for
And just look at the sky and be thankful

Feels like my back might be bleeding
And are my hands really here
Look back at the ground and be hopeful

My body feels long
And my legs are as smooth as candy
I'm as liquid as the sea
I'm as liquid as the sea

And swallowed by a whale
Who grew so old he decomposed
He died and left his body
To the bottom of the ocean

That when a body decomposes

I reached between my legs and found
Found me a silver screw
I held it up and straight out to you
I wish that you would take it

And that leaves me forlorn shares
Even if everyone wanted some

There wouldn't be enough to go around
There wouldn't be enough to go around

She says, ""Honey, well, we don't want no kids
'Cause there's not enough hope""

And he keeps his own room clean
And the hummingbird is on fire

At the coin-op laundromat, on 15th and Montana 
At sweet Suzy Q's up around the corner

Is how the woods call back to you

Doing that crazy dance 
Spinning left to right

And she always said 
The way you call to the woods 
Is how the woods call back to you 

How am I gonna get my work done

Pouring too much wine 
And tuning out sometimes when you fuck me

Too long getting dressed 
Take your tenderness for granted 
Getting negative 
I'm hyper-sensitive 
I come down on you heavy handed

Holly Shelton,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"

Breathing my name with a sigh

Once again I hold you tight

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

Holly Shelton,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

And mail it right away

Got me reeling

Like on my body
And the headlights

Nothing that I can do
Can't stop me from wanting you
I'm losing my self control

If I lose my mind
Touching you tonight
I can't help myself
Gotta satisfy my desire
If I cross the line
If I run this red light
I can't help myself
Gotta satisfy my desire

Right here
Right now
Your adrenaline, pureness
As you hold me
You're still and then we kiss

Can't stop me from wanting you

Gotta satisfy my desire

Holly Williams,"Did your lover leave you stranded
Did your heart endure the truth
Will you fight to find the healing, or will time heal all your wounds
Do you drown in your desire for a time you used to know
Memories can't touch you, they are just a picture show
Don't let go, oh honey, can't you see
Everything's a circle in itself
All as it should be

Have you stood inside a nightmare
Did it slap you in the face
Were you left to lose control
Did you ever find a way
Was it somebody that loved you, or a face you've never seen
So final, so quick are the hands of destiny
Don't let go, honey, can't you see
Everything's a circle in itself
All as it should be

You philosophize each second, then you live as if you're dead
Always aching for the beauty of the visions in your head
Was it something that you wanted, only never had the guts
Now you stand ashamed and regret your giving up
Where would you be if you had tried
If you had given all you could...
To the passion of your life

There is someone out there watching every step you take today
Every struggle, all confusion, endless questions in your head
But He's got you where He wants you
There are reasons we can't see
We all stand where we belong
Every moment meant to be
So don't let go, honey, can't you see
Everything's a circle in itself
All as it should be
All as it should be
All as it should be
All as it should be
",All As It Should Be
Holly Williams,"We are all a little crazy, we are all a little weak
And we all are very fragile when there's nothing left to speak
When there's no one left to talk to, no more tears are left to cry
Will you stand up for the right thing or continue in denial
I don't know

Well, you know I'd love to help you, you know I'd love to heal
But without the hands of God, you will never be revealed
So, take off your mask of happiness, take off your mask of fame
We all know that you've got problems just like everybody's name

I don't know why you fold in the arms of reality
Why do you break with every wave in your stormy sea
You know I'd love to think you were doing fine, but I'd be lying

So, don't tell me everything is good, don't walk on bitter ground
I have seen you at your worst, and I still love you when you're down
But I hate to see you live like this, I hate to see you crying
And I hate to see you tangled in her web of sex and lies
Do you have a god you pray to, do you have a god you love
Do you have some twisted fear about the will from up above
Do you wait for him in silence, do you wait for him in vain
Do you think some crazy fool is gonna preach your pain

I don't know why you fold in the arms of reality
Why do you break with every wave in your stormy sea
Why do you cringe at the wake of every godly dream
While I watch you laughing on the brink of insecurity
You know I'd love to say you were doing fine, but I'd be lying

So, why must you walk with burdens much too big for you to bear
When you know it's not your fault
There are saints and sinners everywhere
You don't have to smile, I can read between your lines
I read guilt, and I read mercy, I read glory to the father
I read bitterness and suffering and love for all your children
I read brokenness inside your heart and scars too deep to see
I read pain from a young boy who's father left too early
Who's mother tried to mold him into what she'd love to be:

I don't know why you fold in the arms of reality
Why do you break with every wave in your stormy sea
And why do you cringe at the wake of every godly dream while
I watch you laughin' on the brink of insecurity
You know we'd love to help, yeah, you know we'd love to heal
But without the hands of God, you will never be revealed
You know we'd all love to say you were doing fine, but we'd be lying
",Between Your Lines
Holly Williams,"A memory falls down from where it was
With this confession I beg for more
I never mean to, and it's been awhile
Since I found meaning in these desires
I know it's wrong to hurt you like this
I know it's wrong to lie like a kid

Fire and blankets, a cheap parade
Of guilty pleasures, I take the stage
But nothing feels good if it ain't true
It's like trying to cry for someone you never knew
I know it's wrong to hurt you like this
I know it's wrong to lie like a kid

I love you with more tears than any pain could ever bring me
I fight it most everyday
I hurt you with more truth than your own eyes could ever teach you
I'm tired of living this way, when I know it's wrong

I never told you, you just kinda knew
By the way I'm not when I'm with you
You never take me like you used to
And nothing heals the scars of all the ones we never knew

I love you with more tears than any pain could ever bring me
I fight it most everyday
I hurt you with more truth than your own eyes could ever teach you
I'm tired of living this way, when I know it's wrong

I know it's wrong to hurt you again
I know it's wrong to lie like a kid

Holly Williams,"I think it's time you look at your own face
Can't you see you're speaking out of place
There's nothing to keep you down
You're reaching for the sky while you drown

I'm aware that I've been lost and I've been unkind
But at least I got the courage to admit the crime
So don't come down on me
I'm still young, I'm trying to believe

Wait, I'll be fine
Just give me a couple years to say my prayers
I'm alive, you should keep that mirror for yourself
You've got problems you never saw and I'm the bearer of them all

Everybody's waiting for me to fall
You criticize my walk as I watch you crawl
Nothing's ever fair
But I believe in reality everywhere

Wait, I'll be fine
Just give me a couple years to say my prayers
I'm alive, you should keep that mirror for yourself
Everybody's fighting hard but there's no leader in the dark

Everybody's waiting for a change
Everybody's waiting for

Everybody's peeking behind that door
If you try too hard you will never find it
Everybody's waiting for something more

Holly Williams,"I used to call you mystery
I wanted to play all the parts
Beware the one who calls for me
I'll only break your heart

The beginning's always beautiful
Like every brand new start
But in the end, when there's nothing left of you
I'll only break your heart

I want you with a harsh desire
I crave you in the night
But I'm here to warn you
You're not safe with me
I'll only break your heart

It scares me like my deepest confession
It haunts me like their pain
While everyone's looking for someone to love
I'll only break your heart

I fade like every summer leaf
I drift like the mind of a child
I never was meant to stay in one place
I only broke their hearts

I used to call you mystery
I wanted to play all the parts
Beware the one who calls for me
I'll only break your heart

Holly Williams,"He's a man in the making, afraid like a child
Who clings to all his fear
And I am his safety, the one with the love
Trying to see things clear and block his shadows

What do you want from me
I have been everything that I could be
You're just a man in the making
What do you need from me
After everything I've given you for free
You're just a man in the making
Hey, don't lose your patience

My joy in the morning, my pain in the night
Scattered he defines
And I'd like to help him discover himself
But after all that I've done, only he is qualified

What do you want from me
I have been everything that I could be
You're just a man in the making
What do you need from me
After everything I've given you for free
You're just a man in the making
Don't lose your patience

You wrestle with faith, you wrestle with your needs
You claim that I don't understand
But believe me, I see it deeper than you
Attempting it all too fast, prepare for a crash

Holly Williams,"Love no more, I have got a prayer
I ask forgiveness everywhere
Devil unseen, please stop bothering me
I've got a broken man to repair

Brakes aren't working now
I'm trying to stop this train
Of desperation, loneliness and pain

Nothing's up ahead, the lights are supposed to be there
And you probably think I never cared
I hope to God one day you find some peace
With the memory of me

Now it's all in your head, and I'm the one at fault
Maybe I never loved you at all
I'd like to say I did, but I just don't know how
My heart could do the damage I allowed
The victim of my youth, the soldier of my dread
And I left all those tears in your bed
I hope to God one day you'll find some peace with the memory me

My potential is improving, my reckless days more calm
I know you won't believe me when I'm singing you this song
Damn, I wanted to please you, I just didn't have the will
I was never looking for someone to keep me still...
Now I see

So, if you pass this way again, if you feel the need
I'd love to hear the words that wait for me
But you don't need my sympathy, you're stronger than I think
I know you'll find your peace with the memory of me
",Memory of Me
Holly Williams,"Underneath this age is the heart of a child
It only wants to love, it begs to come alive
I want your desire, and I long for your hands
To grace me with their presence and touch me again

I don't want your nice gifts
I'm so tired of your words
I'd really like a feeling from the place that you love
Nothing More

It's a long way we've come just to simply exist like this

Tell me something true, even if it hurts
I'm waiting on a sign, do you remember love
Do you remember love?

No one could resist my little girl smile
I wish I were a baby, in this love
I'd be cradled in your arms day and night

I wish I were an old man, a scholar
With the wisdom of a thousand men before me
Wish I were a funny dream that haunted
The people I love every time they were down

I wish I was a fine wine
I wish I were a good drug
Hey and if I were Jesus , maybe I could heal all of us
Just like a good lover, which one do you prefer?

In a world full of ourselves, I wish I were a little bird
Sometimes
I wish I were the sunset in Verona
I'd make a beautiful picture every time I went to bed
Or maybe more the sunrise waking up to a sad man
And hey if I were the blue skies, I'd never rain on him

I wish I was a fine wine
I wish I were a good drug
Yeah and if I were Jesus, maybe I could heal all of us
Just like a good lover, which one do you prefer?
In a world full of vices, I wish I were a little bird
Sometimes

Hopefully he's listening right now",Sometimes

You got me there, I got me to you

It's all the same when it's killing you

Please don't leave me, though my heart is black and blue
My love, deceive me
I'll believe you
Take Me Down

It's a naive world who loves the pain
The more it hurts, the more we gain
And I talk to God, but I got no prayers
I don't wanna rise out of this hell

Please don't leave me, though my heart is black and blue
My love, deceive me
I'll believe you, I'll believe you

Holly Williams,"Velvet sounds you made
Sleeping symphony as I would lie awake
In the crevice of your shoulder soft and warm
That's where I miss your breathing

Black and pink and white
These are colors that remind me of the night
We fell on your steps and wished for all our lives
To be filled with such freedom

Picture perfect place
Painting shadows on the canvas of your face
Graceful rhythms in the frantic love we made
Moving underneath moonlight

Now looking at my mirror
The one you gave to me from the shop across the street
Where everything is rare
Just like your blue eyes
Just like your sad goodbyes
Just like the heartfelt letter that your mother mailed to you
Everything made me cry

So, here they come again
Haunting memories of you, they always win
Begging for a place to come alive again
I swear I will not hurt you again

Velvet sounds you made
Sleeping symphony as I would lie awake
In the crevice of your shoulder soft and warm
That's where I miss your breathing

Holly Williams,"If I could have used my hands to pick you up and make you stand
Would you still have fallen

If I could have told you true, would you still be with us in bloom
Would you have believed me
Or would you still have fallen

Days go by like broken years, with nothing felt, not even tears
Everything's a lie

If I could have made you see, if I had tried everything I knew
Just a little harder...would you still have fallen

What's the use in all these words
Where's the heart that I used to love
I'm sorry I'm too late
Rational thinking come undone
But it's not the man, it's the drug
Everything's a lie
Where have you fallen??

Well, I loved you more than you'll ever know
And I trusted you to never hurt yourself or anyone else

You could've fought, you could've cut him down to shame
You could've told us that our daddy didn't want us

But we're only human and we can't change

How that train would rattle me in the middle of the night
But I slept like a baby in that bed
'Cause mama kept me warm and she kept me fed

July 3rd was a dreaded friend of mine
We'd all go down to the family plot in the Louisiana pines
Staring at that little baby's grave
Stella was as young as she was brave

And what I'd give to go there again
Kiss my daddy's face, hold my mama's hand
Little did I know soon they would be
Lying right beside her, gone away from me
Gone away from me

They always made us kneel by grandpa's grave
Mama was a-wailing asking God if he was saved
I never liked to see my daddy cry
I guess I'll never know how grandpa died

And what I'd give to go there again
Kiss my daddy's face, hold my mama's hand
Little did I know soon they would be
Lying right beside him, gone away from me
Gone away from me (Gone away from me)
Gone away from me, from me (Gone away from me)

You barely even see the tombstones now
The trees are grown up everywhere and no one keeps the grounds
Strangers live inside my childhood home
And I can't believe that daddy's really gone

And what I'd give to go there again
Kiss his withered face, hold her gentle hand

Playing horseshoe with the coloured kids
I tried to kiss her, she grabbed a baseball bat

I was waiting on June, I hope she comes to see me

Waiting on June, I pray to God she'll love me one of these days
I hope I find my way waiting on June

Charley boy died in my arms, he saw Jesus, I saw blood
It soaked her wallet picture that cold night

Well I told my best friend Charley I would kiss his girl goodbye
He made me promise I'd go home and make miss June my wife
Shaking like a drunk old fool, I hopped off of that plane
And I ran home to ask her in the rain

Well time flew by like they said it would
Yeah the kids grew fast and the farm did good
Mrs. Bertha made our supper everyday
At noon that silver bell would ring
We'd all say grace and dig on in
We always ate together in those days

One by one those kids went off and found a love of their own
There's nothing like the joy I knew when they brought their babies home
We'd play all day in the cotton fields with the dogs I raised up right
And end in grandma's kitchen every night

Waiting on June, our bellies are a-aching
Waiting on June, she turns that fork so slow
And we all had to sit there 'til the last bite was no more

We were slower than we used to be, the nursing home told June and me
That we'd have separate rooms side by side,
Oh what I'd give for one more night of sleeping with my wife,
Since '45 I've touched her skin in the middle of the night
So I'm lyin' in this single bed until they cut the lights,
That's when she'll sneak in and I'll be fine

I closed my eyes and quickly went away

I've gotta settle this thing once and for all 
You got my heart, my soul, You can have it all 
I'm on my knees 
Beggin' You please 
Beggin' You please Lord, don't leave me alone

I said You had me in Your arms but I fell through the grasp 
But yep, I had You in my heart but I guess I relapsed 
Like I'm livin' for the wrong reasons, through the seasons 
Tryna fall for You but then they put me on blast 
It's like I try to speak my mind because I know that I'm His 
And yep I try to speak my mind but it don't fly with them kids 
Man, if I'm not talkin' bout the newest Nikes or releases 
They put the mute on me, I can't speak about my Jesus? 
Like I'm living for Him, I'm slippin to sin 
I turn around and make the amends
I try to fit it, I mess it up and stumble again 
I'm takin' this pen 
And writing everything so I remember just how sweet that it is 
Yeah man, I got issues, I can't even lie 
My only saving grace is knowing I got You inside 
I'm done with saving face, I don't got a thing to hide
So don't leave me alone, keep coming day and night 

Don't leave me, leave me alone 
Bust down the door to my heart, Lord it's Your home

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

So meet me under the mistletoe lets fuck
It's Chanukah in Inglewood
The dreidles spinning in the hood
So meet me by the menorah lets get drunk [x2]

J J J Just a little story about last Christmas
About some bad kids who were full of wishes
We gave some gifts and then we gave some lovin
The weird kind of love that you give to your cousin
Little Timmy stole from 7-11
So we stopped by his house with a pair of sevens
We drank in his room with some dude named Kevin
But there was still some bad kids who deserved some presents
Zack got caught with a bottle of jack
So we slipped down his chimney with an 18 pack
He didn't leave cookies but we needed a snack
So we took the beer back and I FUCKED HIM IN THE ASS!!!
It's Charlie Scene got egg nog in my flask
The holidays are back and all my presents are wrapped
Like oh my god is that saint nick
Kids give me your list like its the 25th
Been accused of being a bad kid
But I get presents as is
'Cause Mrs. Claus just myspace'd me
I blew off a date on Christmas eve.
So I don't give a fuck if your naughty or nice
You might still get a Rolly (rolex) and a gang on ice
So write your list and never have no fear
Have a Hollywood Christmas and an Undead new year!!!!
Fuck yeah!!!

bout to serve it up for for all you boys and girls.
Good kids, bad and even Da Kurlzz.
We were chillin at home and deckin the halls.
So I checked my phone and Santa had called.
He said he'd swing by at a quarter to twelve.
He said that his jolly ass needed some help.
He said Christmas ain't a gang but a way of life.
""if you guide my sleigh, I'll let you fuck my wife.""
So we jumped in his sleigh and it started to jingle,
Funnier than fuck you can ask Chris Kringle.
So we all took flight but something was fishy.
He asked for road head and started to kiss me.
Underneath his suit was just a bunch of pillows.
Instead of bags of presents, he had bags of dildo's.
I pulled down his beard and it was a monster.
It wasn't saint nick it was a fuckin imposter.
When we found out he started to pout.
I took my bandana and I choked him out.
I pulled off his beard and I fucked his mouth.
Hi-jacked his sleigh and headed down south.
I had a lot of wild nights but tonight was the craziest,
Met a lot of Jeff's but this one was shadiest.
When it comes to cheer that motherfuckers a grinch.

I fuckin' swear that I care
But its hard when you stare
Into the bottom of a bottle
That is empty and bare
All my desolate soul
In my desolate home
It's my desolate role
Yeah I'm here all alone
I can't think of a reason
To get the fuck out of bed
Curtains closed, lights are off
Am I alive or dead?
I haven't shaved in a week
I always slur when I speak
Tolerance at its peak
Another fit just to sleep
Oh woe is me woe is me
I guess I need love
Hoes ya see hoes ya see
I'm just in a rut
And I swear I'm tryin' baby please
Baby don't leave
God-damn I'm a fuck-up
But I guess that's just me
So I sit in my room
And I'll cry in my bed
Thinkin' about all the shit
That made me wrong in my head
I keep tryin' to climb
But it seems so steep
Pour myself a fuckin' whisky
And go back to sleep, bitch

Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been runnin' these streets
For too long now
I've got nothing that's true
But this song now
But the further I go
I wanna go home

Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been runnin' these streets
For too long now
I've got nothing that's true
But this song now
But the further I go
I wanna go home

I watch my momma cry
She says 'baby why?'
I say 'baby died,
Baby's gone like a suicide'
I don't think you'll see him soon, mom
Stay out my room, mom
Tell daddy that I hate
That mother fucker like you, mom
I sing this shit for you, Danny, Sasha and Jordan
These beers keep gettin' warmer
Every time that I hold her
I pour this out for you
Like a partner in crime
It's part of the times
When you're sick in the mind
Yeah I'm sick, oh so sick
I'm so sick of this shit
Yeah I'm lit, oh so lit
I'm so fucked up off it
So I stumble around
Til I stumble fall down
To this puddle of my tears
Layin' here on the ground

When you've got nothing left
You've got nothing left to lose
With my last left single breath
I'll still be singing to you
So when you bury me man
You better bury me deep
And sing along to this song
Because you're broken like me

Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been runnin' these streets
For too long now
I've got nothing that's true
But this song now
But the further I go
I wanna go home

Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been runnin' these streets
For too long now
I've got nothing that's true
But this song now
But the further I go
I wanna go home

And I wanna go back to the start
Back where we started from
And I know it's been so long
I was wrong, I was wrong
I was wrong all along

And I wanna go back to the start
Back where we started from
And I know it's been so long
I was wrong, I was wrong
I was wrong all along

Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been runnin' these streets
For too long now
I've got nothing that's true
But this song now
But the further I go
I wanna go home

Cause I don't wanna be like this
I've been runnin' these streets

Hollywood Undead,"In a time of need only few can see what's wrong
Millions tend to crawl but only those who choose can make it through this all,

Only few can sing like lions 'cause we sing until we're gone
And we've got each others backs until we're back where we belong,

A woman held my shield and through the battle we did wrong,
A man who taught me wisdom through the static we recall,

And maybe when we' re gone our names will echo through the stars,
Every start's got it's ending even when we've learned to rise above it all,

These lies are leading me astray
Its too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

I see you so please stay strong
I'll sing you one last song
And then I'm gone
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

And we once also had a story too
You can see that good men only come in few.
Even in our greatest moments we may win or we may lose
Every song's got it's rules, you've got to learn to make it through

Maybe one day we can choose how it feels to be a woman or a man
Without rules but buried underneath there's a picture glued

So when my body burns in ashes only sing the truth
Let these words strengthen all your views
Because these words were meant for you

These lies are leading me astray
Its too much for me to stay
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

I see you so please stay strong
I'll sing you one last song
And then I'm gone
I don't wanna live this destiny
It goes on endlessly

An' now I'm floatin' right above my coffin as it closes I look down
I see sigh as she's cryin on my moma's shoulder
I look up into the sky as the gates to heaven open somethin's wrong
Is this destiny or am I goin' home,

What will happen to my soul will I come back I don't know,
Will you meet me when its over let me know,
You can meet me here in heaven don't you ever let me go

This love this hate is burning me away

These lies are leading me astray
Its too much for me to stay

J Dog, Charlie Scene, Johnny 3 Tears, Da Kurlzz, and The Producer

And I can show you how to hump without making love
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak
And I'll be laying in the sun, bottle and a gun
The way you look at me, I can tell that you're a freak

My clothes are always retro
Sexual like I'm hetero
And I play a bitch like Nintendo (Zelda)
Take her for ride in my Benzo
Funny as fuck, I should do stand up
Bust caps at the crowd like I don't give a fuck (fuck you)
Got a gold ass grill
Hit me on the sidekick if you wanna chill
Hop in the ride, let's roll
I'm a baritone with a voice so low
It'll make your speakers explode
And I'll drop your panties to the floor (ah)
Let me bend you over, let me lay you sideways
Hop in the back girls, freaky Fridays!
If you got beef, then you better step up bitch

Introduce me to your mom as Charles

Wait till you see my face, hey bitch
Wear them tight jeans that show your ass crack
My first name gives Vietnam flash backs
I get drunk and do the same old, same old
Take three girls home and call them Charlies Angels
What'chu gonna do after we get signed?
I'm gonna lose my mind
Get 30 inch spinners and pimp my ride
Go back in time, be there that night and save 2Pac's life
Then pay my fine for getting caught fucking on the Hollywood sign
I got the game on lock
I'll have a bottle and a glock
With biceps like The Rock
Buy Tom's soul back from Rufford Murdock (hey)

C'mon girl, let me show you how
Let's get freaky deaky now

Silicon lips and all the fake tits!

Best in the back seat; so lets get fuckin' nasty!
I'm a pirate on the streets of C-California
Movin' and cruisin', we're boozin' all night to the mornin'

Let's watch it burn
Let's watch this city burn the world

Let's watch this city burn
From the sky lies the top the world
Til there's nothing left of her
Let's watch this city burn the world

Body doused in ash
With two empty cans of gas
The only evidence they have
Is the police sketch of my mask
And its hardly time to ask
If you can save my heart for last

And its hard to face the facts
When the darkness fades to black
It's not just make believe
When they make me take a seat
And they put amphetamines
In the air and make me breathe

So come on and grab your children
Look out for burning buildings
And villains who pillage
They're killing by the millions
And billions of people die
For a lost cause

So now I pray for my nation
That's destroyed under god

(It's the end of the world)
All my battles have been won
But the war has just begun

Let's watch this city burn
From the sky over top the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch the city burn away

The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
Till the skies bleed ashes
And the fuckin' sky crashes

We make ashes just with matches
To ignite the flame
And all the hopes of the youth
Deemed fuckin' insane

Take the pill
And go get drunk
And go get killed
Double dose
As in life as in death
Breathing till there is no breath

I will not die in the night but in the light
Of the sun and the ashes
Of this world in my lungs

But who am I to say
Lets all just run away
Go grab your friends and pray
We're gonna rule the world today

(It's the end of the world)
It's the end of the earth
We've been done since our birth

Let's watch this city burn
From the sky over top the world
Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch the city burn the world

The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?

We use the trees as torches
(Do you wanna burn it with me?)
Dot the streets with corpses
(Do you wanna burn it with me?)
We watch the city fuckin bleed
(Do you wanna burn it with me?)
And Bring the world to its knees
(Do you wanna burn it with me?)

From the sky over top the world
Til there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

How could he just forsake us?

Breaks us he makes us
Hate us he gave us
Nothing but no trust
And I am so fucked up
So let this gun bond us
Let's hide by this lust
And once we are just dust
He'll know that he loved us

Just let me burn, it's what I deserve.
God I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?

So take me and make me

To sing when you hurt
And to sing when you cry
To sing when you live
And to sing when you die

And here at the end
At the end of the hurt
All the pain ain't the same
When it's your turn to burn
We're the heart for the heartless,
The thoughts for the thoughtless,
The eyes for the eyeless
We're the gods of the godless!

So cry 3 tears for me,

Who I am I'm this man
With this blood on my hands
In this blood I am damned
So watch my wings burn
As they burn in the fire
I'll scatter the ashes
No need for the choir

Let it all burn
I will burn first
God I've tried, am I lost in your eyes?
Just let me burn, it's what I deserve.
God I've lied, am I lost in your eyes?

Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart

But we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong
We don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

We are young

Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong
We don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart",Young [Video] [Multimedia Track]
Hollywood Undead,"I loved you, you made me, hate me
You gave me hate, see?
It saved me and these tears are deadly
You feel that I rip back, every time you tried to steal that
You feel bad, you feel sad?
I'm sorry, hell no fuck that
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife
This strife, it dies, this life and these lies
And these lungs, have sung, this song, for too long,
And it's true, I hurt too, remember I loved you

I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no

I wish I could have quit you, I wish I never missed you
And told you that I loved you, every time I fucked you
The future that we both drew, and all the shit we've been through,
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew.
How could you do this to me?
Look at what I made for you, it never was enough and the world is what I gave to you
I used to be love struck, now I'm just fucked up,
Pull up my sleeves and see the pattern of my cuts

And I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you
I'm sorry oh , I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no

Seems like all we had is over now you left to rest
And your tears are dried up now, you just lay without a sound
Seems like all we had is over now, you left to rest
And my fears are over now
I can leave with my head down

And I've, lost it all, fell today, it's all the same
I'm sorry oh, I'm sorry no
And I've, been abused, I feel so used, because of you
I'm sorry oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry no

If ain't real then we'll fake it
Open your mouth and I'll break it, don't give a fuck it you hate it!
We're looking for the 6 chicks, down with the 6 dicks
Rollin' all day, gettin' buzzed its ridiculous
Horny like the sickness

Work it like its fitness
Listen while I spit this, gamin' all these bitches
Now I'm gonna hit this, and fuck until I'm dickless!

Let's get girls in the front and the sluts in the back
Let's push 'em all together and put 'em on our laps
Alcohol and drugs and California love
They got me ready to party on this sweetened Bacardi
From the north to the south, this state's all about
Silicon lips and all the fake tits!
California girls; best in the world
Best in the back seat; so lets get fuckin' nasty!
I'm a pirate on the streets of C-California
Movin' and cruisin', we're boozin' all night to the mornin'
So from dust 'till dawn, you know Undead is always on
Hit it once like a bomb
Hit it twice and then I'm gone!

[Chorus]

You don't wanna step on us, we leave the club fucked up
Come on down and say ""What's up?""
Don't front 'cause I ain't buzzed
Johnny's here to fuck you up

You know I'll be here all night

Divided by all our own means
Divided by lines you cant see
We raise our fist

Your scared of us because we influence your kids
And you pave the way that we walk
And you dug your grave we wont stop

You know we got plan held up pointin' at your head
Laying on your back but your better off dead
Got the army would made
With the dove and grenade
Got the pin pulled out its a fuckin' air raid!
We ride like tanks and we bite like snakes
Search and destroy we do whatever it takes

The next time you breath you better think of me
And your parents thank god for the mercy of me
And eye for an eye but I don't need to see
Look at these eyes motherfucker I can feel you bleed!
I gotta black in the attic and the bitch is gold
Notta nother word till I'm platinum no
A critics are shit watch a bitch get rolled
I only say bitch when I see a fucka so

You gone past your due date do you crave
Scene givin' you a grenade to pay
Down your knees crying for help
And your just gonna be another notch on the belt

We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde, singing and crying,
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore

For peace and trust can win the day

How did it come to this?

I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife out my chest
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find
But maybe I won't, because I left it all behind
Now I'm stuck with this, and that'll never change
Always a part of me, until the very last day
Where to go from here? What road to travel on?
I spent my whole life choosing, and it always chose wrong
Will I try to have the will to be alive?
Will I try because I've never seen the light?
Blow it to the ground and it's now you see
You spent your whole life taking the best of me

Where'd you go?
Where's your home?
How'd you end up all alone?
Can you hear me now?
There's no light, there's no sound
Hard to breathe, when you're underground
Can you hear me now?
Hear me now

How long can I keep pretending to be?
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees
A man of many words, but a man of few deeds
Walking these streets, so absent of hope
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home
Lend him a hand, then we're walking the way
Leave the virtue of pity, but we live with the shame
So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight
When you wake up, you know it's darker than last night
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by

We're back for more here to set a worse example

Don't invite Scene over he pee's at sleep overs
He asked your sister out so that he could cheat on her
What a creep loner, shit I couldn't sink lower
You just got a mean boner from a Charlie Scene poster
If I'm poppin' a wheelie it means I'm jackin' your bike
Got my middle finger raised as I'm runnin' red lights
I'm known to punch 'em in the dick at the end of a fight
And I never say I'm sorry at the end of the night.

So many dollars stuffed in my wallet
Chain so bling yeah you know that I'm a baller
We can take the blame cause your parents don't wanna
They roll their blunts with your marijuana
How can I run when the pigs got a chopper
I got a gun but they got a lotta
Shootin' at the sky with a mother fuckin' sawed off
God bless a Catholic forgive me father
Now what's a man to do when another holds a Bible
A lot of kids suein me holdin' me liable
Reflections of a kid and they call him suicidal
Dead beat such a sinner but we call him a child
How can you blame him a play ground they're dealin'
The mother still buyin' and the father still preachin'
And now it's up to me cause no one's gonna teach him
Now nobody, nobody needs 'em.

Your blindfold is on tight, but you like what you see
So follow me into the night, 'cause I got just what you need

It's a motherfuckin' riot, we've been dying to start
You better grab a hold 'cause now you know your falling apart
You thought these streets were paved in gold

In the belly of the beast, I'm a wolf amongst the sheep,
At the bottom of the hill, but at the top of the street
Above the boulevard, schoolyard, victim of deceit
And you're runnin' hard, but this wolf is always at your feet
And you've seen it all before, but the wolf's outside your door
And you're old enough to run, you ain't hiding anymore
Another victim of the star spangled banner of the street
Now you're in the world of wolves
And we welcome all you sheep

So you can taste my reality
Now you're stuck in this place you hate,
And you came here so happily
Then it made you lose your faith,
And that's what fucked with your sanity
Say goodbye to your soul and say hello to your vanity
Hollywood is your friend, and the undead are your family
We'll take you to the edge, and turn your regret into agony
And I'll never let you go, 'cause I know you'll come back to me

Hollywood Undead,"My legs are dangling off the edge,
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone,
My legs are dangling off the edge,
A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone.

Gone too far and yeah I'm gone again,
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends,
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends,
Ones a bottle of pills, ones a bottle of gin,
I'm twenty stories up, yeah I'm up at the top,
I'll polish off this bottle, now it's pushing me off,
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft,
I bet my momma found my letter, now shes calling the cops,
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it,
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance,
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent,
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is,
I've been trying too long, with too dull of a knife,
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice,
I never bought a suit before in my life,
But when you go to meet god, you know you wanna look nice.

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow,
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow.

A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.

We hit the sky, there goes the light,
No more sun, why's it always night
When you can't sleep, well, you can't dream,
When you can't dream, well, whats life mean?
We feel a little pity, but don't empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die,
A Mother and a Son and someone you know,
Smile at each other and realize you don't,
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised,
What happened to the Father, who swore he'd stay?
I didn't know 'cause you didn't say,
Now Momma feels guilt, yea Momma feels pain,
When you were young, you never thought you'd die,
Found that you could but too scared to try,
You looked in the mirror and you said goodbye,
Climb to the roof to see if you could fly.

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow,
Yeah I'll see you tomorrow.

My legs are dangling off the edge,
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone,
My legs are dangling off the edge,
A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone, gone.

I wish that I could fly, way up in the sky,

Oh I might just try,

Since you been away

Someday, someday
I know you're coming back

Down in the dirt
With your blood on my hands
I blacked out
But now I do understand
That you were too good
For this world so you left it
Everything turned red
And then you made an exit
I don't even know
If it was your time
But like all good things
That pass you by
Its like a lost soul
In the time of need
It made my grow up fast
And put some blood on my knees
And you don't even know

Thinking you could never die
Like you're bullet proof

To the sky and the rest

There's nothing to say
Some hearts to stay true

Come lay down beside me

It's only what I've seen
It's only just one dream

Lifestyles of the young and the reckless
Checked in the real world that don't ask questions
Dodging on bullets like a fucked up western
Dragged you on a rope til you're choked out senseless
Kings or crown we're the best around
Got an underground army yeah we holding it down
We built our base and what we found
It takes blood and sweat and always moving the crowd
No skill then you're going the fast way
Let me see you dance on from the AK
Bullshit now he's dropping names,
Who you know, what you doing all sounds the same
A piece of advice quit dropping mine
You're be done way before it even it is your time
Like a stripper in a cage making minimum wage
You're be done like a dollar bill hitting the stage

You're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth

I'm gonna wake your ass up 'cause you ain't got what it takes
You crews ridin' my nuts so tell you how my dick tastes
Yeah I'm shit faced and all black looking creepy
It's Charlie Scene this shit is way too easy
I'm gonna give it to you quick going straight to your throat
Put the burner in your mouth and turn you in to a ghost
All these people making music with nothing to show
Who doesn't have a band? Shit I don't know
What kind of sane person drops his own name
What kind of sane person boos his own band off stage
What kind of sane person drops a verse like this
Damn this ain't working I'm just too damn sick
Dudes coming out here's got me provoked
I'm gonna cut your ass up like a line of coke
I'm gonna roll your crew up like a fat ass roach
Put you in my ashtray 'cause you just got smoked

The world has turned it's face you'll never find

Walls are closing in, their falling down

That we could keep it undercover
When you wanna play

Hollywood Undead,"Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

I wake up right about the mid-afternoon,
With the sun in the sky but nights coming soon,
I walk to the mirror just to fix myself,
Yeah life gets harder when you love nothing else,
So I pick my pills from the counter drawer,
Pick my self-esteem up off the fucking floor,
I guess I'm a man of no recourse,
As I crack another bottle, got no remorse,
And I'll say a little prayer for the child in me,
I swear I used to be what I truly believe,
That I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part the seas,
So

Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

People get sick and they watch you bleed,
When you fall from the top, boy you better believe,
At the bottom, they got just, yeah, just what you need,
Well at the bottom, you can't swim 'cause you drank up the sea,
Then we stop and we look up to the sky,
They don't ask any questions, they ask us why?
Don't have any answers, don't know what to say,
Our knees are getting tired,
Too tired to pray,
That's when we laid down into the road,
We all seem to walk and I guess walking alone,
And I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased.

Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

Time just seems to go on and on,
On and on,
And on and on,
Life inside a bottle all alone,
All alone,
The bottles gone,
I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased,
Whats life inside a bottle if it's cold?
One more song and I'm finally free,
I'll meet you here in heaven, between the sea,
'Cause I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased.
So

Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

And my soul has stained these sheets but they pull up to the side
Who's blood could this be is it yours or is it mine
Take the knife and twist it wheres my heart she missed it
And you know I don't wanna die but baby you insisted
Breathing is a luxury that I just shouldn't have
My heart just keeps on beating and its more than you can stand
Baby please just tell me how we ever went so wrong
We used to sing together and we used to sing a song
We could never sing forever because now my voice has gone
Guess I'm gone forever and you knew it all along

You didn't wanna see me live so you gave me your knife,
Did it hurt as you tiptoed coming from behind,
You took away my kids so I guess you killed me twice,

The longer you stay close to me the further I ran

Wont you hold me lure me more so tell me course nor
Weaving slowly oh wont you hold me

We are made from broken parts
We are, we are
We are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts
They were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are
We are built from broken parts

If you can lose it all, then welcome to Broadway
Silicone dreams and your name on the Marque
And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly
It's hotter here in hell, but it's getting real dark see
So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
And every step, another step, you're walking on my dreams
And every breath, another breath you're breathing when I breathe
I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go
I'm married to the devil in the city of angels
So come all you wicked to the world of the empty
I know I need it all, so baby don't tempt me
I'm knocking on our door, nope, nobody sent me
Just checking all you bitches like I'm checking this check sheet
So put your hats on, Lohner don't get soft
You can see God, when I take my mask off

We are, we are
We are made from broken parts
We are, we are
We are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts
They were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are
We are built from broken parts

The fame is your best friend, you love it no questions,
Beating down the door is the face of rejection
And once again, it's a tragedy anthem
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessing
Who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream?
'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen
With a gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn't think he can die
So grab a pick and an axe, 'cause we try, we cry
Into the bottle of Jack, we die inside,
So when you look in his eyes, what you see now?
Murder the monster you've made and watch him bleed out
We're in a life where it's kill or lose
Just lie motherfucker till you hear the truth
From under the street, through the gutters of youth
Just cry motherfucker yeah, I'm talking to you

We are, we are
We are made from broken parts
We are, we are
We are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts
They were beating in the dark
'Cause we are, we are
We are built from broken parts

An empty vessel of devils (Can take away what's ours) is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes see the world that you gave us

That there's something good inside of me
Just one good thing inside of me
So close to me
That memory
Of that one good thing inside of me
Just one good thing inside of me
Yeah

If I went out the back door, nobody would stop me
But, where would I go?
'Cause I ain't ever had a real home
So, what do I know?
So, I could keep runnin', hide until they find me
But, what would that do?
If they could only know what I knew
What would it do?
I shoulda' seen the writin' on the wall
Instead, I'm left to fall
'Cause the longer I'm away,
I'll always stay the same
Lookin' back, when I thought I knew it all
Instead, I'm left to fall
Did I throw it all away?

Don't you know, little boy, They'll lay you to waste, man
Little do they know, every song is a lifespan
Yeah, they've taken one, but I'm takin' my last chance
To hold all we know and let go with both hands
Though, don't you know that plots are made from concrete
Right through the stone, can you hear my heart beat?
Beats through my bones, like no memory left me
Not for a second or a minute when I dream
I wanna go home, like a home that I'll keep
You can dig six or sixty-six feet
We can live forever, still your misery missed me
Hold this song together with a bottle of whiskey
Look into the mirror, and the lines that time drew
Seen 'em painted white in the eyes that shine through
My heart beats heavy in an open chest
And, I wanna say goodbye, but there's nobody left

Put your hands in mine, and feel this emptiness
There's no beat in my chest
'Cause there's nothin' left
No, it ain't goodbye, it's a last caress
What's another dream?
You could hardly sleep
Can you believe bad things only happen to me?
God knows one day, you will finally see
That's scares will heal, but we're meant to bleed
Do you realize I would lie for you?
Please out my last breath, I would die for you
I know I'm no good, but my heart beats true
You know I'm gonna fight, though I must be scared to lose
You took me in, and I fucked it up again
And an empty promise, no, I won't pretend
'Cause in the end, we need someone to solve 'em
Nobody can fix me if I'm part of the problem

Ain't a good shot, here come four more
Getting hot so I play in the snow
In a town made wicked, made from these wicked things
See the dead on the cover of a magazine
See my smile, it was born from amphetamines
Better duck 'cause it's war on my enemies
Oh God, I think I lost it, oh no
Lost some, wanna watch the rest go

Do you see a lion when you look inside of me
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be
How can I sleep at night there's a war inside my head
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed
'Cause I am a lion, and you are dead

Heres a story of everything we'll ever be
You can hide but some of us can never leave
And if you go I don't need those little things
They remind me of all our little dreams
Can you hear the words, all I can say
We can watch the world even if they walk away
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
You where born a lion and a lion you will stay

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see the lion when you look inside of me
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you can not be

Remember an army of all those little kids
Livin' life like they only get a little bit
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle-end
I'd rather die then watch you givin' in
I'm sorry daughter but you're fathers not the same
I can look into your eyes and I swear that I will change
But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I say you can hide
Beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain
After all only so much we can say
Words can lose their meaning once you walk away
Promise me that you'll love me, watch me as I fade
I'll give you all the things that these lions never gave
The hands on the clock and the things we cannot change
Tearin' out the pieces and take back what I made
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save
'Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see the lion when you look inside of me
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

Hey! I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I'll ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home

Are the pages I write
On my knees and I'm hoping
That someone holds me tonight

Welcome to the world and all the land in it was wasted
The blood upon your hands and the wickedness that made it
Sing or scream it all and the memories keep fading
See the exit wound, dear God what have we taken?
Guess I'll say a prayer and I'll kiss into the air
I'll look into the sky, send them straight to nowhere
We all dug the grave, can't shake away the shame
Quiver in the sky but you're shaken all the same
You left us with the guns and all of them unloaded
Teach us how to shoot but you taught us how to hold them
All the weight of all the world is right between your shoulders
Heavy is the heart when the world keeps growing colder

Who left the door open
Who left me outside
I'm on my knees and I'm hoping
That someone holds me tonight

Breakfast of a mirror, dying slow seems a little boring
Burning like a flag, walking straight into the breeze

Yeah what's another life time like mine
We all die a little sometimes, it's alright
Did you come to say your goodbyes to this life?
We all hurt a little sometimes, we're alright

I've put in too much work
I've dealt with too much hurt
I've worked way too hard for this
But we live in dark places, dark places

I've come way too far for this
I've put in too much work
I've dealt with too much hurt
I've worked way too hard for this
But we live in dark places, dark places

People say I'm pissed off
'Cause I like to shit talk
But people are fake
So wait till their jaws lock
Tick-a-ti-tick tock
The click of the wrist watch
Time is running out
On my way to the tip-top
So fuck it I can't stop
Been waiting for too long
Started my own plot
It's starting with this song
Damned if I'm damn wrong
Who wants to fight a lion?
Motherfuckers who hate
Just wait for me to die trying
Like I'm gonna stop now
Like I'm gonna cop out
Show these motherfuckers
I ain't willing to drop out
So maybe I'm pissed off
Because I feel ripped off
This industry is a bitch
And she'll rip your dick off
Famous and broke
And into a joke
But I've come way too far
Not giving up hope
I'll keep breaking my back
And I ain't gonna choke
Show these faggots I'm tough

When you come from nothing
You want a dove or something
So I started to run
And just kept on gunning
Dark heart, dark thoughts
In a blacked out room
Macked out, Cadillacs
Click-clack, ka-boom
Sung you a song
The words went right through
And I can't haunt a house
If it haunts me too
So let's draw the line
And it's me and it's you
I do it all the time
And Johnny three don't lose
Can you write some checks that you can't cash?
So I'm a little bitter, baby, keep on coming back
Yeah, there's just some things that I can't stand
A little trigger-happy, so come on, let's dance
Yeah, fuck your virtue
Your lie and your meaning
With the writing on the wall
But you just can't read it
Comes back around
Man, you better believe it
If you got a dark heart
I'm gonna motherfucking bleed it

I've come way too far for this
I've put in too much work
I've dealt too much hurt
I've worked way too hard for this

But we live in dark places, dark places

Who's that walking up your block?
Pissed off with two Glocks
With a forty in his fist
And a fifth of moon rocks
Got his sleeves cut off
With marijuana tube socks
Smoking pot in the drop-top
Bumping Kid Rock
I'mma smoke another spliff
And chase it down with six shots
That guy's cockier than shit
Like a guy with six knocks
And I can't stop saying dick
Dick, dick and then cock
Hick-a-dickery-dick-a-dick-a-dickery-dock
So talk shit and get socked
Or kick rocks and get lost
Or get dropped and get topped
This hip-hop shit gets hot
This is not a pit stop
And I'm not gonna stop
Until I'm on the top
Like your mom on a cop
So when you see me in your hood
Yeah, you better think twice
Let me give you all a muy poquito piece of advice
If you push me any further
It's the end of your life
And I'll kill you like the sixteen bars
I killed on this mic

I've come way too far for this
I've put in too much work
I've dealt too much hurt

Better run, here we come

We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a mad man, the voices keep asking
Born with a soul that don’t wanna be saved
Every time I look around I see what a fiend made
Every time I die, I hope they digging up my grave
An undead one like the flag that I wave
I’m not afraid to cry from this cocaine sickness
I’m not afraid to die, let the good book witness
I ask and give none, nope, no forgiveness

This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually
It’s like I magically happened to be the phantom that cannot be
Lets this dagger cut jaggedly
While you're gasping so rapidly
While you gag on this rag
I see you all laughing so happily
It’s okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I’ll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I’ve already started, there ain’t no saving your heart
This is the day of the dead, this is ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The fun has begun, yeah, it’s hard to swallow
When I’m done, I ain’t done, 'cause it’s hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow,
'Cause it’s hell that follows

Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It’s the day of the dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come

When the ashes start to rise
And the moon falls from the sky
And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry
On the flames below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It’s the day of the dead

They say beginnings always starts with the ends
I say forever and forever amen

Forget what you feel

Cast the rain, feeling so hollow
Run into shame, deep in the shallow

I'm not insane I just want to be free
It's not the same if it's our execution
Let them all see you're undead just like me
So I'm to blame, the one to follow
Give it away, got nothing to follow
Fuck the fame, fuck the sorrow

Hollywood Undead,"Can you see me my love?
Up there above when you were dying
I was dying too, look for meaning in song
But the meaning was gone 'cause I was crying
Right along with you if the heavens may break
I hope for our sake that if they ever do
I'll be there with you

I woke up feeling the same way that I did yesterday
Don't know what these tears would say
But I miss my friend, that went away
I watch the seasons as they go
The rain, the sun, the heat, the snow
I don't know much but this I know
I miss my friend I miss him so
I say my prayers, I raise my hands
I move my feet and when I can
I said help, would you help me now?
And lift me up if my legs give out?
I know that life is short and living is the hardest part
And some place through the dark
We will meet and never part
Some place through the dark

Can you see me my love?
Up there above when you were dying
I was dying too, look for meaning in song
But the meaning was gone 'cause I was crying
Right along with you if the heavens may break
I hope for our sake and if they ever do
I'll be there with you

The calm that comes, before the break
The sun that sets like yesterday
The good may come and go away
Or bad news waits for you to wake
We all kneel down before the storm
When waves come crashing at your door
I've been down been down before
And I have faith but I need more
Respects a dust card in our world when
When nothing is behind the curtain
Life is short but death is certain
That will always be our burden
Free, afraid to follow if I promise you tomorrow
See through the dark
We will meet and never part
Some place through the dark

Can you see me my love?
Up there above when you were dying
I was dying too, look for meaning in song
But the meaning was gone 'cause I was crying
Right along with you if the heavens may break
I hope for our sake that if they ever do

I had something to say
But the words went away
Just like they always do
I will be there with you

Can you see me my love?

I burned the world for you and I

Do this shit all night, I don't need nobody else

Higher than a kite, with nobody by myself

By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself

One more shot then it's time to roll
Smoke these crops and I'm out the door
Chug some rock, but I sip Patron
Hit that spot till you lose control
You died? I'll go out alone
Bitch, you must be out your dome
Fresh new kicks, I cut the floor
Ludicrous, I throw them vogues
Life of the party got the bitches laughing
Funny on-point, his joke's cracking
Grind on the wall just to get some action
Looking in the mirror like I'm Michael Jackson
'Cause this is risky, don't try to diss me
I get more pussy than a bowl of Friskies
I roll so low, can't keep up with me
You go home early like you're fucking sixty
You're coming down my highest peak
And think you're having trouble speaking
You a freak and I like freaking

So when everybody else is being such a puss
Doesn't mean you can straight get off the hook
I don't need another partner to shake my tush
I can party all night and slay some bush
So I'mma go out and do some thrashing
Show everybody what the fuck is cracking
'Cause this motherfucker can do some damage
If you don't think so, you can suck my package
'Cause I don't need no static when I feed my habits
So don't be combatant when I wreak some havoc
From this weed I'm having, where's my keys, goddamnit?
I should be on half of me and three's on taxing
On my knees, I'm blacking out, I need some action

Put the half smoked blunt and some blood on my lip

Man, all she had left was ménage à trois
Rolled in the pink I picked up some Cuervo
Walking sideways and I'm starting to swerv-o
Last night was wild put my money a jumbos
Wine and dine, tig ol' bitties and bimbos

Cruise through your valley and I'm snatchin' your snapback
Huffin' on some paint and I think that I'm half black

The hiccup of the telephone wires
Birds tossed in and out of the fray
Clouds rushing in loose focus

Afraid if he drops his glass into this ???
Might just stare a hole clear through
Like a thumb pushed into the paper mache
Grizzly that rides the prey

Pale green life vibrates across the Abraham Lincoln
Curses spin beneath his chin

Not to pass re-judgment
Over the deer and the antelope play
Over the boys swapping names
And the girls folding papers into clipper ships

When they've wandered from the parade route
And the room fills with aquarium lights
Curse ???
And the grizzly lies underneath the ??

From the cold cold places behind the Abraham Lincoln
Where the wallpaper will not fade
Magnolias presure up against the bank from the dark as the deer and the antelope play
The clicking of their heels, the clicking of their heels

Over the boys swapping names
And the girls spinning curses across clipper ships",Abraham Lincoln

Carved ribbons around the smolderings
Only to tie a knot at my feet in a pool of gasoline.

We let the chances pass, the few we held so fast

Wondering how I got a head cold, wishing I didn't know what I know
It's never been about the money, we're worthy or we are not worthy

Everyone's the fool they seek
We all go off the track, and feel for our way back

Scared to look
At peers when they peer back
It's weird how we fear that

It's weird how we wear masks
It appears that we fear our own tears

Looking to draft beers
To bring cheers back
But when the drinking game's finished
No Guinness just a clear glass

Seeing our real image mirrored back
The places that we go to cope
It's so strange
When we're older folks

It don't change
Trying to hang, we don't know the ropes
When we fall, we got more than our shoulders broke
It's no game

It's why we overdose on cocaine
Get our brains comatose, there's no blame
If you've ever know shame
Known pain

Known days when it really don't feel okay

Stop and smile

And I should walk away 
Back up and walk away 
But then I stop and stay

For our earth in decay
They prepare us to die
So we scream our cry

Your evil demon will never see the light
You Christian coward, listen to you pray
You're blinded by Satan, you chose the wrong way

It's the same old game
Only time will tell
Who will be the winner
Heaven Vs Hell

Waking up in a horror fright
I know I'll never win this fight
I feel empowered by Satan at my side
You, weak believer, will never see the light

It's the same old game
Only time will tell
Who will be the winner
Heaven Vs Hell

It's the same old game
Only time will tell
Who will be the winner

Holy Moses,"Believe in my words, it's hell a on earth
It's been a while since I felt so high
Felt so high, felt so high
But I feel you'll say goodbye?

It seems it's hard to talk for you
But it's something I would like to do
It will never be the same
Because I am lost in your name

Today I will pay that bill and I will, to find you gone
We are drawn to my desire
Is that the demon you are running for?
I wouldn't to be in love for you if I locked that door before

My heart therefore feels like it's tattoed
With all the thoughts which came from you
You feel okay, I'm still alone
I have to take care of that danger zone

It's a hell on earth

You cried so long like a huge lost child
You're digging for the answer worldwide
You wonder while they understood you wrong
Why you can't get it on

You told me the secrets of your life
But now you guard them like a lie
I have to cut your pictures on the wall
Before your smile lets me rise and fall

I would like and liked to be at your side
In all your secrecy, allowing your destiny
Within your dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams
And fight for your screams in dignity, far away from agony

Far away from agony, when you feel free
But you forced my soul with needles, soul with needles, soul with needles
Turned your lightning down on low
And my love to you has to go like the snow

It's been a while since I felt so high
But I feel you'll say goodbye?
Ohh, I will miss you, just go away
Unbound the feeling we just had today

Where wild storms dwell
When loosened elements are tightened by a dream
When I must feel this way
When life has to be changed

Hell on earth, hell on earth, hell on earth
Hell on earth, hell on earth, hell on earth
Hell on earth, hell on earth, hell on earth
Hell on earth, hell on earth, hell on earth
",Hell on Earth
Holy Moses,"I don't wanna be alone is that why I'm coming home
But I lie and killing my soul
My heart is broken into pieces of it all
Everywhere I try to go, I find myself nothing to know

I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed, I feel it's eating me
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed, I feel it has to be

I prayed to God, I prayed to Satan
I prayed to God, I prayed to God
I prayed to God, I prayed to Satan

I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I feel it's eating me

I will never know but I feel you had to go
You broke my heart when I stand with you
But now my chance has passed me by, passed me by
I will ne'er know if you really changed your mind

I bleed, I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed, I feel it's eating me
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed

Holy Moses,"These lyrics are simple to understand
There's nothing more for me to say
Into the pleasure of pure feeling
We all think the same, you look like me

I was the first, I am not the last
So face the dead, let's start it fast
Survive the mighty flash of thrash

Amps are roaring, power chords clash
Our razor blade edge, hammer the wizard
Double-bass pounds for the metal blizzard
Wring your ax to bomb the hall
Blood on my strings, until I fall

Princess of hell, give it to me
Princess of hell, it's my decay
Princess of hell, for your body to smell

Your escape from the earth
I open gates of hell
There's nothing more to tell
From below and not above

I give it to you, my love
I throw it up to spit out
I throw it up to spit it out

There's nothing more to tell
I give it to you, my love
I break your neck for my thoughts

There's nothing more to tell
From below and not above
I open gates of hell

Thunder roars from the crowd
I follow my advice without any kind of lies
I die to stay that way
Much more than I can say
I was young when it infected me

Amps are roaring, power chords clash
Our razor blade edge, hammer the wizard
Double-bass pounds for the metal blizzard
Wring your ax to bomb the hall
Blood on my my string, until I fall

Princess of hell, give it to me
Princess of hell, it's my decay
Princess of hell, for your body to smell

My life is fully insane
I will not leave it all behind
I bleed in my inner fuckin' wound

Holy Moses,"There has been an act of war
Declared to the world by terrorists
I can't sit at home and watch TV
Anger and sadness rules my heart

Kind of justice must be done
All the death and pain
Now it has to begin with us
The fuckin' bastards have to die

We are at war, we are at war

No regard for human life
United we have to [Incomprehensible]
But how far, but how far
Torture, death and pain

No regard, no respect
Will be ingredients for human life
No respect
Have to die

We are at war, we are at war
We are at war, we are at war

No one is safe
Nothing for sure
Crimes against humanity
For a king in hell

Satan's work's done
And we will be none
Another holocaust
Human death a bloody cost

A pleasure they need
And we will agree
The world starts to burn
But no one will learn

Is it what I will get?
Do we all like to forget?
Do you wanna be safe?
Something to say, do so

Conquer the way
Delete the way
Delete the way
Delete the way

We are at war

Now we have to ask again
Eyes are blinded from the one
Fight for what we have to believe
All around burned to ash

Bodies, bodies
Teacher's lessons
For your life
Getting our way

Bodies, bodies
Burned to ash
Getting our way
Take our life

Bajo una luna de plata fría

And presents on the tree 

Christmas Eve'll find me 
Where the love light gleams 
I'll be home for Christmas 
If only in my dreams",I'll Be Home For Christmas
Home Free,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
Just like the ones I used to know 
Where the treetops glisten, 
And children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white 

The sun is shining, the grass is green
The orange and palm trees sway
There's never been such a day in whole L.A.
But it's December the twenty-fourth
And I am longing to be up north
So I can have my very own white Christmas
Oh yeah

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white, be white",White Christmas
Home Free,"The Devil went down to Georgia,
He was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bind, 'cause he was way behind,
He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawing on a fiddle and playing it hot
And the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said,
""Boy let me tell you what:
I guess you didn´t know it, but I'm a fiddle player too,
And if you'd care to take a dare,
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle,
Boy, but give the Devil his due
I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny and it might be a sin,
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret,
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard,
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
But if you lose, the Devil gets your soul!

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire blew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in,
And it sounded something like this

When the Devil finished, Johnny said,
""Well you're pretty good old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done!""

Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run
The Devil´s in the house of the rising sun
Chicken in the bread pan a picking out dough,
Granny does your dog bite, ""No, child, no""

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny´s feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again,
I done told you once, you son of a bitch,
I'm the best there´s ever been""

He played,
Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken in the breadpan a picking out dough,
Granny will your dog bite, ""No, child, no""",The Devil Went Down to Georgia
