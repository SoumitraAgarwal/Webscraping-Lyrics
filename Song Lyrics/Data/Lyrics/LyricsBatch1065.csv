Noah and the Whale,"Well I'm just waiting for my chance to come,
Just a silhouette against the rising sun,
Watch the water, watch the sky,
Count the days as they go by,
I'm just waiting for my chance to come,

Well it takes real guts to be alone,
Going head to head with the great unknown,
But there is no sweeter sound, on the kings round I'm bound,
And just waiting for your chance to come,

'Cause it's hard to feel like, you're worth something in this life,
When you're walking next to me, I can hear my body speak,
We're just waiting for a chance to come,
We're just waiting for a chance to come,

Your immortal smile is burned in me,
When I close my eyes its all see,
Among the canyons and the stars,
You're the guide inside my heart,
I'm just waiting for my chance to come,

And you're just looking for a way outta here,
Yeah, a way to see this old life all disappear,
Take a gamble on your heart, it will lead you through the dark,
You're just waiting for your chance to come,

'Cause it's hard to feel like, you're worth something in this life,
When you're walking next to me, I can hear my body speak,
We're just waiting for a chance to come,
We're just waiting for a chance to come,

And no one's gonna get in my way,
Gonna figure it out for myself,
Yeah no one's gonna make me stay,
Gonna figure it out for myself,

'Cause I don't need nothing,
I'm just waiting for my chance to come.",Waiting for My Chance to Come
Noah and the Whale,"Time can make more rubble out of dreams than anything
In a quiet neighborhood where she's living without wings
There's eyes behind the curtains and there's ears below the floor
Cracks inside the ceiling and there's shadows at the door

The boredom stirs a rage inside her soul
A rage that reaches out and takes control
Baby she's a wild thing 
Baby she's a wild thing 
Baby she's a wild thing 
Baby she's a wild thing 

Nine days out alone
Sleep in the dirt
She walks back into town
With blood stains on her shirt
Everyone has questions
But no one wants to know
How far the anger in someone
Can really make them go

Her tangled hair and mud stains on her knees
Bruised ribs and rips on the side of her jeans
Baby she's a wild thing 
Baby she's a wild thing 
Baby she's a wild thing 
Baby she's a wild thing 

Well I used to be a citizen in this town
'Til my teeth turned gray and my hair fell out
All the civil decent people, they don't want to know
But a girl looking for trouble said she'd give me a go

While everybody's sleeping in this town this night
From the crooked clock tower to the borderline
And night star static in the winter breeze
She's lying in the moonlight with her hands between my knees

She says it's all right
Well, it's all right by me
Well, it's all right by me

Baby she's a wild thing 
Baby she's a wild thing 
Baby she's a wild thing 
Baby she's a wild thing",Wild Thing
Noah and the Whale,"One day things will turn out as planned
You'll have her in the palm of your hand
But it's not tonight, no not tonight

One day she'll look at you and say
I never thought I could feel this way
But it's not tonight, no not tonight

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
There will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight

One day she'll hang on to your arm
Chasing the night all the way 'til the dawn
But it's not tonight, no not tonight

One day soon you'll find a way
To learn to lie and what you're thinking you say
But it's not tonight, no not tonight

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
And there will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight

And when it feels like everyone's turning their backs on you
And when it feels like everyone's turning their backs on you
Oh well the sun's not out but you know you got to see it through
Oh well the sun's not out but you know you got to see it through

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
There will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
There will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight

There will come a time
Where you will need your friends tonight
There will come a time
Where you will need someone tonight",There Will Come a Time
Noah Cyrus,"I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Gave you up 'bout twenty one times
Felt those lips tell me twenty one lies
You'll be the death of me
Sage advice
Love, lovin' you could make Jesus cry

When I hear you sayin', ""Darlin', your kiss is like an antidote""
I'm fightin' like I'm Ali
But you got me on the ropes

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Couldn't hear the thunder, but I heard your heart race
Couldn't see the rain, we're too busy makin' hurricanes
Love ain't easy when it ain't my way
But it gets hard, when you ain't here makin' me crazy

Baby, say the word, darlin'
You know just how to hold the sucker down
So I'll see you in the morning
I can't watch you walk out

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Cry, cry, cry

Hear the thunder, see the rain
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh
Keep on makin' me cry
Yeah, hey, hey yeah, ooh
Keep makin' me scream and holler
Keep on makin' me cry
You don't know what you do to me
Hey, hey, yeah

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me",Make Me (Cry)
Noah Georgeson,"When I speak of places
I speak of them as people
And question them at length
Why they are not my home
Why are they not home

When I speak of people
I speak of them as things
I put them in their place
I keep them in collection
Keep them collections

When I speak of things
I speak of them as places
Hand me, please, a city
Hand me, please, an ocean
Hand me, please, an ocean

","Hand Me, Please, A City"
Noah Georgeson,"Fixing a name to a place is left to history
Tags are all hung written out now for a century
The Glenn's Plateaus and barrows all are named
Isthmuses and the coves all have been claimed

We're walking on someone else's
We're swimming in someone else's
We're building on someone else's name

Can't give a face to a statue, plaque, an effigy
Maps are all full, there's no wall space in the galleries
Archipelligos and meadows all have names
The straits, the peaks, the passes have been claimed

We're walking on someone else's
We're swimming in someone else's
We're building on someone else's name

",Walking on Someone Else's Name
Noah Guthrie,"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
'Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all those things I should have done
When I was your man",When I Was Your Man
Noah Stewart,"I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

Noah Stewart,"I'll walk with god 
From this day on
His helping hand I'll lean upon
This is my prayer my humble plea
May the lord be ever with me

There is no death though eyes grow dim
There is no fear when I'm near to him
I'll lean on him forever 
And he'll forsake me never

He will not fail me as long as my faith is strong
What ever road I may walk alone

I'll walk with god 
I'll take his hand
I'll talk with god he'll understand
I'll pray to him
Each day to him

And he'll hear the words that I say
His hand will guide my throne and rod
And I'll never walk alone
While I walk with god",I'll Walk with God
Noah Stewart,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no-how
Without a song

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song!!",Without a Song
Noah Wotherspoon,"The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
I've been looking for my baby
And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
You know the sky's been crying
Can see you see the tears roll down my door",The Sky Is Crying
NoahStradamus,"Is there anybody out there
Calling out for me
So is there anybody out there
It's getting hard to breathe

It's all slipping away too fast
It's like hands are trying to pull me down
To the bottom please take me back
All I want is just to hear the sound
of your melody give me that
Where did I take all my songs played out
I could make it last
All I want is that sweet noise
The sound of your voice 
I need the sound of your voice",Sound of Your Voice

All girls in the house let me hear you scream

Boys may come and boys may go
But there's a little something all you girls should know
They could cover you with kisses and diamond rings
Never give it up on material things

There ain't a data file they will come on time
When they try to play and mess with your mind
When you're looking for some one you can depend
Don't look any further than your own best friend

We are family
I've got all my angels with me
We are family
And now we are gonna do are own thing

I'm not the kinda girl to sit home and wait
For the phone to ring waiting on some date
Love chases with the weather out black the cats
Sometimes I just might change my mind

It's Billy on Mondays, Tuesdays Jack
Forget about bobby I don't want him back
And we phone them on again, my heart again
I'd rather be with my friends

I've got all my angels with me

An otherworld awaits you
Don't you give up on it.
You bite the hand that feeds you.

All alone cold fields you wander
Memories of it, cloud your sight
Fills your dreams, disturbs your slumber
Lost your way, a fallen knight

Hold now, aim is steady
An otherworld awaits you.
One thousand years, you ready?
The otherworld it takes you

Go into the sand and the dust in the sky
Go now, there's no better plan than to do or to die
Free me pray to the faith in the face of the light
Feed me fill me with sin now get ready to fight

You know you will
You know you will
You know you know you know you know that you will
You know you know you know you know that you will

Up to the heights it takes you
Go on if you want it.

(Oh, at last) 
Light between your eyes 
Dark between the days

Can you tell me the way to go 
I feel the time slipping away 
Can you tell me the way to go 
Which way to the end? 

Coming down upon me now 
Ripping through the sound 
Planting the seeds of growing hate 
(You kill what you sedate) 
It is you I will subdue 
I'll do it every time 
Watch me wash away the hands of time 

Can you tell me the way to go 
I feel the time slipping away 
Can you tell me the way to go 
Which way to the end? 

I am singing to the sky 
You are singing to the ones below you 
Singing to the people in the sky 
Singing to your master down below 
Singing to the heavens in the sky 
Singing to the fire down below 
Singing to the fire in the sky 
Singing to the fire and the sky 

I think I'm seeing things again... 
I think I'm seeing things again... 

Spare me your fucking lies 
When in doubt, I'll try to hide 
Away from you 
But what good will that do 
Can't find a way to flee your 
Plastic faces, deadly mind 
Count the ways you suffer blind 
Keep thinking that I'm seeing things again 
Can't find a way to stop you

So I could tell you 
I'm happy

She told me that she hated me 
And stared at me with those cold stale eyes
One hit to the head and she went down

Noel Boggs,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

Across the sand so I may keep

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Noel Boggs,"Hear me, why you keep fooling
Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.

Noël Coward,"London Pride has been handed down to us.
 London Pride is a flower that's free.
 London Pride means our own dear town to us,
 And our pride it for ever will be.
 Woa, Liza,
 See the coster barrows,
 Vegetable marrows
 And the fruit piled high.
 Woa, Liza,
 Little London sparrows,
 Covent Garden Market where the costers cry.
 Cockney feet
 Mark the beat of history.
 Every street
 Pins a memory down.
 Nothing ever can quite replace
 The grace of London Town.

 There's a little city flower every spring unfailing
 Growing in the crevices by some London railing,
 Though it has a Latin name, in town and country-side
 We in England call it London Pride.

 London Pride is a flower that's free.
 London Pride means our own dear town to us,
 And our pride it for ever will be.
 Hey, lady,
 When the day is dawning
 See the policeman yawning
 On his lonely beat.
 Gay lady,
 Mayfair in the morning,
 Hear your footsteps echo in the empty street.
 Early rain
 And the pavement's glistening.
 All Park Lane
 In a shimmering gown.
 Nothing ever could break or harm
 The charm of London Town.
 
 INTERLUDE
 In our city darkened now, street and square and crescent,
 We can feel our living past in our shadowed present,
 Ghosts beside our starlit Thames
 Who lived and loved and died
 Keep throughout the ages London Pride.
 
 London Pride has been handed down to us.
 London Pride is a flower that's free.
 London Pride means our own dear town to us,
 And our pride it for ever will be.
 Grey city
 Stubbornly implanted,
 Taken so for granted
 For a thousand years.
 Stay, city,
 Smokily enchanted,
 Cradle of our memories and hopes and fears.

 Toughening,
 From the Ritz
 To the Anchor and Crown,
 Nothing ever could override
 The pride of London Town.",London Pride

Noël Coward,"In a dear little village
Remote and obscure
A beautiful maiden resided
As to whether or not 
Her intentions were pure
Opinions were sharply divided
She loved to lie
Out 'neath the darkening sky
And allow the night breeze 
To entrance her
She whispered her dreams 
To the birds flying by
But seldom received any answer

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice would love to stray
When it came to the end of the day
She would wander away
Unheeding
Dreaming her innocent dreams she strode
Quite unaffected by heat or cold
Frequently freckled or soaked with rain
Alice was out in the lane

Who she met there
Every day
Was a question
Answered by none
But she'd get there
And she'd stay there
'Til whatever she did
Was undoubtedly done

Over the field and along the lane
Both her parents would call in vain
Sadly, sorrowfully, they'd complain
'Alice is at it again.'

Although that dear little village
Surrounded by trees
Had neither a school, nor a college
Gentle Alice acquire
From the birds and the bees
Some exceedingly practical knowledge
The curious secrets that nature revealed
She refused to allow to upset her
But she thought
When observing the beasts of the field
That things might have been organised better

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice would make up
And take up
Her stand
The road was not exactly arterial
But it led to a town nearby
Where quite a lot of masculine material
Caught her rolling eye

She was ready to hitchhike
Cadillac or motorbike
She wasn't proud or choosy
All she
Was aiming to be
Was a pinked-up
Minked-up,
Fly-by-night floozy

When old Rogers
Gave her pearls as large as
Nuts on a chestnut tree
All she'd say was
'Fiddle-di-dee!
The wages of sin will be the death of me!'

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice's parents
Would wait
Hand in hand
Her dear old white-headed mother
Wistfully sipping champagne
Said 'We've spoiled our child
Spared the rod
Open up the caviar and say ""Thank God!""
We've got no cause to complain!
Alice is at it again!'",Alice Is at It Again
Noël Coward,"Girls:
 Tell us, sailor,
 Tell us, please,
 For we're terribly keen to know
 What it's like to be fancy free
 Footloose on the rolling sea?
 China girl chop-chop,
 Gay Maltese,
 Hot Mommas from Mexico-
 
 Harry:
 If you'll forgive a crude remark
 And don't resent a rude remark
 I'll let you into a secret-
 
 Girls:
 Well?
 
 Harry:
 They're all alike in the dark!
 
 Girls:
 There must have been
 Some place you've seen
 Superior to the rest?
 
 Harry:
 As a matter of fact
 With political tact
 I like America best.
 
 Girls:
 
 There's a good time a-comin on de ole plantation
 For a jolly Jack Tar
 Has just confessed
 The he likes America best!
 
 Verse 1
 
 Harry:
 I don't care for China,
 Japan's far too small,
 I've rumbled the Rio Grande,
 I hate Asia Minor,
 I can't bear Bengal
 And I shudder to think
 Of the awful stink
 On the road to Samarkand.
 
 Harry:
 I like America,
 I have played around
 Every slappy-happy hunting ground
 But I find America-okay.
 I've been about a bit
 But I must admit
 That I didn't know the half of it
 Till I hit the U.S.A.
 No likely lass
 In Boston, Mass.
 From passion will recoil.
 In Dallas, Tex.
 They talk of sex
 But only think of oil.
 New Jersey dames
 Go up in flames
 If someone mentions-bed.
 In Chicago, Illinois
 Any girl who meets a boy
 Giggles and shoots him dead!
 But I like America
 Its Society
 Offers infinite variety
 And come what may
 I shall return some day
 To the good old U.S.A.
 
 Verse 2
 
 Harry:
 I've loathed every acre
 From Cannes to Canton,
 I also deplore Bombay,
 I've jeered at Jamaica
 And seen through Ceylon,
 And exploded the myth
 Of those Flying Fith
 On the Road to Mandalay.
 
 Girls:
 We'll never mith
 Those blasted fith
 On the road to Mandalay.
 
 Harry:
 But I like America,
 I have traveled far
 From Northumberland to Zanzibar
 And I find America-okay.
 I've roamed the Spanish Main
 Eaten sugar-cane
 But I never tasted cellophane
 Till I struck the U.S.A.
 All delegates
 From Southern States
 Are nervy and distraught.
 In New Orleans
 The wrought-iron screens
 Are dreadfully overwrought.
 Beneath each tree
 In Tennessee
 Erotic books are read.
 And when alligators thud
 Through the Mississippi mud
 Sex rears its ugly head.
 But-I like America,
 Every scrap of it,
 All the sentimental crap of it
 And come what may
 Give me a holiday
 In the good old U.S.A.",I Like America

Just the echo of a sigh

True to the breed that that bore him,
Answered the call that held in thrall
His father's heart before him.

Jean Louis Dominic sailed away
Further than love could find him
Yet through the night he heard a light
And gentle voice behind him say:

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my thoughts go with you
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea

As you gaze from afar on the evening star
Wherever you may roam
You will remember the light through the winter night
That guides you safely home.

Though you find womenkind to be frail,
One love cannot fail, my son, 
'Til our days are done....

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my thoughts go with you
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea.

Jean Louis Dominic Pierre Bouchon
Journeyed the wide world over
Lips that he kissed could not resist
This loving roving rover.

Jean Louis Dominic, right or wrong,
Ever pursued a new love
Till in his brain, there beat a strain
He knew to be his true love song:

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart goes with you
Matelot, Matelot,
When you go down to the sea

For a year and a day you may sail away
And have no thought of me,
Yet through the wind and the spray you will hear me say
No love was ever free.

You will sigh when horizons are clear,
Something that is dear to me
Cannot let me be,

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart goes with you
Matelot, Matelot 
When you go down to the sea.

Matelot, Matelot, 
Where you go my heart will follow
Matelot, Matelot, 
When you go down to the sea

When there's grief in the sky and the waves ride high
My heart to yours will say
You may be sure that I'm true to my love for you
Though half the world away.

Never mind if you find other charms,
Here within my arms you'll sleep,
Sailor from the deep....

Where you go my heart will follow

When you go down to the sea",Matelot
Noël Coward," Verse 1
 
 The world for some years
 Has been sodden with tears
 On behalf of the Acting profession,
 Each star playing a part
 Seems to expect the 'Purple Heart',
 It's unorthodox
 To be born in a box
 But it needn't become an obsession,
 Let's hope we have no worse to plague us
 Than two shows a night at Las Vegas.
 When I think of physicians
 And mathematicians
 Who don't earn a quarter the dough,
 When I look at the faces
 Of people in Macy's
 There's one thing I'm burning to know:
 
 Refrain 1
 
 Why must the show go on?
 It can't be all that indispensable,
 To me it really isn't sensible
 On the whole
 To play a leading role
 While fighting those tears you can't control,
 Why kick up your legs
 When draining the dregs
 Of sorrow's bitter cup?
 Because you have read
 Some idiot has said,
 'The Curtain must go up'!
 I'd like to know why a star takes bows
 Having just returned from burying her spouse.
 Brave boop-a-doopers,
 Go home and dry your tears,
 Gallant old troupers,
 You've bored us all for years
 And when you're so blue,
 Wet through
 And thoroughly woe-begone,
 Why must the show go on?
 Oh Mammy!
 Why must the show go on?
 
 Verse 2
 
 We're asked to condole
 With each tremulous soul
 Who steps out to be loudly applauded,
 Stars on opening nights
 Sob when they see their names in lights,
 Though people who act
 As a matter of fact
 Are financially amply rewarded,
 It seems, while pursuing their calling,
 Their suffering's simply appalling!
 But butchers and bakers
 And candlestick makers
 Get little applause for their pains
 And when I think of miners
 And waiters in 'Diners'
 One query for ever remains:
 
 Refrain 2
 
 Why must the show go on?
 The rule is surely not immutable,
 It might be wiser and more suitable
 Just to close
 If you are in the throes
 Of personal grief and private woes.
 Why stifle a sob
 While doing your job
 When, if you use your head,
 You'd go out and grab
 A comfortable cab
 And go right home to bed?
 Because you're not giving us much fun,
 This 'Laugh Clown Laugh' routine's been overdone,
 Hats off to Show Folks
 For smiling when they're blue
 But more comme-il-faut folks
 Are sick of smiling through,
 And if you're out cold,
 Too old
 And most of your teeth have gone,
 Why must the show go on?
 I sometimes wonder
 Why must the show go on?
 
 Refrain 3
 
 Why must the show go on?
 Why not announce the closing night of it?
 The public seem to hate the sight of it,
 Dear, and so
 Why you should undergo
 This terrible strain we'll never know.
 We know that you're sad,
 We know that you've had
 A lot of storm and strife
 But is it quite fair
 To ask us to share
 Your dreary private life?
 We know you're trapped in a gilded cage
 But for Heaven's sake relax and be your age,
 Stop being gallant
 And don't be such a bore,
 Pack up your talent,
 There's always plenty more
 And if you lose hope
 Take dope
 And lock yourself in the John
 Why must the show go on?
 I'm merely asking
 Why must the show go on?",Why Must the Show Go On?
Noël Coward,"They're out of sorts in Sunderland
And terribly cross in Kent,
They're dull in Hull
And the Isle of Mull
Is seething with discontent,
They're nervous in Northumberland
And Devon is down the drain,
They're filled with wrath
On the firth of Forth
And sullen on Salisbury Plain,
In Dublin they're depressed, lads,
Maybe because they're Celts
For Drake is going West, lads,
And so is everyone else.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Misery's here to stay.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
There are dark clouds hurtling through the sky
And it's no good whining
About a silver lining
For we know from experience that they won't roll by,
With a scowl and a frown
We'll keep our peckers down
And prepare for depression and doom and dread,
We're going to unpack our troubles from our old kit bag
And wait until we drop down dead.
 
From Portland Bill to Scarborough
They're querulous and subdued
And Shropshire lads
Have behaved like cads
From Berwick-on-Tweed to Bude,
They're mad at Market Harborough
And livid at Leigh-on-Sea,
In Tunbridge Wells
You can hear the yells
Of woe-begone bourgeoisie.
We all get bitched about, lads,
Whoever our vote elects,
We know we're up the spout, lads.
And that's what England expects.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Trouble is on the way.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
The horizon's gloomy as can be,
There are black birds over
The grayish cliffs of Dover
And the rats are preparing to leave the BBC
We're an unhappy breed
And very bored indeed
When reminded of something that Nelson said.
While the press and the politicians nag nag nag
We'll wait until we drop down dead.
  
From Colwyn Bay to Kettering
They're sobbing themselves to sleep,
The shrieks and wails
In the Yorkshire dales
Have even depressed the sheep.
In rather vulgar lettering
A very disgruntled group
Have posted bills
On the Cotswold Hills
To prove that we're in the soup.
While begging Kipling's pardon
There's one thing we know for sure
If England is a garden
We ought to have more manure.
Hurray, hurray, hurray!
Suffering and dismay.

There are bad times just around the corner
And the outlook's absolutely vile,
There are Home Fires smoking
From Windermere to Woking
And we're not going to tighten our belts and smile, smile, smile,
At the sound of a shot
We'd just as soon as not
Take a hot water bottle and go to bed,
We're going to un-tense our muscles till they sag sag sag
And wait until we drop down dead.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
We can all look forward to despair,
It's as clear as crystal
From Bridlington to Bristol
That we can't save democracy and we don't much care
If the Reds and the Pinks
Believe that England stinks
And that world revolution is bound to spread,
We'd better all learn the lyrics of the old 'Red Flag'
And wait until we drop down dead.
A likely story
Land of Hope and Glory,
Wait until we drop down dead.

And terribly cross in Crete,
In Bucharest 
They are so depressed 
They're frightened to cross the street,
They're sullen in Siberia
And timid in Turkestan,

In the Isle of Wight
And jittery in Japan,

Maybe because they're Celts,

And wait until we drop down dead.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
The horizon's gloomy as can be,
There are black birds over
They grayish cliffs of Dover
And the vultures are hovering round the Christmas tree
We're an unhappy breed
And ready to stampede
When we're asked to remember what Lincoln said,
We're going to un-tense our muscles till they sag sag sag
And wait until we drop down dead.
 
They're morbid in Mongolia
And querulous in Quebec,
There's not a man
In Baluchistan
Who isn't a nervous wreck,
In Maine the melancholia
Is deeper than tongue can tell,
In Monaco
All the croupiers know
They haven't a hope in Hell.
In far away Australia
Each wallaby's well aware
The world's a total failure
Without any time to spare.
Hurray,  hurray,  hurray!
Suffering and dismay.
 
There are bad times just around the corner,
We can all look forward to despair,
It's as clear as crystal
From Brooklyn Bridge to Bristol
That we can't save Democracy
And we don't much care.
At the sound of a shot
We'd just as soon as not
Take a hot-water bad and retire to bed
And while the press and the politicians nag nag nag
We'll wait until we drop down dead.
 
There are bad times just around the corner
And the outlook's absolutely vile,
You can take this from us
That when they Atom-bomb us
We are not going to tighten our belts and smile smile smile,
We are in such a mess
It couldn't matter less
If a world revolution is just ahead,
We'd better all learn the lyrics of the old 'Red Flag'
And wait until we drop down dead.
A likely story
Land of Hope and Glory,
Wait until we drop down dead.",There Are Bad Times Just Around the Corner
Noël Coward,"A lady known as Paris, Romantic and Charming
Has left her old companions and faded from view

Lonely men with lonely eyes are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were, but there's no sign of her

She has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street caf‚

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them
Old women, selling flowers, in markets at dawn

Children who applauded, Punch and Judy in the park
And those who danced at night and kept our Paris bright

'til the town went dark. 
",The Last Time I Saw Paris [Alternate Take][#]
Noël Coward,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Noël Coward,"Oh, tell us please
Entirely confidentially
How A.D.C.s
Are trained in social grace.
It's awfully brave
Daily to be called upon to save
His Excellency's face!
 
Any explanations
Of the duties of an A.D.C.
Prove the complications
That are rife at Government House.
Certain situations
We could never let a lady see,
There are strange vibrations
In the life at Government House.
Truth is often sacrificed for reasons of diplomacy.
 
That of course we understand
But all the same it must be grand 
To be
So suave, so calm, so dignified!
 
If you knew what all that signified-we-
Who break the Ninth Commandment every day
Would hang our heads in shame and say
Forgive-we have to live
Officially on feet of clay.
Every minute
We're made to sin it
Is really very depraved,
But to Hell
With the lies we tell,
His Excellency's honour must be saved.
 
His Excellency regrets
That owing to an attack of Gout
He really dare not venture out
On Saturday to dine.
His Excellency regrets
That owing to doctor's orders he
Cannot attend the Mission tea
And also must decline
Your kind invitation
For Wednesday week.
A slight operation
And poor circulation
Combined with a weedy physique
Has made him unable to speak.
All this in addition to what
The Doctors describe as a ‘Clot'
Which may disappear
By the end of the year
But may, very possibly, not!
His Excellency regrets
That owing to his exalted state
He can no more associate
With amiable brunettes.
Walk up-walk up-we're willing to take your bets
That that's one of the principal things His Excellency regrets!
 
So now we know
About the Diplomatic Corps,
How it can so
Corrupt the soul of youth.
What happens if
Some day you give the waiting world a whiff
Of plain, unvarnished truth?
 
His Excellency regrets
That, failing a better alibi,
He must admit he'd rather die
Than open your Bazaar.
His Excellency regrets
That, lacking enough official scope,
He can't disband the Band of Hope
No matter where they are.
He frankly despises
The people he rules,
His gorge also rises
When giving the prizes
At co-educational schools
To rows of illiterate fools.
And if you should write in the book
He'll give you a murderous look.
For it ruins his day
To be taken away
From his rod and his line and his hook!
His Excellency regrets
He hasn't enough to run the house
Or pay the staff-or feed a mouse
Upon the pay he gets
Heigho-heigho-he's up to his ears in debts
But that's one of the least of the things His Excellency regrets!",His Excellency Regrets
Noël Coward,"Verse 1
 
 The India that one read about
 And may have been misled about
 In one respect has kept itself intact.
 Though ‘Pukka Sahib' traditions may have cracked
 And thinned
 The good old Indian army's still a fact.
 That famous monumental man
 The Officer and Gentleman
 Still lives and breathes and functions from Bombay to Katmandu
 At any moment one can glimpse
 Matured or embryonic ‘Blimps'
 Vivaciously speculating as to what became of who.
 Though Eastern sounds may fascinate your ear
 When West meets West you're always sure to hear-
 
 Refrain 1
 
 Whatever became of old Bagot?
 I haven't seen him for a year.
 Is it true that young Forbes had to marry that Faggot
 He met in the Vale of Kashmir?
 Have you had any news
 Or that chap in the “Blues”,
 Was it Prosser or Pyecroft or Pym?
 He was stationed in Simla, or was it Bengal?
 I know he got tight at a ball in Nepal
 And wrote several four-letter words on the wall.
 I wonder what happened to him!
 
 Refrain 2
 
 Whatever became of old Shelley?
 Is it true that young Briggs was cashiered
 For riding quite nude on a push-bike through Delhi
 The day the new Viceroy appeared?
 Have you had any word
 Of that bloke in the ‘Third',
 Was it Southerby, Sedgwick or Sim?
 They had him thrown out of the club in Bombay
 For, apart from his mess bill exceeding his pay,
 He took to pig-sticking in quite the wrong way.
 I wonder what happened to him!
 
 Verse 2
 
 One must admit that by and large
 Upholders of the British Raj*
 Don't shine in conversation as a breed.
 Though Indian army officers can read
 A bit
 Their verbal wit-has rather run to seed.
 Their splendid insularity
 And roguish jocularity
 Was echoing through when Victoria was Queen.
 In restaurants and dining-cars,
 In messes, clubs and hotel bars
 They try to maintain tradition in the way it's always been.
 Though worlds may change and nations disappear
 Above the shrieking chaos you will hear-
 
 Refrain 3
 
 Whatever became of old Tucker?
 Have you heard any word of young Mills
 Who ruptured himself at the end of a chukka
 And had to be sent to the hills?
 They say that young Lees
 Had a go of ‘D.T.'s'
 And his hopes of promotion are slim.
 According to Stubbs, who's a bit of a louse,
 The silly young blighter went out on a ‘souse',
 And took two old tarts into Government House.
 I wonder what happened to him!
 
 Refrain 4
 
 Whatever became of old Keeling?
 I hear that he got back from France
 And frightened three nuns in a train in Darjeeling
 By stripping and waving his lance!
 D'you remember Munroe,
 In the P.A.V.O?
 He was tallish and mentally dim.
 The talk of heredity can't be quite true,
 He was dropped on his head by his ayah at two,
 I presume that by now he'll have reached G.H.Q.
 I'm sure that's what happened to him!
 
 Refrain 5
 
 Whatever became of old Archie?
 I hear he departed this life
 After rounding up ten sacred cows in Karachi
 To welcome the Governor's wife.
 D'you remember young Phipps
 Who had very large hips
 And whose waist was excessively slim?
 Well, it seems that some doctor in Grosvenor Square
 Gave him hormone injections for growing his hair
 And he grew something here, and he grew something there.
 I wonder what happened to her-him?

I am not myself
What a different world I view

I see a new sun up in a new sky
And my whole horizon has reached a new high
Yesterday my heart sang a blue song
But today hear it hum a cheery new song

And I'm spreading sunshine all over the place

Through the perishing
winter nights and days,
A funny little phrase
That means so much to me,
That you've got to be
With me heart and soul,
For on you the whole thing leans.

Come with me and leave the noisy crowds,
Sunlight shines for us above the clouds.
Please don't turn away
Or my dream will stay
Hidden out of sight,
Among a lot of ""might have beens""!

And you,
And no-one to worry us,
No one to hurry us through
This dream we've found.

We'll gaze at the sky,
And try
To guess what it's all about,
Then we will figure out why
The world is round!

We'll be as happy and contented as birds upon a tree,
High above the mountains and the sea.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true,
Our room with a view?

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to give advice,
That sounds like a paradise few
Could fail to choose.

With fingers entwined,
We'll find
Relief from the preachers
Who always beseech us to mind
Our P's and Q's.

We'll watch the whole world pass before us while we are sitting still,
Leaning on our own window sill.

To find that vice can be
Its own reward

Noël Coward,"Lord Elderley, Lrd Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
With every virtue, every grace,
Ah what avails the sceptred race,
Here you see-the four of us,
And there are so many more of us
Eldest sons that must succeed.
We know how Caesar conquered Gaul
And how to whack a cricket ball;
Apart from this, our education lacks co-ordination.
Though we're young and tentative
And rather rip-representative,
Scions of a noble breed,
We are the products of those homes serene and stately
Which only lately
Seem to have run to seed!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
How beautiful they stand,
To prove the upper classes
Have still the upper hand;
Though the fact that they have to be rebuilt
And frequently mortgaged to the hilt
Is inclined to take the gilt
Off the gingerbread,
And certainly damps the fun
Of the eldest son-
But still we won't be beaten,
We'll scrimp and scrape and save,
The playing fields of Eton
Have made us frightfully brave-
And though if the Van Dycks have to go
And we pawn the Bechstein Grand,
We'll stand
By the Stately Homes of England.
 
Here you see
The pick of us,
You may be heartily sick of us,
Still with sense
We're all imbued.
Our homes command extensive views
And with assistance from the Jews
We have been able to dispose of
Rows and rows and rows of
Gainsboroughs and Lawrences,
Some sporting prints of Aunt Florence's,
Some of which were rather rude.
Although we sometimes flaunt our family conventions,
Our good intentions
Mustn't be misconstrued.
 
The Stately Homes of England
We proudly represent,
We only keep them up for
Americans to rent,
Though the pipes that supply the bathroom burst
And the lavatory makes you fear the worst,
It was used by Charles the First
Quite informally,
And later by George the Fourth
On a journey north.
The State Apartments keep their
Historical renown,
It's wiser not to sleep there
In case they tumble down'
But still if they ever catch on fire
Which, with any luck, they might
We'll fight
For the Stately Homes  of England
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Though rather in the lurch,
Provide a lot of chances
For Psychical Research-
There's the ghost of a crazy younger son
Who murdered, in thirteen fifty-one,
An extremely rowdy Nun
Who resented it,
And people who come to call
Meet her in the hall.
The baby in the guest wing,
Who crouches by the grate,
Was walled up in the west wing
In fourteen twenty-eight.
If anyone spots
The Queen of Scots
In a hand-embroidered shroud
We're proud
Of the Stately Homes of England.
 
Lord Elderley, Lord Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
Behold us in our hours of ease,
Uncertain, coy and hard to please.
Reading in Debrett of us,
This fine Patrician quartette of us,
We can feel extremely proud,
Our ancient lineage we trace
Back to the cradle of the Race
Before those beastly Roman bowmen
Bitched our local Yeomen.
Through the new democracy
May pain the old Aristocarcy
We've not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance what will be- will be.
Our heads will still be
Bloody but quite unbowed!
 
The Stately Homes of England
In valley, dale and glen
Produce a race of charming,
Innocuous young men.
Though our mental equipment may be slight
And we barely distinguish left from right,
We are quite prepared to fight
For our principles,
Though none of us know so far
What they really are.
Our duty to the nation,
It's only fair to state,
Lies not I pro-creation
But what we pro-create;
And so we can cry
With kindling eye
As to married like we go,
What ho!
For the Stately Homes of England!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Although a trifle bleak,
Historically speaking,
Are more or less unique.
We've a cousin who won the Golden Fleece
And a very peculiar fowling-piece
Which was sent to Cromwell's niece,
Who detested it,
And rapidly sent it back
With a dirty crack.
A note we have from Chaucer
Contains a bawdy joke.
We also have a saucer
That Bloody Mary broke.
We've two pairs of tights
King Arthur's Knights
Had completely worn away.
Sing Hey!
For the Stately Homes of England.

The Stately Homes of England,
Tho' rather on the blink
Provide a lot of reasons
For what we do and think.
Tho' we freely admit we may be wrong,
Our conviction that we are right is strong
Tho' it may not be for long,
We'll hold on to it
We might as well hold the bat
Till they knock us flat
Our dignity of race may
Retire into its shell
Our Minister of Grace may
Defend us none too well
But still if a child
Becomes too wild
And we're forced to use the rod,
Thank God

Though the Riviera
Seems really much queerer

When Laura got blind on Dubonnet and gin
And scratched her veneer with a Cartier pin

I went to a marvelous party
I must say the fun was intense
We all had to do
What the people we knew
Would be doing a hundred years hence
Dear Cecil arrived wearing armor
Some shells and a black feather boa
Poor Millicent wore a surrealist comb
Made of bits of mosaic from St. Peter's in Rome
But the weight was so great that she had to go home

When suddenly Cyril screamed “Fiddledidee”
And ripped off his trousers and jumped in the sea

Elise made an entrance with May
You'd never have guessed
From her fisherman's vest
That her bust had been whittled away
Poor Lulu got fried on Chianti
And talked about esprit de corps
Maurice made a couple of passes at Gus
And Freddie, who hates any kind of a fuss
Did half the Big Apple and twisted his truss
I couldn't have liked it more

I went to a marvellous party
We played the most wonderful game
Maureen disappeared
And came back in a beard
And we all had to guess at her name
We talked about growing old gracefully
And Elsie who's seventy-four
Said, “A, it's a question of being sincere
And be, if you're supple you've noting to fear

It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

It's phony it's plain to see
How happy I would be
If you believed in me",It's Only a Paper Moon
Noel Freidline Quintet,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

Really gets bad

Noel Freidline Quintet,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

Noel Freidline Quintet,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Noel Freidline Quintet,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it

Right through the very heart of it

I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Are gathered 'round their TV screens
To hear the government about to speak
For solider boys and Jesus freaks
They go to heaven on their holidays
The congregation hopes and prays
They leave their letters in the mail box
For lonely souls they could not save

Off and on I used hear the call
But she was just a baby doll
And all around them were the holy men
Who twist the words of way back when
She will kiss the sky and shelter all the world from the rain
Put on a record on the jukebox
She might dance the night away

On and on we go and the rest of the world outside
May soon explode and there is no place we might hide

What if I'm already dead, how would I know?
What if I'm already dead, how would I know?

Lost inside my head behind a wall, do they hear me when I call?
And when the night is over where will I fall?

Noel Gourdin,"Growin' up, it was tough
We were glad for what little we had
I saw my share of old fair, Mississippi
Dirt roads and Confederate flags
Everyday my father would tell me
""Son, run and don't never come back""
That's where I left my girl
That's where my heart is at, and oh...

I held my breath when they dipped my head
Then I came up shiny and new
Found out about love in the back of my Impala
Where they laid my grandfather too
Down by the river
Where black folks gather
After Sunday service is through
How the river runs to the ocean
I'll be runnin' right back to you

I got along, I'm movin' on
I bandaged the scars of, well
I think of her, then I seem to wait
For a card or a letter in the mail
I walk the beach with the sand in my feet
Place my ear to a shell
I wonder if you miss me too
Cause I been longin' to get to you
I'm sick of starin' out my window sill
I'm tired of hopin' she remembers me still
I'm packin' my bags, I said I'm goin' back home
To the place where I belong
The river
And if she's there when I get there
I'm never gonna leave her again
You see, she stole my heart
Down by the river

I held my breath when they dipped my head
Then I came up shiny and new
Found out about love in the back of my Impala
Where they laid my grandfather too
Down by the river
Where black folks gather
After Sunday service is through
How the river runs to the ocean
I'll be runnin' right back to you

So I'm packin' up my suitcase
Bought me a one-way fare
I'm leavin' everything behind me
But in my heart I always care
And I'll still be right there
Thank you baby
Cause nothin' can replace that part in my life, and...

Girl may I take you out with me tonight

Its a bad look girl,
You know he's just gaming, he promised the world
Something about him, come sit with me girl

Settin' on you to settle, cause the better man for you

When I'm the better man for you

Damn, there you go once again
Trippin' out over him, why do you do it baby
Oh baby please, you don't hear the stories
I want to set your mind at ease
If you let me c'mon and give you all of me baby

If you could girl, see all the things that I do 
Then you can see what he does, just makes him look like a fool

I guess its all my fault, flatten all my tires

You can have it all
Can have the house, cars, and the dogs
I'm gone as long as your happy
But when it gets rough, and it will
Find another sucker to cover your bills
She really played me out, but I love her still

[Chorus]
Hurts like hell, but she'll never see me crying
No way, theres never no way baby
With every breathe theres a pain in my chest
And it feels like im dying, 
You'll never catch me crying over her

Could she ever be replaced,
Maybe I made a big mistake
Before the break up waking up
Next to your beautiful face
Maybe im better off 
Or maybe we tried to force
Couldn't fit maybe its best 
We called the whole thing off

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

You had it made in the shade
And now its gone away,
No more pictures to remind me of yesterday

So baby get your things and ill be OK

From robbing your will and a heart that could break

But I dug ya, then I liked ya
Now I love you baby

I'm so happy since you came to me
A love so heavenly 
You inspired a change you made a believer in me
I'm so blessed to be, living my fantasy

Created for me is it too good to me

I feel I don't wanna get back up
Girl I don't wanna pick myself up and out of love

I feel but you don't have to help me up

Up and out of love

Don't ever wanna [Repeat: x5]

Now look at me
I'm so wrapped up in love
And all that we've become

Remember who I was, I never left the club
I never gave my trust, but you gained it
I cant explain it no, oh girl

Ain't nothin' left for me to say

Sometimes we don't see eye to eye
And go for days and don't talk
Just imagine something happens to the ones we love
While we hold a silly grudge

Don't procrastinate shower the people you love with love
Make sure they know with a kiss or a hug
Cant hesitate to give them all and all
Pick up the phone and call
Don't go your whole life long without the joy
Of knowing you loved someone
And they returned the love 24

[Chorus]
Make the most of the time you share
With that special someone
Let them know how much you care
Life is short
We don't really know,
Make the most don't be afraid let the feelings show

A guy who couldn't put aside is pride to save his life
Sits alone at home by the phone and its no surprise
He done took that woman for granted and she got wise
Better open your eyes and recognize

Can make the day worth while
If we could only be like a child
And remember to laugh sometimes
And not question our hearts

I've been wondering why its taken me so long,
To make you my baby

I was the first to say it
But I been thinkin' bout your touch,
My mind keeps replayin' it

And everything that I stood for,
I take it all back for your love
I realize that I want you more,
Talkin' bout gettin' serious
So maybe its time we talked
So that we could just discuss
Where we gonna go from here,
Cause baby this here ain't enough

[Chorus]
Baby what about us [Repeat: x2]
We could be just one love [Repeat: x2]
Baby what about us
We could be, one love, one love
We're lucky to just have just one

And ever since you left that night,
I cant stop thinking about you
Seems like something ain't just right,
Spending days without you
Now I tried my best to hold my tongue
But its time to get indigent
Baby we should just be one,
So just hang on with it

And everything that I stood for,
I take it all back for your love
I realize that I want you more,

Noel Gourdin,"My baby got her eye set on a diamond set necklace, 
Bracelet and finger row
And I'm gonna get it for her
One day I will but today 
I'm the wrong color collar inside of my reach
But with your love it wont be long
Stick with me you keep me strong
But for now its cubic Z,
I get you everything you dreamed

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stretch out my arms,
Girl ill reach, just to give you what you need so,
Stick with me [Repeat: x3]
One day you'll eat the hand that im gonna be
Maybe if I reach [Repeat: x4]
Stick with me [Repeat: x2]
Cause you cant have and hold what you want
Unless you reach,
Reach [Repeat: x6]
You gotta reach baby stretch out your arms and reach

Now we set up for the week,
We got some food to eat
Need a spot, car wash, I got you covered
As long as we got each other
All out, ill go, girl I never ain't long
But that fly shit is out of my reach
Ill drop a note on some shoes or a bag
Put on some steaks and put on some jazz
Eat an exotic cuisine, your plate is always full with me
But that fours stars is out of my,

[Chorus]

And I know it ain't always been easy girl
One day I will sit back and laugh
When I think about it the tough times we had
And honestly theres no where else I'd rather be
And im glad to see that you stuck it out with me

Noel Gourdin,"Girl we need to talk
Cause I cant look at you 
And keep this to myself
Cause every time I see your eyes
The thought comes back to mind
Girl I didn't want to do it
But I gave into temptation
I couldn't hold it back
She really put me on
And I swear I never meant to hurt you
But its killing me 
Cause now I'm so afraid

[Chorus]
Cause I don't want to lose
Girl I'm sorry forgive me
If you'll just let me explain
Girl I'm sorry forgive me

Baby now I understand
If you just want to up and leave
After what I've done cause I don't deserve you
But if you can only take the time 
And think of what we had
If you could just give me a second chance
Cause baby we could live romance
Baby just me and you
No one in between us
I know I'm asking for too much
But if you still have a heart
Thats all I need

[Chorus]

I don't want you to leave
Cause I love you 
Girl I cant see myself 
Living without you
I don't know what id do if I lose you

Noel Gourdin,"Winter cold, glass and stocking, temperatures dropping
To and fro through sleet and snow
Cant wait to get home
Cause when we set it off the clothes come off
And the cold don't mean nothing
Its hot like a oven when we get to loving 
You keep that soft and warm

[Bridge]
And its hot to death
But your body makes me want to do it till I'm out of breath
And we're soaking wet 
We out the storm up in this room lets get it on

[Chorus]
Just cause its cold outside
And the sun ain't shining
That don't mean me and you cant get to sweating
Just like its summertime
It might be cold out there
Its hot as the fourth of July up in here 
Cause we change the weather when we get together
Oh baby lets make it summertime

Makin' love over an hour
We lay still feeling the chill
Wrapped up in a comfy quilt
Makin' body heat when bodies meet
From front back, think I better check the thermostat
Bought to pass out girl but I ain't mad
Cause its the greatest sex I ever had

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Shivering and shaking not from the cold
But from the love we're love making
It could be December if we keep kissing
We going to need some air condition
Gotta fifth of Bacardi sucking that Marley
Windows are foggy,
And we can make summer wherever we go

Noel Gourdin,"[Chorus]
Is it too late to change your mind
I was hopping I could see you just one more time
If its too late to get you back 
I'll move on along you just like that

It's been a whole year since we talked
And I been missing you 
And everything alright with me
I wanna know how life's treating you 
I was dead wrong always gone
Leaving you home alone when I should of been there for you

[Bridge]
Theres something I wanna say 
Pride got in the way 
Should of stopped you at the door
Should of loved you more
But now that your gone away I feel it everyday
So much pressure babe
I wanna catch a flight
Ill be there tonight

[Chorus]

Its no one else's fault
Girl I paid the cost
If you don't return well I guess its just my loss
Can I get a second chance
Can I get one more dance
Now I realize that I need you in my life

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

I made it so complicated, and now shes jaded
Cause I procrastinated I never meant to do her wrong
I regret that it took me so long
To see you that I was hurting my baby
I think I'm getting faded
You see I took her for granted and I couldn't have planned it much worse
But sugar I gotta know

Is it too late, is it too late

It's the ending of our first year, as time passes by
And though the future is unclear
I can promise you this, my love will never die

So when the world is against us
And all the pressure, it builds up
Until the point where I feel I should give up
That's when I look in the distance 
And see just what I'd be missing
So let the people keep on talkin', cause there is no breakin' up

Cause I don't want to grow up

I just want to be with you wherever you are, oh baby
Cause I don't want to grow up

I just want to be with you wherever you are

Now we could settle down and have a few kids
Never gets old, feels like the first kiss
When your lips touch mine
Seasons may change but your heart's still true
You're the home that I could run to
And I will keep on running baby, running right back to you

It's terribly sad but true,

Noel Lorica,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Noel Paul Stookey,"This house goes on sale ev'ry Wednesday morning
And taken off the market in the afternoon
You can buy a piece of it if you want to
It's been good to me if it's been good for you

Take the grand look now the fire is burning
Is that your reflection on the wall?
I can show you this room and some others
If you came to see the house at all

Careful up the stairs, a few are missing
I haven't had the time to make repairs
First step is the hardest one to master
Last one I'm not really sure is there

This room here once had childish laughter
And I come back to hear it now and again
I can't say that I'm certain what you're after
But in this room, a part of you will remain

Second floor, the lady sleeps in waiting
Past the lantern, tiptoe in its glance
In the room the soft brown arms of shadow
This room the hardest one to pass

How much will you pay to live in the attic?
The shavings off your mind are the only rent
I left some would there if you thought you couldn't
Or if the shouldn't that you've bought has been spent

And taken off the market in the afternoon
You can buy a piece of it if you want to

If only I could heal your sorrow

Noel Paul Stookey,"Sunday morning, very bright, I read Your book by colored light
That came in through the pretty window picture.

I visited some houses where they said that You were living
And they talked a lot about You
And they spoke about Your giving.
They passed a basket with some envelopes;
I just had time to write a note
And all it said was ""I believe in You.""

Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants.
The discussion was theology,
And when they smiled and turned to me
All that I could say was ""I believe in You.""

I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving
And a balded man said You were dead,
But the house would go on living.
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave
He shook his head and said I'd never find You.

My mother used to dress me up,
And while my dad was sleeping
We would walk down to Your house without speaking.",Who Loves the Girls

And I'm logged-on to the INTERNET.
I usually pickup my e-mail in the afternoon
But on weekends sometimes I forget...
I yell down the hall to the bedroom, ""Honey, I'll be right there...""
She says ""that's ok, dear, I got a brand new book here and
I'm not going anywhere"".

A funny thing about a couple when a couple of years've gone by.
You don't talk; you think you know each other so well you don't have to try...
you take for granted what you used to call enchanted just a while ago...
ah..when does a mystery turn into history?
I don't know...

Anyway, I got another meg of data coming down the line;
A Wall Street profile...spreadsheet from a friend of mine...
Up on the screen pops a little green box says 'click on me'.
Somewhere I swear Alice in Wonderland's callin'...

I look up at the clock (not as late as I thought: only quarter to one).
Download's finished, I could take five minutes and have me some fun.
The invitation's from a web location in Hong Kong.
It's already started, this virtual party runs all night long!
I say all night?

We're invited to a virtual party tonight...(you try it)
You're invited to a virtual party tonight...

There's computers in the microwave, computers in the automobile, computers in the phone.
Oh and even my wife who used to tell me to 'get a life'
has got a computer of her own.

Grab you by the hand and step on the electric door
Leave the shopping cart right where it is
I betcha somebody's got the same list
I want to take us away from all this to a distant shore.

I'd leave the car by the curb with the motor on
The tape deck playin' our favorite love song
And you'd say ""What in the world?""
And smile just like a little girl
And I'd say ""I can't tell you now but it won't be long.""

I know it sounds funny, but it's true
I get so busy I forget I'm in love with you
And every now and then we need to get away to get close again.

Up in the air in a window seat
Your head on my shoulder and a blanket around our feet
We could leave the kids at home
And if you get worried we could telephone
We need a weekend of fun for under two hundred dollars complete.

I know it sounds funny, but it's true
I get so busy I forget I'm in love with you
And every now and then we need to get away to get close again.

There we would be in a sunny land
We'd lie on the beach and you could wiggle your toes in the sand
A tropical drink late at night
And a midnight dip if the temperature's right
The best things turn out better if they never were planned.

Noel Redding,"Hello Josephine.  How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler ""Woo woo woo""

I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella ev'ry time it rained
You used to cry so much it was a crying shame


Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler 'Woo woo woo""

You used to live over yonder by the railroad track.
When it rained you couldn't walk I used to tote you on my back
Now you gotta make believe it was a thrill at that.

Noël Samyn,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam",Amsterdam
Noël Samyn,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight",La Maison Sous Les Arbres

Noel Schajris,"Después de tanto tiempo que ha pasado
Te parecerá mentira Pero no me acostumbro
Parece como hubiera sido ayer
Ese primer día que nos vimos desnudos
Y siempre pensé La vida debe de continuar

Pero sin ti Todo se quedo por la mitad
A medio vivir A medio sentir
Y se me pasa la vida
Y no encuentro salida sin ti
Después de tanto tiempo que ha pasado
Aun te espero como siempre En el mismo sitio

Aun así logro sentir Tu pecho presionado con el mio
Y tus latidos Y cada vez Se me hace mas difícil cada vez
Y es que sin ti Todo se quedo por la mitad
A medio vivir A medio sentir Y se me pasa la vida
Y no encuentro salida sin ti
Llevamos mucho tiempo hablando Y no te seguire aburriendo mas
Con mi discurso Solo te llamaba por saber
Si por si acaso tu tambien Necesitabas

No esta de mas Hablar de vez en cuando No esta de mas
Y es que sin ti Respiro con un solo pulmon
Y es que sin ti Todo se quedo por la mitad
A medio vivir, a medio sentir
y se me pasa la vida Y no encuentro salida sin ti",A  Medio Vivir
Noel Schajris,"Yo pienso que
No son tan inútiles, las noches que te di
Te marchas y que
Yo no intento discutírtelo, lo sabes y lo se
Al menos quédate solo esta noche
Prometo no tocarte ,estas segura
Tal vez es que me voy sintiendo solo
Por que conozco esa sonrisa, tan definitiva
Tu sonrisa que a mi mismo, me abrió tu paraíso

Se dice que, con cada hombre, hay una como tu
Pero mi sitio, lo comparas con alguno
Igual que yo mejor lo dudo
Por que esta vez agachas la mirada
Me pides que sigamos siendo amigos
Amigos para que maldita sea
A un amigo lo perdono, pero a ti te amo
Pueden parecer banales, mis instintos naturales

Hay una cosa que yo no te he dicho aun
En mis problemas sabes que, se llaman tu
Solo por eso tu me vez hacerme el duro
Para sentirme un poquito mas seguro
Y sino quieres ni decir en que he fallado
Recuerda que también a ti te he perdonado
En cambio tu, dices lo siento no te quiero
Y te me vas con esta historia entre tus dedos

Que vas hacer, busca una excusa
Luego márchate
Por que de mi
No debieras preocuparte, no debes provocarme
Que yo te escribiré un par de canciones
Tratando de ocultar mis emociones
Y pensando pero poco en las palabras
Que hablare de la sonrisa, tan definitiva
Tu sonrisa que a mi mismo, me abrió tu paraíso

Hay una cosa que yo no te he dicho aun

Quien como tu que solo entre tus brazos se duerme

Quien como tu que con ternuras curas sus fiebres

Y que se pierda en le pasado este tormento

Este vacío de tenerte sólo en sueños
Mientras me calma el corazón por ser tu dueño

Cuando me miran sin saber que estoy muriendo
Por entregarte la pasión que llevo dentro

En cada noche sin tus besos
En el rincón de mis lamentos

Why why not

I like the way that u played it 
I'll learn your body 
You'll teach me how too

Se que me daban un año para que ami me mataran

Y ahora están aquí con migo porque los tengo chambiando
Mira lo que son las cosas y que vuelta esta la vida

Porque la herencia es muy grande y los juniors seguirán
Esto no es cuento ni historia es el reflejo de mi vida
Yo no sueño con la gloria yo trabajo día a día

Donde corre un rio muy frio

Llevo a todos mi hijos muy cerquita del alma
Deje atrás todos los vicios mis miedos y malos karmas

Neta que ese ranchito pa las fiestas y alborotos

De que tengo sobrepeso

Hago y deshago contento

Cualidades  respetables no cualquiera llega grande
Hay enviadas y hay cobardes aquí sobran los tacuaches
La palabra es la palabra el respeto es el respeto
Y hay que caminar derecho

El que no arriesga no gana y yo tenia muchas ganas
De hacer alguien en la vida
Dicen que la tierra es vida y se convertio en mi amiga
Me dio lo que yo quería pura rama me brindaba
Cosechaba y la sacaba y los billetes me llegaban

Puros clientes exclusivos
Eran los mas efectivos
Cambiaban verde por verde

Buscaban a la guanabana
Sabia que bien trabajaba
Por eso me respetaban

Tengo recuerdos muy dentro de mi,

No puedo vivir,
Si no estas aquí,
No quiero seguir,
No puedo existir,
Si consumo alcohol,
Me sale peor,
Aumenta el recuerdo y me pongo llorón,
Ya no se que hacer,
No se que pensar,
Mucho menos se lo que va a pasar,
Lo único que se es,
Que no quiero estar,
Si mi muñequita no va a regresar,

Pa' que entregara a su padre 
Como nada le sacaron 
Demostró no ser cobarde 
Mas de su gente arrestaron

Bernarba y don Manuel Sanchez 
Mas que en el oro molido 
Traiban orden de arrestarlos 
No podían seguir ya vivos 
Secuestraron a su madre 
Para tomarlos rendidos

Fue allá por la madrugada 
Que los pudieron rodear 
Ellos cuidaron las armas 
No había otra oportunidad 
Su familia secuestraron 
Se tuvieron que entregar

Por un puño de dinero 
Un traidor cambio sus vidas 
A un grupo de pistoleros

Me has dejado solo crueles decepciones
Pero anda ingrata como pagas otro a ti te ha de pagar

Te brindo el camino que no he caminado
Why un poema nuevo que voy a escribir
Junto al arco iris que esta tras de ti

why volaremos sobres nubes
Como pajaros azules
De la mano de este amor
Why volaremos sobre nubes
Para que jamas lo dudes

Que este amor es puro amor
Que este amor es tanto amor
Que esto es demasiado amor

Donde tu espiritu libre comienza
Te brindo una estrella que va iluminando
A nuestros instintos para convivir
Para que del tiempo me llene de ti

Porque me haces buenos los momentos
Why de repente vienes why cambias mi historia

Porque me haces descubrir
Algo nuevo en mi interior
Porque sabes todo lo que quiero
Why alimentas la ilusion, porque quiero contigo

Noelia,"Quiero vivir ese instante
De la sin razÃ³n
Cuando el amor llega
Why nos desnuda

Quiero habitar el latido
De tu seducciÃ³n
Sin el temor de senitr la duda
Presiento que se rompen

Las cadena, dezatando la pasiÃ³n
Tus manos le dan la vida
A ese poema, donde no cabe la pena
Porque manda el corazÃ³n

Toco la luz, cuando al fin me entrego
Sobre tu piel cuando muero por ti
Quiero besa el calor del fuego
Why abrazarte luego, why quedarme alli

Busco el lugar donde nacen los versos de amor
SueÃ±o con el sola en tu cintura
Quiero rozar con mis labios
Tu verso mejor sobre tu piel nace la locura

Tu boca va escribiendo
Lo que siento enmudece la razÃ³n
Quiero sentir eterno este momento
Donde duerme el desaliento
Porque me manda el corazÃ³n

Toco la luz, cuando al fin me entrego
Sobre tu piel cuando muero por ti
Quiero besa el calor del fuego
Why abrazarte luego, why quedarme alli

Noelia,"En mi mente estás como una adicción que se siente dulce, 
Tierna y natural 
Pasas el umbral de mi intimidad, 
Llegas hasta el fondo de cada rincón 
Me tienes aquí como quieres tú, 
Vienes y desplazas a mi soledad, me vas atrapando 

En mi mente estás palpitando a mil 
Y verte a mi lado es mi necesidad 
El dejarte ir o decir adiós es morir en vida, 
Es negarme a mí, que mi libertad se termina en ti 
Y sentirte cerca de nuevo es saber que te estoy amando 

Tú y de nuevo tú, dejas que naufrage justamente en ti 
Tú, mi locura tú, me atas a tu cuerpo no me dejas ir, 
Tú, adherido aquí, entre cada átomo, entre cada célula 
Vives tú, todo lo llenas tú que vienes y pasas como un huracán
Tú, total y pleno tú, te haz vuelto mis fuerza y mi talismán 
Tú, silente y sutil entre cada átomo, entre cada célula vives tú 

Vas creciendo en mí, es inevitable, 
Caigo en tu mirada, soy tan vulnerable 
Desprendes la luz de cada palabra, 
Te has vuelto mi espalda tras cada batalla 
Descubrí el amor al llegar a ti 
Y caigo de nuevo en esta conclusión que te estoy amando 

Tú y de nuevo tú, dejas que naufragué justamente en ti 
Tú, mi locura tú, me atas a tu cuerpo no me dejas ir, 
Tú, adherido aquí, entre cada átomo, entre cada célula 
Vives tú, todo lo llenas tú que vienes y pasas como un huracán
Tú, total y pleno tú, te haz vuelto mis fuerzas y mi talismán 
Tú, silente y sutil entre cada átomo, entre cada célula 

Y es que has hecho de mí lo que tú quieras, lo que sientes, 
Lo que has deseado, 
A tu sexo, a tus ganas, a tu entorno, a tus afectos 
Tú me has moldeado y en todo vives tú 

Entre cada célula 
Vives tú, todo lo llenas tú que vienes y pasas como un huracán
Tú, total y pleno tú, te haz vuelto mis fuerzas y mi talismán 
Tú, silente y sutil entre cada átomo, 
En todo vives tú

Llegando hasta aquí
Tiernos senderos por descubrir
Abro mis brazos

A la nueva madrugada
Que me trae tu olor y tu calor
Voy dibujando tu cara en la luna
En la punta de mis dedos

Te puedo sentir vuelan mis ojos
Mirando las estrellas
Te acercas y aterrizas junto a mi

Amor que se desata
Baila en nuestras almas
Tan profundo como el mar
Llenas el vació ya no siento frio

Haces magia dentro de mí
Me bajas el cielo ya no siento miedo
Siembras flores a mis pies
Es amor como cera derretida

Soy en tus manos cera derretida
Cubierta de besos me haces feliz
Se atraviesan los suspiros
Se entrelazan los latidos
Puedo sentir tu corazón dentro de mí

Amor que se desata
Baila en nuestras almas
Tan profundo como el mar
Llenas el vacío ya no siento frio

Haces magia dentro de mí
Me bajas el cielo ya no siento miedo
Siembras flores a mis pies

Valió la pena una vez más
Esperar por ti derramarme
En ti como cera derretida

Just tumbling while the suns shining
I have no boundaries
Call me a gypsy

Just rambling
What do you do, where do you go
When nowhere feels like home
I'm restless

Am I an angel 
Fallen from heavens grace
Oh it feels like that somedays
And I can't find my place
I guess God just made some of us
To live and die by highway dust
Guess I just have to trust
On the days I'm crawling
That this is my calling

I'm restless
Just rambling
What do you do, where do you go
When nowhere feels like home
I'm restless

Oh, to hold somebody close that cares
Oh, to finally find some roots somewhere

Noémi,"La borsa di una donna pesa come se ci fosse la sua vita dentro 
Tra un libro che non vuole mai finire ed altri trucchi per fermare il tempo 
C’è la sua foto di un anno fa che ha messo via perché non si piaceva 
Ma a riguardarla adesso si accorge che era bella ma non lo capiva 
La borsa di una donna riconosce le sue mani e solo lei può entrare 
Nascosto in una tasca c’è quel viaggio che è una vita che vorrebbe fare 
Milioni di scontrini, l’inutile anestetico del suo dolore 
E stupidi sensi di colpa per quel desiderio di piacere 
E se ci trovasse quei giorni 
Di carezze fra i capelli 
Lei per due minuti soli 
Pagherebbe mille anni 
Anni spesi per ritrovare 
Le cose che qualcuno è riuscito a smarrire 
La voglia di sorridere, di perdonare 
La debolezza di essere ancora 
Come la vogliono gli altri 
La borsa di una donna non si intona quasi mai con quel che sta vivendo 
Nasconde il suo telefono gelosa di qualcuno che la sta chiamando 
Vicino alle sue chiavi la solita ossessione di scordarle ancora 
E in quel disordine apparente la paura di restare sola 
La borsa di una donna che può rivelare i suoi segreti in un momento 
E forse nella tua distrattamente la sua vita c’è rimasta dentro 
Tu che pensavi che ci fosse rimasto un po di spazio per un altro amore 
Invece nella borsa di una donna non c’è posto per dimenticare, dimenticare… 
E vai dove ti porta il cuore, si
Un ritaglio dentro la patente 
Ci sei stata mille volte ma 
Non ci hai mai trovato niente 
Niente che ti aiuti a capire 
Il senso di una sera che non sa meravigliare 
Il senso del tuo ricordare e progettare 
Scordandoti di vivere adesso 
Adesso che si alza un vento che spazza le nuvole 
E che si porta via gli inverni 
La polvere, i dubbi e i miracoli 
Aspettati mille anni 
Anni spesi per ritrovare 
Le cose che qualcuno è riuscito a smarrire 
La voglia di sorridere, di perdonare 
La debolezza di essere ancora 
Come ti vogliono gli altri

She said ""My name's Louise
Now will you take your clothes off please?
I want to take you to the moon and back
So get on your back.""

She made her scream
She made her laugh
She made her dance

Now with her legs spread wider
She needed to have Louise inside her
She said ""I'll never forget the first time 
You kissed me, now I want you to fist me.""

I don't want to do it

The bridge you took it out, the ticket takers suddenly lost count
Sleeping under rays, your teeth crumbling away, say goodbye
To all responsibility, you never wanted it man
Wasting time whenever you get the chance
Which happens to be all the time
Kick back, free meals

Nolan Bruce Allen,"I must say that I don't care 
Hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all

And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you 

No matter how much I pretend
I wish I had you back again
Oh nothing else means half as much as you
Our world just seemed to die the day you said goodbye
And I can't forget no matter what I do

Nolan Bruce Allen,"Oh, Mister fiddling man, please strike up the band
And play that Texas playboy rag
There ain't no rhythm aroun' that rides right on down
Like that Texas Playboy Rag

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag

I see that old Alamo and blue bonnets grow
When I hear that tune you see?
And memories start to roam of my Texas home
When I hear that melody

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag

Oh, mister fiddling man, now you understand
Why I love this melody?
To me it's more than a song
It takes me along back to where I long to be

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas

Nolwenn Leroy,"Il y a des vies pleines de sourires
Pas de couronne juste un avenir
Fait de sentiments, de rires d'enfant
Et de gestes touchants

Il y en a d'autres qui font souffrir
Où l'on interdit le désir
D'aimer simplement, il faut tout le temps
Se cacher d'être vivante

Etre une femme sur la terre
Qu'on soit reine, qu'on soit mère
Ou pieds nus sans prières
On est toujours
On est toujours solitaire
On est toujours solitaire

Le manque d'amour nous rend fragile
On marche souvent sur le même fil
Qu'est-ce qui nous attend, au fil du temps
Quand s'effacent tous nos printemps
On est ce qu'on vit, là-bas ici
Et la même chose nous unit

Etre une femme sur la terre
Qu'on soit reine, qu'on soit mère
Ou pieds nus sans prières
On est toujours, on est toujours solitaire

Etre une femme sur la terre
C'est l'amour ou l'enfer
C'est semer sans savoir
Le début d'une histoire
Le début d'une histoire",Être une Femme
Nolwenn Leroy,"Là, je tourne en rond
Je passe mon temps
A chercher pourquoi ou comment
J´ai fait pour ne pas voir avant
Qu´il suffit de vivre au présent
Le passé est un vieil amant
Le futur un doux prétendant
Mais rien n´est suffisant
Là, je fais ma dernière overdose
Promis, je passe à autre chose
Je fais la paix à ce faux moi
L´égo dont il est, je ne suis pas
Je subis la métamorphose
De l´inévitable névrose
Soudain je me dépose
Immuable est le temps
Semblable à ce chant
Dans un coeur d´enfant
Qui s´en défend
Insondable et pourtant
C´est dans l´ici, le maintenant
Que la vie se prend
Inévitablement
Là, je ne tourne plus
Je parle comme si
Les mots n´étaients plus un défi
Mais l´indicible un vrai récit
N´en déplaise à Descartes aussi
Entre les mots et leur silence
Je trouve le véritable sens
Je suis, donc je pense
Immuable est le temps
Semblable à ce chant

Insondable et pourtant

Que la vie se prend
Inévitablement
Semblable à ce vent
Tout est dans le moment présent
Dispensé du temps

Rien ne nous fait plus mal
Rien ne nous fait plus mal

Nolwenn Leroy,"Jour de rentrée, t-shirt violet 
Des Converse sous l'averse

Cours du lycée ensoleillée
Vingt années écoulées

Sans me méfier j'ai écouté 
Les murmures de ces murs

Les jelly la mode Liberty
Et cet air sucré
Qu'elle a gravé
Dans son cœur
Et sur le bois usé 
J'ai tout retrouvé
En suivant les empreintes
Qu'elle avait laissé
Cet air un peu Dandy qu'elle avait dessiné
Moi je l'ai aimé
Ce fantôme oublié
Cette ombre du passé 
M'a envoûtée

Un jour de Juin elle est partie
Bac en poche nostalgique

La musique les poésies

Mais rien n'efface

Dans les escaliers, les couloirs

Je ne sais rien de son histoire
Juste qu'il s'ennuie
Je l'ai retrouvé 
Il s'était endormi
Je l'ai réveillé

Ce fantôme oublié
M'a envoûtée
Ce fantôme oublié 
M'a envoûtée

Pourtant rien n'a changé
Il me reste en héritage

Nolwenn Leroy,"Mystère
Très loin dans ma galaxie

Qui donne un sens à la vie
Sans le mystère
Où s' en va l' espoir?
Qui peut le dire?
Mystère
En quoi faut-il croire?

A la lueur d' un phare
J' ai vu l' île aux trésors
Dans la terre des Cathares
Je pensais trouver l' or
Mais comment ai-je 
Pu trouver normal
Que le graal ne soit que de métal?

Mystère
Au centre de l' Australie
Mystère
Dans le creux de ma main
De Stonehenge
Aux criques de Santorin
C' est si facile
De se perdre en chemin
Et dans le noir
Mystère 
On peut perdre l' espoir

J' avoue que j' ai cru à tout
Que j' aime ce qui est fou
Dans l' étrange
Rien ne me dérange
Je prends ce qui m' arrange

Et surtout
Le mystère

Simplement, sans effets
Il a juste pris ma main
Son regard, je le sais
A changé mon destin

Nolwenn Leroy,"Dehors le temps file ses heures éphémères
Ainsi vont les jours qui s'en vont dans la nuit

Ainsi les idoles pleurent leur gloire évanouie

Reste encore, oublie le temps, reste encore un peu, comme l'été
Reste encore encore, comme l'enfance
Reste encore un peu

Ainsi s'en vont les fleurs au matin d'automne
Les châteaux de sable qu'emporte la mer
Ainsi vont les rêves que l'amour abandonne
L'instant est fragile ainsi passe un ange mais c'est déjà hier

Reste encore, oublie le temps, reste encore un peu, comme l'été
Reste encore encore, le temps hélas est victorieux

Oh la la rien ne dure que le futur

Ni les mots qui nous agacent, 
Ni les vagues qui nous fracassent contre les jet?es

I would land just where you are after all this lonesome travelling

Do you want to be my one and only love?

So you want to be my friend, so you want to be my lover
With you I do confess
I can't be one without the other
That was hard for me to say
I hope I said it right
Which ever, come what may, you see I need to know tonight

Do you want to be my one and only love?
Do you want to be my one and only love?

Do you want to run away or do you want to stick around?

Sous l'océan enfoui
Dans les bras d'une sirène qui
Te chantera toute la nuit
Te chantera toute la nuit

Je marche sur la grève
Où les bateaux s'échouent
Mais jamais la marée ne ramène
Nos hommes jusqu'à nous
Vieux phare allumé
Tranchant comme une lame
Rappelle que Saint Cast avait
Laissé chez lui sa femme
Qui marchait dans le sable
Juste pour se souvenir
Que derrière les vagues du ciel
Se cachait son sourire

Juste un peu d'eau sur les lèvres
Juste pour me souvenir
De ce dernier baiser amer
Juste avant de t'enfuir
Dis moi juste que tu es ici
Sous l'océan enfoui
Dans les bras d'une sirène qui
Te chantera toute la nuit
Te chantera toute la nuit

L'océan qui t'a enlevé
Envoie son écume à mes pieds
Pourrais-je un jour lui pardonner

Juste un peu d'eau sur les lèvres
Juste pour me souvenir
De ce dernier baiser amer
Juste avant de t'enfuir

Nolwenn Leroy,"Peeling paint on closing doors
The echoing sound of late night calls
The memories are coming back
Of things that I've done wrong

I'm sorry for the freedoms that I've taken
The boundaries that I keep on breaking
Still still trying but I've lost count
Of things that I've done wrong

I was running round and wild crashing into walls
Running so fast I always know but you're never sure
All I've got is this love it might not be enough
It's full of mistakes, full of regrets,
It's limitless,
It's limitless

Underneath my careless ways
Deep inside the truth remains
I cover it up soulfulness
The things that I've done wrong

I recognize my foolish self

Dans la pénombre où nage Ophélia,
Si la lueur des profondeurs t’attire aussi,

Même si les bras froids du tendre océan te saisissent, englacent ton cœur,
Tu me rejoindras,
Ne me sauve pas,
Coule avec moi,
Ne me retiens pas.

Nomeansno,"The sword of truth is just another weapon
Let me live for just one more second
I see a woman, she's holding flowers
A bouquet of roses that are blood red
From a burning building, a man leaps to his death
I stand above these mansions of the dead
Red tombs and above us looms
The tower
I see red
I see a tower against the sky
Beneath a red unblinking eye
Radiowaves curve and cross
I stand below them - lost!
Above me is a black obelisk
And the dangers that I risk
Here gather the ghosts of the mind
That tear my heart and here I find
All the traps that have been set
Everything I would forget, beneath
The tower
I see red
I see a tower against the sky
Beneath a red unblinking eye
Violence is close at hand
You are damned if you do
And if you don't - damned!
A red eye, tyrant full of hate
Glares from the sky, it's captive state
If it should blink or deviate
A thousand worlds would obliterate
I do not move, nor do I speak
Beneath that hard and pitiless peak
Of concrete, steel and antennae wheels
The tower
I see red
I see a tower against the sky
Beneath a red unblinking eye

And those titties, and those titties
In the BODY BAG.
Nobody knows you and nobody wants to.
Willie's poised to dive into flesh,
Something tells me he will leave a mess
In the BODY BAG.
When we kiss my eyes are closed,
My lips are full, I breathe through my nose
In the BODY BAG.
Nobody knows you and nobody wants to.
See the children play in the mud,
Moulding balls of faces and blood
From the BODY BAG.
All praise for corporal flesh;
The smell of love, the smell of death
From the BODY BAG.
Is it a womb or is it a tomb?
A sac of water that's quiet and warm,
A complex shape's beginning to form,
On marble slabs you're flat on your back,
All colours fall into the basic black
Of the BODY BAG.
The creatures of earth are countless and strange,
Open your lips and tell me the name
Of your BODY BAG.
All praise for corporal flesh.

His face a mask of indifference
And it don't care about me or you

Is a crow on a telephone pole
With something to say
And you feel like someone
Has just walked on your grave
That's real love

That precious rain
That falls from above
First a gentle murmur
That calls from the heart
And then a great wind
That will blow you apart
That's real love
That's real love
Like a ghost it will pass right through you
A spirit that lives on
When you are through
And there is nothing that you can do
The wind in the trees
The smell of wet leaves
The rumble of a passing truck
A streak of blood
Please forgive me for what I've done to you
And lord forgive me for what I'm going to do
In the name of...

You try to hide when it looks for you
You never know what it will do
And it don't care about me or you
And there is nothing you can do about
Real love
Anyway, that's what I heard a crow say
But who cares what a crow say anyway?
Especially about something, something
Something so strictly personal
(Real love)
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? That wind on your face
You can get down on your knees and pray
But nothing that you do or say
Will make it go away
(Real love)
It's like thunder, like lightning
The way you love me
The way you love me
The way you love me
It's frightening

Nomeansno,"I recall at the end of it all 
You were on your knees and I was standing tall 
But is my memory deceiving me? 
Was I hanging there while you prayed for me? 
Remember how when the show was done, 
We were dancing and singing and having some fun, 
Then I heard you speak, your voice was bleak--- 
""What we forget we must repeat."" 

Are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are, are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are 
I remember the tricks of the trade, 
Who got left behind and who made the grade, 
And I don't need the pages of some master plan 
To tell me what to do or tell me who I am 
But when all is said and all is done, 
Under the yellow glow of a setting sun, 
It really doesn't matter what you have done, 
You are blind and deaf and dumb 

Are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are, are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are 
I remember an endless space 
And the tolling bells of some holy place 
Is it a dream that comes back to me 
Or a memory that I can barely see? 
Not the voices that haunt my mind 
Of the friends and lovers I have left behind. 

What I see, what comes back to me, 
Is a place I cannot find.

She went away 
Gone and left me

Because I'm sitting on top of the world

Gonna buy me a hacksaw 
Gonna free my heard 
Cut that pain away

Because I'm sitting on top of the world

Where the cops spray their mace
On the kids at the gigs
And they act just like pigs
Beat 'em up, knock 'em down

Stuck in old victoria

All of them wrong
Snap out of it, I tell myself
Stop singing that same old song
The All Clear sounds but the streets are deserted
We sit in shelters with out eyes averted
I searched for your face among those who remained
But they were
All the Same

I wanted it all, now I find I'm lost

You screamed that I had sold you out
That there had to he something I could do
I'm just trying to hold on, I said
But when you were gone what could I hold on to?
This world is tangled deceptive and huge
You make your choices, try to find what's true
You got lost, that's what happened to you
But now
I'm lost too
Lost

To this land I was driven, to the land of the misgiven,
To the land of false starts, to the land of missing parts
I wanted it all, now I find I'm lost
Lost

I go to work everyday
Come home and watch the news
What chance did we have, I think
Just us two?

Missiles with eyes search for all who survive
I couldn't get through at all
Still I called und called und called

Walking away

Across the Porch and over the lawn
And when 1 reach the street
See the dust fly off my feet

One fine day
I will settle up
Empty my account
And give it away
And on that day
Conversation will cease
The arguments and questions
Will fade away

To the edge of town
Iæ??l keep my feet on the ground
But never again will I look down

Iæ??l be on my ...

Maybe I love you all too much
But I can't sleep I can't breath
It's tearing me up, it's tearing me up
It's tearing the heart out of me

All my fears and heartaches
Have melted away

I'm afraid there's nothing left to say

Escape from New York, but I be on some Brooklyn bullshit
I pull clips as fast as I dose chicks with ope tits
Call me Necor, set the coke surviving the sticks
Got my name all in your mouth like your liable to brick
Click me on the tube, chain swinging down to my shoes
Light up the room, african boom, spark it and zoom
Disciple of rock, the type to range rifles and cops
I'm spiteful, fake's get left shaking like Michael J. Fox

(Ill Bill)
?? the age affected me through accupuncture
Gangster and hustler murderer and kidnap a suspect
Wrap her in ??, with Blood red to Crip blue
My shit's to colorful, running through with a hundred goons and maniacs
If a bitch like to suck dick, she a brainiac
Bust up in they mouth piece, see how they react, take it back
Like a instant replay, live in the PJ's, watching my Uncle freebase
Analyzing the angles on a fiend's face
I learn to love my trees lace, the way the PCP taste
The way it make me see things, old school dice spot bills and sheep skins
As I write, yes I'm rocking Iceberg jeans and Tims
Thinking where I'm going be in 2007
Either a house in the Hamptons or a house in Heaven
I be chillin on the beach in the South of Venice
Or merking the President live on Channel 7

My crew's nice, late night at the corners we shooting dice

Tanktops to roofies, groupies acting loosely
Who'll be, in a black drop, with his hat cocked, that can't block
Puff on the stove, get spit in snapshots 
I'm trying to live, feed the kids, drive some whips, handle biz
Own a crib, do my shit, in the streets, that's how it is

If I say Rockstar, I'm talking about rocking the mic
My shit's hot like the rock fiend dropping a pipe

Natalie Portman with a blank tape in my Walkman
Talkin' to myself over instrumental cassettes
The essential steps of having graphic, telepathic mental sex

Mind fuck me or get the hell off of my head case
Suck it up or spit it out, how's that medicated bed taste?
I replaced the sheets, I love ripping off pillow cases
Breaking teeth, shoving lip glass in your little faces

Verbally inept except when subjects are expected

Shit is hot, plumbers unclog my toilet wearing over mitts
Your mommy thinks I'm dope... There's no pretending I'm not
Put hockey sticks in your throat... From the penalty box

Having sex for the sport of it on basketball courts
Maintaining my composure when game night is over
And I don't strike a pose... I strike a poseur, doin' damage

I quickly enter your honey dip, strip ends from your money clip
Joe beats you to death with the shit end of his ugly stick

After they're chased with an axe, half of their face'll collapse
You ain't copped it when non-prophets dropped bass on wax?
Well, I'm your typical hip hop political figure
But I'm not left wing or right wing, I'm the middle finger

And Joe's a sick, demented, jaded mind reader
Who shoots the shit with a nickle-plated 9 mm
When it's time to rock shut the fuck up
I never had writer's block and Joey's never been in a production slump

Ah, forget it. It's actually accepted for rappers to have no ethics
Their albums would benefit if they put in half the effort
I attended candle light vigils for Matthew Sheppard
While you put out another ""fuck you, faggot"" record

I blame my hate mail on typographical errors
Correct the mispellings and then send out thank you notes for the love letters
Accept rejection when I get a return to sender
Reject acceptance when the girl's got an agenda

I've entered this Brave New World of true cowards
Talkin' 'bout, ""No one goes to shows no more. They're too crowded.""
So they stay home and burn shit
Then they say, ""I downloaded your life off the net. Totally worth it.""

African medalions didn't sell platinum albums
That's part of the reason why you think hiphop died
It was here before you were. It'll be here in the future
Life's not a bitch, she's just sick of being personified

That Ain't Right
This household is filled with the half-deads
They've got a mouthfull of pills because they're crack heads
They shout that I'm ill, but they're doubtful of skill

You need to stop, before you find your grave on Long Island

I'm on a mission, dismissing, all that ass kissin'
Before my lyrics burn a hole in your neck, that's what I'm wishing
I'm tapping spines along with your mind
Cause I made you feel good when I rocked your whole 'hood
My soul run deep, like a crack in the street
I keep it real, so you can feel, my true skills

And if you want to rock the spot, you better funk stronger
Keep on, and I'ma have to unleash

I'm knockin' home runs in your ass so what's the matter
A' take your time cause the funky rhyme blow your mind
Strut my stuff cause I'm so tuff, and hard to find
In this maze of amazement I got you cornered
Cut your dimes and your nickels cause you know your money's spent
Meanwhile back at the ranch, take a chance
On this funky head bob that's gonna make you dance
Now even the funky chickens who can make up on the twist came in
But do the chicken with the twist and you can blend
Put your eyes on the prize, we gonna take a ride
So deep in your soul you got tears in your eyes
You blinded by the light, now can you see me
Cause I know that you feel me cause I'm cutting like a knife
With the phife, you flow is so weak I call your punk
You starvin' for some soul, yo, you need to bite a chunk

(verse 1)
It's Saturday night, I'm on the usual standing in the long line
Waiting for my hand to be stamped so I can get mine
It's never me and who, it's always the same crew
Me with a few ends rollin' with a few friends
Fake smiles, yeah we got 'em in the pocket books
For all them frontin' niggas with the rented cars that want to look
Music blastin' in the cars while they passin'
Mini skirts high, hoping we can catch an eye
To get a duplicate number from the last week
You rap outside but inside the club you can't speak
Talkin' bout yeah, you want to keep it real on the phone
But got me on the list just to bone
I don't think so, let me mingle, cause I'm single
Movin' to the next man, with a drink in my hand
It's all about a good time on the weekend
Party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Gin, juice and tonics, stereophonics got me open
Swayin' up the crowd make you want to go wild so high
Can't stop Cause you feel good
When you brushin' thighs catchin' eyes off the guys when you walk by
It's Saturday night, now can you see this
And if it wasn't packed in the club it wouldn't be this good
All the fellas from the hood
Be givin' out your number all night if you could
Relaxing, no pistol packin', now what's this feelin'
Temperature's risin', bass lines through the cieling
Time to get a drink, I think champagne will do
Pass a glass to me, and slide four bottles to my crew
Why I thought you knew, that Nonchalant will make you feel right
It's past midnight, and this funk's tight
It's all about a good time on the weekend
Party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

(chorus)

(verse 3)
>From inside to outside, fellas on the slow ride
Creepin' while they peepin' out the jeep an' damn
Yeah I feel like swayin',
And if you ever fronted all night yeah you know what I'm saying
But oh, what I'm feeling, and you know I'm willing
To give it to you like it is so you know you're dealing
With the true one, big fun, hell I 'fess
If I roll past you're house then you're best to get dressed
While I'm sippin', still trippin' off the last week
Honeyz makin' moves but they still can't catch me
Cause I'm swervin', been in ever curve an'
Checkin' out the scenen so I'm just observing
>From a 8-50, ladies are you wit' me
And if you want's to roll, holler, can you come get me
Cause it ain't no joke when we creepin'
Yeah, just party on the Sunday when you should be sleeping

(verse 1)
Hey baby I can see reflections of a life long dream
The sounds of screams got me wonderin' if my life is worth the means
I see it's only been a while, I can barley feel it's real
But niggas know about the way it goes with me, I know you know the deal
I'm only about makin' mine, brothers takin' time
And if you want to move with me then never try to fake in line
Just know how temporary life can be
And find a way to say you tryin' to live this life with me
Don't call me crazy 'coz I say the things I say when I feel them
'Coz I could never blame you for the times you said you had to feel 'em
Just get your story straight 'coz I can be a saint
Tryin' to put you in the paint, flip the shit, and try to get you back
It's never easy when you dealin' with the realsits
So just relax with us and hope to God your nervous ass don't miss
'Coz you could easily take a turn for the worst
So listen first just remember when it starts to hurt, It's all love...

(chorus)

(verse 2)
The longer you wait to turn around the longer your ass
is gon' be pointing in the same direction, alone with no affection
I got it all if you want it come and get it
If you're thinkin' you're the first, it's all love, baby just go with it
I feel the fire when you're vibin' wit' me
That's justified by the lines if you can find them this week
I'm puttin' it down for all my sisters livin' life like this
Through all the times you thought that one was just a sight like shit
I get this crazy feelin' knowin' that your minds not here
And I can tell the way you stare up at this world you fear
But listen, ain't no need to be afraid fool, you got it made
The ground work is laid, and if you're careful then you won't get played
Just make it easy for yourself, be a soldier for yourself
If not for nothing but the love you get from nothing else
'Coz there's a reason that I'm telling you this
To keep your mind from getting wrapped up in the turns and twists, it's all 
love...

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Look, I don't want it if you can't recline
Find you're timing wit' your best self, look at you just sweatin' mine
Even if we had it all night to do, I couldn't comment on this shit
I hope you might find it too
It's automatic that the way I feel I would if you please me
Never let your mind get you thinking I'm the one who's easy
Just live your life without what you might fear
And get your hands on what you know is lookin' tight right here
It's been a minute now since we've all felt the first impression
But it seems with all the love I showed you haven't learned a single lessson
Is it that you're fellin forced to do
'Coz if it is then we can always try to talk shit through
But look I need a little feedback from your side, young
Just see if you can get with that and let's have some fun with this
Love that you've been hoping for with thoughts alone
Now get yourself up off your ass before your times all gone, it's all 
love...

I see the red lights flashing, damn here they come, what did I do?
I gotta think about what's already done so I'm pulling over
My Range Rover, windows tinted,
Got my hands on the wheel while they flashin lights in here
What you lookin' for is underneath your nose
If you take a look around, while you pattin' down my clothes
But it never fails, you got me payin' bail
While the true bad boys is on the streets raisin' hell
I couldn't see it, I couldn't be it, another dirty cop
How the hell is the crime rate rise gonna stop
Transactions, his-a-action, you keep passin'
Every damn day cause I see it around my way
You think you true, but who's gonna win or lose in this crime game
Niggas on the street, doin' dirt through the time change
You writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

Where the hell are you at when I be callin' ya?
Nickle and dimin' passin the time in a doughnut shop
Why don't your ass be a real cop?
Ain't no stayin' at the borders, check your sons and daughters
The judges don't avenge us cause their ass is out of order
I can't plead my case, but when I don't need you
Your ass is in my face sayin' I see you
But I can see you too, and everything you do
Swinging your night stick, Mr man in blue
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now raise your right hand, and your oath, now what's your motto
To break all the rules that your ass is 'sposed to follow
That right hood on your head is just invisible
And when I dig deep, yeah it all gets political
Cause drug orders come from the borders not from the streets
Ships and planes, check the first class seats
But you still pull me over, put your foot on my neck
Hold me down till I stop breathin', said that I flex
But everything must change
Nothing stays the same, so I'ma see that you have your day
When the shit hits the fan and starts to spray
Find my tape, stick it in and then push play
Yeah, this is your foretold warning
And you know I'm getting practise from the deserts that I'm storming
Yeah, you writin' tickets, I'm writing picket signs
Cause I'm going blind from the lights that shine...

Said I'm lookin' for brains, good looks and skills
Step on up if you think you fit the bill
I know what you look like but looks can be decieving
Let me tap the brain so I can justify the reason
Why I'm callin' your name in my sleep
Why I memorised the tag number on your jeep
I think your skills is something that I want to check
Judging by your looks and your thighs when you flex
I been askin' around tryin' to figure what to do
I know all the names of the fellas in your crew
I ain't playin' no game I'm for real
The cards is on the table so I think you know the deal
I bet you if I got closer you wouldn't doubt it
Everything would be clear and not clouded
But I don't want to get deep yet
I want to make you feel all the love you can get, yeah

I gotta come correct, make it clear, state me claim
I want you to know you're drivin' me insane
Now I don't want to press, but I must confess
That it won't take long 'fore the lifting of the dress
But that's the ways, damn that I know you're fine
Plus I gotta know that you're gonna be mine
But check this out, do you have any kids?
Even though, I gotta say I wouldn't mind if you did
But with the kids comes the ex-girlfriend
And then I want to know, is she still tryin' to blend?
Cause I ain't one to be fightin' in the streets
Tryin' to duck flyin' bottles every time that we meet (from a dumb ass 
bitch)
So tell me when the coast is clear so I can get near
Fell your soft lips when you whisper in my ear
Cause ain't no reason to hide when you ride
I want to scream your name when you holding me tight (in the middle of the 
night) yeah

So what's up? Can we do this or not?
I'm ready to give eveything that I got
I'm waitin' on you to make the next move
But I hope you move quick or you're gonna knock the groove
The green lights flashin ready, set, go!
Everything I think you need, yeah you know
Sexy little buggar, heart strings tugger
Tell me where she at cause I want to thank your mother
I don't give a damn about the rules that I'm breakin'
Step onto your face, straight up with no fakin'
You're killing me softly so I'm pressed for time
Why don't you just say that you're gonna be mine
Cause ain't no other in the world for you lover
And that's what you are, a sexy brown brother
I'm keepin' it real so you know how I feel
Cause I want to be with you and just chill

None More Black,"I'm up here in my bedroom. I'm never coming out.
I've got some rearranging that I've got to figure out.
Maybe it's the computer, maybe it's the TV. Maybe.
Maybe Not. I doubt it. Maybe it's...
I've lost communication between rational and doubt.
Washed out the wave until it led me to the drought.
Now I'm pissed and angry, just staring at the floor.
I need a little more focus. Come on, this is ridiculous.
How something small has become so big.
Come on, I can't consider this.
I can't consider this is how it's gotta be.
I'm counting on the music to get me through the day.
I'm counting on the anti-histamine so I can breathe.
I'm choking on opinion. I'm coughing up conceit.
Ha Ha Ha. Just try to throw that back at me.
Drove twice through the same hour.
Flew right a day. Still it's not enough for me.

All the knowledge and feeling
Of these five deadly sins
That your mother would not
Let you see on TV
So you creep to your basement
And lie about being asleep
All alone where the rats colonize
With their tea
As they sip and they watch
You give into the sound
It just takes you and rips
At your soul
This piper is playing and hypnotizing
A funky ass street tempo
The forces are lining
The ticking the timing is off
You're resisting
But it's all for nothing
The piper is playing his song
Can you hear it It's ripping it's gripping
And pulling your spirit
From your inside chest
Your heart it collapses
From the depths, the pits , the gutters, the shits
That make you scream
Scream, scream, scream, scream,
Scream, scream, scream, scream,
Scream, scream, scream, scream

And even though I wrapped you up in butterflies like evenflow

And in flash he caught a fist
And broke his glasses

From the boom that you listened to
In your room

Is coming harder
Than a booyacka-booyacka

With his eyes the surprise is
Start to fizz
Realize that control is his
The pipe is strong
The trip was long
You hit the bong
To concentrate on the song
And before too long
You're under his control
What the fuck?
The children are listening
The temper is ringing
Constantly clinging
To that hydroponic feeling
If you give him the chance
He'll take your mind away

Their robes and golden tassels
When a hero isn't measured by

I'm just sittin' here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on

Like the desert waiting for the rain
Like a school kid waiting for the spring
I'm just sittin' here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on

My poor heart, it's been so dark
Since you've been gone
After all, you're the one who turns me off
But you're the only one who can turn me back on

My hi-fi is waiting for a new tune
My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes
I'm just sittin' here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on, turn me on",Turn Me On
Norah Jones,"I've tried so hard my dear to show
That you're my every dream 
Yet you're afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scheme 

A memory from your lonesome past 
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart 

Another love before my time 
Made your heart sad an' blue 
And so my heart is paying now
For things, I didn't do 

In anger, unkind words are said
That make the teardrops start 
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart

There was a time when I believed
That you belonged to me 
But now I know your heart is shackled
To a memory 

The more I learn to care for you 
The more we drift apart 
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart, ah, ah","Cold, Cold Heart [Live]"
Norah Jones,"Come away with me in the night
Come away with me
And I will write you a song
 
Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us, with their lies
 
I want to walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come
 
Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me
And I'll never stop loving you
 
And I want to wake up with the rain
Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night

Norah Jones,"Bessie was more than just a friend of mine
We shared the good times and the bad
Many years have since passed me by
I still recall the best thing I ever had

Now I'm going down the road to see Bessie
Oh... To see her soon
I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith
When I get there I'm a wondering what she'll do

Now all the crazy things I had to try
Well I tried them all and then some
If you look you one day you will find out
Where it is that your really coming from

Now I'm going down the road to see Bessie
Oh... To see her soon
I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith
When I get there I'm a wondering what she'll do

Now in my day I've made some foolish moves
But back then I didn't worry about a thing
Now and again I still wonder to myself
Was it the sweet love, or the way that she could sing

I'm just going down the road to see Bessie
Oh... To see her soon
I'm just going down the road to see Bessie Smith
When I get there I'm a wondering what she'll do",Bessie Smith
Norah Jones,"Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat
Comes love, nothing can be done
Comes a fire, then you know just what to do 
Blow a tire, you can get another shoe
Comes love, nothing can be done

Don't try hiding, 'cause there isn't any use
You will start sliding, when your heart turns on the juice
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
Comes love, nothing can be done

That's all brother, if you ever been in love
That's all brother, you know just what I'm speaking of
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you may get another break
Comes love, nothing can be done",Comes Love
Norah Jones,"I was dancin' with my baby to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I just happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one

And I knew just how much I had lost
I have lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing

For them to slow down
So I can make some sense
Of the words that are pouring out
Of your crooked spout

Last night was a record to be broken
It broke all over the kitchen floor

I'm coming back with a rag
To wipe away the haze from the days

'Cause I've been so all alone
And no one will pick up the phone

When you wanted to make a blanket outta me
Oh, I can't lie, I been keeping score
And it's your turn to wring me out
And lay me down to dry

Norah Jones,"He's got a broken voice and a twisted smile
Guess he's been that way now for quite awhile
He's got blood on his shoes and mud on his brim
Did he do it to himself or was it done to him?

Now people say that he don't look well
But all he needs from what I can tell
Is someone to help wash away all the paint
From his purple hands before it gets too late

I saw him stand alone under a broken street light
So sincere, singing silent night
But the trees, they were full and the grass was green
It was the sweetest thing I had ever seen

And we can hear the children playing
Outside in the park

There's bars on the window
And if there were a fire
We'd burn up for sure

If you steal my true love's name
Broke down subway in this city of spires
Tape your picture over his in the frame

We'll imagine we're sleeping revolvers
Shotgun wedding in a strange SoHo
Our chambers hold silvery collars
Gun down werewolves wherever we go
We gun down werewolves wherever we go

Midnight phone calls in the back of a Mustang
Creased white pages torn right from the spine
Kissed my neck with a crooked, cracked fang
You always hoped one day you'd be mine

Threw our fathers on funeral pyres
I'm not sure that we were playing a game
Busted gasket in a field full of liars
No one noticed we set five boroughs aflame
No one noticed we set five boroughs aflame

Young blood
Young bone
Old ghosts
Go home

Band of gold with a diamond implied
You wrote letters that you never sent
I made promises I'll always deny
Now we'll never know what the other meant

Watch is ticking like a heartbeat gone berserk
Lost the chance to wind the key
Roosters are nothing but clucking clockwork
Our fears are only what we tell them to be
Our fears are only what we tell them to be

Drown the last of our matches
Burn the rest of each other
You were strongest when I ached for breath
Through the thick of smoke we'll finally smother

Norah Jones,"Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
I think you only live to see the lights of town.
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
When the lights have lost their glow, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.

I lie awake at night and wait 'til you come in.
You stay a little while and then you're gone again.
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie.
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye,""
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry

When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you.
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
I'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me there,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.","Cry, Cry, Cry [Live]"

Nothing will be funny, honey
And now that everyone's a critic
It's makin' my mascara runny
If we only talk about the ""Heathers""

If we don't get a new situation
For our busted nation, we're lazy

Don't stone her on a talk show, you'll ruin

And when we get there make your play

And my mind is proud but it aches with rage

What a waste, I could've been your friend
Perfect love is like a blossom that fades so quick
When it's blowing up a storm in May

Travel south until your skin turns, woman
Travel south until your skin turns brown
Put a language in your head and get on a train
And then come back to the one you love

Yeah you're great, you're just part, of this lifetime of dreaming
That extends to the heart of this long summer feeling
Quiet night, you see the TV's glowing
Quiet night, you hear the walls are awake

Me and you are getting out of the party crowd
Can I see what's underneath your bed?
Can I stay until the milkman's working?
Can I stay until the cafe awakes?

Do you hate me in the light?
Did you get a fright?

Oh, I'll tell it too

Well, it ain't easy to stay in love
If you can't tell lies,
So I'll just have to take a bow
And say goodbye

I'm loosened up, but it's too late to turn it around
I'm dropping bolts on the ground and I'm coming unwound

Don't you miss the good old days,
When I let you misbehave?
Why you're looking down like that?
I know that you dying to come back,
Please come on back

Well, it ain't easy to stay in love
When you're telling lies,
So I'll just have to take a bow
And say goodbye",Say Goodbye

To your distant valley

And I'd like to know if it's all a show
'Cause you sure look happy
Are you really happy?

Invitation lies

Ticking slowly at your nerves
It's amazing that we made it through
Cause it keeps raining in your heart

Maybe you should go away
If the love we had is meant to stay
Find a place to call your own
No need to roam around the rooms

When the sun goes down
We sleep safe and sound

Time for dealing a different game
One where we don't have to place the blame

And daffodils have their fun 
Where the cares of the day seem to slowly fade away 
And the glow of the evening sun 
Peace, when the day is done 

If I go there real late, let my mind meditate 
On everything to be done 
If I search deep inside, let my conscience be my guide 
Then the answers are sure to come 
Don't have to worry none 

When you find peace of mind, leave your worries behind 
Don't say that it can't be done 
With a new point of view, life's true meaning comes to you 
And the freedom you seek is won

It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy

He was only twenty five
Had an open heart and tender mind
He sang through all the hymns he knew
He was searching for a higher sign
When his water was turned to wine
All the darkness became light

Babies and a patient wife
They just wouldn't have to keep him high
So he gave them up just to fill his cup
Every sip would make him feel alive
No bones in his body were dry

It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy

Now he's finally come around
He's got wrinkles and a crooked friend
He holds back tears thinking of the years
That the bottle had a long time down
So he'd sit have another round
Singing hallelujah 'til it drowns

Som gömdes I mörkrets tid
Hör bjällror klingar vid sjön, 
När lockropen stiger mot skyn
Och där bland blommande rönn, 
Går hjorden så makligt och lugnt ner till byn Öppna dörren, se ängens ljus där älvorna dansat I natt 
De strödde sin skatt, små pärlor av glas, på tuvor och blek konvalj Se solen letar sig fram och daggen blir vågor av guldDet väcker något till liv, som sov I en längtan att sona sin skuldÖppna dörren så går vi ut, det ljusnar och allt är ju härSom vintern har fött, I dag har vi mött det löfte som ljuset bärDet blev ristat I en sten, det tecken vi skulle förståSå bär det inom dig nu och låt det berätta om visdom och frid

När en stjärna faller då ser man att den fanns
För den lyser starkast när den dör på våg till någonstans
Och I skenet väcks en dröm till liv, som har slumrat I min kropp
Jag ser seglet fyllas av en vind mot den dag som andas hopp
För idag när båten glider ut så blir jag fri igen
Det är bara vintern som är slut - nu lever sommaren
Vad är det som väntar, det känns att allt är nytt
Ska jag hitta dig som den do var med allt do har betytt
Vi blir ett med allt, när allt blir ett, liksom stjärnor utan namn
Inte ser do om det fattas en den som förde mig I hamn
För idag när båten glider ut så blir jag fri igen
Det är bara vintern som är slut - nu lever sommaren
Ser do himmelen är blå I dag när molnen blåst förbi
Tag emot mig för nu kommer jag när do ser mig är jag fri

Såg do en bild från en annan värld
Ljuset föll ner som ett hotfullt svärd
Grät do när hästarna föll I sken, skrämda av himmelen som brann
Sprakande kastades natten ner, mitt I din väg - då allt försvann
Jag är här, jag är inte rädd I natt
Det finns sånt som skrämmer mig mer
Jag är här, jag ska ta dig hem I natt
Om do blir evig - vad händer då
När do sett allt - vart ska do gå
Fattar do allt - så blir inget kvar
Frågorna dränks I alla svar
Skräms do av svärdet som bröts itu
Var det en dröm så vaknar do
Ekot blev kvar I en frusen skog, men det blev tyst när vinden dog
Jag är här, jag är inte rädd I natt
Det finns sånt som skrämmer mig mer
Jag är här, jag ska ta dig hem I natt
Kom till mig nu, nu händer det inget mer
Hotet är störst från det do inte ser
