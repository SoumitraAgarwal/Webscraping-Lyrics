Barbara Lea,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)
Barbara Lea,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too? 
Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;
 

",Who's Sorry Now?
Barbara Lea,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Barbara Lea,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Barbara Lea,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Barbara Lea,"How little we know!  
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow from lover to lover!
How little we understand what touches off that tingle,
That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle.
Who cares to define what chemistry this is?
Who cares, with your lips on mine, how ignorant bliss is?
So long as you kiss me, and the world around us shatters,
How little it matters, how little we know.
How little we understand what touches off that tingle,
That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle.
Who cares to define what chemistry this is?
Who cares, with your lips on mine, how ignorant bliss is?
So long as you kiss me, and the world around us shatters,
How little it matters, how little we know.
How little we know.  
How little we know.
",(How Little It Matters) How Little We Know
Barbara Lea,"Blue again
Blue again
And you know darn well
It's you again
You said last night
We were through again
And now, I'm blue again

I'm alone again
Alone again
I'm out around on my own again
There's a mockingbird that's flown again
And I'm alone again

Now baby, though I said I hate you
I love you more every day, babe
Though I aggravate you
All that I'm dying to say
Is that it's new again
You again
And we'll meet today at half past two again
And tonight, we'll fight
Again
And I'll be blue again",Blue Again
Barbara Lea,"Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side
When you're gone, my sugar candy
I get so lonesome, I get blue

But when you're handy
It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone
What can I do?",Fine and Dandy
Barbara Lea,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon
Barbara Lea,"Just a little lovin' 
Early in the mornin' 
Beats a cup of coffee 
For starting off the day 
  
Just a little lovin' 
When the world is yawnin' 
Makes you feel wake up feeling 
Good things are coming your way 
  
This old world 
Wouldn't be half as bad 
It wouldn't be half as sad 
If each and everybody in it had, yeah 
  
Just a little lovin' 
Early in the mornin' 
That little extra somethin' 
To kinda see them through 
  
Nothing turns the day on 
Really gets it dawnin' 
Like a little bit of lovin' 
From some lovin' someone like you 
  
This old world 
Wouldn't be half as bad 
It wouldn't be half as sad 
If each and everybody in it had 
  
Just a little lovin' 
Early in the mornin' 
(Just a little lovin') 
(When the world is yawnin') 
Just a little bit of lovin' ah 
Oh, in the morning 
Nothing turns the day on 
Really gets it dawnin'

It's so good, it's so good

Barbara Lea,"Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Barbara Lea,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Barbara Lea,"Like the folks you meet on
Like to plant my feet on the Brooklyn Bridge
What a lovely view from
Heaven looks at you from the Brooklyn Bridge

I love to listen to the wind through her strings
The song that she sings for the town
I love to look up at the clouds in her hair
She's learned to wear like a crown

If you've been a rover
Journey's end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge
Don't let no one tell you
I've been tryin' to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge

All the folks in Manhattan are sad
'Cause they look at her and wish they had
The good old Brooklyn Bridge

If you've been a rover
Journey's end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge
Don't let no one tell you
I've been tryin' to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge

You'll miss her most when you roam
'Cause you'll think of her and think of home
The good old Brooklyn Bridge",Brooklyn Bridge
Barbara Lea,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me
Barbara Lea,"It was a most romantic interlude
And we were in a most romantic mood
Our hearts were lost in reverie
I only knew you were close to me
 
The music stopped, but we were still dancing
Which goes to show that music has charms
The lights were low so we kept on dancing
I felt the glow of you in my arms
The band had left the stand and we were in heaven
Dancing on a cloud 'way off in the blue
The music stopped and people were glancing
But we went on dancin' for we didn't know
Because the lights were low
And we were in love
 
The music stopped but we were still dancing
Which goes to show that music has charms
The lights were low so we kept on dancing
I felt the glow of you in my arms
The band had left the stand and we were in heaven
Dancing on a cloud 'way off in the blue
The music stopped and people were glancing
But we went on dancin' for we didn't know
Because the lights were low
And we were in love",The Music Stopped
Barbara Lea,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Barbara Lea,"Whadda they do on a rainy night in Rio?
Whadda they do when there is no starry sky?
Where do they go when they can't go for a walk?
Do they sit at home and talk,
Or do they sit and sigh, ""Aye Aye!""?

Where do they woo on a rainy night in Rio?
How can a guy meet a sweetheart by the sea?
Maybe the girl wants a tender kiss, and yet,
How tender can you get
When you're beneath a wet palm tree?

Whadda they do in Mississippi
When skies are drippy?
And whadda they do when it's murky
In Alberquerque?
And whadda they do in Old Arkoona
When the moon above ain't bright?
Well, that's what they do in Rio
On a rainy night!

But whadda they do when skies are dreary
Along Lake erie?
And whadda they do in St Louis
When nights are dewy?
And whadda they do in Colorado
When a shadow dims the light?
Well, that's what they do in Rio
On a rainy night!

Yes, that's what they do in Rio
On a rainy night!",A Rainy Night in Rio
Barbara Lea,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended
Barbara Lea,"Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down
Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown

Seven to midnight I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes

Sometimes I think I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, big boy, ten cents a dance!",Ten Cents a Dance
Barbara Lea,"I try to keep  you out of my heart
But somehow I find
Trying to keep you out of my heart
I'm out of my mind
I tell myself ""I'm through with you
And I'll having nothing more to do with you""
I stay away, but every day
I'm just foolin myself

Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it isn't so
I'm just foolin myself

And every time I pass
And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say
""How do you do, you fool
You're trowing your life away""
I'm acting gay
I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend

And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars

Barbara Lea,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

Barbara Mandrell,"Tonight's my lucky night I know
He talked to me
To tell me he's been thinking of me
And all this time he's changed his mind
Oh, he told me so
That's how I know he's gonna love me

Tonight's the night
We'll turn out the light
And love again
Like we did back then
And we'll start all over
Tonight

Tonight's my lucky night I'm sure
He's at my door
I've waited for this chance to hold him
And how I see he's needed me
Oh, imagine that
He's coming back
Coming back to live forever

Tonight's the night
We'll turn out the light
And love again

And we'll start all over

Barbara Mandrell,"Hello?
You don't know who this is but...
The reason I'm calling you is because...
I was going through my man's pockets this morning...
And I just happened to find your name and number...
So woman to woman, I don't think it's wrong to call
Now, I don't know how you're gonna take this...
You might even hang up the phone...
But, you see, it really doesn't make any difference...
And it's only fair that I let you know...
That ""that man"" you've been seeing...
He's mine...and I love him...
So woman to woman I think you'll understand

Now if you were in my shoes
Wouldn't you have done the same thing too?

I've just got to make you see
Woman to woman
That you can't take him from me
Woman to woman
I just can't step aside
And let you take what is rightfully mine
Chorus:
Woman to woman
Right or wrong
I ain't gonna let you break up my happy home
I hope you understand...
I love that man...
And he's mine

But no matter how he tries it ain't the same thing
'Cause he'll never ever take the place of you
So don't try to see me when you come back to town
I finally found myself up straight so please don't drag me down

I'll be good to him I'll make him happy I owe him so much what else can I do

And she don't mind if I lay out all night

And you said hallelujah this woman sure gets to ya
I fin'lly found peace of mind
A singing hallelujah you don't know what good it'll do ya
Playin' around with love'll do it everytime

But then one day she felt like movin' on 
One goodbye and you were all alone
And it's funny but I could almost hear the sound
When your whole world came tumblin' to the ground

And I said hallelujah that woman socked it to ya
Just walked away and blew your mind
A singing hallelujah you've got what's comin' ya
Playin' around with love'll do it everytime

But it seems that I'm not too satisfied
With the brand new love that's walking by my side

Barbara Mandrell,"Aren't we the same two people
Who took those vows that mean nothing now
Didn't we sit at this table as husband and wife
Now we're on opposite sides
Is this the way love ends
With paper and pen

[Chorus]
It's all there in black and white
All the words that separate our lives
It's all there, wrong or right
But love falls between the lines
It's something you can't write
In black and white

Can we forget all the good times
And never look back, it is as easy as that
Can we be sure that it's finished
With tears in our eyes, can we say that we tried
It's all come down to this
Is there something that we missed

I've told my friends, you've told yours
But opening and closing doors swing both ways
Is it too late

Barbara Mandrell,"I don't want to tie you down
With some lines spoken in sorrow
With some hopes pinned on tomorrow
You've got your bedroll and your guitar
And there you are
Ready to be alone, rolling stone

I don't want the phone to ring
I can't talk when I'm crying
Your voice shakes when you're lying
Saddle the wind and ride for the sun
The way you run
You'll never have a home, rolling stone

But if you don't love what you've found
Just remember the world is round
And whatever rolls away
Can always roll back home some day

When you sleep beneath the sky
With your coat making your pillow
As the wind cries on the willows
And your bed holds no tenderness
Remember this
You made it on your own, rolling stone, roll on",Rolling Stone
Barbara Mandrell,"They say that times are getting harder
Well that's easy to say
And this crazy world can't go much farther
It's spinning faster each day
But not everything has changed

[Chorus]
Kids still get restless on rainy days
Lilacs still fill the air in spring
Love's still the only word that I can use in telling you
The way I feel and I'll love you always
Some things never change

Seems like we're always in a hurry getting no where fast
We're all wrapped up in work and worry but all of that will pass
It's the simple things that last

[Chorus]

After all that we've been through
Love is still the same",Some Things Never Change
Barbara Mandrell,"She was my friend when I needed a friend
He was a man who said our love would never end
When things went wrong she'd tell us both to try again
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for

And there were times when she was feeling down
One of us would always come around
And try to share some other happiness we found
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for

I suppose I should have seen what was happening to me
And I guess I should have known there wasn't love enough for three
And now there's only me

So I'm alone like I never thought I'd be
I trusted her just as far as I could see
And she stole his love away from me
If that's what friends are for
I don't need them anymore
",That's What Friends Are For
Barbara Mandrell,"I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back, I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams

",I'll Be Home for Christmas
Barbara Mandrell,"Once again the windows shine with pretty lights
Once again our loved ones gather at our side
Busy crowds of strangers greet each other with a smile
There's Christmas in the eyes of every child

Once again the presents are resting by the tree
Once again we worship the One who came for you and me
I hear choirs of voices as they're singing out His name
Again we tell the story of how the Christ Child came

One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Savior's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be
Like Christmas Eve
When love's pure light is shining everywhere, one night a year

Once again around the world heads are bowed in prayer
Once again the promise of peace is in the air
But soon will come the morning and the feeling will be past
And I can't help but wonder why the feeling only lasts

One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Savior's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be
Like Christmas Eve
When love's pure light is shining everywhere, one night a year

One night a year we believe in peace on earth
One night a year we praise our Savior's birth
I wish every night the whole year through could be
Like Christmas Eve
When love's pure light is shining everywhere, one night a year

One night a year

And somewhere near a steeple

Barbara Mandrell,"WHERE ARE THE PIECES OF MY HEART

(Hugh Prestwood)

You took your suitcase and your toothbrush
And walked out in your walking shoes
You left behind this little letter breaking me the news
But now some things of mine are missing
Some things that I could dearly use
And since the evidence points to you
I must accuse

I don't mean to be unfriendly
All I want is to be fair
I'll be more than glad to share
But you gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart

It was bad enough to break it
After all that we've been through
But then to go on and take it
Was unkind of you
Every night I feel so empty
This pain is more than I can bear
Even if you do not care
You just gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart

It's not the first time it's been broken
It's been dropped a time or two
I got to piece it together
And then get over you
Where even if you do not care
You just gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart

Where even if you do not care
You just gotta tell me where
Are the pieces of my heart

What you see ain't nothin' new

Barbara Mandrell,"Standing room only
You must think my bed's a bus stop
By the way you come and go
I ain't seen you with the lights on
Two nights in a row
So pack your rusty razor
And don't bother with goodbye
Your cup runneth open
But mine is always dry

But I can't stand no more
Standing room only
Outside my door

Don't help me set the table
Cause now there's one less place
I won't lay mama's silver
For a man who won't say grace
If home is where the heart is
Then your home's on the street
Me, I'll read a good book
Turn out the lights and go to sleep

When my eyes are closed in death with my Jesus I'll be at rest

If they sow no seeds of kindness make the thorns in my path grow

Barbara Montgomery,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last

Barbara Montgomery,"If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets in this rhyme
Like the galaxies in time 
If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells 
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst 
So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child 
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst 
So
If it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone",If It's Magic

Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Barbara Morrison,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Why should we spend money

Barbara Morrison,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Barbara Rosene,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true

Barbara Rosene,"Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long

Is it a crime

If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you.

Because I'm nobody's baby now

Barbara Rosene,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended

How much to discover
What chemical forces flow from lover to lover!
How little we understand what touches off that tingle,
That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle.

Who cares, with your lips on mine, how ignorant bliss is?
So long as you kiss me, and the world around us shatters,

Ooh, deep inside me, and it hurts so bad.

Before you won my heart (baby, baby)
You were a perfect guy.
But now that you got me,
You wanna leave me behind (baby, baby).
Ooh, baby.

Baby, baby, baby don't leave me.
Ooh, please don't leave me all by myself (baby, baby).

Barbara Weathers,"Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all of your hope is gone,
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion,
And your world around is crumblin' down;  
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach on out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you.
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through.
I'll be there to always see you through.
 
When you feel lost and about to give up 
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold, 
And you're drifting out all on your own, 
And you need a hand to hold:
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you, 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you.
I'll be there to love and comfort you.
 
I can tell the way you hang your head,
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need, 
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me.","Reach Out, I LL Be There"

Y al brotar la aurora sus lindos colores matizan de encanto mi nido de amores
Al despertar a mi linda guajirita doy un beso en su boquita que adoro

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra la la la la

Long ago there were three pigs
Little handsome piggy wigs
For the big, bad the very big, very bad wolf
They did not give three figs

Number one was very gay
And he built his house with hay
With a hey hey toot he blew on his flute
And he played around all day

Now number two was fond of jigs
And so he built his house with twigs
Hey, diddle diddle he played on his fiddle
And danced with lady pigs

Number three said, ""Nix on tricks
I shall build my house with bricks""
He had no chance to sing or dance
'Cause work and play don't mix

Ha, ha, ha, the two little do little pigs
Just winked and laughed ah, woo

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra la la la la

Came the day when fate did frown
And a wolf blew into town
With a gruff huff puff, he puffed just enough
And the hay house fell right down

One and two were scared to death
Of the big bad wolf's breath
By the hair of your chinny chin I'll blow you in
And the twig house answered yes

No one left but number three
To save that piglet family
So when they knocked, he fast unlocked
And said come in with me

Now they all were safe inside
But the bricks hurt wolf's pride
So, he slid down the chimney and oh, by Jiminey
In a fire he was fried

Oh, oh, oh, the three little free little pigs
Just winked and laughed, ah, woo

Barbra Streisand,"How does the wine taste?
Does it stain your lips?
What is the fruit-like?
Just beyond my finger tips?

Just out of reach, I see so much
I cannot taste and mustn't touch
Tied to my little world
My safe little world

What would it be like
If I broke the string?
Would it be lovely
And a little frightening?

There is so much I've never understood
How does the wine taste? Is it good?

How does the wine taste?
Does it make you glow?
How does the wine taste?
How does the wine taste?
How does the wine taste?
I think I know
",How Does the Wine Taste?
Barbra Streisand,"Here is a verse unlike any verse
To a song that you've never heard
It deals with the subject that I and the authors agree
Is at best absurd
Love is a bore
Love is a ball game without a score
Love is a sail boat without a sail
The lock on the candy store
Asparagus without the hollandaise
Plus all the petty laughs
In Tennessee Williams' plays
I used to love it but now it's a drag
Love is a flag pole without a flag
Love is the mailman without the mail
A comic without a gag
A soap-opera plot and lots lots more
But mainly I mean love is a bore

It's I'll-call-you-tomorrow
It's a phone that never rings
It's a sack full of sorrow
Or a ride on angel's wings
So just remember the next time you saw
Love is an exit without a door
But if you're in love you'll ignore
All the things that I've said here before

And you'll pray that your love
Whatever he does
Will come back and be
The bore that he was
Before!",Love Is a Bore
Barbra Streisand,"He is pleased with me!
My Lord and Master
Declares that he's pleased with me,

What has he seen?
Something young
Soft and slim,
Painted cheek,
Tap'ring limb,
Smiling lips
All for him,
Eyes that shine
Just for him,
So he thinks

Just for him!
Though the man may be
My Lord and Master,
Though he may study me
As hard as he can,

He'll never see
He'll never know

He'll never know
I love another man.",My Lord and Master

How can I be thankful
When they start to thank the Lord,

Barbra Streisand,"You must remember this,
A kiss is just a kiss,
A sigh is just a sigh,

And when two lovers woo,
They still say ""i love you,""
On that you can rely,

No matter what the future brings,
As time goes by.

Moonlight and love songs,
Never out of date,
Hearts full of passion,
Jealousy and hate,
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate,

It's a picture of me after being with you...

Down to some big store and there to buy a honey
And a trophy for myself

To show the world I've won

Alone on the shelf?
Ain't it a shame,
But no one's to blame but myself.

Which way is clear
When you've lost your way
Year after year?

Do I keep falling in love for just a kick of it?
Staggering through the thin and thick of it,
Hating each old, tired trick of it,
Know what I am,
I'm good and sick of it!

Where em I going?
Why do I care?
Run where it's foul,
Run where it's fair,
No matter where I run I meet myself there.

Looking inside me, what do I see?
Anger and hope and doubt,
What em I all about?
And where am I going?
Tell me why do I care?

No matter where I run I meet myself there
Looking inside me, what do I see?

Barbra Streisand,"Goodbye, no use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends

Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say

I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this, i wish you love!
And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health, and more than wealth, i wish you love!

My breaking heart and i agree
That you and i could never ever be
So with my best, my very best, i set you free!
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, but most of all

When snowflakes fall, i wish you wealth
I wish you health, i wish you love!",Clopin Clopant

Avec ma voix autour de quelques mots,
J'ai tant joué avec ton nom,

Au premier jour de mon premier amour,
Chaque seconde avait ton nom,
Et j'ai trouvé cette chanson.

Barbra Streisand,"Love and learn, they say we love and learn
Learn the facts of love
Each in his turn
Learn that love will soothe and love will burn
It will hurl you to heaven and then down again
Give you hope, give you heartbreak
Love and learn like me that love is strange
Sweet and bitter ride
That one and nothing can change it
Love and learn like me that love is strange
It will warm you in winter and chill in spring
Invade your nights then one day be gone
Love and learn so your heart may wiser be
Love and learn that love's mad, gay and sad, good and bad
Nothing like you've had but you can't
Heaven it seems
You give your love to your man
All the love that you can
Never do you dream
He will take it and go one day
Now you know all there is to know about
There you go
Wise to love but still without it
Love and learn that you learn
Not a thing at all",Love and Learn
Barbra Streisand,"Once upon a summertime if you recall
We stopped beside then in a flower stall
A bunch of bright forget-me-nots
Was all I let you buy me

Once upon a summertime
Just like today
We laughed the happy afternoon away
And stole a kiss in every street caf?
You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree
I was as proud as any girl could be
As if the major had offered me the key,
The key to Paris

Now another wintertime has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chime
You loved me once upon a summertime

Tous les lilas, tous les lilas de mai
N'en finiront, n'en finiront jamais
De faire la f'te du coeur
Des jeunes qui s'aiment
S'aiment, s'aiment

And say what I'm longing to hear
Tender words of love
Repeat them again
I implore you speak to me of love
Whisper these words to me, dear
I adore you,
I want to hear, to hear those words that are so dear,
I want to hear you say I love you
By all the little stars above you
Your voice is like a fun caress
It thrills me till I must confess
I long to hear the voice that brings me
Such thrilling love and happiness

Barbra Streisand,"If a girl isn't pretty
Like a Miss Atlantic City
All she gets in life is pity
And a pat

Kindly name a star who hasn't
Won a contest or a pageant
If she hasn't she just never
Gets to bat

She must shine in every detail
Like a ring, you're buying retail
Be a standard size that
Fits a standard dress

When a girl's incidentals
Are no bigger than two lentils
Then to me it doesn't spell
Success

Frumpy faces that could cause ya
To have temporary nausea
Do I have to hear a lecture
Such as that?

Is a nose with deviation
Such a crime against the nation?
Should I throw her into jail
Or drown the cat?

So she looks a bit off balance
She possesses golden talents
Or is that a pill too bitter
To digest?

Oh, she's got very nice deportment, hmm
But when they see that at Ortmund's
From the gallery they'll be
Throwing fruit

Barbra Streisand,"Act II opens with the newly wed Fanny and Nick
Arriving at their home in Long Island. Fanny's
Friends have prepared a surprise party for them.
Ziegfeld is there, hoping Fanny will be in his new
Show; he's even hired her friend Eddie as dance
Director. Fanny's Ziegfeld friends ask her what
It's like be married and she replies:
[Fanny:]
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
Bow when I go by.
I'm a corporation now,
Not me, myself and I.
Oh how that marriage license works
On chambermaids and hotel clerks.
The honeymoon was such delight
That we got married that same night.
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
Still in bed at noon,
Racking my brain deciding
Between orange juice and prune.
Nick says nothing is too good for me,
And who am I not to agree?
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady, that's me!
[All:]
She's Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
[Fanny:]
Meet a mortgagee,
[All:]
The owner of an icebox
[Fanny:]
With a ten-year guarantee.
Oh, sit me in the softest seat,
Quick, a cushion for my feet.
Do for me, buy for me, lift me, carry me,
Finally got a guy to marry me!
I do my nails,
Read up on sales,
All day the records play.
Then he comes home, I tell him
Oy--what a day I had today!
I swear I'll do my wifely job,
Just sit at home--become a slob!
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady, that's me!
[All:]
She's Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
[Boys:]
Sadie, you did the trick.
[Fanny:]
It's nothing!
[Girls:]
Not ev'ry girl can get herself
A guy who looks like Nick.
[Fanny:]
Wait, to tell the truth, it hurt my pride--
The groom was prettier than the bride.

Husband, house, a mortgage, a baby,

Shoot the swans?
These lovelies?

Can't you see when you look on me
What a lovely creature is a swan

I'm all over fluffy white
I wouldn't peck at you or bite
And have tiny twinkle toes to dance upon

Oh, was that good?

So you just gotta have a swan
Or you're out of luck

Little signs that say ""keep off the grass""
Did you ever stop and ask yourself why?

Little squares where lovers love to go
Disappear so parking lots can grow
Why?

What's disturbed when you disturb the peace
Pets and children are prohibited

Why? ask yourself why?

Bullets fly like popcorn on the screen
Recommended wholesome nice and clean
Making love's the thing that can't be seen
Why? 

Let your hair down just an inch or two
Let your skin be red or green or blue
They invent a special name for you
Why? 

On a clear day oh say can you see
What remains of mountain's scenery
Catch a glimpse of all the scenery,  sky,
Beautiful sky ..as shiny as a penny

Put a sign right next to it that says ""why?""",Ask Yourself Why

When they knew you had to wear that coat forever

They fixed your legs so you could not run 
And then they put you in boxes and sold you

And they made you lie in boxes all together

I wanted to send it

Barbra Streisand,"It's a God-awful small affair 
To the girl with the mousy hair

To the seat with the clearest view 
And she's hooked to the silver screen

Now the workers have struck for fame 
'Cause Lennon's on sale again

Barbra Streisand,"Love in the afternoon
Love in the afternoon

He walked right up and told me
That he liked my style
I noticed something different
In the way he smiled

He said, ""You're quite a lady
And I know a place that's shady
Would you care to come
And lie with me awhile?""

And deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And found that sweet old river

And he showed me the way
To find love in the afternoon

I knew he was a stranger
But I didn't care
We had something in common
But it wasn't clear

He said that life's a lover
When you love and like no other
Don't you think it's time
For you to get your share?

And deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And found that sweet old river

And he showed me the way
To find love in the afternoon

I never could remember
Or recall his name
But I hang on to that memory
Just the same

I know it makes me crazy
It makes my head all hazy
To think about the way
He played that game

'Cause deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And found that sweet old river

And he showed me the way
To find love in the afternoon

Yes, deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And found that sweet old river

And he showed me the way to find
Showed me and showed me
And showed me the way
To find love in the afternoon

Barbra Streisand,"Church bells were ringing and I heard angels singing
On the day that I said ""I do""
He gave me a kiss and I thought wedded bliss
Was a mother-to be's dream come true
The he carried me across the threshold and I heard the front door slam
Cabin fever had just began
Pack his lunch at six-thirty but do not disturb him
Cause he wants to sleep in till eight
If I don't remind him it's time to get up
He tells me it's my fault he's late
Now I clean up the kitchen till noontime
And then I vacuum till a quarter to three
Cabin fever is killing me

At seven he calls up and says ""don't cook supper""
When he knows that it's already done
My kids climb the curtains and I climb the walls
He's with the boys having fun
Let me try to get a breath of fresh air
And all I ever get's the third degree, I got to leave here
Cabin fever's killing me
Cabin fever's killing me
I gotta leave here

Barbra Streisand,"Self-contained and self-content
No promises to keep
I've got things so together
That I just can't fall asleep
Walked the night and drank the moon
Got home at half-past four,
And I knew that no-one marked my time
As I unlocked my door.
It's really lovely to discover
That you like to be alone
Not to owe your man an answer
When he gets you on the phone
Not to share a pair of porkchops
When you crave champagne and cheese
And your aim becomes to please yourself
And not to aim to please
Oh they sold me when they told me
Two can live as cheap as one
But I'm learning twice you're earning
Doesn't mean it's twice the fun
If you spend your each dime and all your time
On someone else's schemes
I'm not needy but I'm greedy
And I live my deepest dreams
Take an hour in the shower
Use the water while it's hot
In the tub a hand to scrub my back
Is all I haven't got.

Self-aware with self-esteem
Is selfishness a crime?
I take the day for quite a ride
And I take my own sweet time
Time to spare and time to share
And grateful I would be
If just one damn man would share the need
To be alone with me.

Put it down and I think about you
I make some coffee and I think about you
Wash up the cup and I think about you
Wind the clock and I think about you
Turn on the light and I think about you
When I punch the pillow and I think about you

Thinking something might be saved.
Growing tired of broken promises
And dreams you never made.

And I wanted to be more than just a friend,
Not knowing I would hurt, so, in the end.
So I swore I'd never call you home again.

Took time to see through all the glitter
That you made.
I was blinded by your fire light
And swept myself away.

And I guess I couldn't bring myself to see
You had taken all the very best of me.
So I'm leaving while there's something left of me.
Just like a child, I keep running back for more.

You know I thought I knew the answers,
'Cause I've been hurt before,
And one more time around won't break me.
You will never see that side of me,
No, no, no, no,
I don't break easily.

I told my service to pick up all my calls,
And I've taken down our photographs
That lined our bedroom walls.
And the outside door no longer has your name.
All your clothes are gone.

My welcome mat's been changed,
But the key's still there,
And I've left the door unchained.
Just like a child, I keep running back for more.

Please, stay away, stay away

Stay away out of my dreams
Stay away from my nights
You're there in the darkness
So I need no other lights
I don't want no whisky
'Cause it brings back the pain
Makes me call you at midnight
And beg you to come back again

Do me a favor, for god's sake
Please, stay away, stay away

'Cause time is just too short
To waste it on regrets
They say it heals a broken heart
That's waiting to forget
Oh, stay away, leave me alone

Like you hurt me before

But if you should need me
Don't think it's all right

In the middle of some lonely night

I' m afraid I might say

Remembering what happened a moment ago
Like after the rain, when the wind breezes a sigh
While it's resting on pillows of sky
Deep in your arms, it's peaceful and warm
Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm
In a moment or two, we can hear the stars coming through
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you

After the rain, the birds want to fly
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see
Are their loving reflections of me
After a while, you touch me and then
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again

I could stay for hours like this
Though i don't know just what magic the raindrops contain
I know that everything's wonderful after the rain",After the Rain

With one wish I can say,
Kiss me in the rain, and make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
Kiss me in the rain, and make me feel like a child again
With the feeling that I get,
I don't even mind if we get wet

Have I changed so much from who I used to be?

We talk, but there's so much that we don't say

But in Niagara, you promised me the moon
And when I fell I couldn't tell it happened all to soon
Up in Niagara, we were foolish then

She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

All alone in the moonlight
I can smile happy your days (I can dream of the old days)
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The still cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me,
You'll understand what happiness is

Where is it written
What is it I was meant to be?
That I can't dare
It all began the day I found
That from my window I could only see
A piece of sky
I stepped outside and looked around
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high
The time had come

If you've never flown at all
Though it's safer to stay on the ground
Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?

Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?

The more I learn, the more I realize
The less I know

And listen to the lessons of the leaves.
I can enter rooms

Wrapped in the shawl that learning weaves.

No wave can wash away;
No wind can blow away,

How did I ever let it get this far?

Am I woman or a man?
Am I a devil or a demon?

I ask too many questions.
He said a soul can get perplexed.
I can't believe what happens next!
Papa was right!
It seems this little game I play
Becomes more risky every day!
Tomorrow night; tomorrow night
Under the canopy,
I'll stand with her tomorrow night,
And place a ring upon her hand.
With her all dressed in white,
Tomorrow night.
I don't know how this came about,
But I'll be wed without a doubt.
Oh, my God, I've got to get out!
Look at this!  The way one lie
Begets another.
Somebody wake me up and say
It's all a dream!
(Look at this!)
Look how easily I fool them;
They may have eyes, but they don't see.
They never really look at me.
People are blind!
How else would everyone believe me?
It might be interesting to know
Just how much further I can go.
Tomorrow night; tomorrow night
I can't believe what I'll presume to be,
Tomorrow night.
I'm not the bride, but I'm the groom to be,
Tomorrow night.
And that's a monumental trick;
I'd better think of something quick.
(Oh, my God, I'm feeling sick!)
I could run away.
I could leave without a trace.
Go anywhere, or any place
Where no one knows my face.
As a woman or a man?
I don't know; just so I can
Run away, run away!
I'd be free; I'd be rid of all of this,
But there's someone I would miss,
And being near him is what this is all about!
So running away is out!
Papa, dear, you dreamed of dancing
At my wedding,
But something tells me that I'm right;
You wouldn't want to dance tonight!
Isn't this a strangely logical solution?
Things may not be as they appear,
But the advantages are clear:
He loves her; she loves him.
He likes me; I like her,
And I've reasons to think she likes me.
She keeps him; he keeps her.
I keep things as they were.
It's a perfect arrangement for three!
Who'd have ever predicted
The moment would come
When I'd find myself grateful?
They've kept women dumb!
She's an innocent maiden,
But, then, so am I!
That's why it's possible; I could get by.
Look, I've seen the impossible happen before,
So maybe, God willing, it'll happen once more.
For I feel like a train on a perilous track,
With no way to stop, and no way to go back.
Like a snowball that's gathering speed down a hill,
Going faster, and faster, and faster, until

Across the mountains and the seas
Beyond the make-believe of any fairy tale
Why have the thirst if not to drink the wine

Of things that can't be mine

Yet I know you really loved me 
So it's hard to let go like I should 
Let's forget the bad 
Remember the good 
Cause you loved me the best you could 

But I need more 
I need someone to hold me tonight 
Someone there when I turn out the light 
Just to be here with me 
I need more, I need more than you somehow 
I need more than your time will allow

We both loved the best we could",Best I Could
Barbra Streisand,"Face in the mirror looks the same every morning 
I keep looking for a change 
Sometimes I wonder am I standing still in time 
Tired of doing everything the same old way 
Tired of playing all the games that people play

I need the emotion 
I need to laugh 
Sometimes I need to cry 
I need the emotion 
I need to love so hard 
I don't know what to do 
And baby, I need you 
Oh 

Sometimes I need a good old fashioned fight 
It doesn't matter If I'm wrong or right 
Please don't worry about it 
You know how much I care 
Sometimes I need to make love all day long 
Sometimes I need to hold you in my arms

It doesn't matter where 
As long as you're there cause I need

Sometimes I need to cry 
I need the emotion 
I need to love so hard 
I don't know what to do 
And baby , I need you
Oh 

Sometimes I need to tear the whole thing down 
Sometimes I need to turn it all around 
When I put it back together I'll be calling out to you 
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me? 
Can you hear me? 

I need the emotion 
I need to laugh sometimes I need to cry

Barbra Streisand,"When I dream
In a world that has no time
In a world that pays no mind
To a heart such as mine
I can be

Out along the stars somewhere
All alone without a care
I can be anything
When I dream
By myself

All I want to do is find what
It's all about
I'm reaching out

Knowing that there must be more
I imagine when I dream
What I've never known
Or felt before

I can turn reality
Into anything I see
All at once I can be
On the sky or on the ground
Of the earth but not earthbound
I can be anything
When I dream

Thinking back it seems I've
Spent my life
Sacrificing what I felt inside
Never thought I could have in my life
The dreams I have denied
When I dream

I believe there's someone there
Someone else with dreams to share
Someone willing to care

He could be
Out among the stars somewhere
Someone gentle, someone fair
He could be anything

When I dream
When I dream
There's no posibility
That I can't begin to see
There's no voice telling me
Not to be

Out among the stars somewhere
Feeling free, I'm free to dare
And to be anything
When I dream

For beyond the fantasy
And the harsh reality
Suddenly I can see

Barbra Streisand,"Be nice, girl!
You have to pay a price, girl!
They like to give advice, girl!
Don't think about it twice, girl!
It's time to get to work!
Art isn't easy
Even when you're hot
Advancing art is easy
Financing it is not
A vision's just a vision if it's only in your head
If no one gets to hear it, it's as good as dead
It has to come to life
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, only way to make a work of art
Every moment makes a contribution
Every little detail plays a part
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
Putting it together, that's what counts

Ounce by ounce, putting in together
Small amounts, adding up to make a work of art
First of all you need a good foundation
Otherwise it's risky from the start
Takes a little cocktail conversation
But without the proper preparation
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Link by link, making the connections, yes we do!
Drink by drink, taking every comment as it comes
Learning how to play the politician
Like you play piano, bass and drums
Otherwise you'll find your composition
Isn't gonna get much exhibition
Art isn't easy
Every minor detail is a major decision
Have to keep things in scale
Have to hold to your vision
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it gets the funds for your foundation
Every time I start to feel defensive
I remember vinyl is expensive!
Maybe one!
Dot by dot, building up the image
Shot by shot, keeping at a distance doesn't pay
Still if you remember your objective
Not give all your privacy away
A little bit of hype can be effective
As long as you can keep it in perspective
Even when you get some recognition
Everything you do you still audition

Art isn't easy
Overnight you're a trend
You're the right combination
Then the trend's at an end
You're suddenly last year's sensation
All they ever want is repetition
All they really like is what they know
Gotta keep a link with your tradition
Gotta learn to trust your intuition
While you re-establish your position
So that you can be on exhibit
So that your work can be on exhibition!
Be new, girl!
They tell you till they're blue, girl!
You're new, or else you're through, girl!
And even if it's true, girl
You do what you can do!
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, working on the vision night and day
All it takes is time and perseverance
With a little luck along the way
Putting in a personal appearance
Gathering supporters and adherents
Mapping out the songs but in addition
Harmonizing each negotiation
Balancing the part that's all musicians
With the part that's strictly presentation
Balancing the money with the mission
Till you have the perfect orchestration
Even if you do have the suspicion
That it's taking all your concentration
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Beat by beat, part by part
Sheet by sheet, chart by chart track by track
By by reel
By stack, snit by snit
By meal, shout by shout
By deal, spat by spat

I will know, right away
Soon as it shows
It may come cannonballing down through the sky
Gleam in its eye 
Bright as rose
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on the beach
Under a tree
I got a feeling there's a miracle due
Gonna come true, comin' to me

Could it be, yes it could
Something's comin', something good
If I can wait
Something's comin'
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
With a click, with a shock
Phone'll jingle, door will knock
Open the latch
Something's comin'
Don't know when
But it's soon
Catch the moon
One handed catch
Around the corner
Or whistlin' down the river
Come on, deliver to me
Will it be, yes it will
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there
Come on, something
Come on in
Don't be shy
Meet a guy
Pull up a chair
The air is humming
And something great is coming

I feel like drumming
And something great is coming
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight",Something's Coming [From West Side Story]
Barbra Streisand,"[Barbra:] Look, I've spent a lot of time working on this
[Producer 1:] Look, no one's gonna buy it -- no one.
[Producer 2:] No one in Middle America, anyway. That's for sure.
[Producer 3:] He's right!
[Producer 1:] Sweetheart, it's just not commercial!
[Barbra:] What is commercial?
[Producer 2:] It's not what's selling nowadays.
[Producer 1:] I mean - personally, I love it, but
[Barbra (sung):]Be nice, girl!
[Producer 3:] Nobody's into this kind of material.
[Barbra (sung):] You have to pay a price, girl!
[Producer 2:] This album needs a hit single we can push.
[Barbra (sung):]They like to give advice, girl!
[Producer 1:] The whole idea's too risky.
[Barbra (sung):] Don't think about it twice, girl!
[Producer 2:] The audience won't understand this kind of thing!
[Barbra (sung):]It's time to get to work!
Barbra (spoken): I disagree! Why don't you wait until you hear it?
[Producer 3:] This is like your old stuff!
[Barbra (sung):] Art isn't easy.
[Producer 3:] You've got to appeal to the kids.
[Barbra (sung):] Even when you're hot.
[Producer 2:] Why would you want to make an album like this anyway?
[Barbra (sung):] Advancing art is easy.
[Producer 1:] I think we ought to talk seriously about this.
[Barbra (sung):] Financing it is not!
[Producer 2:] Why take chances?
[Barbra (sung):] A vision's just a vision if it's only in your head!
[Producer 1:] Nobody respects your artistic integrity more than I do, but
[Barbra (sung):] If no one gets to hear it, it's as good as dead!
[Producer 2:] You have to think about you career!
[Barbra (sung):] It has to come to life!
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, only way to make a work of art
Every moment makes a contribution
Every little detail plays a parts
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
Putting it together, that's what counts!
Ounce by ounce, putting in together
Small amounts, adding up to make a work of art
First of all you need a good foundation
Otherwise it's risky from the start
Takes a little cocktail conversation
But without the proper preparation
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
[Producer 2:] Do we really need all these musicians?
[Barbra:] Link by link, making the connections, yes we do!
Drink by drink, taking every comment as it comes
Learning how to play the politician
Like you play piano, bass and drums
Otherwise you'll find your composition
Isn't gonna get much exhibition
Art isn't easy
Every minor detail is a major decision
Have to keep things in scale
Have to hold to your vision
[Producer 1:] Why don't we talk about this over dinner, darling?
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it gets the funds for your foundation
Every time I start to feel defensive
I remember vinyl is expensive!
[Producer 3:] Would you agree to do an interview?
[Barbra:] Maybe one!
Dot by dot, building up the image
Shot by shot, keeping at a distance doesn't pay
Still if you remember your objective
Not give all your privacy away
A little bit of hype can be effective
As long as you can keep it in perspective
Even when you get some recognition
Everything you do you still audition
Art isn't easy
Overnight you're a trend
You're the right combination
Then the trend's at an end
You're suddenly last year's sensation!
All they ever want is repetition
All they really like is what they know
Gotta keep a link with your tradition
Gotta learn to trust your intuition
While you re-establish your position
So that you can be on exhibit...
So that your work can be on exhibition!
Be new, girl!
They tell you till they're blue, girl!
You're new, or else you're through, girl!
And even if it's true, girl,
You do what you can do!
Bit by bit, Putting it together
Piece by piece, working on the vision night and day
All it takes is time and perseverance
With a little luck along the way
Putting in a personal appearance
Gathering supporters and adherents...
[Producer 1:] Well, she's an original!
[Producer 3:] WAS!
[Barbra:] Mapping out the songs but in addition
Harmonizing each negotiation
Balancing the part that's all musicians
With the part that's strictly presentation
Balancing the money with the mission
Till you have the perfect orchestration
Even if you do have the suspicion
That it's taking all your concentration
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Beat by beat, part by part
Sheet by sheet, chart by chart
Track by track, bit by bit,
Reel by reel, pout by pout
Stack by stack, snit by snit,
meal by meal, shout by shout
Deal by deal, spat by spat
Shpiel by shpiel, doubt by doubt
And that... Is the state of the art!
",If I Loved You
Barbra Streisand,"Love soft as an easy chair
Love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two

You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us, cause we have the brightest love

Two lives that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen","A Evergreen (Love Theme From ""A Star Is Born"") [Live]"
Barbra Streisand,"Oh! What a beautiful night, isn't it? The smell, crickets, it worries me
That we are tampering with what it took
Three hundred eighty million years to create
We're being reckless with the whole miraculous balance of nature
But I have great faith in people
I believe that, if they're told, if they understand what's at stake
They will make a change, they always have
And so this is for you
You who have the opportunity to raise your voices and do it again

It's a new world I see
A new world for me
The tears have rolled off my cheek
And fears fade away everytime you speak
A new world away, we're in a tiny room
What a vision of joy and blossom and bloom
A new found promise one that will last
So I'm holdin' on and I'm holdin' fast
You'll bring a new world to me the way the world should be",It's a New World [Live]
Barbra Streisand,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Barbra Streisand,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

 For amber waves of grain,
 For purple mountain majesties
 Above the fruited plain!

 And crown thy good with brotherhood
 From sea to shining sea!
 O beautiful for heroes proved,
 In liberating strife,
 Who more than self, their country loved
 And more than life

 Confirm thy soul in self-control,
 Thy liberty in law!

'Cause I think I might find out
That there's no rehearsal

And, I don't want to miss one bit if this is it
Here's my prayer
We can make it last
If we learn to tell the truth

And to trust each other
And be unafraid of what we'll see
With time and love we learn
When we accept each other

That's when our lives can come together
Let him stay by my side
If it lasts this time
Then the shadows of the past

Will remain behind us
And finally we will be free
With time and love we learn
We have this chance to grow

We have this chance to know each other
Time, all we need is time to feel
All of the love inside us
And then our lives will come together

With love and light
Nothing's gonna change our love tonight

Barbra Streisand,"So often as I wait for sleep
I find myself reciting
The words I've or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting

The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning
I relive the roles I've played

The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid
Along the roads I've wandered
Yet all the time I knew it

Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray

I may have never found my way to you
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray

And even when I had said next time
I'll never give my heart

You were soaking wet
No time to be impressed
I remember so much later on

I knew that you were someone
I would not forget
Everybody's searching, hungry for the glamour
You know too many hearts are in a rush

No matter how you try to
You can't explain

I can't explain it, but I can feel it

Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue

And sometimes I would wonder
Could the one to save me
Possibly be you?
I was lost, I was blind
Till I loved you
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You were my friend, dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you
Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from you
Until that certain moment when I loved you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment when I loved you

I knew it ...

Anyway that's all yesterday

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Main Event/Fight

Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life 
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory, too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale court smell of morning
A street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you'll touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Well, You won't find me being the one

Once I had so much to give
But You just refused my love

Weak one moment,
Then the next I'm fine

Is a river of surprise
Feelings are awakening
I hardly recognize
As mine!

What's the secret they reveal?

I touch you, I hold you, but lately I don't know you

And we just pretend it all away
We act like nothing's changed
But in our hearts we know it's not the same

Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's all right
But we're not makin' love

Remember when you couldn't wait to run into my arms
When the love inside my heart was all you needed
Remember when you made me wish the night would never end
The fire, the thunder, we lived to love each other
If ever two hearts were one, then it was yours and mine
But that was another place in time
Now all we have to show
Are memories of a dream we used to know

Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's all right
But we're not makin' love

When did we lose our way, we had it all
Don't know how it all just slipped away
But oh, can we get it back again
Is it too late, can we try
Just one time, because darling

Barbra Streisand,"I hate music, but I like to sing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaa!
But that's not music! Not what I call MUSIC, no sir!

Music is a lot of men with a lot of tails making lots of noise like a lot of
Females
Music is a lot of folks in a big dark hall where they really don't want to be
At all with a lot of chairs and a lot of heirs and a lot of furs and diamonds!
Music is silly

I hate music...but I like to sing

Barbra Streisand,"Nothing is so good it lasts eternally 
Perfect situations must go wrong 
But this has never yet prevented me 
Wanting far too much for far too long. 
Looking back I could have played it differently 
One of few more moments who can tell 
But it took time to understand the man 
Now at least I know I know him well. 
Wasn't it good? Oh so good 
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine? 
But in the end he needs
A little bit more than me
More She needs security 
He needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well. 

No one in your life is with you constantly 
No one is completely on your side 
And though I move my world to be with him 
Still the gap between us is too wide. 

Looking back I could have played it differently
Could have played things some other way. 
Learn about the man before I fell
I was just a little careless
But I was ever so much younger then. 
I was so much younger then
Now at least I know I know him well
Wasn't it good? Oh so good 
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine 
Isn't it madness he won't be mine? 
Didn't I know how it would go?
If I knew from the start 
Why am I falling apart? 
Wasn't he fine? Isn't it madness 
He won't be mine?
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me 
More She needs security 
He needs his Fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 
It took time to understand me 
I know him so well.",I Know Him So Well
Barbra Streisand,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me in the night?

Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?

Looking at the skies
I seem to see a million eyes
Which ones are yours?
Where are you now that yesterday
Has waved goodbye
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much bigger
Now that I'm alone

Papa, please forgive me
Try to understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?

Can you hear me praying
Anything I'm saying
Even though the night is filled with voices?

I remember ev'rything you thought me
Ev'ry book I've ever read
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright

But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very un-lady like
Way of running out

Your on a date with me

And yet before this evening is over
You might give me the brush

You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best
That I can do is pray

Luck be a lady tonight
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck if you've ever been
A lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight

Luck how I'm longing to see
How good a friend you can be
Stick with me sister
I'm the one that you came in with
Luck be a lady with me

A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the joint
And blow on some other guy?s dice

So, let's keep the party polite
Hmm, never get out of my sight
Stick with me sister
I'm the gal that I came in with
Luck be a lady tonight

A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers
She?d have heart, she would have a soul
A lady wouldn't make
Little sneak eyes at you
When I've bet my life on this roll

And in a little while he'll take my hand

I know we both won't say, we won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday maybe not.
Still I'm sure to meet him one day,
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

From which I'll never roam,
Who would, would you?

Let me relax my dome
My whole joints blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva
Ties will never sever
You died tryin to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin in peace don't even stress that beef
Go head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
Everytime I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
Its all over bearing witness like jehovah
ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his bodys underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table BLAOW
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin, not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin Sega
And buggin on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin
[Chorus 2X]
Aiyyo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brothers bad scratch
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin no crap
Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

I have walked too long alone

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far

It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then

Running away 
Till someone's arms 
Caught me by surprise

There's a part that knows

Follow what you feel

Will always find the light of day

Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself

Barbra Streisand,"Be nice, girl!
You have to pay a price, girl!
They like to give advice, girl!
Don't think about it twice, girl!
It's time to get to work!
Art isn't easy
Even when you're hot
Advancing art is easy
Financing it is not
A vision's just a vision if it's only in your head
If no one gets to hear it, it's as good as dead
It has to come to life
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, only way to make a work of art
Every moment makes a contribution
Every little detail plays a part
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
Putting it together, that's what counts

Ounce by ounce, putting in together
Small amounts, adding up to make a work of art
First of all you need a good foundation
Otherwise it's risky from the start
Takes a little cocktail conversation
But without the proper preparation
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Link by link, making the connections, yes we do!
Drink by drink, taking every comment as it comes
Learning how to play the politician
Like you play piano, bass and drums
Otherwise you'll find your composition
Isn't gonna get much exhibition
Art isn't easy
Every minor detail is a major decision
Have to keep things in scale
Have to hold to your vision
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it gets the funds for your foundation
Every time I start to feel defensive
I remember vinyl is expensive!
Maybe one!
Dot by dot, building up the image
Shot by shot, keeping at a distance doesn't pay
Still if you remember your objective
Not give all your privacy away
A little bit of hype can be effective
As long as you can keep it in perspective
Even when you get some recognition
Everything you do you still audition

Art isn't easy
Overnight you're a trend
You're the right combination
Then the trend's at an end
You're suddenly last year's sensation
All they ever want is repetition
All they really like is what they know
Gotta keep a link with your tradition
Gotta learn to trust your intuition
While you re-establish your position
So that you can be on exhibit
So that your work can be on exhibition!
Be new, girl!
They tell you till they're blue, girl!
You're new, or else you're through, girl!
And even if it's true, girl
You do what you can do!
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, working on the vision night and day
All it takes is time and perseverance
With a little luck along the way
Putting in a personal appearance
Gathering supporters and adherents
Mapping out the songs but in addition
Harmonizing each negotiation
Balancing the part that's all musicians
With the part that's strictly presentation
Balancing the money with the mission
Till you have the perfect orchestration
Even if you do have the suspicion
That it's taking all your concentration
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Beat by beat, part by part
Sheet by sheet, chart by chart track by track
By by reel
By stack, snit by snit
By meal, shout by shout
By deal, spat by spat
Shpiel by shpiel
And that, is the state of the art!",Putting It Together
Barbra Streisand,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here, at last, on the ground

One who can't move
Where are the clowns?

Making my entrance again with my usual flair

As close as today is to tomorrow
At midnight they can finally touch

Closer

So on this silent night
I call your name
And suddenly all time and space disappears
I see your face in firelight

I hold you close in memory

I know you're here

Barbra Streisand,"Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies

Can you still help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream

My grown-up X-mas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
Every man would have a friend
That right would always win
And love would never end

What is this illusion called
The innocence of youth
Maybe only in that blind belief
Can we ever find the truth

That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And every man would have a friend
And right would always win

Barbra Streisand,"I awake on a chilly Christmas morning
Watching choirs singing carols on TV
I gaze out through my window at a dozen other windows
Then I plug in my artificial tree
And like a dream I begin to remember every Christmas I used to know
A thousand miles away, a million years ago
I remember sky.
It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky
I remember snow, soft as feathers, sharp as thumbtacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint when the wind would blow
And ice like vinyl on the streets
Cold as silver, white as sheets
Rain like strings and changing things
Like leaves
I remember leaves
Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks, spread like broken umbrellas
And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes
Light and noise and bees and boys
And daaaaays, oh!
I remember days or at least I try
But as years go by, they're a sort of haze
And the bluest ink isn't really sky.
And at times I think I would gladly die
For a day of sky!",I Remember

Barbra Streisand,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful [From Road to Rio]
Barbra Streisand,"Emily, Emily, Emily

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Barbra Streisand,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?

How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year

Yet all to soon

Those sweet ""hellos"" became ""good-byes""
Almost love, but never quite
Never seemed exactly right
Just another love affair
Then I turned and you were there
You smiled and the world never was the same
I was in love before I even knew your name

Instantly I knew
All my life has led to you

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung

Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

One summer night
With nothing left to say

We let the dream begin
It was carried on the wind
And it wandered away

One golden sky
One spark of light
Forever will remain

And the song of the storm
Brought us close, kept us warm
All alone making love
In the rain

Gone is the world outside
Home on the turning tide
True love will find the sun
And know the reason why

And the night will become
Our golden dawn

No tears to cry
With you I have it all

If love can never die

But how far must I fall

One silver song
One lullaby
For all the love we make

It's the look in your eyes
It's the moon on the rise
It's the sound of the heart
That you break

Gone is the dark of night
Call on the early glow
Send down the birds of love
That circle us below

And still I will hunger for

And we can find a little hideaway
Where we can go

I'm in the corner with a friend of mine
I stood with my defenses down
So many things that bring you close to me
That we be led astray, the wonder of desire
To love the things we cannot touch

Maybe we turn and say goodnight and walk away
And then the story can go on without a single tear
You take a chance on it and change the history

Barbra Streisand,"In a very unusual way, one time I needed you
In a very unusual way you were my friend
Maybe it lasted a day, maybe it lasted an hour
But somehow it will never end

In a very unusual way I think I’m in love with you
In a very unusual way I want to cry
Something inside me goes weak
Something inside me surrenders
And you’re the reason why, you’re the reason why

You don’t know what you do to me, you don’t have a clue
You can’t tell what it’s like to be me looking at you
It’s scares me so that I can hardly speak

In a very unusual way I owe what I am to you
Though at times it appears I won’t stay, I never go
Special to me in my life, since the first day that I met you
How could I ever forget you once you had touched my soul?
In a very unusual way you’ve made me whole

A-all the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In fields of gold and 
Forests of the night
And when you stand before 
The candles on a cake

Sweet touches
We turned our hearts to love then tried it
First time romance
There in the quiet
Love learns to dance

We loved, we slept, we left the light on
The night's gone
And morning finds us caught in life's most
Sensible trance
Turn up the quiet
Love wants to dance

Old souls find new life
In hearts that are listening like ours
And old dreams find young wings
In silence, in silence

From too much talk to loving touches
Love touches
When pure emotion takes the moment
We take the chance

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love

Barbra Streisand,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

And yet I've watched it growin'

Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Barbra Streisand,"Why was there no applause?
It was our best performance
All in our thought last night
Went quite well

We knew all of our lines
And we knew how to say them
Just how to play them
Keeping it light till the tears fell

Though we both knew our story was ending
We were surprised when it came
Some things are just too good to be true
And no one's to blame

So there was no applause
When we brought down the curtain
We were so certain
There wasn't anything left to say

Maybe somehow our hearts knew
What our eyes couldn't see
Love would wait for us someday, someway

Barbra Streisand,"I'm all alone in a place I have never been.
I see a door to a garden and wander in.
And though my journey has barely begun
I am spun like a top to the top of the universe and
High in a spiral of ice I gaze upon a scene
That flickers far below me.
And what I see is a crinkle of colors and sounds.
Colors and sounds.

I can hear tinkles of crystal
And I can see sparkles of mist on the spangles
And I can feel tangles of tingles and sprinklings of angles
And inklings of angels around.

A rabbit crosses my path unexpectedly.
I hear a sigh of despair as he passes me.
I have a feeling that rabbit is late
For wherever he's going whatever he's headed for is my destination.
Oh, show me the way to stay here in this world
Because here's where the right things happen.
Oh baby here's where the good things are.

Looking at this enormous butterfly,
Wondering if he cares to dance with me.
Delicate as a flower carved of chrysophrase,
Idly I ponder how far have I yet to find it.
I've got to find it and act as though I've lost it.
Otherwise I'm lost in wonderland.

I've got to find it or else I am bound
To the empty ground bleak and vast.
Where dark spells are cast.

Flooring above me and ceiling below me
And chandeliers rising like tremulous towers
And tables and chairs, beds hanging like blossoms
In turquoise and purple and green.

You were asleep so I guess you were not aware,
I took a walk through your mind and I lingered there.
But what I found I can never reveal to you
Not with my words nor the pitch of my flute recall it.
You'll simply have to come walking with me
One day into that wonderland shining behind your eyes,
Beyond the gossamer doors of sleep.
Lovely, lovely sleep",Lost in Wonderland
Barbra Streisand,"For a little face, that's the biggest yawn
Look at teddy bear yawning too

Are you comfortable little lamb?
Such a sleepy smile you must surely know

I hope that she forgets and leaves my door open
So I can have a little light from the hallway
If I can hear them talking, if I can hear them laughing
I know I won't be frightened, maybe

At night I know that's just my chair, the nice red one
But it looks different than it looks in the daytime
Sometimes I think it's moving, a big enormous monster
A dinosaur or dragon maybe

I close my eyes and there are ghosts and witches
I'm scared a wicked witch will eat me

There ain't nothin' can start it over again.
Pack your bags and leave, ain't no use to grieve.
Though you've lost a lover, try to win a friend.

The partings easier when there are smiles instead of tears.
In your dreams you see that moment even if you live a million years.

I still can see your face

We're all just prisoners of time
The days go rushing by
With memories we've locked away
There may not been much I regret
But there were things we couldn't say
Maybe the ending came too soon
You are the one I can't replace
And though it's been so many years
I still can see your face

Somehow we knew another love would find us
We'd carry on, leave yesterday behind us
Sometimes I find, the quiet nights
I close my eyes and realize
I've never loved too far

And if by chance we meet again
We meet again

A street where we have never been
And with the hour getting late
You're running to my open arms

Wasn't long before she grew tired of me
And the life she thought would redeem
All the love she'd thrown away as a child
All the things she thought she had seen

And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her

And I will always love her
And I will always care

Barclay James Harvest,"Two of them watched in the dawn's early light
And two of them died in the morning
Search not your soul if you want to be right
But two of them died in the morning
It's not for you we cry
No, not for those who die
It is only for their sons
Forget the lives of others who are gone

Two and by two in the dawn's early light
All went to die in the morning
Search not your souls for the truth and the right
For all went to die in the morning light

It's not for you we cry
No, not for those who die
It is only for their sons
Forget the lives of others who are gone

It's not for you we cry

To think of things, lost and done
You wonder why she left so soon
No word or reason why

Lazy days passing by
With memories you just can't hide
The song flows on you can't pursue
Your words don't mean a thing
The mood's too hard for you to sing

The seconds they dripped right on by
And slowly filled the day
And feelings born can only fade away",Song With No Meaning

The last grain falls
The kneeling man just sighs
Protected by the one great wall
Of coloured parts
He probes his clouded mind
If he takes a look around him
Is there nothing left to see
Is there nothing left at all
After the day

With trembling hands he wipes his eyes
He tries to stand
But does not feel the need
The morning sun shines on
The multicoloured cross
Left standing through it all

If he takes a look around him
Is there nothing left to see
Is there nothing left at all

In the caves of the talking stoned the fools
Seen the stars plant their seeds and watch them grow
Just to keep mister reap but never sow 

In my life I've seen greed and I've seen hate
Seen the first to accuse the last to praise
Tried so hard to find just one saving grace

Barclay James Harvest,"I woke up to a feeling, it was cold by my side
You had gone with the sunrise, leaving tears in my eyes
I got up with a feeling of an emptiness inside
To the noise of the sidewalk and the silence of my mind 

Well I walked out this morning, down a street with no name
To a club called ""The Loser"", like a dog that's gone lame
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view
I took out life subscription - it's the only one they do 

I stepped out on the guard rail, saw the crowds slowly part
Heard a voice shouting ""Don't jump, please for God's sake let me move my car!""
Felt a hand on my shoulder, heard a voice cry ""Just in time!""
Felt the quick push, felt the air rush
Felt the sidewalk, fell in line",Suicide

Way up in the clouds

of the sunshine
We hear your song
High above the living

Brother gull, see him soar the sky
He's so pleased to be
Buoyant and triumphant
On the raging sea
Backing nature, feeling free

Loving nature, rest your head
Hear the message, man is dead
See the cities fall
While Brother Bird still.... flies!

Brother Lark, see him wake the day
See him fly on by
Above the streets now empty
To his mournful cry

Now she walks along the seashore
And she listens to the sea
But I can't say if she ever thinks of me

Or a wave upon the sand
Or just a drop of water in her hand
A pebble or a broken shell
A rock upon the shore

Awaiting her man
A victim to take by surprise.

She's the Golden Gate Park killer
She's the scourge of Frisco Bay
Where she got herself beat up
And left for dead
By a man she felt true love for
But who left her out of hand.
Now she's out to take revenge on every man
As she stands there with a pistol in her hand.

The victim arrives
She looks in his eyes
He goes for the gun in her hand.

Karl Malden was great. (unlike the film, though)
But just a bit late. (this was the real show)
And got it right between the eyes.

Barclay James Harvest,"Early morning,
It's cold and the sun is white
For I was born in
The darkness before the light

Of a new day
A new way of living
Of giving delight
And if you pay
Then you may be slipping
Back into the night

Then all knowing
With words and with pen I write
Of the growing
Of things that are in my sight

Early evening
It's cold and the moon is bright
And I believe in
The darkness before the light
Of a new day

Barclay James Harvest,"Oh Mother dear
What a night this has been
I awoke in the light of a vision in white
The prettiest girl that I have ever seen 
Lately my love, said the lady in white
I have watched from afar, but love draws me near
Now take my hand, hold tight, Mother dear
Do you know what this could mean, Mother dear?
Was it just another dream. in the night? 

Mother dear, on that same silver night Saw a figure in black by the lady in white
He said his name was death, was he right?
Do you know what this could mean, Mother dear?
Was it just another dream in the night?
Do you know what this could mean, Mother dear?
Was it just another dream in the night? 

Mother dear, what a night this has been
It's so cold by your side, no don't cry, can't you see?
Won't you listen to me please, Mother dear
Was it just another dream, Mother dear?",Mother Dear
Barclay James Harvest,"I am walking in a dream
Everything I touch it isn't real
People aren't just what they seem
And I really don't know what to feel
Mr. Sunshine's not for me

I don't mind the sky of blue
Or the honey clouds that wander by
When that orange thing comes through
I must look away or think I'll die
Mr. Sunshine's not for me

Blacker days I'll never see
And I curse your light a hundred times
When you shine your rays on me
I must hide my head or lose my mind
Mr. Sunshine's not for me

My old man says I am mad
Said that things were saner in his day
But I didn't listen, Dad
All the words you said I threw away

Trying hard to forget
All the cries and the lies
Of the people she met

Hypnotized by the sight
That you're seeing and yet
Can't disguise in her eyes
There's a look of regret

So she drifts into tomorrow
Maybe she can find a better way
To love and see her sorrow
Vanish in the haze

Rock 'n' roll lady, keep on trying
Like the sand that is washed on the shore
Don't believe all the tears and the crying
She's running back for more

In the bars where the stars
Drink tequila and wine
Loud guitars, fancy cars
And the feeling is fine

See her face every place
Every movement in time
But don't choose or a loser you'll be
When she throws you her line

And she drifts into tomorrow
Maybe she can find a better way
To love and see her sorrow
Vanish in the haze

Rock 'n' roll lady, keep on trying
Like the sand that is washed on the shore
Don't believe all the tears and the crying
She's running back for more

Won't ever change now I'm over you

The evening skies make me cry

No one beside me who may doubt
All of the words that I could chose to say
So listen, believe, or be gone from this day

And sit in the shade of an old tree
To think nothing much, just agree with my thoughts
To say nothing much, never tell what I ought 

Watching the people pass by now
They just don't know why or know how
They don't seem to care about all that I've seen
They just walk on by never knowing I've been

Barclay James Harvest,"In corridors of air the clouds were waiting there
They knew that never again the skies would be so blue

And I wonder if the sun will come again 

But the sun will never shine the way it used to do
The clouds won't let it through
Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you
The clouds won't let it through 

It wasn't long ago the people that I knew were glad
And nothing they ever thought about was sad
But since the sun has gone their laughing times are none
That's bad, to make them forget the happy times they've had
So they look outside their window at the sheets of pouring rain
And they wonder if the sun will come again

Barclay James Harvest,"For your love I cry
The long lonely hours
Before the dawn
In my dreams I try
To hold back the dark
To hold back my fear

But I'm not alone tonight
So help me turn the tide
Light up the flame of love
And let it shine

I have hope, I pray
That someday we'll all
Have love of our own
In the long lonely night
I'll hold to the fire
That's burning so bright

But we're not alone tonight
So help me turn the tide
Light up the flame of love
And let it shine

We're not alone tonight
So help me turn the tide
Light up the flame of love
And let it shine

Let it shine
Let it shine

",For Your Love
Barclay James Harvest,"There's a girl that lives in the shadows
Of the street where the music plays
There she waits and looks from the outside
There's an angel in her face
But from her glass she sips a little comfort
From the boys she takes a little more
And she knows just how far she can take it
In a moment she's out on the floor 
Hold on, she's got to keep a-moving
Hold on, dance with the light
Hold on, got to keep a-moving
Hold on, into the night 

In her eyes they thought they saw a question
Maybe she is looking their way
As the night gets older are they wiser?
Who will take her? No-one can say
Does she know just how they feel about her?
Can't she see she's driving them insane?
When the music starts playing again
They're saying

Hold on, she's got to keep a-moving
Hold on, dance with the light
Hold on, got to keep a-moving
Hold on, into the night",Hold On
Barclay James Harvest,"And though I think of you tonight
I cannot hope to hold you tight
But I've got this feeling in my heart 
And when tomorrow I'll be gone
How can I hope to carry on?
I've got a feeling in my heart 

I can no longer see
What's making things go wrong
You've stayed away before
It always seems so long 

But wherever you go
Whatever you do
You know I'll always be with you
'Cause I've got this feeling deep in my heart 

I can no longer see

Barclay James Harvest,"I have seen the streets and alleyways
Of a million faceless towns
The camera comes, the camera goes
Filming our blues for the late night news
We gather round 
Never searching for our innocence
Our faith, our truth, our love
They're only there when things go wrong
Filming our blues for the late night news
We gather round 

Show us peace and understanding
Brother love for fellow man
Cure us, we are sick from violence
In your sideshow of life 

Impartiality is like
A coin they have to spend
The currency of the chosen few
They place their bets
Switch on your sets 

There's world disasters by the minute
They tell us on the hour
And when we think we've paid our dues
They've filmed our blues for the late night news
We gather round 

Show us peace and understanding
Brother love for fellow man
Cure us, we are sick from violence
In your sideshow of life

And if you don't break the rules
It's going to be fine

Watching for the dawn to break
Just sitting here
Waiting for the time it takes

Searching for a clue, watching you 

Here, this is me
I'm living my life through the night constantly
Or so I've been told
Hope I can make it before I grow old
With love on my side
I could write you a song that would make your heart fly
So good for your soul
But there's something about you
That's leaving me cold

There's a part of me that's gone
Like a day without the sun
I can't go on without you

There is nothing I can do
And no words that I can say
All the meanings slip away
I can't go on without you

I used to think you loved me so
Now you have gone and love's no more

I can't go on without you
Though I must try to live again

Barclay James Harvest,"And with the rain
Soft pools of blue
White mist like love
When you glow so new
Must warm to you

Just like the snow
Falling anew
When it's soaked through
The snowdrops so few
Must warm to you 

Take my hand, my love
Come talk to me
Tell me of your walk
Through leaves of green
Where life was free

Tell me of rain
In soft pools of blue
How white mist like love
When you glow so new
Must warm to you

Tell me of snow
Falling anew
How when it's soaked through
The snowdrops so few
Must warm to the love of your heart
Warm to the love of your heart
And warm to you

Take my hand, my love
Come talk to me
Tell me of your walk
Through leaves of green
Where life was free
Take my hand, my love

Barclay James Harvest,"How come you happened to be hanging around

Take it easy

You're gonna make it
But let's make it last.

Barclay James Harvest,"Through the eyes of a child
There's no wrong or right
No reason to hate
No need for a fight
No color, no creed
No malice, no greed
Till the child becomes a man 
Give up your freedom
Hand back your rights
Then change your color now
You're black not white
And there'll never be a piece of the action
Now you're an African 

Forget beliefs and swallow your pain
You're just a number now
And Boy's your name
And you'll never get a piece of the action
Now you're a working man 

African, Asian, it's all the same
Brown, black, Caucasian

The politics of Apartheid
The politics of shame
The cold abuse of human rights
Of torture and of pain
Are only part of the action
When you're an African 

The politics of making more
The politics of greed
The cold abuse of poverty

When there's no food to eat
The politics of digging gold
Instead of planting seeds
The leader with his private golf course
And his flashy cars
Sits playing with his diamond wrist watch
While the people starve 

The politics of shooting down
A plane that brings relief
By fat men playing power games
Who've got enough to eat
The politics of racial hate
The politics of war
The men who sell the guns have fun
While we all count the score 

One, two, three, four
Thousands, millions
People dying just to keep
Them in the action

Same stuff I've heard it before that philosophy starting to bore me
Now you won't have to, smile and ignore me 
These days the karmas right the sun shines bright I'm kicking out the bad dreams

And you still will not give one back to me
You never have good apology
And your hooves never wrap all the way around me

You do sit just a little bit closer
And while we're all spending my money
Sometimes you do smile but I get mad

You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away

Would you share with me?
And whatever I got is never enough [Incomprehensible]

I feel so special when you are close to me
And if you cared it all for me
You would swear to God that you hated me
And send me away with [Incomprehensible]

Bare Jr.,"I had a nurse at home called the Soggy Daisy
Seven lonely people all died in one day
Seven people put away and forgotten
Seven people with a lifetime of wisdom for their offering

Here are some people who had loved and lived
May had done things that they wished they never did
Sometimes in life got bored and sad
May have been gay and dressed up like a bride

A great seducer, a horrible singer, an unknown psycho-killer
A devout Christian on a mission that he or she lost faith in
A hopeless romantic, a survivor of the Titanic
A small person who wished they were gigantic

A loud person who thought too much of them self
Sharp person who never knew they're better than everyone else
Great artist who knew they were sham
A lawyer always found a new way to scam

[Incomprehensible] never made one mistake
A macho man who's hard, never felt enough to break
A mother who loved too much, a brother who teases as much
A sister who spied and cried too much

A dancer who survived cancer only to die
Chicken with some manila figurative
Sneaking as to get a Libra
A Sagittarius, a person who could care less

A hair blade you or braid you
A kindergarten teacher's story
A loner, a passionate murderer, a butcher, a baker
A constant masturbator who asked me never read

A terrible reminder of the worth treasures
Inside the shoes our elders
Have been sentenced to die alone
And before you turn away from this page

Didn't think you'd ever know, didn't think you were coming home

Followed up by repeated hits
I think I have a broken rib, 
I taste blood upon my lips

I'm chasing a dream that spins me out of control
Simplistic intuitions free me from the grip of society
Don't wanna live my life like it's a movie roll

But I feel it in the air
On the highest mountaintops
Just wanna hold that breath forever
I'm dancin' in the clouds
With my feet still on the ground
I couldn't say a dream could get much better
And then the rain comes pouring down
And you wake up to the sound
Of changes in the weather

I close my eyes for a moment
I'm taken to that timeless zone
I'm feeling lost and helpless in a sea without a breeze
The unobtrusive feelings are slowly catching up to me
I wish the wind would bring me someone so I wasn't so alone

But I feel it in the waves
As they crash on over me
Just wanna float out here forever
With a six-string in my hand
And my feet buried in the sand
I couldn't say a dream could get much better
And then you watch the sun go down
While you wake up to the sound
Of changes in the weather

When the lights have all gone out
Thoughts of the day get tossed about
The images you see
Become a false reality
And your dreams become the pictures

And things you can't remember

It's all my greatest hits

And you can tell why
It's just some demos I recorded in my basement

Disc Five, I was barely alive 
I was hacking up a lung
Oh so they had to use a special computer as my replacement

Disc Six, a dance remix 
So I can catch the latest trend

Who's in his cups?  Which one of us recovering?
Who likes to look at pictures and cries, but way too late?
Who doesn't want to change a thing, accepting it was fate?

The wrong man was convicted, you know I did the deed.
I thought that you would wait for me, your wants I needn't heed.
The wrong man lies beside you and waits for you to wake,
And all because I lacked conviction, the judgment's my mistake.

Who's breathless now?  Who only hyperventilates?
Who'd die for you?  Who's dying inside anyway?
Which one of us is sunshine and which one's growing dim?
When two men dream of you at night, do you just dream of him?

The wrong man was convicted, you know I did the deed.
I thought that you would wait for me, your wants I needn't heed.

And so you hate my arrogance, my smothering and sitting on the fence,
But I'm afraid of the hard permanence of letting you go free.

I'm so sick of fighting and that effigy you're lighting,
Looks an awful lot like someone whose name I just can't quite place.

And tell me where to go. But there I'll always go

Her blue-green eyes complement the burnt sienna in her locks

And only her tenderness stopped me from bawling my eyes out

Fell down two flights of stairs
Well I thought I was wide awake but my legs were still asleep.

There was nobody there to help me
Broke my back

I fell flat on my ass

That my parachute failed

But a pair of shoes tripped me down stairs and I lay there and wail
Those things I used to take for granted
Now I take sitting down
I can't brush my teeth, chew my nails, give the finger to a clown

I broke my back
And I can't even change the channels
Broke my back
I fell flat on my ass

Well they tell me that I shouldn't get discouraged
But they tell me that I'll never walk again
And they say I'm gonna need a lot of courage
And they say I'm gonna need a lot of friends

But what I really need is a pair of electric legs.
So I wish some genius would just invent them.
And if they cost too much I'd share with someone else.
Or I would scour the Yellow Pages and I'd rent them.

I know I can probably pop a wheely
Entertaining the kids
I can put hockey cards in the spokes I can even throw skids
I get a good seat at a concert

Even get stuff for free

When I guess I should have just come out and told you right from the start
Why must I always tell you all I want is this?
I guess 'cause I didn't want to break your heart

Curl up and die just because of you?

I don't think I do

Did I fool you too?

Has eyes that roll back in his head
They flutter and dart, he slows down his heart

What do you dream about?
Do you dream about
Music or mathematics
Or planets too far for the eye?
Do you dream about
Jesus or quantum mechanics
Or angels who sing lullabyes?

His fontanelle pulses with lives that he's lived
With memories he'll learn to ignore
And when it is closed, he already knows
He's forgotten all he knew before
But when sleep sets in
History begins
But the future will win

When you dream,
What do you dream about?
When you dream,

Or languages not yet conceived? 
Are they silent or boisterous?

Loud enough to be perceived?

On transistor radio waves?

Are you wise beyond your few days?

They're frightened of jumping, in case they survive

Shaken while he stirred.  When you awaken you will
Make him eat his words right off the hook...

The souvenirs of men who cheat
It all makes sense - with each offense

Barenaked Ladies,"The credits roll, the camera pans,
And in the mist our hero stands,
He starts to speak then folds his hands in prayer.
An awkward pause, then ""What's my line?
There's nothing left to say this time -
And what do you say to a bad guy who's not there?""
In terms of Roman numerals he's IV league with Roman Polanski,
He'd win an Oscar every time if he was only given a chance.
He started on the Broadway stage,
The product of another age,
An offer and a pilot drew him west.
The series bombed, commercials came, 
And though nobody knew his name,
They all recognized the potential he possessed.
Deodorants and dental floss,
And how much does that new car cost?
His acting was methodical in
""You Don't Need A Medical"".
He's branded like a racing car,
He's like a movie star without movies.
The week of Independence Day,
The casting agent called to say -
""Your smile could save the movie and the world.""

And vaguely Celtic music fills the air.
We choose a foreigner to hate,
The new Iraq gets more irate,
We really know nothing about them
And no one cares.

Enhanced by brand new special effects.
Saddam and his cow disease
Spiced up with some gratuitous sex.

A low speed chase, a smoking gun,

The highway's dividing, the city's in view
As usual I'm almost on time

While out my window the horizon does flips

Because I've never seen so much,
Never seen so much, never seen

I'm still standing in the snow

I stood and watched the lights go out
While the snowflakes settled all around me
Though it filled my heart with doubt
Couldn't move and this is where you found me
As our footprints disappeared
Snow erasing how I came to be here
I've got nowhere else to go
Now you're standing
In the snow
Look for understanding
In the snow
You look just outstanding
In the snow
Standing in the snow

Now it's almost Christmas Eve
And I'm surrounded with the sound of laughter
To give is better than to deceive
For I received a happy ever-after
You might have left me in the cold
A fitting ending for the fool that I was
But you'd be cuddled up alone
And I'd still be standing in the snow",Footprints

Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself

At least it's only once a year
Perfect parcels tied with perfect bows
And carols ringing in my ear
Bundled up against the cold
Lines wherever gifts are sold
Each shop window displays a Christmas scene
For everybody young and old
Icicles on eavesdrops and tinsel on the trees
But it's a green Christmas for me

Couples skating on the pond (couples skating on the pond)
Making angels on the lawn (making angels on the lawn)
Five red mittens drying on the rack
And needle-shedding tannenbaums
Red bows on the railings
And snowflakes on the ground
But it's a green Christmas in this town

Green
Cause of everything I miss
All this mistletoe, no kiss
And with every Christmas wish
There would be no greater gift
Than to have this envy lift

Carolers are at my door

Broken glass, broke and hungry
Broken hearts and broken bones

Why did you clean the floor?
Why did you plaster over
The hole I punched in the door?

Why did you keep the mousetrap?
Why didn't you keep the dish rack?

Forty-two stairs from the street
Crooked landing, crooked landlord
Narrow lane way filled with crooks

Why did they change the lock?
Why did I have to break it

How is the neighbor downstairs?
How is her temper this year?
I turned up your TV
And stomped on the floor just for fun

I know we don't live here anymore
We bought an old house on the Danforth
She loves me and her body keeps me warm, I'm happy here

Three days since the living room,
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry

You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish,
Although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 
Cause it's never touched a frying pan

Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes
Big like Leann Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits
You try to hold me but I bust through

Threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees

You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait till you say you're sorry

You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin' X-Files with no lights on,
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one

Like Sting I'm Tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy

Like Kurosawa I make mad films
Okay I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the backswing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

Dropped your arms to your sides and said I'm sorry
Five days since I laughed at you and said
You just did just what I thought you were gonna do
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?

I saw you on the lawn
I see you all the time

With everything I wrote
I threw it off a bridge
And thought that it would float.
