Nikka Costa,"The sun'll come out tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There'll be sun
Just thinking about
Tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow
Till there's none

When I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely
I just stick out my chin and grin and say...oh

The sun'll come out tomorrow
So ya gotta hang on till tomorrow
Come what may

Tomorrow
Tomorrow
I love ya
Tomorrow
You're always a day a-way

(Repeat)
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
I love ya
Tomorrow
You're always a day a-way

[Repeats]
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Just thinking about
The sun coming out",Tomorrow
Nikka Costa,"Let life toss me around
I'll fall with both feet on the ground
And smile though my whole world
Is upside down

I'll win each race I start
Iii fight the strongest heart
I'll shine and light the dark
But there's no way
My day could start

[Chorus]
Without You
I wouldn't have someone to guide me
I wouldn't have someone beside me
To hide me when troubles make me blue
Without You
Just who would put the sunshine in my life
Who'd dry the tears that fall from my eyes
I know I could never make it through
Without You

Without a you for me
My heart would be a lonely place
And dreams would not mean anything to me

But you've lit up my night
You gave me wings to fly
New I can touch the sky
But I know I could not survive

[Chorus]

Without You",Without You
Nikka Costa,"I dunno when things changed
Maybe I'm the one to blame.
I could see forever in your eyes
If you just look at me, baby.

I dunno where I went wrong
Have we just tried for too long?
I could you tight til I die,
If you come near me again.

Baby, who's loving you?
Who's loving you?

What can I do make you stay?
If waive done drove you away.
I could turn back the hands of time,
If you just care again.

Baby, who's loving you?
Who's loving you?

Can you blame me
If I'm dying to know,
Who took your love away.
Can you blame me
If I've got to know,
So I can go on and love again.

Baby, who's loving you
Who's loving you
Who's loving you",Who's Loving You
Nikka Costa,"Meet me in the stillness
Away from all this madness
I'll give you a piece of me
If you'll give me a moment
To let you into the corners of my mind

I looked into a stranger
And found my soul waiting there
It hit me like a siren
To see myself everywhere
And I saw that I knew him 
Like the corners of my mind

And like every other soul
You feel the night come on hard and go slow
And life goes on and on and it goes
In the corners of my mind

So shed your skin for me
Let's pull back the covers
There's so much about ourselves
We're yet to discover
So won't you let me in to 
The corners of your mind

We pass on chance with our eyes to the ground
It only takes a minute to see what's around
But instead we choose to reside in 
The corners of our minds

So I stand before you now
Faulty but not broken
Fragile like the break of day
And sometimes sad like words unspoken
But I'll let you in
I'll let you in to the corners of my mind

And like every other soul
You feel the night come on hard and go slow
And life goes on and on and it goes
In the corners of my mind",Corners of My Mind
Nikka Costa,"My face to the sky
Dreaming about just how high
I could go and if I know
When I finally get there

Taking of my glasses
Sun pokes through my lashes
And somehow I know
There's a time for every star to shine

Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

People keeping score
Say better hurry up and get yours
Cause somebody else get your spot
Before you even dropped

Seek and you shall find
Everything in my own sweet time
I'll take my chances
With what I believe is only mine

Busy holding on
So the roof don't fly
Keep you from moving on
So get it right
Turn the tide over
Like a love song
Like a butterfly
Believe if you hand it over
You'll come out all right

Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

Illuminate the silly things
Shed some light on all that's wrong
Everybody need it sometime
Sometimes the only thing you got
Is what makes you feel like
You're something else altogether
You have everything don't need
Another reason to be something
I've been on a ride
And caught up in the landslide
But I'm gonna spread my wings and fly

Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star",Everybody Got Their Something
Nikka Costa,"Y'all know my steelo

What if I was the one to leave 
Your sorry ass behind
What if all these tears that're falling 
Were yours instead of mine
What if I was proof 
All the wiser by the minute
What if I knew your were making a bed 
And just who was lying in it

Hope it felt good to say you love her
Hope it felt good baby baby baby
Hope it felt good to be with another
Hope it felt good yeah yeah yeah

And uh
What if I just wipe the floor 
With your love without even thinking
What if the thread you were hanging on 
Had you strung out on wishful thinking
I've become clearer since I came out 
From under the wrong impression
I've been stuck on the detour, baby 
Heading in the wrong direction

Hope it felt good to say you love her
Hope it felt good baby baby baby
Hope it felt good to be with another
Hope it felt good yeah yeah yeah

I hope it felt good yeah
I hope it felt good yeah
I hope it felt good for you baby
I hope it felt good for you baby
Oh you're killing me baby

Alright
Oh didn't it feel good baby
I hope it felt good
Oh didn't it feel good",Hope It Felt Good
Nikka Costa,"I take you in and I hold my breath
Try to save the time that's passing by
And if you came to say goodbye
A thousand summers would never dry
Every tear that touched my face

And they don't laugh the way you do
And they don't smile the way you do
And their eyes don't shine the way yours do

I love
I love
I love you just because

Without the words to fall back on
I'm afraid it's hopeless to describe
And if I tried, I'd probably steer you wrong
Cause a thousand phrases would never say
How I feel today

And they don't laugh the way you do
And they don't smile the way you do
And their eyes don't shine the way yours do

I love
I love
I love you just because",Just Because
Nikka Costa,"I'm coming out of my wishing well
Where only echoes lonely hear m prayers
I'm coming around to bend cause my resistance been to persistent
I've come to far to force it so I'll watch it slide and land
I could come on strong and willful but
I'd rather watch it fall to the palm of my hand

And when I set it free like a feather it will be
And when I rise to see it done like whatever it will be it will be

I'm taking a breather baby
From sitting on pins waiting for my sky to fall
I'm taking up giving in
So here's the wheel, I'm putting my feet up
Take another look at me baby
Today I'm taking on catastrophe
I'd rather take it easy
Then try to force what's on its way to me

And when I set it free like a feather it will be
And when I rise to see it done like whatever it will be it will be

We're only afraid if we pull back the blinds too far
The lights behind that we free will blind other stars
But the truth doesn't blind it helps to see far
So get ready to be
Who you are",Like a Feather
Nikka Costa,"It's late in the evening
And you're breathing with someone else
You come home to call me
And I ask you what you've 
Been doing with yourself
And you say nothing at all
You say nothing at all

You flight is longer that usual
And you conscience ain't no company
I'm there smiling and warm I missed you so
And can't wait to show you how I feel
But you feel nothing at all
You feel nothing at all

There we were
Never strangers before
There was a light that shined on us
But now there's nothing at all

You should've taken a look around
Before you laid that woman down
You better get a hold of yourself
Cause there's a woman here
Who's willing to try

Weeks go by
And you mind seems preoccupied
I feel a piece missing here
But when I ask you about what's going on
You say it's all me my dear
So I thought nothing at all
I thought nothing at all

You should've taken a look around
Before you laid that woman down
You better get a hold of yourself
Cause there's a man in you
About to die
With nothing
With nothing",Nothing
Nikka Costa,"I am a woman with a mission 
And a past to outdo
I don't need a gun 
I've got a microphone 
And a melody or two
Just like the earth has spent 
A thousand years 
Making up for what we do
So have I for you

Your seeds of misery have sprouted 
And they try to block my way
The worst gets the better of you 
And you try to disarm me with an embrace
Just like the heart that's spent a lifetime 
Forgiving what is cruel
So have I for you

Well mama you can choose the rain 
But I choose the sun
That's all I need to free myself

I am a woman with a mission 
And a past to outdo
I don't need a gun 
I've got a microphone 
And a melody or two
Just like the earth has spent 
A thousand years making up 
For what we do
So have I for you

I have justified every wave in our ocean
I have covered every range of emotion
And just like the sea has spent eternity 
At the mercy of the moon
So have I for you

Well mama you can choose the rain 
But I choose the sun
That's all I need to free myself

This bird's gonna fly so high
Watch my sky come undone
Mama you can choose the rain
But I choose the sun",So Have I for You
Nikka Costa,"Like the day looks forward to the rising sun
Like the sun that everyday kiss the tide
Like the bridges that leads you to the other side
I'm everyday thankful that you're the one

If you chased me baby I'd be still as stone
Cause babe you bring my smile on like no other
There ain't no deeper feeling I get nowhere than
When I'm the skin beneath your hands

You're some kind of beautiful in my life

I don't need to hide my willingness
To revel at the beauty that you possess
Like every grain of sand that rolls with the sea
Just like heaven you and Ii will forever be

You're some kind of beautiful in my life",Some Kind of Beautiful
Nikka Costa,"Make your mama proud like a real man should
Scream so loud, I wake the neighborhood
Gonna write a song 'bout the way you do it
Baby, don't fuck around, put your back into it, yeah

Make your mama sing like a gospel choir
Now I'm hearing things baby, I'm on fire
Watch your mama work it till we both retire
Baby, don't you know I'm worth it gonna sock it to ya right?

We don't love to talk it over
Let's just get it on and on, and on, and on

I'm getting sticky just thinking 'bout ya
Bend your mama over let's work it out
Ain't nothing wrong with how we do
Baby, make me smile with your groove

On and on, and on, and on
We don't have to talk it over
Let's just get it on and on, and on, and on
C'mon

We don't have to talk it over
Let's just get it on and on, and on, and on
On and on, and on
On and on, and on, and on",On & On
Nikka Costa,"Everyone around the world
Will find themselves about to fall
In my case I've gotten down, gotten up
Laid back down, filled my cup and had to crawl
But it's clear that it's my time to be here
And I'm gonna make it clear to you all

Spend our lives trying to get over
On this roller coaster that we're traveling on
And everyday we ride the elevator
No matter where it takes ya
Up or down

Don't let it get you down
Love will always be your soldier
Wiping every tear you cry
Don't let it get you down
Yours for always and forever
Yours until the end of time

Everyone around the world
Will find themselves with the chance to fly
In that second we decide if we ride
If we'd be satisfied to pass it by
But it's clear that it's our time to be here
And we've gotta make it clear all our lives

We spend our lives trying to get over
On this roller coaster that we're traveling on
And everyday we ride the elevator
No matter where it takes ya
Up or down

So don't let it get you down
Love will always be your soldier
Wiping every tear you cry
No, don't let it get you down
Yours for always and forever
Don't let it get you down
Yours until the end of time
Come on

Everyone around the world
Don't let it get you down
Everyone around the world
Don't let it get you down

When ain't nothin' goin' right
Love will be your soldier
When all you can do is cry
Love will be your soldier

When no one is around
Love will be your soldier
When your world is tumbling down
Love will be your soldier

When ain't nothin' goin' right
Love will be your soldier
When all you can do is cry
Love will be your soldier

When nobody is around
Love will be your soldier
When your world is tumbling down
Love will be your soldier

Everyone around the world

Nikka Costa,"Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
Never did nobody, no good
You better plant in your garden
And make sure you water it like you should

Time spoiled you rotten, you done forgotten
Why you been put here, come on
Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
But make your dreams disappear

Blaming everybody who dealt your hand
But you're keepin' your on head in the sand
You should be sweatin' while you sit at home
Looking under your bed for your backbone

Instead, you ridin', bitch, till the tables turn
Till you get your check, till your luck returns
How are you expecting to find your way?
With shoulda, woulda, coulda coming out your face

Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
Never did nobody, no good
You better plant in your garden
And make sure you water it like you should

Time spoiled you rotten, you done forgotten
Why you been put here, come on
Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
But make your dreams disappear

You keep ridin' your bike in a cul-de-sac
Think you're getting somewhere ridin' piggyback
You're only gettin' out what you're puttin' in
So stick your neck out, take it on the chin

'Cause there's a whole lotta nothin' goin' on for too long
'Cause the time isn't right 'cause it feels all wrong
Wishin' like a baby you could just get on
Ain't nothin' doin' while nothin's done

Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
Never did nobody, no good
You better plant in your garden
And make sure you water it like you should

Time spoiled you rotten, you done forgotten
Why you been put here, come on
Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
But make your dreams disappear

Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
Never did nobody, no good
You better plant in your garden
And make sure you water it like you should

Time spoiled you rotten, you done forgotten
Why you been put here, come on
Can'tneverdidnothin' and neither did couldn't
But make your dreams disappear

[Incomprehensible]
",Can'tneverdidnothin'
Nikka Costa,"Heaven spoke too loud
Left me a fatherless child
Occurs to me everyday
But your memory makes me proud

You're the one I hold
You're the first man I loved
And all that follow
Have a mountain to rise above

And there's a hole inside of me
Where I put flowers so I can breathe
And though the winters have come and gone
You're still my heart, you're still my sun

Somehow I always knew
What I lost was never gone
'Cause there's a part of you
Inside me that carries on

And there's a hole inside of me
Where I put flowers so I can breathe
And though the winters have come and gone
You're still my heart, you're still my sun

Heaven spoke too loud
Left me a fatherless child
And there are times you know
I really wish you were around

And I'll try to make you proud
'Cause you're the break in every cloud
And I'm convinced that's why
The sun shine on me
",Fatherless Child
Nikka Costa,"I hid my heart in self-defense
I felt the break and consequence
Never to return to meltin' feelin's inside
And oh, I've told myself, wouldn't fall again

Even in the light of day
You'll never see
How much I feel, feel for you baby
How much you mean to me

'Cause I fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
I'm goin' crazy wishin' I could tell ya
Fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
But now you're in love with somebody else

I fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
I wish I could tell ya, how much I love ya
Fooled ya baby, fooled ya
But I'm the fool

I bit my lip with ignorance
I kept it quiet and sat on the fence, yeah
Never thought it made a difference, no, no, oh
But my time has come and gone
And honey, I never took the chance

And oh, even in the light of day
You'll never see
How much I feel for you baby
How much you mean to me

I fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
I'm goin' crazy wishin' I could tell ya
Fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
But now you're in love with somebody else

I fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
I wish I could tell ya, how much I love ya
Fooled ya baby, fooled ya
But I'm the fool

I count the hours till I see your face
I'd stop the world from turnin' out in outer space
I'd get back the time that's been erased
Just to have you near me, just to hear you say

That I'm yours till the day you die
And ain't nobody else in your life
Ain't nobody ever made me feel
Sexy like I was wearin' a new pair of heels

I fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
I'm goin' crazy wishin' I could tell ya
Fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
But now you're in love with somebody else

I fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
I wish I could tell ya, how much I love ya
Fooled ya baby, fooled ya
But I'm the fool

I'm the fool
I'm goin' crazy for you baby
I'm goin' crazy for you baby

Fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
I fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
I fooled ya baby, fooled ya baby
I'm goin' crazy
I'm goin' crazy

Don't you know
I'm the fool?
",Fooled Ya Baby
Nikka Costa,"You're nothing but a dirty, dirty old man
You do your thinkin' with a one track mind
Keep talking 'bout heaven's glory
But on your face is a different story

Clean up your act, your story's gettin' dusty
Wash out your mouth, your lies are getting rusty
Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do

You know you're funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bowl weavers
Same old thing, same old game, you never change
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing

Blowing minds is a thing of the past
You blew your chance, that's why you'll never last
You wanna be a graduated lover
But in reality you're just another brother

You think you're slick but you could stand a lot of greasin'
The things you do ain't never really pleasin'
You think you're slick but you could stand a lot of greasin'
The things you do ain't never really pleasin'

Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you're funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bowl weavers

Same old thing, same old game, you never change
Always rappin' 'bout the same, same, same old thing, oh

Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you're funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bowl weavers

Same old thing, same old game, you never change

Nikka Costa,"Kisses sweet you wake me
With the first tease of the sun
And I'm gonna have my day made
Before it's even begun
Between working or playing with you
You help me make up my mind

'Cause it don't matter if I miss the train
They don't pay me enough anyway
And if they did I'd forfeit every dime
To hear you say
I'm about to make the sun shine
Brighter in your day baby

You make me happy in the morning
And when I go to bed
You take all my naughty thoughts
And they get put to use instead

And it feels like I've been dreaming
But my pillow never hit my head
You make me happy in the morning

Sugar's too sweet to ignore
Maybe just five minutes more
Your love is shining all over my world

Better run if you don't plan on making
Something of yourself
But I give in the minute you give me
Some loving on which to dwell

I'll take on the world tomorrow 'cause
I'm taking off today, baby
'Cause it don't matter when you take me on
Before the sun even rises

All my troubles stay far away
'Cause you're a sight for sleepy eyes
And it's a wonder I get anything done
With your kind of love in my life

You make me happy in the morning
And when I go to bed
You take all my naughty thoughts
And they get put to use instead

And it feels like I've been dreaming
But my pillow never hit my head
You make me happy in the morning

Sugar's too sweet to ignore
Maybe just five minutes more
Your love is shining all over my world

You make me wanna
You make me wanna get on up in the morning
Get on up in the morning
Get on up in the morning

You make me happy in the morning
And when I go to bed
You take all my naughty thoughts
And they get put to use instead

And it feels like I've been dreaming
But my pillow never hit my head
You make me happy in the morning
Happy in the morning
Your love is shining all over my world
",Happy in the Morning
Nikka Costa,"You've said all you have to say
You've hit the wall and can't get through another way
You got your eyes down to the floor
You say you don't think you can give anymore

We're colder than you've ever known
It seems we made our choice and now you walk alone
But just in case your mind's not made
Tell me if there's still a chance I could persuade

You say you've tried but can't go on trying in vain
While we step over your tears
But I say try and try again
Because we need to hear

Hey love, while we try so hard
To get our way you're pushed aside
We're running faster
But it's only you we leave behind

Hey love, and everyday you try
To rise above we let you down
If you let us we'd really
Wish you were around

You say you've tried but can't go on trying in vain
While we step over your tears
But I say try and try again
Because we need to hear, hey love

I know you won't disappear
It's plain to see in every child that you put here
But if you should turn away
I don't think we could afford the price we'd pay

While we try so hard
To get our way you're pushed aside
We're running faster
But it's only you we leave behind

Hey love, and everyday you try
To rise above we let you down
If you let us we'd really
Wish you were around

But I say try and try again
Because we need to hear
Hey love

Hey love, never go, never go
Hey love, never go, never go
Hey love, never go, never go
Hey love, never go, never go
Hey love, never go, never go
Hey love, never go, never go

Nikka Costa,"I gotta know
If I give my heart to you,
And everything you say is true,
And everything you say you'll do, you'll do.
And I gotta know, if I bare my soul right here, 
You'll never run or disappear, 
You'll hold me till the hours turn to years.
And I gotta say, my heart has never been so sure, 
You've mended every piece that tore, 
And now my love's too strong to tear away.
So I gotta know, if you feel the same my dear, 
Lets justify why we are here, 
Say the words that I long to hear.

'cause I've been so strong for so long, 
I've never needed anyone, 
But my strength is wearing out my heart.
So I'm letting my guard down 
'cause I feel like I've finally found somebody.
But I gotta know.

I gotta know
You'll still kiss away my tears, 
Even if they make no sense, even if they put you on defense.
And I gotta know
Through the times when it gets rough, 
That our love will be enough, and you'll never let it go.

'cause I've been so strong for so long, 
I never needed anyone, 
But my strength is wearing out my heart.
So I'm letting my guard down 
'cause I feel like I've finally found somebody.
But I gotta know.

I gotta know, babe.
I need to hear you say, 
I know only time will tell, 
But I need to hear it anyway.
'cause now my love's too strong to tear away.

'cause I've been so strong for so long, 
I never needed anyone, 
But my strength is wearing out my heart.

Nikka Costa,"Gimme somethin' I can work with here
Baby, c'mon
Gimme somethin' I can work with here

I can see it in your eyes
You can hardly contain yourself
With everything you feel
You say, Hallelujah

I'm so glad my friends made
Me come here, all this talent
And me looking so damn fine up in here
I'm your gift and it's your birthday

So swing it around and put it here
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon
Swing it around and put it here
So swing it around and put it here
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon
Swing it around and put it here

So now you're in my ear
Talkin' 'bout how the eyes are really windows
Into someone's soul
And I'm supposed to act like

I never heard that one before
I thought no one used
Those lines no more
It's just as tired now as it was then

Swing it around and put it here
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon
Swing it around and put it here
Swing it around and put it here
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon
Swing it around and put it here

Blow my mind and I'll bend right over
I'll be yours with no do-overs
But it's gonna take
So much more than a promise
To move my world
To make this rock wanna roll with ya

Swing it around and put it here
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon
Swing it around and put it here
Swing it around and put it here
Baby c'mon, baby c'mon
Swing it around and put it here

You try to put pictures in my head
I don't know, somethin' 'bout
Have I ever rode a thoroughbred?
My friend didn't buy it

So you thought you'd try it on me instead
And now my eyes couldn't get further
Back in my head
But you still askin' if my hair is really red? Baby, c'mon

Gimme somethin' I can work with here

My lover E was extraordinary and my one regret
'Cause my lover F was just too freaky to forget
My lover G was touch and go for a good while

And I gotta say I was jonesin for my lover J
But my jelly was too sweet for him and jealousy got in the way
Let's just say my lover K was kicked to the curb
And my lovers L M N O P have all become a blurb

My lover Q was quite qualified
But my lover are was ready to rush me out of his life
My lover S was so busy spreadin' his seed

Nikka Costa,"When your faith lights the canon
When your pride is pulling triggers
And nobody is left standing
Tell me where's the God in that

You can say the war is over
Try and sell that to a mother
Sent away her heart and got back a stone
Now it's quieter than she's ever known

Takes one second to breathe in and out
One decision to believe or doubt
One heart beating echoes in a crowd
Cryin' for change and only tears get out

Mam's cryin' bullets in the sky
Raining, raining tears on each side
Fight for love don't love the fight
Mama's cryin' bullets in the sky

No you can't please everybody

And somebody else wants to take ya down

That you choose to ride

You need someone to hold your hand
Someone to understand

Was good as gold

Turned my heart to stone, so

I disappear

Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands

In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel

Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach",The One

And let you slay me
I showed you my heart
And now, I'm sorry

Head first into you
I fell in, too deep
Not much I could do
But watch you leave me

I've tried but I can't
Guess, I don't understand
The meaning of letting you go

I'm a heart with no beat
Fading fast by the hour
Flailing in circles
A struggle to breathe

Butterfly with no wings
A fragile wilting flower
Baby, without you it seems
I'm a fish out of water

Thought you were the one
I was dreaming
What I thought was love
Just left me empty

No turning back time
No more pretending
No rainbow inside
No happy ending

Though I try, I'm confused
Where to start without you
My world has been turned upside down

I'm a heart with no beat
Fading fast by the hour
Flailing in circles
A struggle to breathe

Butterfly with no wings
A fragile wilting flower
Baby, without you it seems
I'm a fish out of water

I've surrendered to the unconscious
You are the haze that grips my mind
I opened the flow gates, it hurts in slow motion
Baby, I'm running out of time

And I've tried, oh, oh

I'm a heart with no beat
Fading fast by the hour
Flailing in circles
A struggle to breathe

Butterfly with no wings
A fragile wilting flower
Baby, without you it seems
I'm a fish out of water

Nikki Cleary,"Me and my girlfriends 
Are always in competition
We picked a guy, made a bet
On who would the first to kiss him
The game was make the poor boy beg
Be the one inside his head
I played the game to win

Left the girls in the rearview
I got into first position
While they were hittin on him, flirtin with him, I was turning his ignition
Thought he was just a game to win
But now I'm hearing violins
And now the joke's on me

Get your hands off my baby
The bet's off
It's not a game anymore
You see the plan's gone wrong
And you can't touch
Not playing like I was before
You gotta keep the game 
Our little secret
He can never know the score
Now I love him,
I don't want him to hate me for it
It's not a game anymore

We were bored hangin' out
Just looking for a new distraction
But the plan backfired,
Ended up as reverse attraction
It was just a little innocent fun
But I'm the one who's comin all undone

And make the world make sense
Laying in your arms used to be the
Place where I felt heaven holding on to me
What I wouldn't give to be there right now
I can't seem to shake watching my heart walk out

When the sun decides to set in the east
That'll be when I'm over you getting over me
When the steepest mountain falls into the sea
Only then will I be over you getting over me

Emotionless you told me goodbye
And even to this day I'm really not sure why
I never thought that perfect could end
Maybe my perceptions blinded me again
Words we didn't say are what haunt me now
Happy ever afters the page you ripped out

When the sun decides to set in the east
That'll be when I'm over you getting over me
When the steepest mountain falls into the sea
Only then will I be over you getting over me

Was I guilty of caring too much
Did my constant devotion scare you away
When I close my eyes I dream the same dream
That we stayed in love and you're holding me

When the sun decides to set in the east
That'll be when I'm over you getting over me
When the steepest mountain falls into the sea
Only then will I be over you getting over me

When the sun decides to set in the east
That'll be when I'm over you getting over me
When the steepest mountain falls into the sea
Only then will I be over you getting over me

It's shop time, in line, hurry on the quickness
Couch gorillas, you all need fitness
Word up, word up, kick out the dead presidents
All nightmares and Elm Street residents
Come on down, there's nothin wrong with that
But when Booga Bears do it - it's wack
In fact, I was in the shop the other day
Girls, hear me out, okay?
Reading Essence magazines
The latest fashions, adults and teens
Walkman kicks with the Jam that's Def
I see a female with a mask as I glance to the left
Slide to get my nails done
A manicure for sure - huh, can ya dig it, hon?
Suddenly the girl's mask came down
Grill piece looks ill, skips town
Pieces of skin were here, there, everywhere
A horror flick and scare
Why do so much when it shouldn't be done?
There's someone for everyone
No, you had to go overboard
Lipstick, but lips got cold sores

Caked up make-up makes up the monster mash
Splash bubble bath, don't laugh
Not the natural look, but the truth rises to the top
Chop into the beauty shop flock, don't drop
Look in deep skin, then stop
If you see no wins, don't spend your ends
On those millions of hundreds, or even tens
Of pairs of pieces of horse hairs, tear upon
Ashes of trashes of where they shared food
Don't be rude, let self rule
Who'll be cool in the midst of confused
With this on the mind at the end of the mop 
Clean it up please, at the beauty shop

Build up a structure, imagine a fixture
Skip a paragraph, then develop a picture
Oo-wee, che-check out the brand new mixture
Artificial everything, sorry, Mister
How could you do your generical set-up?
And look faked up walkin the street lookin chopped up
Material's a thing you choose to get to strike a pose
Get cosmetic ears and get a cosmetic nose
No Siree, because you look wack, buddy
If looks were makin paper, you would be broke and ugly
Berries are suckin, yo, I wish you good luck
Walkin up the street and still your face looks fucked
Ain't no misbehavin, get outta here

He-he-he-ha-ha-ha...

[ VERSE 1 ]
Daddy's little girl, but not the girl that daddy knew
Daddy never had a clue of what his little girl would do
A drifter, swift to open up and get with ya
A pocket full of dreams, as for my love - forget ya
I never concentrated on the fact that I'm loved, scheme for scheme
And things that would lead me to a pipe dream
Picture it, yes, I'm daddy's little girl
I never asked for nothin, now it's a string of pearls
My chances are thin, could I win with a substance?
A princess with a smile, but my sweetness was sort of grim
I never fought the feelin that I had to be wild
Cause in my mind I was a mature child
But I could't hurt daddy, I played the role
But on the sneak tip, I was massagin his soul
Nikki had to be free, you see, I had to be me
Or life just wouldn't flow through correctly
Being daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 2 ]
Daddy'd always tuck me in bed and kiss me goodnight
Said, ""Nikki, sleep tight,"" then turn off the light
And when he goes away on a business trip
I flip, lose my grip - party time - ah shit!
Tell the girls, split the duty, one go pick up the booze
My other half, move your ass and go spread the news
The party went on, lasted all night long
Song after song (to the break of dawn)
Then watch some nasty porns in the morn'
My body got warm, hmm - from gettin freaky with Vaughn
Sexin like crazy, my body amazed me
By takin a chance with a man that didn't faze me
A night so hectic, a bit unexpected
Before I made love, I shoulda been protected
Cause now I'm in a jam with this careless punk
And in about 3 months my stomach will be plump
Trouble, yes, I'm in the hot seat now
Tell my pops? No way, no how
It'll break his heart, wreck his whole world
To have to grow up quick - daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 3 ]
Neighbors asked could he trust me, yeah, daddy loves me
Cause I can feel it in his arms strong when he hugs me
But there comes a time when his angel must spread her wings
So I bow my head and get deep into the swing of things
Sort of raunchy I must be, cause mama knew
Every time I skipped school mama sat home and sang the blues
Now I regret the day that daddy let me out to play
But I'm a woman now, so let's keep it this way
Daddy's little girl

But I'm daddy's little girl",Daddy's Little Girl

Damned if I'll be good, I turn this track to a gangster
And roll up on the bitties who are jokes and pranksters

Can be a painless paradise
An open canvas waiting
For someone to come inside

Oh, heaven knows all the lonely ones
All the ones that walk away from love
Oh, and I hope that I can learn again to trust
There is nothing that love can't overcome

Painting pictures of me
As I'm chasing the wind
Searching to fill my soul
With what I'll have to chase again

I grow tired of running
Oh, I need a place to stay
So paint me a kind of love
That I can't push away

Oh, heaven knows all the lonely ones
All the ones that walk away from love
Oh, and I hope that I can learn again to trust
There is nothing that love can't overcome

Oh, heaven knows all the lonely ones
All the ones that walk away from love
Oh, and I hope that I can learn again to trust

All the ones that walk away from love
Oh, and I hope that I can learn again to trust

Nikki Hassman,"Your voice is haunting me
Afraid and yet intrigued
One more step won't hurt
I'll get out before I'm burned

Reaching for just one touch
But then it's not enough
I feel this is wrong
Or is this where I belong

[Chorus]
Deep in the heart of fire
In ashes I would find you
Descending for your fall
Oh, I will meet you there
Deep in your darkest night
With ashes burning around you
With patience on your shoulder
Till you know I'm there

Sometimes I can't control
Emotions overflow
Before I even choose
I do what I don't want to do

You are just like a fire
With blazing colors
I can see your sense of grace
Impossible to embrace

You make me reckless
You make me feel right
I feel heat
And I want it to be mine
Oh, patience

Oh, you rapture me
In your eyes I escape
This lonely place

The sunlight shines away my fear
I've learned to believe
Cause you have taken me
From the cold and disillusion
Into the light of day

Say he’s gonna leave
He’s gonna ride on the settin’ sun
He ain’t scared to go there
He’s traveled before
But tonight’s gonna be his very last one

And it’s crazy all around
Rustlin’ in and rustlin’ out
The stereo’s playin’, we’re just passing time
And there ain’t much left to say here, cause when it all comes down
We’ve left it all up to the toss of the dime

Who’s gonna lay you down tonight?
Tears falling like pouring rain
And hold your hand while you wash away
Who’s gonna lay you down tonight?
Put aside the fear and the pain
And hold your hand while you die

She stands in the doorway
She’s got her head held high
She knows his time on earth is done
And that sparkle in his eye
As the sun falls from the sky
He says, my love you are the only one

I heard the news
They laid him in a black suit with flowers all around
The town is filled with strangers that love him still
They’ve come to see his burial ground

I say, who’s gonna lay you down?

Who who who
Who who who
Whooooooooo

Who’s gonna lay you down tonight?
Tears falling like pouring rain
And hold your hand while you wash away

Nikki Lane,"Well I heard tell of a woman out there
With tight blue jeans and long black hair
She'll come to play but she won't stay
And it always brings 'em down
Some folks say there will come a day
When she'll settle in some old town
But as best you know this long, long road
She ain't gonna come around

Sixty thousand miles of blacktop
Countless broken hearts between
Winding lies and wide but don't stop
Living the life of the highway queen
She's decided, leaves your party
Haunts your mind like a melody
You can tie her down with a Marlboro Light
But the highway queen don't need no king

Well one or two, they might have broken through
They might have nearly roped her in
But a fire like that is far too hot
It's gonna burn and burn again
Seasons fade and so does the pain
It blows away like a like a tumbleweed
You can't blame the girl for loving this old world
She can't help it she's a highway queen

Sixty thousand miles of blacktop
Countless broken hearts between
Winding lies and wide but don't stop
Living the life of the highway queen

But the highway queen don't need no king
Highway queen don't need no king

Well miles and miles she keeps on rolling
Place your bets if you ain't folding
Miles and miles, no sign of slowing
It ain't who she loves, it's who she's holding

Nikki Leonti,"It's true to each heart comes a little pain
Lord, in each life falls a little rain
But if I look there's a rainbow in the sky
A ray of hope when a shadow passes by
A silver lining just behind the darkest cloud
All the promise that I need to say out loud

[Chorus: ]
Every moment is another gift of life
I'm grateful for each minute, Lord, of walking in your light
Every moment is an opportunity
To dedicate myself to living all you have for me
Every moment

Time, I only have what's in today
Lord, help me to use what slips away
We never know for tomorrow may not come
Our lives appear then like a vapor they are gone

I want to treasure each day you give to me
Live it as though it's the last I'll ever see

Nikki Leonti,"I know you're waiting
For the light at the end
Of this tunnel that you're going through
Anticipating
What lies around the bend
Wondering what He has in store for you
Rest in His will
Keep the faith in prayer until
You see what He provides...

[CHORUS]
It'll come to you
Like a beacon into view
There's a light that will shine through
It'll come to you
Seek Him first in all you do
And when you least expect it to
It'll come to you

Looking back through
The pages of your past
There's a story of His faithfulness
When you come to
The chapter's end at last
You will see it turn out for the best
It'll be alright
Even in the darkest night, just hold out for the dawn...

Nikki Leonti,"We spoke with the tongues of angels
But we didn't have love, no we didn't have love
We had faith that could move any mountain
But it wasn't enough, 'cause we didn't have love
We had wings but we did not fly
We had vision but we didn't have sight
Can we forgive, so the whole world can live


CHORUS 
Love, Love one another
Leaving the past, believing in the power of love
Love one another
'Cause we're all in this together
Love one another


No one would live forever
If it wasn't for love, God's love
No one would stay together
If it wasn't for love


Disillusioned by the stained-glass sea
But there is truth for those that hope and believe
Now I can see, that the greatest of these is love

Leaving the past, believing in the power of love
Love one another
'Cause we're all in this together
Love one another.

Just let me be, where life is sweet

Nikki Leonti,"I'm falling down over my own shoelaces
Trying to run with the crowd
I'm head over heels in the wrong direction
Until now


Yeah, well, I'm thinkin about it here's what I see
Somehow there seems to be two of me
The one in the mirror
And one that's been redeemed


CHORUS
Liberate my heart
Emancipate my soul
Forgive the sin in me
And make me whole


Every now and then I go through phases
But I'm like a bird flying free
Then all of a sudden the old man awakens
And captures me
And then the good that I would
Is not what I do
When goodness is with me
Evil is too
So I come to you, Father, God, asking this of you

My love has come along
My lonely days are over 
and life is like a song

Skies above are blue
My heart wrapped up in clover

I found a dream that I can speak to 
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

The moon may be high

You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me

It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts, and the summer windLike painted kites
those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky

Then softer than, a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind
The autumn wind and the winter winds they have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end

Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
And you say that I'm the only one, the only one, yeah
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star?

In the times of 1791
During the French revolution
As the church of Salon tollet the bell
Seven soldiers were approaching

They were drunk from wine and victory
Marching their way home
When nature called an urgent stop
By the shadow
Of the dome

We were brothers in arms
With a mission in life
Standing on holy ground

But the church is just an implement
Of fear to push us round

""Under the oak lightning strikes in Cienne
Long centuries grabbed""

All in a flash of light ...
""Found shall die eye pierced by a spring
Doomed by destiny stabbed""
With picks and shovels we broke the piece
Of the tombstone never dared
As the locals gathering in fear

(As the locals gathering in fear
To meet again our seer)

So I proposed a brazen toast
Drinking from his scull
I don't believe, I fear no ghost

(He don't believe,
He fears no ghost

Your legend is so dull
And Lord Mayor himself
Held his speech of rebuke
""Please, let the dead rest in peace""
Heard the prophet of Woe laugh and sing
""I gave you a fair warning""
""Under the oak lightning strikes in Cienne
Long centuries grabbed""

I warned you all ...
""Found shall die eye pierced by a spring
Doomed by destiny stabbed""
And later on next morning
By the break of dawn
As the sun of grace revealed it's righteous face
To witness seven soldiers die
A minor death just another stitch
In our violent history
To become my destiny

""Under the oak lightning strikes in Cienne
Long centuries grabbed""

All in a flash light 
""Found shall die eye pierced by a spring

Now it's time to put the question on you

I have come to the fork in the road
And now I want to hear what you say
In the quiet of the morning

Now I wonder whan I was young
In a dream that you walked right on by
Still I wonder if I was wrong
Any scheme that I know you will try
You live in the future
You spoken the word
And I am still King of this land
And I don't fear nothing
And I walk alone
And I might be taking you life
I don't believe, I don't believe !

Should I ask him ? 
Should I take him ?
Should I break him ?
Now, who is you master ?
There's a cold wind blowing faster
You're the healer of mindless disaster

I have come to the fork in the road
And now I want to hear what you say
Dying second of the hour 

Now I wonder when I was young
In a dream that you walked right on by
Still I wonder if I was wrong
Any scheme that I know you will try
You live in the future
You spoken the word
And I am still King of this land
And I don't fear nothing
And I walk alone
And I might be taking you life

So, where do I go ?
And there, there is no fate
All of my life, I've been told
Deep in my destiny
Inside my darkest hour
I will fall, will I fall ?
Can you hear me ?

Your majesty, my King
This man is a master of spell
He spoke some words
He'll take advantage of you
There's a danger but you won't even see
In the morning I beg you
Never play ""live or die""
So I ask you, listen to me
Beware of this prophecy, oh yeah 

Now I wonder when I was young
In a dream that you walked right on by
Still I wonder if I was wrong

Were frightened by all of the things that he knew

Eat of the dead

The highest fulfillment of man
Is to become food for the crawling things
That burrow and slither in human flesh
Unceasing in mindless hunger
Remorseless undefiled by reason
The worms of the tomb they are pure

Their purity elevates them
Above the putrefying pride of our race

The destiny of man is merely to be
The nourishment of the worm
Yet their excrement bestows higher wisdom

From decay arises new life
Fill myself with that which rots
And I shall be reborn

By writhing upon my belly like a mindless worm
I shall rise up in awareness of truth
I gnaw upon my own decaying flesh
And my mind is forever purged of the corruption of faith

Believe in nothingness
There is no purpose in birth
No blessedness after death
Only oblivion

Eat of the dead
Lest I be consumed by the emptiness

Nile,"Abandon hope
And I shall become free
And with freedom acquire emptiness
With the mind cleansed and empty

There is the void known as despair
A gateway upon an emptiness endless and vast

In despair the language of the shadows is intelligible
In madness all sounds become articulate

Terror and despair they guide me
Into nightmares that follow one upon the other
Like windblown grains of sand

I have become as the wastelands
Of unending nothingness
Now shall the night things
Fill me with their whisperings
And the shadows reveal their wisdom

Ra maketh thee to burn
Thou who art hateful unto him

Ra pierceth thy head

Ra melteth thine countenance
Lo your skull is crushed in His hand
Thy bones are smashed in pieces

Burn thou fiend before the fire of the eye of Ra
The hidden one hath overthrown thy words
The Gods have turned thy face backwards
Thy skull is ripped from thy spine

Thy lynx hath torn open thy breast
The scorpion hath cast fetters open thee
Maat hath sent forth thy destruction
Thou shalt burn

The God Aker
Hath condemned thee to the flames

Fire be upon thee, Apep
Thou enemy of Ra
Let flames gnaw into thee
And sear thy flesh

Fall down, Apep

Taste thou death, Apep
The burning is upon you

Thou art consumed
I hath lain fire upon thee
I hath smeared thy remains with excrement
I hath spat on thine ashes
Taste thou death

It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted
      
I was an impossible case
No-one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know

The name of the game

I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know
       
What's the name of the game?  (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)

I try to reach for you.  but you have closed my mind
Whatever happened to our love?  I wish I understood
It used to be so nice.  It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?
 
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out. I wish I understood

Soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breath and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park
Summer night city

It's elusive
Call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow
When it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream
It's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

I wanna sing it out to everybody

Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still strivin' for the sky, no taste for humble pie

No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

I was once a married man livin' peacefully
Hard to say exactly when the devil blinded me
But there was some confusion when my sweet wife left this world
Darker times, drunken crimes, a dead young working girl
Left a jailer there in Caroline, watching me from down below

Runnin' from my fame
Blowin' where the wind blows
Where no one knows my name

In the El Vaquero Bar in the town of Eagle Pass
Moments from my freedom warm whiskey in my glass
Some Borracho took me for the man who stole his wife
He went for his forty-four as I reached for my knife
He never fired a second shot, he was just too slow
My new life is waiting in old Mexico

I hear of hidden harbors south of Mazatlan
Where cool spring mountain waters meet the warm Pacific sun
I pray the miles I've traveled and all the sins I bear
Burn away like mornin' fog and vanish in the air

Nimo, Habeebee

Camp Nou, Nachwuchs, Habibi, bin der
Auf den du gewartet hast, kein Facebook-Rapper mehr (ja, echt)
Wie kann es sein, dass du mich verstehst?
Gestern Freestyle auf Hofgang, heute Deutschlandtournee
Denn von fünf Megapixel zu Ultra HD
Gestern Smartphone, heute 6k-Qualität
Idéal ist mein Team, setzt Hoffnung in mich
Gib mir die Idéal-Quote, 385 Ibrahimovic
Nimo ist extravagant, aber trotzdem bescheiden
Alle Habibis, die mich kennen, wissen, was ich meine
Was ich meinen Feinden rate ist, dass wenn wir uns begegnen
Sie sich's gut überlegen sollten, wie sie sich bewegen
Jede Aktion spürt 'ne Reaktion, die direkt zu effektiv ballert wie Flexkristalle
Idéal, der Rest ist kharra
Setz den Süden wieder auf die Landkarte
Stuttgart, Feuerbachhood, deux deux neuf ma ville

Und sauer und wollte viel Dollar, Dollar, Dollar
Fühl mich beobachtet vom allsehenden Auge im Dreieck
Dollar ist mehr als nur Geld, Dollar vergiftet die Welt
Dollar ist der Teufel selbst, Dollar ist eine Message
Doch bei wem kommt sie an?
Sag mir, wie nimmst du sie auf, ha?
Hast du sie überhaut verstanden?
Sag, ja wir führen Kriege aus dem Grund, dass am Ende Dollar auf der Bank sind
Hab als Kind Dollar gesehen, MTV hat uns vergiftet
Dollar im Videoclip, Soulja Make it Rain war Plan des Systems

Starting believing in love again

You rescued me and showed me the way

You must be an angel

And it keeps on getting better baby
Caught up in your love spell
Feels like I'm in heaven, heaven

Never thought I'd see the day
A special guy like you would come my way
I wish I knew the reasons why
You gave me the strength for one more try

How could love at first sight work out so right
I can't believe this is paradise
Just when I thought love would never come
You came to me swept me away

You must be an angel
Feels like I've gone to heaven
And it keeps on getting better baby
Caught up in your love spell
Feels like I'm in heaven, heaven

At the wrong time
Guess I always knew inside

Are shining on distant shores

But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours
Will come to see

Sometimes good-byes are not forever
It doesn't matter if you're gone
I still believe in us together
I understand more than you think I can
You have to go out on your own

And somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours
Will come to see
That you belong with me

Letting go is just another way to say
I'll always love you so

Maybe the best is yet to come

Nina,"When I was a child, the story would say 
Somebody will sweep you off your feet some day

Much to my surprise

I may never get to kiss you goodnight 
I may never get to look deep in your eyes

All the happiness that I could find

From the moment I wake up till I fall asleep 
I imagine you're not with her but with me 
Talkin' and laughin', sharin' our dreams

I had to watch you turn around 
Walk away without a sound

What if you would forgive me
I would do anything
To undo what I did last night
What if I could turn back time
Back when you would believe me
Would you help me instead 
To unsay what I said last night
What if wrong could turn ro right

We're not supposed to share 
Our destiny like this
All the plans that we have made
Can't let them fade away, fade away

When you're near it wraps me up
Now I find the space to feel thrill
Like the water it fills me with peace

When you near me again I still breathe within
And now that you're at my side
Your soul in mine
But I long for your touch
It's hurting so much

You give me, give me colored kisses
Colored kisses for my lips to taste,ah-ah
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay

My head on your shoulder and pray
What else can I do?
Cause all I want is more and more
Colored kisses from you

Yellow is the sun that shines on me
Like your smile it sets me free
Seasons change to blacken my mood
When I falter my heart goes astray
I remember the nights when you'd take me away
Because when I'm at your side
I'm safe and warm but I'm never alone
My heart is your home

You give me, give me colored kisses
Colored kisses for my lips to taste,ah-ah
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray
And that no one can take me from you
And no one can break us in two
So lift it up in the clouds set me free
And let your rainbow all out shine on me

Come back... come back... come back

You lead me, lead me to an oasis

And mail it right away

Nina Gerber,"Though Adam was a friend of mine, 
I did not know him well 
He was alone into his distance 
He was deep into his well 
I could guess what he was laughing at, 
But I couldn't really tell 
Now the story's told that Adam jumped, 
But I've been thinking that he fell 

Together we went traveling, 
As we received the call 
His destination India, 
And I had none at all 
Well, I still remember laughing 
With our backs against the wall 
So free of fear, we never thought 
That one of us might fall 

I sit before my only candle, 
But it's so little light to find my way 
Now this story unfolds before my candle 
Which is shorter every hour 
As it reaches for the day 
But I feel just like a candle in the way 
I guess I'll get there, but 
I wouldn't say for sure 

When we parted we were laughing still, 
As our goodbyes were said 
And I never heard from him again 
As each our lives we led 
Except for once in someone else's 
Letter that I read 
Until I heard the sudden word 
That a friend of mine was dead 

I sit before my only candle, 
Like a pilgrim sits beside the way 
Now this journey appears before my candle 
As a song that's growing fainter 
The harder that I play 
But I fear before I end I'll fade away 
But I guess I'll get there, 
Though I wouldn't say for sure 

Though Adam was a friend of mine, 
I did not know him long 
And when I stood myself beside him, 
I never though I was as strong 
Still it seems he stopped his singing 
In the middle of his song 
Well I'm not the one to say I know, 
But I'm hoping he was wrong 

I'm holding out my only candle, 
Though it's so little light to find my way 
Now this story's been laid beneath my candle 
And it's shorter every hour 
As it reaches for the day 
Yes, I feel just like a candle in the way

Nina Gerber,"Well I've been out walking 
I don't do that much talking these days 
These days,
These days I seem to think a lot 
About the things that I forgot to do 
For you 
And all the times I had the chance to 

And I had a lover 
It's so hard to risk another these days 
These days,
Now if I seem to be afraid 
To live the life I have made in song 
Well it's just that I've been losing so long 

I'll keep on moving 
Things are bound to be improving these days 
These days,
These days I sit on corner stones 
And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend 
Don't confront me with my failures 
I had not forgotten them",These Days
Nina Gordon,"Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
If you don't love me anymore. 

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love. 

[Chorus:]
I wake up in the morning and I wonder.
Why everything is the same as it was.
And I can't understand,
No I can't understand Why life goes on the way it does. 

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when we said goodbye. 

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning and I wonder.
Why everything is the same as it was.

No I can't understand Why life goes on the way it does.

And why do these eyes of mine cry?

Why?

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Give me the chance to express
My big love is a big success
I always wanted to ask you this:
Do you really know what love is?
Love is to help one another
To give and to share like a good mother
Now if you are Italian, English or German
Doesn't make a difference even if your name's Herman
You will find your counterpart
And you know it in your heart
Your love is all that matters
Only love can sex us

And across deserts of death
I've travelled from time to time
To find at last your velvet soft cushion of revelation
And with the softest touch of tenderness
I'm wearing your costume of graceful bliss
My wings of rainbows strive to paradise
Of ecstatic peace and holy love

There's more than enough at the fountain of joy
Where tears of love I cry
I'm getting bolder and bolder
I'm already leaning on your shoulder
Hey, it's no crap
But I want to sit on your lap

Most definitely I hopped from one existence to another
And I will keep on jumpin' gaily
From one pleasure blade to another
Until I rest on the save ground of your divine lingam

Tell of God, the personification of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss.
Proclaim holy Lord Shiva with the Goddess Mother,
The Sustainer, Inspirer, and World Master.

Hail, hail to Lord Haidakhan,
Who incarnated for the liberation of the world.

Thou alone art my true divine Master,
Shiva invisible, unperceivable, highest God.

Your heart is very full of mercy,
One who surrenders to you is immediately liberated.

What pain in the world cannot be removed,
Instantly by your grace, O king of sages?

You always speak words which remove our fear.
Baba fulfills all desires.

Oh Lord, you are the source of auspiciousness, the remover of evil.
I sacrifice everything at your lotus feet.

Great Sage, you speak very sweetly, extremely benevolently,
Your sentences are the essence of knowledge.

The true eternal religion, full of generosity,
Tells of knowledge combined with holy work.

Each one's own duty is good for him,
Jealousy and hatred are not.
Truth, simplicity and love, brother,
This duty alone brings man happiness.

Meditate on the Lord's name, brother, to purify the heart.
Find the Lord sitting in your heart.

Holy Shiva is residing in your heart.
Find him there, leave ignorance and disappointment behind.
The great saint, an ocean of all qualities,
Whose beginning and end nobody knows.

Haidakhan is a wonderful place
Very holy giving joy and solace.
The roar of the Gautama Ganga is heard day and night,
Siddhas, gods and demons worship there every day.

Holy mount Kailash, so beautiful,
Looking at it, the mind yearns for it.
Under that mountain is a beautiful cave,
That great cave is described in the Vedas.

The wild animals wandering in the dense forest,
They forget all enmity among themselves.
Since the Lord started living here,
The ""Garden of the Heaven's"" beauty faded in comparison.

All glory to this holy place is ours,
Which Shiva enjoys as his living place.
Thy merciful look gives love of Thy holy feet.

By no other method can one get a pure mind.
Now Lord, show me grace in this way,
Let me renounce all and do meditation day and night.

All forms are one, Thou, mother goddess Amba",Omhaidakhandi

Breaking waves around me

Stormy tides and I feel
My ship capsizing

Out of sight, saving shore
Ever gone, evermore

Ropes untied, rain that pours
The waters rising

In devastating times
I keep this hope of mine
Even in the darkest night

Guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage

There in the sky
Hiding away
Never to die and fade

Nina Nastasia,"I had a dream about a dog
I was walking in an amusement park
With people all around me

We rode the roller coaster rides
And he was laughing as we
Jumped to the sky
And I saw that I looked just like him

It's a dog's life
I want to lead a dog's life
Run to the woods, dig a hole
Just him and me

He showed me all the various scented treasures on the ground
There was a little girl, and she was scared of me, and I was scared of her
He let out a bark then she screamed
Dropped her chocolate ice cream
Suddenly this old man chased us 'til we jumped the fence

It's a dog's life
I want to lead a dog's life
Under the couch, chew a bone
Just him and me

He ran across the street and barely missed a speeding car
Suddenly this old man grabbed him from around the corner
I hid behind a big trash can, wondered â??What's become of him?â??
I tried to stay, but curiosity kills me",A Dog's Life
Nina Nastasia,"Jimmy Rose owns a tattoo parlor
Three times a day
Cooks a spoon of powder
I wash the dishes piled in his tub
If I wait too long he may never stand up
Up

He lies awake on an empty canvas
And tilts his brush
Watching brilliance drip circles on the floor
And I lay his shirt on the bed
I fall inside picture frames
Breathing in his oil paints
He doesn't see me
He wanders in
His mouth looks thin
Like a child who stands there shaking
I can feel his anger choke me

To pay off the doctor that he prescribes
There's kerosene in the wishing well

With gravel in her shoes
She's playing in the spotlight
No sugar with that pose

And everywhere that Judy is

Across his frozen cheek, too close to touch

He looks happier than any other day
He won't go out with me
I don't care if I never see his face

Sometimes I want to get out of here.

Everyone's talking about you behind the gym.
They're sharing cigarettes,
Drinking beer out of coke cans,
They're saying what a waste,
You must have been loaded
Tearing down Pacific Coast Highway.

Bradley,
I think you got away.

[Chorus]
Someone found a blue Ford
Twisted up and glass all around.
There was a girl with you.
Nobody knew her.

Your step dad was called in
To say he recognized you.
Everyone knew you
And said it was a waste.

While you scream past my head
Fly away, fly away
I wonder what you said

And I'm watching you
Bare your teeth in a growl
Throwing your way
Back and forth 'til now

And I'm here in oblivion
I don't feel anything
Well, it's time to begin again
I won't remember anything at all

Could it be something that I said
It's making you good, boys and hens in my bed
And I would feel sorry if I could
So fly away, fly away, if you think you should

I'm in oblivion

Out on the highway waiting down
Buffalo rumble in the wind

And watch the hell lights coming down on me

Let yourself go
I hear them say
It's beautiful
I'm not afraid
This is ""happy"" ever after

Oh, my my security
Is running in circles over me
But I don't think I'll stick around

A dance we weave beneath our skin
I keep you in me where the breath had been

I can hear them laugh and call me minnow
Carrying on, coughing on my bones

But I'm counting up your bones
I'm counting up your bones

Inside of me
Inside of me

Your bones fall in

Beside your heart

Tumbling and left out to dry alone

Nina Nastasia,"Dumb I am and a weak one too
A simpleton my wool worn loose
Once all the filthy flies I free
And there they go nothing I can do

Dumb I am and a long day dream
A simpleton with a memory
A home prepared and a feast as well
But all will spoil with the lies I tell

Dumb I am and I have no kin
A simpleton can be my sin
No mother to greet me with the sun
No father to call when the work is done

Dumb I am but a clever lot
Making good with the deal I got
With no one with a care for me
Alone I go and okay I'll be

Nina Nastasia,"In the back of the house in the room I used to sleep
I woke up and smelled burning wires

For a month I wasn't me
A thief would wait for me outside

There were nights I would let him in

No one ever found out

I always wondered, Francis, where you lived

Standing proudly in the tub
I never saw you in your clothes

In the back of the house in the room right next to mine

The only place she let you smoke
There you spent most of your time

Painting pictures of smoke",Jim's Room
Nina Nastasia,"I remember
The hail of red clay rocks
Fom your lame chucking arm
The boys, the hill

And the wild lines home from work
Silent stairs we crept before your mom at the tv had a clue
She never talked to me or to you

But when we would have a game
Up there she would shout your name
And the record we'd hush
She'd go away
We'd dim the light in your room
And we would play

You were more like a girl every time
We'd fall asleep to the tune as the walls spun round

Light flashed, life stopped
With you, lee
Under bed sheets
A tent we had made there
Were things as I remember
Hard things for you as a man you left angry

Oh Lee, how a child can wine
I'm done telling lies to mine
There's no deal in it all
He needs to hear

All the things we're pining for
All that's carried far from sure
We were bitter about what remains
I'm not telling him now
Just the same
You were a dream when you painted your eyes
Mighty you were like a sail on a heaving sky",Lee

Let my dog go down deep in that old wishing well
And I know that they'll find it
She'll make a big scene hoping no one will notice

And I feel that when night falls I need it
And here I waste and I hustle myself

Why a little crime can make for a life this bad
It escapes me
But I know I'm not aloud to hold on too tightly to what has gone

And down at my new home
All of my family smiles in my face
But I've lost all the seconds that lead up to this
And I know that something will happen
If I don't take charge it might all disappear

And I fell that when night falls I need it
And here I wake and I trouble myself
Buy a little time from memories left alive
If they'll let me
But I know I'm not allowed to hold on too tightly to what has gone
Oh, to what has gone

And I stand down in a brick hole
Thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking at them
The scariest man calls down from the opening
And tells me that I won't be thinking again

And I feel that when night falls I breathe it in
Here I wait and I ready myself

Let's not wait to leave the city
We've got just enough money

let's see how far we can amble
One day can make all the difference
Brings the red dirt into water

can you stay with me and tell them you're sick
I'll pack us a meal for our day trip

we'll be save out in the sun
We'll split a bottle on a boat
Two souls alone now on a lake

it will be the perfect afternoon
We can loose our clothes and have a swim

your free hand waving from the gate
The medal shining at your waist
You had so much more ambition

Nina Nastasia,"Summer headlights cut into the dawn
We city kids ride the highway unboundry
We were like a pioneer's sons
Counting all the coins that we'd won
In our hands

Running rooftops like the river boys do
Kiss me once and you say I love you
You make it cold in my heart
But promise you will never leave me behind

Sleepy-eyed you wait for tomorrow
And I know that you'll marry some day
And I can only lie down as your mistress
'Cause I gave you away
Our innocence lost in the plan

Better endings are what we have now
Weary friends keeping good on a vow
But there is a part of me
Still telling me to go and feelings arise

Just a roof of woven reeds
You and I
On the highest front
Of a very tall tree

Months and months we'd stay up high
Because all the climbing takes such time
And we'd live on the blooms carried in by the breeze

Every night I promise you
We'd go down to see the friends we once knew
But every night I'd make an excuse

And I never came down from the roof
I awoke and you had flown
Just an impression of you next to me
And the terrible sound of the clapping of leaves

Where you'll never be
Hungry or lost no stranger

Not much I can think of
We cut down the oak last year
I know you can't stay very long

Don't ask me, that's something that you destroyed,

We were rushed, we had no foundations
Explanations were never settled first.
I guess when building something special
You should always use ground work
'Cause now we're falling down, falling down. (Hey, Hey)

I could blame you for a lot
But I guess it was me that let us drop.

And I'm left looking not so hot,

And I can hold to the memories

And this distance between us has come and cut us clean as
A sharp blade
And this distance between us has made my heart as weak as
Silk that's frayed

And I just wanna hold ya, hold ya, hold ya, now
You're the one that keeps me, keeps me, on the ground
I just wanna hold ya, hold ya, hold ya, now
Can we turn this knife the blunt way around

And I sleep next to my window
In case you decide to come home

Bare feet on the sand

See the boys next door
On their way to Magaluf
Matching T-shirts
They're school leavers
It's gonna be off the hook
But I just wanna lay under
The northern sky with you
Until our lips turn from red to white to blue

Turns out lobsters aren't just food
Pack your tent and pack your crate

Yo quise querer pero no podía

Los paisajes más bellos
Viven en la mente de los ciegos
Y la esperanza mas fuerte surge

De los que no tienen remedio
Todavía
Yo no me creo que te tengo

Qué pena

En su mirada tan profunda y sin igual
Cuando intento describir no hallo la Forma de expressar
Lo hermoso del amor que el a mi me da
Y asi como la hiedra en la pared
Asi sentirme cuando estoy con el
Como si fuera perla en el fondo del mar
Mi amado es señalado entre diez mil
Y me confieso suya hasta el fin
Me vestire de blanco y le dare
Mi vida por conpleto a el

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

I can't face tomorrow since my love has gone
He's left me left me for another and my heart went with him

Was our love a game played for a day
Were you pretending two hearts gone astray

Beloved how I long to hold you in my arms enfold you
Live again out happiness but now I can face tomorrow alone

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It's my own fault for what happens to my heart

Just find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Well, I know they make you sad
They make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me like you should
Folks got ways to make you feel no good
I'd guess they've got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And boy, you never lied to me
And the part of you they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me

Barry Gibb wrote this song in 1966, when he was twenty.
The first recording of this song was by Ronnie Burns in Australia. It was a top 20 hit for him in Australia in July 1967. The Abi and Esther Ofarim version was also out in mid 1967 on a single. They worked mainly in Europe, not the US, including Germany where the Bee Gees were very, very popular, but I just don't know whether it was a hit single. 



The Bee Gees version was first out on the movie soundtrack album Melody at the start of 1971, by the way. Best of vol.2, 1973 is the first actual Bee Gees album that had it. This is their second recording of it; that first one, was recorded as a demo by Bee Gees in late 1966 and first released in 1970 on the Inception / Nostalgia 2-LP set.",In the Morning

I got my tongue, I got my chin
I got my neck, I got my boobies
I got my heart, I got my soul
I got my back, I got my sex

I got my feet, I got my toes
I got my liver, got my blood

Got life, I got my life",Ain't Got No (I Got Life)

Nina Simone,"To be young, gifted and black,
Oh what a lovely precious dream
To be young, gifted and black,
Open your heart to what I mean

In the whole world you know
There are billion boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black,
And that's a fact!

Young, gifted and black
We must begin to tell our young
There's a world waiting for you
This is a quest that's just begun

When you feel really low
Yeah, there's a great truth you should know
When you're young, gifted and black
Your soul's intact

How I long to know the truth
There are times when I look back
And I am haunted by my youth

Is that we can all be proud to say

Is where it's at","To Be Young, Gifted and Black"
Nina Simone,"Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time

For who knows how my love grows?
And who knows where the time goes? 
",Who Knows Where the Time Goes?
Nina Simone,"Because I have loved so deeply
Because I haved loved so long

Gave me the gift of song

Because I have loved so vainly
Sung with such faltering breath
Oh, oh, oh, the Master in
His infinite mercy
Offers the boon of death",Compensation
Nina Simone,"Streets full of people, all alone
Roads full of houses, never home
A church full of singing, out of tune
Everyone's gone to the moon

Eyes full of sorrow, never wet
Hands full of money, all in debt
Sun coming out in the middle of June
Everyone's gone to the moon

You see a long time ago, life had begun
Everyone went to the sun

Parks full of motors, painted green
Mouths full of chocolate-covered cream
Arms that can only lift a spoon
You see everyone's gone, everybody's gone
Everyone's gone to the moon
Everyone's gone to the moon

What will happen now?
Everyone's gone to the moon
There's nobody left
Everyone's gone to the moon

Nina Simone,"No one seems to care as much
No time to smile, laugh or cry as much

Have we lost the human touch

No one wants to be alone
To walk or talk and sleep and weep alone
Have we lost the touch that does so much
Have we lost the human touch

Hold me tight so i can go
Through this misery unafraid

All the love and the life
That you know and say

Nina Simone,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the house and weep your heart out
And cry your eyes out and rack your brain

You say it and wonder, how anyone is wonderful as he
Could 'cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven, but I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain",In Love in Vain

I used to smile and say hello. Guess I was just a happy guy. 
Then you happened,girl, this feeling that posessses me. 
I just can't move myself. I guess it all just had to be.

[Chorus]
I can't see nobody... no, I can't see nobody.
Mine eyes can only look at you...you.

I used to have a brain; I used to think of many things. 
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing. 
Don't ask me why, little girl. I love you and that's all I can say.
You're ev'ry ,ev'ry breath I take.You are my nights; my night and day.

[Chorus]

Every single word you hear...is coming from this heart of mine.
I never felt like this before...a love like yours so young and fine.
And now as I try to forget you...it doesn't work out any way.
I loved you such a long time ago...but in my eyes you'll always be.
Every single word you hear...is coming from this heart of mine.
I loved you such a long time ago...don't know why...
And I don't know why...baby...

Nina Simone,"They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see the light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
So, I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere inside these walls

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Yonder standing me in this lonely crowd
A man who says he's not to blame
All day long I hear him hollering so loud
Just crying out that he's not to blame

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released",I Shall Be Released
Nina Simone,"When you're lost in Juarez
And it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through

Don't put on any airs
When you're down on rue morgue avenue
They got some hungry women there
And man, they really make a mess out of you

If you see Saint Annie
Tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
And my fingers are all in a knot

And I haven't got the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend the doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got

Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room

And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And then she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

Up on project hill
It's either fortune or fame
You can take one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim

And If you're looking to get silly
You'd better go back from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man, they expect the same

All the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post

And picking up my brother Carl
who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking like a ghost

Well, that's it folks, that's it

Well I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough

Ah, but the joke was on me
There was no-one there even to bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough",Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues
Nina Simone,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river 
You can hear the boats go by 
You can spend the night beside her 
And you know that she's half crazy 
But that's why you want to be there 
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China 

And just when you mean to tell her 
That you have no love to give her 
Then she gets you on her wavelength 
And she lets the river answer 

That you've always been her lover 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that she will trust you 
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind. 

And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 

And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said ""All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them"" 

But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 

And you want to travel with him 
And you want to travel blind 
And you think maybe you'll trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. 

Now Suzanne takes your hand 
And she leads you to the river 
She is wearing rags and feathers 
From Salvation Army counters 

And the sun pours down like honey 
On our lady of the harbour 
And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 

There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever 

While Suzanne holds the mirror 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that you can trust her 
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.",Suzanne
Nina Simone,"Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Above you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin', changin'

Come writers and critics
Who prophesy with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who
It'll be namin'
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin', changin'

Come senators and congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside
It's ragin'
I will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin', they're changin'

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
For your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
The old road is
Rapidly fadin'
Please get out of the way
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin', they're changin'

The line it is drawn now
And the curse it is cast
AND The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is
Rapidly fadin'
Oh the first one now
Will later be last

A time to laugh, a time to weep

A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together

A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracing

A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew

A time of peace, I swear it's not too late",Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)
Nina Simone,"And now, the end is near and so I got to face 
The final curtain, girl
Friends I say clear and state her case of which I'm uncertain
I've lived a life that's full of travelled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yeah, regrets, I've had a few
But then again, who feel to me uncertain.
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each other course, each careful footstep along the byway,
Yeah, and more, much more than this,
I did my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know
When I did all much more than I could do
But threw it all, when there was doubt, on everyday
And it's not enough, I faced it all 
And as big as all did my way.

Oh, I've laughed and cried, had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, counted also music
To think like the old lad
And may I say not in a sky away,
Oh, no no no, You're not me, I did it my way.

What is a man, what have he got
If not himself, and he had not to may the things 
He truly feels not words of one for use
With that shows, I took the blows and did it my way!

Nina Simone,"There is music for lovers
It to be found
In the sound
Of a sigh.
And there's music for lovers
In the hush-a-bye dreams
Of a child.
When the whole world discovers
That love's the only thing worthwhile.
Then there'll be music for everyone
And the whole world will smile.

In the willow tree
Made for you and me
There's a silver symphony of birds.
When the poets rhyme
In the summer time
You'll hear melodies
In the words.

There is music for lovers
It to be found
In the stream
Running wild.
And there's music for lovers
In the hush-a-bye dreams
Of you child.
When the whole world discovers
That love is the only thing worthwhile
There'll be music for everyone
And the whole world will smile.

Nina Simone,"My father always promised me
That we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance

We lived in Ohio then
He worked in the mines
On his dreams like boats 
We knew we would sail in time

All my sisters soon were gone
To Denver and Cheyenne
Marrying their grownup dreams
The lilacs and the man

I stayed behind the youngest still
Only danced alone
The colors of my father's dreams
Faded without a sound

And I live in Paris now
My children dance and dream
Hearing the ways of a miner's life
In words they've never seen

I sail my memories of home
Like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun
As it sets in my father's eyes again

Always danced with worn out shoes
The silver hair, a ragged shirt
And bare ragged paints

I met him in a New Orleans cafè
He was down and out

His dog up and died, dog up and died
After twenty years he still grieved

He said, I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars
He said, I drink a bit

I heard someone ask, please

Nina Simone,"I remember this afternoon
When my sister came into the room
She refused to say how my father was
But I knew he'd be dying soon.

And I was oh so glad, and it was oh so sad
That I realized that I despised this man I once called father.
In his hanging on, with fingers clutching
His body now just eighty-eight pounds
Blinded eyes still searching
For some distant dream that had faded away at the seams.
Dying alone, naturally.

I was his favourite child, I had him a little while
Just as long as I could play the piano and smile a little smile
Just when I needed him most, he was already a ghost
And for all my life there where promises and they always have been broken

Leaving me alone with all my troubles
Not ever once touching me and saying
""Daugther, I'll help you get over.""
Now he's fadig away and I'm glad to say,
He's dying at last. Naturally.

It's a very sad thing to see that my mother with all her heart
Believes the words that the Bible said ""Til death do us two part"".
For her that was forever and ay, he decided her night and day
How could some English words so small affect someone so strangely?

Taking her away from us, her soul included
She might es well be gone with him, all the children are excluded.
Loneliness is hell, I know so well,
For I'm alone. Naturally.

I waited three weeks for him to die
I waited three weeks for him to die
Every night he was calling on me
I wouldn't go to him.
I waited three weeks for him to die
Three weeks for him to die.

And after he died, after he died
Every night I went out, every night I had a flight.
It didn't matter who it was with
'Cos I knew what it was about.
And if you could read between lines, my Dad and I close as flies.
I loved him then and I loved him still, that's why my heart's so broken.

Leaving me to doubt God in His Mercy
And if He really does exist then why does He desert me?
When he passed away I smoked and drank all day,
Alone. Again. Naturally.",Alone Again Naturally

I got laughs, sister

Nina Simone,"I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I've got to go 'way
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice.

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Put some music on while I pour.

The neighbors might think
But baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell.

I oughta say no no no sir
Mind if I move a bit closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Oh baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside

I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is No
Ooh baby it's cold outside
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm.

My sister will be suspicious
My your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a half-a-drink more
Never such a blizzard before.

I've got to get home
But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me a coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
Your eyes are like starlight now*
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old doubt,
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside

It's cold out side.
It's cold out side.

Nina Simone,"I was never one for singing what I really feel 
Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real 

Stars, they come and go, they come fast or slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
Hey but it gets lonely there when there's no one here to share 
We can shake it away, if you'll hear a story 

People lust for fame like athletes in a game, 
we break our collarbones and come up swinging, 
some of us are downed 
some of us are crowned, and some are lost and never found 
But most have seen it all, 
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
They always come up singing 

Some make it when they're young, 
before the world has done its dirty job 
and later on someone will say 
""You've had your day, now you must make way"" 
But they'll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned 
or the many years forgetting what you know too well 
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down 
You try to make amends without defending 
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twenty-five 
that follow as you walk and ask for autographs 
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you 
Some make it when they're old 
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare 
or perhaps there's nothing there) 

Stars, they come and go, they come fast they come slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
But most have seen it all, 
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
They always have a story 

Some women have a body men will want to see 
and so they put it on display 
Some people play a fine guitar, I could listen to them play all day 
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee, they sure can dance 
I guess I could learn how, if I gave it half a chance 

But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar 
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord 
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display 
Except the tunes, and whatever else I say 
But anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say 
I meant to tell a story, I live from day to day 

Stars, they come and go, they're coming fast they come slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
But most have seen it all, 
who live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
And we always have a story 

So if you don't lose patience with my fumbling around 
I'll come up singing for you, even when I'm down",Stars

Nina Simone,"'tis the last rose of summer, left blooming all alone
All her lovely companions are faded and gone.
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh.

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! to pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
'thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead.

So soon may I follow, when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie wither'd and fond ones are flown

For everybody knows about Mississippi Goddamn

I made you thought I was kiddin'

Picket lines
School boy cots
They try to say it's a communist plot
All I want is equality
For my sister, my brother, my people and me

Yes you lied to me all these years
You told me to wash and clean my ears
And talk real fine just like a lady
And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie

Oh but this whole country is full of lies
You're all gonna die and die like flies
I don't trust you any more
You keep on saying 'Go slow!'
'Go slow!'

But that's just the trouble
'Do it slow'
Desegregation
'Do it slow'
Mass participation
'Do it slow'
Reunification
'Do it slow'
Do things gradually
'Do it slow'
But bring more tragedy
'Do it slow'

Why don't you feel it

You don't have to live next to me
Just give me my equality

Nina Simone,"Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin broken down

Where you looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
Is there anyone who knows?
Is there anyone who cares?

So you prayed to the Lord above
Please send you a friend
Yes you prayed to the Lord above
Please send you a friend
But your empty pockets tell you
That you ain't got no friends

Your babies are cryin' louder now
It's poundin' in your brain
Your babies are cryin' louder now
It's poundin' in your brain
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass is turnin' black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turnin' black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin' now
Your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin' now
Your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's poundin' roar

There's seven people dead
On a south Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a south Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
Seven new people are born

The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair

The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her baby comes to call
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
Cos when she's by his side
It's such a change from old routine

Will spend her life alone",The Other Woman [Live]

I want some day to be your wife,
So you can thrill me the rest of your life.
So stop stalling,
Finish your drink, and let's get falling.
Gimme some.
Gimme some.
I can't stand it no longer.
Why don't you gimme some?",Gimme Some
Nina Simone,"Oh Daughter, dear Daughter,
Take warning from me
And don't you go marching
With the N-A-A-C-P.

For they'll rock you and roll you
And shove you into bed.
And if they steal your nuclear secret
You'll wish you were dead.

[Chorus]
Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay.
Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay.

Oh Mother, dear Mother,
No, I'm not afraid.
For I'll go on that march
And I'll return a virgin maid. 

With a brick in my handbag
And a smile on my face
And barbed wire in my underwear
To shed off disgrace.

[Chorus]

One day they were marching.
A young man came by
With a beard on his cheek
And a gleam in his eye.

And before she had time
To remember her brick...
They were holding a sit-down
On a nearby hay rig.

[Chorus]

For meeting is pleasure
And parting is pain.
And if I have a great concert
Maybe I won't have to sing those folk songs again.

Oh Mother, dear Mother
I'm stiff and I'm sore
From sleeping three nights
On a hard classroom floor.

[Chorus]

One day at the briefing
She'd heard a man say,
""Go perfectly limp,
And be carried away.""

So when this young man suggested 
It was time she was kissed,
She remembered her brief
And did not resist.

[Chorus]

Oh Mother, dear Mother,
No need for distress,
For the young man has left me
His name and address.

And if we win
Tho' a baby there be,
He won't have to march
Like his da-da and me.",Go Limp

Nina Simone,"Years, they will come and go.
Sometimes the tears will flow.
Some of my memories will fade,
But I'll always remember that one September day.
I used to reminisce
'Cause I thought that love was bliss.
How did they know it would go astray?
It began, and it ended on one September day.
We met by chance,
As people often do,
But it blossomed, yes, it blossomed
Into something I never knew.
Now... It is in the past.
They said it would never last.
I'll not forget the moment back,
Nor hot May or December,
Nor June or November,
But one September day.",One September Day

Go ahead and take care of business 
For me for me for me 

In all my life no-one has touched me so close 
Nor made me feel so sweet

Take it from me take it from me

Others will end behind bars

Yet we would all like the right to find the key to success
That elusive ray of light that will lead to happiness

No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I'm been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn

Now it's my life I'm living
My only concern for tomorrow is my turn

Though time may help you forget all that has happened before
But honey it's too late to regret what is gone will be no more

Nina Simone,"You've got to learn to show a happy face
Although you're full of misery
You mustn't show a trace of sadness
Never look for sympathy 

You've got to learn although it's very hard
The way of pocketing your pride
Sometimes face humiliation
While you were burning up inside
Facing reality is often hard to do
When it seems happiness is gone

You've got to learn to hide your tears
And tell your heart life must go on

You've got to learn to leave the table
When love's no longer being served
To show everybody that you're able
To leave without saying a word

You've got to learn to hide your sorrow
And go on living as before
What good is thinking of tomorrow
Who knows what it may have in store

You've got to learn to be much stronger
At times your head must rule your heart

You've got to learn from hard experience
And listen to advice
And sometimes pay the price
And learn to live with a broken heart",You've Got to Learn

Nina Simone,"Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,
But we will always be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

Nina Simone,"Chorus:
I have been a rover, I have walked alone,
Hiked a-hundred highways, never found a home.
Still in all I'm happy, the reason is, you see,
Once in a-while along the way, love's been good to me.

There was a girl, in denver, before the Summer storm.
Oh her eyes were tender, oh her arms were warm.
And she could smile away thunder, kiss away the rain,
And even though she's gone away, you won't hear me complain.

Chorus

There was a girl, in Portland, before the Winter chill.
We used to go a-courting, along October hill,
And she could laugh away the dark clouds, cry away the snow,
It seems like only yesterday as down the road I go.

Nina Simone,"The more I see you, 
The more I want you. 
Somehow this feeling 
Just grows and grows. 
With every sigh I become more mad about you, 
More lost without you, 
And so it goes. 

Can you imagine 
How much I'll love you 
The more I see you 
As years go by? 
I know the only one for me can only be you. 
My arms won't free you; 
My heart won't try.",The More I See You

Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me in the night?
Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?

Looking at the skies I see a million eyes 
Which ones are yours?
Where are you now
That yesterday has waved goodbye
And closed it's doors
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world is so much bigger
Now that I am alone.

Papa, please forgive me
I know you understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Oh, can you hear me prayin'?
Anything I'm sayin'?

Even though the night is filled with voices
I remember everything you ever taught me
Evey book I've ever read.

Can all the words,
All the music help me face what's ahead?
The trees are so much taller
I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely 
And the stars are half as bright.

Daddy, how I need you
Daddy, how I miss you 
Kissing me goodnight.","Papa, Can You Hear Me?"

Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.

I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, 
But how strange the change from major to minor,
Every time we say goodbye.

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,
I'd say that I had spring fever,
But I know it isn't spring.

I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented,
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever,
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else,
Walking down a strange new street,
Hearing words I have never never heard,
From a man I've yet to meet.

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,
That it might as well be spring,
It might as well be, might as well be,
It might as well be spring.",It Might as Well Be Spring

There are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her baby comes to call
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause when she's by his side

The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone",The Other Woman

Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he's read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had a little too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddles near
And give him babies one for every year

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him 'cause I don't want him
Because he's not the man for me
Then I'd close the window while he soundly slept
Then I'd raid the icebox where the food is kept
I'd fix the breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee some apricot juice and some buttered toast
Oh oh then I'd go out and buy the papers
And when they've been read spend the balance of the day in bed

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him 'cause I don't want him because he's not my man
I don't want him you can have him
You can have him I don't want him
You can have him I don't want him
'Cause he's not the man for me",You Can Have Him
Nina Simone,"Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Nina Simone,"There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years
Baby, baby, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)",Angel of the Morning
Nina Simone,"Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could
Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you
Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams
That I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes
That I am not gonna be the one to share what
Seems to be the life that you could
Cherish as much as I do yours
Oh I'm beginning to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters, just the right sound
That could make you hear, make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind
Oh I could say I need you but then you'd realize
That I want you just like a thousand other girls
Who'd say they loved you With all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes
Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could

They walk without a sound

Just like the tiptoe moth
That dance before the flame
They burn their hearts so much
That death is just a name
And if love calls again
So foolishly they run, they run, they run
They run, they run, they run, they run

They run without a sound

I know the road tey're on
I've walked their crooked mile

Be hind the settin sun

Yeh, yeh, yeh, they walk without a sound

Le he who threw the stone at them
Stand up and take a bow
He knows the verb ""to love""
Beu he'll never, never, never know how
On the bridge of nevermore
They disappear one by one
Disappear without a sound

The desperate ones
And underneath the bridge
The water's sweet and deep
This is their journey's end
The land of endless sleep

And the problems
From her curls

And what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here

I must admit
I believe it's time for us to quit
And when we meet again
Bein' introduced as friends

Along there came a false young man, come stole the heart of mine.
Come stole the heart of mine

The gardener standing by, three offers he made me.
The pink, the violet, and red rose, which I refused all three.
Which I refused all three

The pink's no flower at all, it fades away too soon.
The violet is too pale a bloom, I think I'll wait till June
I think I'll wait till June

In June the red rose blooms, but it`s not the flower for me.
It's then I'll uproot the red, red rose, and plant a willow tree.
And plant a willow tree

And the willow tree shall weep and the willow tree shall mourn.
How I wish I were in my young man's arms who stole the heart of mine.

And if I'm spared young year more, and if God should grant me grace.

And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy Southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'. 
No. You couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""What's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you.

There's a ship

With a skull on its masthead
Will be coming in

Get upstairs! What's wrong with you! Earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cuz there's nobody gonna sleep here, honey
Nobody

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say, ""Who's that kicking up a row?""
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda
And you say, ""What's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell ya.

There's a ship
The Black Freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""Why do they spare that one?""
Yes.
That's what you say.
""Why do they spare that one?""

You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning 
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The Black Freighter
Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them NOW, or LATER?""
Askin' ME!
""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock
And so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""Right now.
Right now!""

Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

Blood on the leaves and blood at the roots,
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
Them big bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolia, clean and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh

For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the leaves to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter crop",Strange Fruit

Turned another way
With a laugh, a kind hello

A smile to put them in
With other lives to listen to
And some work I've got to do
I forget that I'm not over you
For a while

Days go by with no empty feeling
Until I remember you're gone

When you have some time to spend
Drop around and meet a friend

Wouldn't heal all the pain in my soul.

If I'm in your heart, really in your heart
How near to you can I get?

How near to you can I get?
How near to you, can I get?

Nina Simone,"I have almost ev'ry thing a human could desire,
Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire
But there's something missing,
Something isn't there,
It seems I'm never kissing the one whom I care for.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds 
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my 
Something To Live For.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouln't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.

Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my Something To Live For.

Why you want to fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly
No place bif enough for holding all the tears you're gonna cry
'cause your mama's name was lonely and your daddy's name was pain
And they call you little sorrow 'cause you'll never love again
So why you want to fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly

Where did you come from cotton-eye Joe?

He rode through the fields so
Handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was having some fun

For those memories of you that are no longer sweet

Nina Simone,"Since you've gone I spend each lonely night,
Dealing out the cards from left to right,
And the King of Hearts is there to remind me 
That I'm all alone playing solitaire.

Love was just another game for two,
I see now that's all it meant to you,
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle,
So I'm all alone playing solitaire

In each romance there's an element of chance,
A gamble to win or to lose,
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules,
Just made for fools.
Now, the Joker has a laugh on me,
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly,
And until you wanna share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire.

And until you want to share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away, dealing time away with solitaire.",Solitaire

They could give you the whole round world for a toy
All I have are my arms to enfold you
And a love time can never destroy destroy

You'll be so surprised to know my demands are very small

The one who has taken my place,
Can everyone see what I'm trying to hide,
Isn't it written all over my face?

Of course, I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drips from leaves then I recall

I've forgotten you just like I say would
Of course, I have
Or maybe except when I hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
I've forgotten you just like I should

What a fool am I
To think my aching heart could kid the moon
What's in store
Should I phone once more
No, no, no, no, no it's best that I stick to my tune

I'll make no sacrifices
Through each tomorrow let it be me

They shouldn't, they mustn't, but they do.
Can't get out of this mood,
Can't get over this feeling,
Can't get out of this mood,

Last night your lips were appealing,
The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.
Can't get out of this dream
What a fool to dream of you,
Twasn't part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you,
But now I'm saying it, I'm playing it dumb,
Can't get out of this mood,
Heartbreak here I come.

Nina Simone,"Savoy, the home of sweet romance,
Savoy, it wins you with a glance,
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Your old form just like a clinging vine,
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine,
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.
What joy - a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you;

The home of sweet romance,
It wins you at a glance,
Gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Just like a clinging vine,
So soft and sweet as wine,
So soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never, never, never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.
What joy - a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you;",Stompin' at the Savoy
Nina Simone,"Oh she was a the fairest in Trinidad
And he was a wandering sailor lad,
But she stole his heart as no other had

Tomorrow, tomorrow we will meet once more
In the old village square,
So wait for me darlin' and I'll be there.

The moon was so young and their hearts were gay,
I'm yours for ever he heard her say,
But she knew in her heart that he could not stay.

Tomorrow, tomorrow we will meet once more,
In the old village square,
So wait for me darlin' and I'll be there.

Now her heart is sad as he sails the sea,
And I heard her sigh, ""Oh come back to me"",
And the wind in the waves whispered mournfully,

""Tomorrow, tomorrow we will meet once more,
In the old village square,
So wait for me darlin' and I'll be there.""

Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow",Tomorrow (We Will Meet Once More)

Nina Simone,"You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No. you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""what's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you.

There's a ship
The black freighter
With a skull on its masthead
Will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, ""hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! what's wrong with you! earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, honey
Nobody
Nobody!

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say, ""who's that kicking up a row?""
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda
And you say, ""what's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell ya.

There's a ship
The black freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""why do they spare that one?""
Yes.
That's what you say.
""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The black freighter
Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them now, or later?""
Askin' me!
""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock
And so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""right now.
Right now!""

Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

And the ship
The black freighter
Disappears out to sea
And
On
It

But with all its charme give me the little country farm
I'm going back home where I was born

Tell you all about it why I wanna go

I miss the bootlegger smelling in the air
Miss friendly faces and the country smiles
The crickets singing you can hear it for miles

Miss the rooster crowing at the break of dawn
Yes it all happens where I was born
Miss the fried chicken colored greens
Miss the hot biscuits and the lima beans
Miss the prayer meeting where the people pray
With the drum beating till the break of day

You can have it you can have it
You can have it you can have it
You can have thy town I won't be around
This here life's too fast but 'll never never last

But I'm in love and I know what time it is
The good book says, ""Go seek and ye shall find""
Well, I have sought and my, what a climb it is!

My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers

An emotion like the ocean
It's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man
Like I love him

Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around
I end up like I started out just cryin' my lil' heart out
He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could, I got it bad and that ain't good

So bad, so bad

I got on it so bad, so bad though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad, I'm mad about you, I can't live without you
Lord above me make him love me the way he should

Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
The things I tell my pillow
No woman should

Even in Switzerland your memory came through

But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.

Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Dance before me like a million eyes,

Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Nina Simone,"Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time

And who knows where the time goes?",Who Knows Where the Time Goes [Live]

He doesn't know it, but he needs me
And so no matter where he goes
Though he doesn't care
He knows that I'm here

He needs me
I ought to leave him, but he needs me
I know that I ain't very bright
Just to tag along
Oh, but right or wrong
I'm his and I'm here
And I'm gonna be his friends or his lover

Cause my one ambition is
To wake him and make him discover
That he needs me
Ive got to follow where he leads me
Or else hell never know that I need him
Just as he needs me",He Needs Me
Nina Simone,"Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do
Old girl you're through
Sit there, count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue.

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

Won't you just sit there
Count the little raindrops
Falling on you
Cause it's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use old girl
You might as well surrender
Cause your hopes are getting slender and slender

To cheer up little girl blue",Little Girl Blue

Nina Simone,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river 
You can hear the boats go by 
You can spend the night beside her 
And you know that she's half crazy 

But that's why you want to be there 
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China 
And just when you mean to tell her 

That you have no love to give her 
Then she gets you on her wavelength 
And she lets the river answer 
That you've always been her lover 

And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that she will trust you 
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind. 

And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 

And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said ""All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them"" 

But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 

And you want to travel with him 
And you want to travel blind 
And you think maybe you'll trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. 

Now Suzanne takes your hand 
And she leads you to the river 
She is wearing rags and feathers 
From Salvation Army counters 

And the sun pours down like honey 
On our lady of the harbour 
And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 

There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever 

While Suzanne holds the mirror 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that you can trust her 
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.","Suzanne [Live, Philharmonic Hall New York 1969]"
Nina Simone,"I bless the day I found you,
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me.

Don't take this heaven from one,
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me.

Each time we meet, love,
I find complete love.
Without your sweet love
What would life be?

So never leave me lonely,
Tell me you'll love me only
And that you'll always let it be me.

If for each bit of gladness
Someone must taste of sadness
I'll bear the sorrow, let it be me.

No matter what the price is
I'll make no sacrifices.
Through each tomorrow let it be me.

To you I'm praying,
Hear what I'm saying.
Please, let your heart beat
For me, just me.

And never leave me lonely,
Tell me you'll love me only
And that you'll always let it be me,

Of all the evil that will have to end.

But if I have to swim the ocean 
Well I would just to communicate

Needed you like the blood in my veins
Would have done anything for you

To relieve my mind and put aside all of this shit attacking me inside
All of this drama surrounding me, drives me crazy constantly
I just need some time to breathe and take my mind off of everything

Try to keep it behind me, but I'm always reminded
Of everything that bothers me, like you can't take breaks from reality
Just keep on moving and keep on doing what will keep my life running smoothly

Guess only God knew your fate

I burst to tears

To live on your legacy

Se un giorno tu
Tornassi da me dicendo che
È stato un errore
Lasciarmi andare lontano lontano da te

Se un giorno tu
Parlassi di me
Dicendo che
Sono il tuo rimpianto e non riesci a dormire

Allora ti direi
Stavolta sarebbe per sempre
Non importerebbe niente se

Mi hanno fatto male ma tanto vale che

Puoi lasciarti cadere
Dimenticare non basterà
Ma illudimi che sia per sempre

Da ciò che sei realmente
Di quello che ho dato non ho avuto indietro

Neanche quel minimo

Mentre affoghi nei tuoi errori
E cerco di capire l’irrefrenabile

Morire
E invece di morire ho imparato a respirare

Slow down 'cause it won't get no good
Low?
So low?
I know it can only get worse from here
It turns black from grey
There's no way of getting up now
Now when you are down
'cause you see
I've got some news for you 

There is no way of getting up
And this road will only take you to the end 

So come on
It's done
No one is going to help you
And I
I lie
Yes I'd do it again
One thing you know will be there
Is your darkest fear
And now it's time for you to do what's right to do 

It's just the way it's meant to be
There is no light at the end to see 

Everyday is one step closer
Everyday is one step further down
And do you know where we all are going?
You follow me to the end of the road where we die

Makes me burn forever 

Set it all in flames
If this is heaven no angels sing

And I will be suffering
Until I see where I'm wrong, if I am wrong
If there is no right, there is no wrong
To be stuck in the middle is even worse
Your inferno isn't worse than mine 

You tell me you know what I feel
Stop using me as an excuse for being you
When I look up I see your grin
The satisfaction of kicking me down

Innocence is gone
Choking on the ashes
Buried in debris
Drowning in a pool of blood
Cities in decay
Nothing left alive

When it all comes down to dust
Alone with no one to trust
We're standing on the edge of ruin
All we can do is… 

An empty sky
Where birds won't fly
The world is caving in 
Everything is left in ruins
Empty cavity
And the ground is crumbling

There's two to ways do everything 
The right way and the wrong way

At the coppa cabanna, swear to god I split a nigga like a banana
Over currencies or property ain't no stopping me, I'm building a 

Monopoly now copy me, each one teach one lessons of making and taking 
Erasing, faking, and snaking, serious like a jamacian, and I bring home

My hand raps around dollar bills sends chills down my spine 
Like cheap wine, so I gotta get mine
All the time I rewind back to the day when I realized sometimes crime 
Pays, there's a million ways to die but only one to live

I need enough money to spend enough, money to give cause I love my 
Peeps and my peeps love me and I refuse to see them living in proverty 
I gotta be on point, I am not myself savior with new flavor 
Like craig with my third eye I cried 

Shed tears in the mind for being blind only thing left for me now 
Is crime or rhyme 

I got to make something or I got to take something 
Even if it comes down to hustling in public

Never bite the hand that feed you never bite the hand that buck (pow) 
Now what! stuck in a maze with only one way out figure it out that's 
What life's about, trail after trail, tribulation after tribulation

I want a black nation cause I'm sick of the plantation 
No more picking cotton have you forgotten we the kings and queens of 
The earth, now rome in the rotten apple, drinking snapple
Trying to get a little capital, spend it like I'm crazy, that's what 

Rap will do, you got to maintain make sense out of what's insane
And stay on top of you're game, don't blame nobody but yourself for you're 
Lack of wealth, times get hard get sneaky like a stealth
Make or take is the thesis, I want pieces of the pie gotta do or die

So unwrinkle your mug and relax God

Excuses excuses you ain't really ruthless

Pussies like you end up on all fours with no drawers
I came through the doors in 1994 like never before
In ninety-five I went on tour, while you slept on the floor
Reality my style is legit
And if you can't hit you need to sit or quit and don't say shit

Wouldn't waste a bullet on you, I can dead you with a mean stare
You too easy to scare, and I don't care
Whatcha say just mess around and try it
Get hit up with a hundred silencers cause I bring the Quiet Riot
Put your money where your mouth is and I'll buy it
Twist your tongue up so fuckin' bad, you won't be able to untie it
Stay out of my circumference when I'm mic checkin'

Save the theatrics for the mattress.
Nine bring it raw dog style with no practice.
I mack this microphone like a hoe on the stroll.
In total control of the soul.
Any asshole can pull a gun the streets are full of fools
I met smarter younger brothers in jails than in schools.
Runnin his story about his glory, it bore me.
And his territory, it don't do nothin for me.
So fuck him and the horse that he's ridin
I'm barely survivin, losin my breath
Cause I'm drownin in sorrow.
I seen a lot of pain with these two eyes of mine.
That's why I write the rhymes that borderline on crime.
I gotta make somethin or I gotta take somethin.
Can't beat that...
Fuck Versace and Rolex, I can't eat that.
I need that green it seems to reign supreme.
By any means, pens and papers on triple beams.
Get rich schemes blow up in your face
None taste worse that a plan gone sour
Your power slippin through your fingers like dimes and nickels.
We go pistols
you know where to shoot at, wherever the loot at.
I don't break the law the law breaks me.
I ain't sittin around waitin for the devil to come and take me.
Don't shoot until you see the whites of they eyes
Anything less would be uncivilized

You know... in a world full of lies and alibies
Some men die for a piece of the pie
It's Uncivilized
So I strive to survive and keep my eyes on the prize
(So I try to stay hi stayin high of the lie (2))
Anything else is uncivilized
(It's keepin me from actin uncivilized (2))

I break the rules on my quest for the 12 jewels
Believe in Delf' bring stacks and green packs
Need hats for Jacks, camoflauge
At least 2 gatts for when skies are grey
Any day above ground is a good day, I'd say
The way kids play nowadays, no hands
They spray round my way
I'm feelin like Ja Day and I'm runnin outta sad songs
You fake, one mistake could leave you dead wrong
Roll with the king, whoever that is
See him in the corner of my eye
But he disappears like cigarette smoke
In a cloud, then the rain comes, then the pain comes
X marks the spot, graffitti marks the slums
The chosen ones communicate with mathematics
The new tactics set me free from all the dramatics.
Keep it in my attic, that's where my brains at
Keep it in the closet, yeah but keep it black
Back up from the ropes if you can't float between notes
Ane memorize them quotes that I toke from Buddha smoke
Hope ya brought your dictionary with ya
Cause if you get the words, then you get the picture
I hit ya because I love ya
You're my people and I put no one above ya
But if you're foul I bust ya

Part of the reason we're all uncivilized.

I walk into this summer all alone the usual session
You feel your instinct then you act but was it your intention
To leave me down and broken now you've ended our ascension
Yeah

I still can feel the beach sand in my shoes remember when
We talked along the ocean's song 'til blue from black fade in?
But that was then I learned to live without you far within'
I ask you why you're back to try to let me lose again?
You brought me here you wet my taste
You disapear without a trace
It wasn't me who made the call

'Cause now I want to' be
Where you sleep
Where you laugh
Where you breathe
And I hate to say
Still I sway
Brown your eyes
Gone away

Should I feel some closure I deserve if that atleast
And would you be so kind to show reasons for your release?
You woke me up from a distant past I left behind complete
The message that you sent that night now falls to bittersweet
Was it me, my honesty?
You fail to show I'll never know
It wasn't me who made the call

Was it me, my honesty?
You failed to show I never know
You brought me here you wet my taste

Nine Inch Nails,"I beat my machine it's a part of me it's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream it's changing me I am becoming
The me that you know he had some second thoughts
He's covered with scabs and he is broken and sore
The me that you know doesn't come around much
That part of me isn't here anymore
All pain disappears it's the nature of my circuitry
Drowns out all I hear there's no escape from this my new consciousness
That me that you know used to have feelings
But the blood has stopped pumping and he's left to decay
The me that you know is now made up of wires
And even when I'm right with you I'm so far away
I can try to get away but I've strapped myself in
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
I can see it killing away all my bad parts
I don't want to listen but it's all too clear
Hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid

And it turned out to be a scab
And I had this funny feeling
Like I just knew it's something bad

I just couldn't leave it alone
I cut off that scab
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
But I climbed through

Now I'm somewhere
I am not supposed to be
And I can see things I know
I really shouldn't see

And now I know why
Now I know why

I can't shut it off
This thing I've begun
And it's hard to tell
Just where it's coming from
And it's hard to see
What I'm capable of
And it's hard to believe
Just what I've become

Me, I'm not

I can swallow it down
Keep it all inside
I define myself
By how well I hide
I feel it coming apart
Well, at least I tried
I can win this war
By knowing not to fight

If I take it all back
Someway, somehow
If I knew back then
What I know right now

There's bullet-holes where my compassion used to be
And there is violence in my heart

Into fire you can send us
From the fire we return
You can label us a consequence
Of how much you have to learn

You can try, but you'll never understand
This is something you will never understand
Can you hear it now?
Hear it coming now?
Can you hear it now?

On hands and knees
We crawl
You cannot stop us all
Our bones, our skin
We will not let you in

You have set something in motion
Much greater than you've ever known
Standing there in all your grand naivety
About to reap what you have sown

Time will feed upon your weaknesses
And soon you'll lose the will to care
When you return to the place that you call home
We will be there, we will be there

On hands and knees
We crawl

We did just what you told us
Lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies

Do you remember the time we...

And I know you remember
How we could justify it all
And we knew better
In our hearts, we knew better
And we told ourselves it didn't matter

And we will all be back together as one

May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us

And you never get to take the easy way
And all of this is a consequence

And at peace?

As the light starts to fade
That you are the reason
That I am not afraid
And I guess I just wanted to mention
As the heavens will fall

Will be anything at all

Nine Pound Hammer,"Got a '68 Chevy that his cousin bought in '71.
Traded 98 dollars and his daddy's lucky shotgun. Christened the back bumper with a half-empty bottle of beer. In the back of his mind, he could hear all the people cheer. 

He used to sleep in school, hopin' no one would call his name, as the teacher tried to turn 'em out all the same.  Get up every mornin', do the work you're expected to, and at night, sit and count the crumbs thrown to you. 

He inherited a job at the local distillery. Where he had all day to sit and think of what would never be.
Somewhere along the line, he'd been deceived. Get stoned, read the Bible, an' pretend he still believed. 

Rollin' down the road with his foot to the floor. Passin' the same farms and fields as every time before.
Nothin' haunts a man like knowin' that he's free to choose. So he lets up off the gas when he thinks of all he's got to lose. 

Well, you work all day, live just like a slave. Hustlin' for a seat on the slow shuttle to the grave. 
There's a bottom to every bottle and the only thing that ever lasts-------- is riding shotgun in a Chevy and countin' all the cars you pass.",Shotgun in a Chevy
Nine Pound Hammer,"Raised on a diet of No-Doz, donuts, an' diesel emissions, Listenin' to wrinkled old men dronin' on about the weather and road conditions. Stayin;five miles ahead of whatever's behind, wonderin' where I went wrong. And the strange city signs start to sound like rhymes in a never-ending song.

Just a one-horse town---no motel or bar. Just a wax museum, of dead HEE-HAW stars. You don't look in a mirror, when you're cold and mean. Stranded outside Tater Knob, with just a JUGGS magazine.

Well I was sittin' at a table in a topless bar at the end of Music Row. Watchin' fat girls strip to Molly Hatchett songs, hopin' their stretch marks won't show. I spent my last dime on a watered-down drink, and I'm headed out for the door. Before I could kick myself for comin' here, I was already back for more.

My ex-wife ran a whorehouse on the highway out of town, they used to give special truckers' rates before the Baptists burned it down. She had a tattoo on her inner thigh, said ""if you can read this, yer too close"". We used to drive five miles for the nearest cold beer and bitch about the lives we chose.",Stranded Outside Tater Knob
Nine Pound Hammer,"Well they gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Saying Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 but it's old 97 you must put her into Spencer on time
Well he turned around and said to his fireman shovel in a little more coal
And when we cross this big White Mountain we'll watch old 97 roll
(guitar)
It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville and a line on a three mile grade
It's on that grade that he lost his airbrakes you see what a jump he made
They were goin' down the grade makin' 90 miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
A scalded to death by the steam

Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband
He may leave and never return ",Wreck of the Old '97

It's driving me insane
Well, I'm drownin' my fears in cheap American beer

You only go 'round once in life
Well, I'm wastin' my time on long drunken drives
Makin' up excuses for an angry wife

Feels like I hit a bus last night

Rammin' God's children head-on
Well, what can I say, it never happens this way
In all those old Red Sovine songs

As I'm told by a drunken society
Now there's more blood on my can of Bud
Than there ever was in me

Makes me burn forever

And I will be suffering
Until I see where I'm wrong, if I am wrong
If there is no right, there is no wrong
To be stuck in the middle is even worse
Your inferno isn't worse than mine 

You tell me you know what I feel
Stop using me as an excuse for being you
When I look up I see your grin

Ninety Pound Wuss,"Your substantial credibility
Isn't much a part of me
A spreading sickness, poor in taste
No sense of reality
Following the newest trend, it's cutting edge
So you pretend to believe ideals
And conform to rules of material opinions
We're all products of a manufactured generation
Controlled through television by sex and violence
Resist
We accept the obscene as average
Twisting all that our instincts are fighting for
Resist it
Man exploiting women, flesh, sex, skin, flash
We rape, we destroy all that's holy
Resist them
Flesh market society we digress
We fight to survive while
Destroying each other with selfishness
Lies of liberty and freedom
Hopes in something called democracy

Ninety Pound Wuss,"Crash triggers clinging chokers
Choking victory dry
Don't panic simply randomly
So what she has alzheimers
Mathematically epileptic
If she don't wet her pants first
The problem a constitution null and void
Who's to look for your disclaimer?
Get over it
The question then becomes fragmented
Jaded, or confused
Everyone gets together
Vibrations named ourselves
Don't cry this inauration day
Best pillows I ever felt
Is it fulfilling?
Collectivism, discipling, unionism
Trading souls to never fill your void
Labor $10 minimum
She's still dying and wets the bed again
Who's more frustrated?
Me or you or you or me
Take a look
What is conception
Some frivolous game puts children on the street
Her disease is still the same
Old and stiff and angry, birth to death
What have you left, but a small space inbetween
Don't waste your time it's short
Primal language of new born infants
Choking ignorant
Raised deaf, dumb and blind
Age old desire
In solitude of other brainwashed has-beens
Incontinent failure
None of us survive
Survive fire
We all die too young

Ninety Pound Wuss,"A quick glance forward
Only lends a hard hand backwards
Leaning not on self alone
Yet feeling sufficient for life giving forces
Recklessness ends all possibility of future
In this dark age
We've destroyed through murmuring
Gestures which confront ourselves
And I cry out Lord take me now
I know it's the end
She said our time lasts
I guess she proved herself wrong
I thought I know the love of two
I forgot three makes a trinity
Three's a perfect union
I can sense the end in your eyes
I hear your thoughts in my memory
How could I forget
The close proximity of your face
I guess we all stumble sometimes
Lord I cry at your feet

The breath of life. 
The breath of life. 
I am weak from the fight and I can still hear them celebrating victory. 
Wiping the blood from my face. 
The pain creeps in taking over my thoughts. 
My spirit lays broken, shattered, shrouded by you. 
Your icy pale skin in the cemetery plot I dug for you. 
I push you in and I like it. 
Hating the darkness which becomes my flesh. 
Inside this shell you try to hide. 
Your still churning. mind and spirit burning. 
Torture love never fails. exception in your case. 
Failure comes quite naturally or so it seems. 
Fading in and out from black to white, to black to white again.

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

And then a bunch of fucking aliens from Mars

Turns out that guy was you
And yet you're there
There can only be one explanation
And that's that you're a zombie

Are you gone forever?

I put my package in your mailbox
Made love to all your chairs
Dropped a load inside your washer
I went down on all your stairs

I took your cabinets from the front, and
Your sofa from behind
I looked deep into your vacuum's eyes
And then we sixty-nined

Thanks in advance for
Not judging me, or
This aspect of my soul
When I dick-smash all of your belongings
Is when I'm finally whole

I boned your couches and your telephone
And all your scented candles
And your dictionary, fishtank, and the pictures on the mantle

I had sex with your whole kitchen
With no boundaries or limits
And your lamp was looking so good
That you know I had to hit it

Your wallet and your toothbrush
And your jacket and your red hat
Oh, you're mad about the toothbrush?
Just forget I ever said that

And your carpet and your furniture
Your windows and the curtains
And I licked your stamp collection
I dicked your floor for certain

That you may hear during our motivational program
Awh! Heah! Ugh ah! Hah hoh huuuoh
Uoah! Dadubu, buh! Heeh
I'm sorry

It's time to go for the gold, there should be no doubt
Except for you roger, would you please leave now?
Now girls form a line in order of height
Goddammit, Roger, what did I just say?

Now I'll put on my blindfold and my sex hat
Maybe you are starting to suspect that
I'm already hard, now reach for the stars

And you look to the north where the pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn
In the distance hear the laughter of the last unicorn

In between the bright lights and the far unlit unknown

Lit up like a firefly just to feel the living night

Or lose the race to rats

Y mis brazos vacíos se cerraban
Aferrándose a la nada, intentando detener mi juventud

América
(América, América)
Es América
(América, América)

Todo un inmenso jardín
Eso es América
Cuando Dios hizo el Edén
Pensó en América

Nino Bravo,"tiene casi veinte aos why ya esta cansado de soar
pero tras la frontera esta su hogar, su mundo why su ciudad. piensa que la alambrada solo es un trozo de metal
algo que nunca puede detener sus ancias de volar

Libre!!! como el sol cuando amanece, yo soy libre
como el mar.
Libre!!! como el ave que escapo de su prision why puede alfin volar.
Libre!!! como el viento que recoje mil lamentos why libertad.
camino sin sesar detras de la verdad
why saber lo que es al fin la libertad.

con solo por bandras se marcho cantando una cancion marchando tan feliz que no escucho la voz que le llamo.
why tendido en el suelo se quedo, sonriendo why sin hablar sobre su pecho flores carnes why frotaban sin sesar.

Libre!!! como el sol cuando amanece, yo soy libre
como el mar.
Libre!!! como el ave que escapo de su prision why puede alfin volar.
Libre!!! como el viento que recoje mil lamentos why libertad.
camino sin sesar detras de la verdad
why saber lo que es al fin la libertad.",Libre
Nino Bravo,"De por qué te estoy queriendo, no me pidas la razón
Pues yo mismo no me entiendo con mi propio corazón
Al llegar la madrugada mi canción desesperada
Te dará la explicación

Te quiero vida mía, te quiero noche why día
No he querido nunca así, te quiero con ternura
Con miedo, con locura, sólo vivo para ti

Yo te seré siempre fiel, pues para mí quiero en flor
Ese clavel de tu piel why de tu amor

Mi voz igual que un niño te pide con cariño
""Ven mi, abrázame""
porque te quiero te quiero, te quiero
te quiero, te quiero, te quiero
why hasta el fin te querré

Te quiero con ternura
Con miedo, con locura, sólo vivo para ti

Yo te seré siempre fiel, pues para mí quiero en flor
Ese clavel de tu piel why de tu amor

Mi voz igual que un niño te pide con cariño:
""Ven a mi, abrázame""
porque te quiero te quiero, te quiero
te quiero, te quiero, te quiero
why hasta el fin te querré
why hasta el fin te querré","Te Quiero, Te Quiero"
Nino Bravo,"Of things I should be thankful for I've had a goodly share 
And as I sit here in the comfort of my cozy chair 
My fancy takes me to a humble eastside tenement 
Three flights up in the rear to where my childhood days were spent 
It wasn't much like Paradise but 'mid the dirt and all 
There sat the sweetest angel, one that I fondly call 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles 
Oh I know that I owe what I am today 
To that dear little lady so old and gray 
To that wonderful yiddishe momme of mine 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles 
Oh I know that I owe what I am today 
To that dear little lady so old and gray 
To that wonderful yiddishe momme of mine",Mi Querida Mamá (My Yiddishe Momme)
