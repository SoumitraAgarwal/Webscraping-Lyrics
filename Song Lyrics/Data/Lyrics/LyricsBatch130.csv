Freeway,"Hit it
Young Philly from the block y'all rock stars
This is criminal opera I got y'all
60 niggas willin' to pop y'all or rock y'all
Freezer cruise the city in a hot car sports car
Cleveland today Atlanta tomorrow
Free will never be soft cause the hood is in me
They say it will be here today gone tomorrow
But I'm still standin' strong cause the hood is with me (hit me)
Yes! before this rap thing cracked off
I was somewhere gettin' a pack off that's all
Now I'm gettin' my raps off that's all
Shuttin' down coliseums like NASA asshole (Freezy where you been)
I took four years off
I went to Mecca paid respect and
Earned some checks for the road
Be the man that cut the check so please respect Young Hov
Before I hit y'all with the tech
And turn ya lights down low
Woah!

Lights get low (Low)
Let the music take total
The music take total control
Trol trol trol
Let the music take total
The music take total control
Trol trol trol (I got to hustle I got to grind)
(I got to hustle I got to grind)
Let the music take total
The music take total con...

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Born with the murder one
We got the hood burning up
Yea this what you want
My niggas know to turn it up
The white be with my city yea for me to run
You standin' in a pool of blood
Youngin' shoulda seen the sun
What you want to do tell me what you want to move
A good week for me another man a month or two
I'm into blowing and laying you niggas low
The feds tappin out and they fucking with figure fours
I don't wanna wrestle I wet em and then they froze
Me and Free hit every freeway around the globe
If she with me just know that she throw stacks
A quarter stick of dynamite off in that whole back
She the bomb
I'm the boss
Maybach that's my flying sauce
Count a mill with me shorty because you need to ride
You watch it freeze up you will see in time

Lights get low (Low)

Let the music take total
The music take total control

Let the music take total

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Y'all rappers perpetrating
Free motivateing
Put bones together like I'm the great lakes
Then use my dome acheing
I'm so patient
Struggling between my music and moving weight and
I can move a crate in
Less than an hour
And make hit in the same hour
It's so amazing
Matter fact free so hood
That I still hit the kinks
For three weeks I'm cool with Asians
Nigga come at me going to lose
You need to fire them dudes
Who hike them up through his agent
Me & Cool & Dre will give you abrasions
Hit his chest because his hustle so soft
Don't make me go off
Treat this town like the brightest star
Grinds in the east the south an the west
If a nigga got beef I'm a put it to rest
God bless us when I tell him
That I leave him deceased
Now peep holla

Hova's dough is on autopilot, I don't even drive
In the bop with my shoes up, I just took back the Phantom
Too many fuckers could fathom, what it felt like to have em
I just copped me an all-things, a professional ball team
Tell me I ain't the illest hustler y'all seen
When you don't buy out the bar, you buy the bar, that's what ya call
(Hey big spender!) Ha,ha,ha,haaa

I got some dough on the block, got some dough getting wrists
I got a villa in Tahiti and I don't owe no rent
I got that paper for real-a, and these niggas finally thinking
Eat my cake up in the safe and take a slice of the dilla
Three hundred grands of damn willa, why y'all niggas debating
I'm copping, y'all niggas hating 'cause I'm making that scrilla

Shawty if you love me like your lost and you can't find your way without me
You goin' wake up one day when I'm gone thinking why did you doubt me
But you better believe me I take it to the, take it to the, take it to the top
You got to believe me I take it to the, take it to the, take it to the top

I made you why would I play you?
Not only showered you with gifts I bathed you
Plus I hit the first night and I stayed too
I know it's early but I just thought I would page you

Hey you!
More then I'm willing and able
You get tired from all the presents that I gave you
Still you

Be acting like you someone faithful
You swear I'm fucking on a rendezvous
When you think of freaking I be on my girl
Even when we not freaking you be on my mind
I'm more mature I'm flipping them dollars

So I can't give you all of my time cause I'm,
24 hours a day stuck in a war
Atleast 8 hours or more cooking them rhymes up
So 16 hours just you can hit the store and you complaining you want more free time?

[Chorus]

You got to believe me baby I'm making it easy baby
My SWA you watching Feezy baby
I got a mean Mercedes and got a cleaning lady
Heres some advice for you, you better heat it baby

Long as your whip in the room and got a strip on them booms
So what the fuck do you care cause I live on the road
I'm busy gripping them Ole's that's how you gripping them clothes
Home I ain't getting no dough I can't be sitting in there

So what they worth is they own baby I'm different then them
I bring them benjamins in look at the kitchen in there
Look at the living room set look at that thing on your neck
Matching that thing on your wrist but got some digits in there

I give a fuck if they stare I give a fuck what they think
I get them budgets in check and put the diesel in there
Don't let them people in there
Gas you up and get you all upset
You win my heart and I'm a keep you there

[Chorus]

And since these feelings at heart are not right I,
Put in position to rock ice right and,
Them other niggas be singing the same song they might,
Have what it takes but they handle things wrong

You in your mens or something you want the meaner man
You got to believe yourself cause I believe in me
I got the Beamer keys I'm just as clean as these
I smoke the greenest trees
Them other niggas be fronting

Freeway Philharmonic,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ohé ! Les copains !
Venez-vous rincer la gueule, 
Ce soir, je suis toute seule,
Il est mort ce matin !

Ça fait rudement longtemps
Qu’on était tous les deux,
Moi, j’avais dix-huit ans
Et lui dans les vingt-deux
Il m’a tout fait quitter,
Mon père et puis ma mère
C’était pour me faire gouter
A toutes les misères

Ohé ! Les copains !
Venez-vous rincer la gueule
Ce soir je suis toute seule, 
Il est mort ce matin !

C’était un beau salaud 
Qu’en foutait pas une rame
Pour un verre de Pernod
Aurait vendu son âme
Quand il était bien saoul
Il tapait comme une brute
Il connaissait de ces coups
On aurait dit de la lutte

Ohé ! Les copains !
Venez-vous rincer la gueule
Ce soir je suis toute seule, 
Il est mort ce matin !

Des fois il me trompait
Ces choses là, ça m’écœure
Et quand il revenait
Il ronflait 24heures
Pourtant y’avait des jours
Ça c’était une merveille
Il me parlait d’amour
Quand je rapportais ma paye

Ohé ! Les copains !
Venez-vous rincer la gueule
Ce soir je suis toute seule, 
Il est mort ce matin !

Mais je ne sais pas ce qu’il y’a
C’est pourtant pas normal
Rien que de parler de tout ça
J’ai le cœur qui me fait mal
Ça c’est vraiment marrant
Y’a quelque chose qui cloche…
C’est quand j’ai eu 20 ans 
Qu’il m’a donné cette broche.

Ohé ! Les copains !
Venez-vous rincer la gueule
Ce soir je suis toute seule, 
Il est mort ce matin !

Allez les copains !
Ce soir je suis toute seule…
Je reverrai plus sa gueule
Il est mort ce matin !",Ohe Les Copains

Dans ses bras il tenait sa belle

Und so wird es immer, immer, immer, immer bleiben
Ist es Angst, ist es Frust, ein Komplex
Eine Sucht, ein von Kind an symptomatisch verschleppter Wahn?

Sommer und Sonne, Arm in Arm
Tanzten wie Kinder durch den Schnee

Kann vieles erst jetzt verstehen

Sind sie jetzt wieder zurück
Schonzeit vorbei
Auf in den Kampf und ab ins Glück
„Wichser united“ passt am Besten
Zu den ganzen Denunzianten
Bei denen in erster Linie
Menschen ohne Eier rumtanzen

In Reih und Glied und Händchen haltend
Wird getreten und geschossen
Fremdes Recht im Keim erstickt
Mit eigenem Unrecht übergossen
Wir glaubten bisher
Jeder Mensch hat ganz gewiss
Auch gute Seiten
Wir lagen falsch und danken euch
Jetzt mal mit unseren Zärtlichkeiten

Kommt her und zeigt euch
Kommt schon her und zeigt euch
Versteckt euch nicht
Wir tun euch schon nichts

Lügen, Lügen, Lügen, Lügen
Haben immer kurze Beine
Leichen im Keller, Leichen im Keller
Habt nur ihr und wir haben keine
Und wir wissen, ja wir wissen
Wer am Ende übrig ist
Ihr seid es nicht, weil das Gewissen
Eure Seele bricht

Viel Feind, viel Ehr, Unkraut vergeht nicht
Tinte frisst keinen Zement
Kenne erst die Schwächen, dann deinen Feind
Bevor du ins offene Messer rennst
Kenntnis und Wissen sind viel stärker
Als Vermutung auf Papier
Wahrheit siegt über die Lüge
Genau deshalb stehen wir noch hier

Falsche Gegner, falsche Ziele
Falsche Motivation
Auf nacktem Arsch durch unser Feuer
Gibt rote Backen und heiße Ohren
Verstehe doch, du bekriegst die Falschen
Und bist zudem genau so schlimm
Wie die ganzen Nazi-Spasten
Denn die haben auch nur Hass im Sinn

Sag mal ehrlich, bist du verwirrt?
Hast dich wohl im Ziel geirrt?
Kein Schuldspruch, kein Verbot

Fremont John,"There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go,
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

The sun ain't nearly on the rise
And we still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies,
Love is all that matters  Won't you stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye,
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
And don't you ever leave",Lay Down Sally
Fremont John,"What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running and hiding much too long.
You know it's just your foolish pride.

Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down.
Like a fool, I fell in love with you,
Turned my whole world upside down.

Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane.
Please don't say I'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain.

Layla, you've got me on my knees.
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

French Acoustic,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon CĂŚur
French Affair,"Take me now, baby, here as I am
 Hold me close, and try and understand
 Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
 Love is a banquet on which we feed
 Come on now, try and understand
 The way I feel when I need your hand
 Take my hand, come under cover
 They can't hurt you now can't hurt you now, can't hurt 
 you now
 Because the night belongs to lovers
 Because the night belongs to love
 Because the night belongs to lovers
 Because the night belongs to us
 Jan Wayne's gonna move yaaa
 Have I a doubt, when I'm alone
 Love is a ring on the telephone
 Love is an angel, disguised as lust
 Here in our bed 'til the morning comes
 Come on now, try and understand
 The way I feel, under your command
 Take my hand, and the sun resets
 They can't hurt you now can't hurt you now, can't hurt 
 you now
 Because the night belongs to lovers
 Because the night belongs to love

We could drive out to the dunes tonight

I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
Let them slip away
I might sleep all day

When the roads are clear, we'll head on out of here
If you're comin' back, I'll see you in the morning

French Kicks,"When you walk around, you know you feel okay
Although you had some mornings that make you cry
You took 'em lying down
You took ?em, oh, so hard

And when you call the phone and talk to me and explain
I try to hark the words and not obey
They came out wrong
And I was back where I started

There is only one person that talks that way
And you use imagination in the back of the cab
You took it all the way
Home to my empty room

Well, I remember that expression for the rest of my life
My answer to the party line, up in and go get her
Reach inside my kitchen for that old carving knife
To mess up all my people, make 'em see a little redder, hey

When I do my dirt, will you stand up high
And tell me how you got to be this way
I listened all the time
I wait around so long

And if you ever thought of dying to kill yourself
Like a tired old record you get played out
And you'll be on your own
Buried in the ground

Well, I remember that expression for the rest of my life
My answer to the party line, up in and go get her
Reach inside my kitchen for that old carving knife
To mess up all the people, make 'em see a little better, hey

Woke up with a new song
Woke up with a tightrope
Living room is empty
Did you even miss me?

I knew about the last time
This could be the last time
Smoke going up the chimney
Can I take you with me?

Living room is empty
Dead with the memory

Like waxing needles pushing through my tired frozen skin
If I go walking then I know you wanna let me in, please

If you could take my worst words anywhere, it's now

Still it seems, we know what we know, it's not a thing

It's where we went off, and it's where we belong
Into your hands, into my arms and everyone

I don't know if, break it down
If it's worth staying out all night
The longer it goes on

Falling into your hands, into my arms

French Kicks,"One more time
I wake and I'm anywhere
Well, I'm feeling lonely when
You look like you're coming after all

All that time
And laugh only when you're still around
Thought I'd feel something else
When love keeps me climbing up the wall

A little heat and I lose some more sleep
A little sleep and a little more heat
In other ways, I keep waking up
A little heat and a little more

Oh, that's fine
Relax, will you? While you're still around
But I'll be your only friend
When off running things into the ground

You're alone with me
Nothing wrong with me

It's still hard
A little heat and a little more sleep
[Unverified]

I can do without it
Wait a little bit more
I will come around yet

We'll always as far as I can see
We'll always fall in stride
And it's really too late
I'll never lose that will in your heart at all

And it?s really okay
I see you coming out [Incomprehensible]

There is only so long
I can do without it
Wait a little bit more
I will come around yet

Feel you coming alive
And you turn around it
Wait a little bit more
I will come around yet

Oh, we leave it nowhere
We will find it all gone
Now I'm taking our time
And I like it that way

Feel you coming alive
And you turn around it
Wait a little bit more
I will come around yet

Every moment of mine
I'll deliberate it
Never made up my mind
Never liberated

Feel you coming alive
And you turn around it
Wait a little bit more
Operate around it

I tell my kids I'll never leave them lonely
Fucking streets on me,
Death row Jamaicans murder your family
Fuck what happens tonight,
Fuck what happens tonight
Fuck what happens tonight,
I've got my gun on me

It was murder she wrote, your name in blood
When the love's gone,
Your eyes diluted full of blood
Six cars full of goons, six blocks heard the boom
Dreadlocks, middle of June, head shots, get tombed
Stone, ten shots, five gone, 9/11 dial tone
You want it all, die alone
A war's going on nobody's safe from
Now we're talking to the judge when your day come
Like it was hard not to kill these niggas
It was like a full-time job not to kill these niggas
Eight figures, need the eight story mansion
While I'm strapped up
Two-stepping with the devil dancing
Diluted with blood in my eyes
Like a stillborn,
Niggas won't make it out alive, nigga

Fuck it, I'm ready to die tonight
Put it on momma that clip in the back, and I loaded it twice
Just a call away, my niggas is ready, no matter the price
Playing with mine,
You niggas could get it including your wife
Isn't life a motherfucker?
Since seventeen that pistol's been my blood brother
Sleeping with that lethal weapon, playing Danny Glover
AK40, hold a hundred if we're talking numbers
Riders' fucking with mobsters
Niggas want beef? Turn them to pasta
Load up the clip, shoot up your master
Bang bang, bless them father
Passed beside him, rest aside a lake
That's swimming with snakes inside
And look at my eyes, I hate disguises
Knife or gun, I compromise it
Oh Lord, I'm a ride on my enemies
If I die tonight, I bet them gangsters remember me
Nigga, until then

I got my gun on me,

Fucking streets on me,

Fuck what happens tonight,

From the depths of the sea, back to the block
With a bitch on my dick and a bottle of Ciroc
Tick tock, non-stop, blocker, blocker, blood clot
Don't test the lion
'Cause you'll get dropped on the spot
Lick shot, drip drop on soil
Pot's hot until it boils
To this Crip shit, I'm loyal
Dip with us, ride with us,
Slide with us, slip with us
Sit with us, slick with us,
This bad little bitch wanna get with us
Say she likes the French tip nails that I wear
And how I'm so pimped out
With dreads in my hair, yeah
You got truth, now the truth is to dare

The smell of blood in the bathroom
Body laid out stiff full of stab wounds
I told this nigga I was coming back
Pussy must not have heard me when I told him that
Nigga, it's eye for an eye
A life for a life, a body for a price
I want to smell his last breath took
And look him in his eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
Because I'm him, it's in the air, I can feel it
Shot him four times with the gun I was concealing
Over killing, it ain't no coming back from it
Then walked away with a demeanour
Like I just done it
Something evil this way's coming
For big face hundreds this bitch gets punished

I got my gun on me,

When I bought her a number two
Dipping and you know it,

Bringing all my jewels, how you know I start a riot

You blowing up her phone, she ain't trying to pick up
Drinking out the bottle, I'm leaning with a model

Brag and I boast, they be doin' the most
If I look at his friend, he'll be grippin' the toaster
So I took him to the crib to kill him with it
Put my legs behind my head, I hit the ceiling with it
When I put it in his mouth I couldn't believe it
He looked me in my eyes and said he wanna breed it

Smoking blunts, bad bitches on camera
Took a second and got tatted on my neck and hands
You don't gotta love the music, but respect the man

Come over to the crib, get hit by me
Woke her up and told er get that money to them lames
You were sent by me, it's jet life over here partner
And plus nobody I know got popped in
New Orleans where I be, smoking pot with your hoes

They we realized
The dream was attainable
Now look at us

(Maybach music)

Countin money all I seem to hear is benji talkin
Hater we ain't conversatin it's just semis talkin
Countin money all I seem to hear is benji talkin
Countin money all I seem to hear is benji talkin
Hater we ain't conversatin' it's just semis talkin
Used to be the boul
They said they have a penny on em
Now I walk around with twenty chains with like a milli on em
Lace up my boots
Put on my strap
And go lookin for that paper I'm like where it's at
They lookin at me
I'm starin back (I see you)
Feelin like I'm superman
Every time I wear this mac

Monday
It's probably 106 & park
Tuesday
Probably in the hood where it get dark
Wednesday
Probably catch me swimmin' with the sharks
With blood drippin' from my shoes
These lous coated in my heart

See dreamchasin' is a occupation
Those with the job understand the process and manifestation
A dream starts as a thought
And it's nurtured, achieved and sustained
Then we go back in our minds for more work

Let me out my cell
Right back on the mission
Fresh from off a bail
Right back in the kitchen
Who the fuck gon' pay my lawyer
I got
And like eighty grams of crack
He said the feds probably come for ya
I'm like oh lord
Copper said I tried to kill I'm when I go to court
I hope they don't find me guilty
It's my word against they word
And I won't get a chance to speak
I caught my case with nine of my niggas
And I'm the only one they beat

I took one for the team
Even though I had a dream like Martin Luther King
Who thought that I'd be cover of these magazines
Cause I be spittin' fire flow on kerosene

Lemme talk to em
Uh
Fuck y'all niggas gon' say about me
My north niggas they don't play about me
South Philly niggas that'll spray about me
A million dollar bail in a day bout me
Ain't gotta sound real cause they'll tell you that
I'm on the top floor, I started where the cellar at
Self made, bitches

I had a dream one time
It was that I was gon make a lot of money
Doin' what I wanted to do
I went after it
And it was a struggle to achieve
But you know what
I caught that bitch

A few minutes ago it was like a poolhall in this motherfucker
Now it's as quiet as a church
How much you got, Joe? (What?)
Total. You put down 80 thousand like it didn't matter
That's a lot of money for somebody like you and I think it matters
What's the difference?
I'm a millionaire. That's a difference. I lose 80, I get another 80
For me it doesn't matter, see, I think it's you who's sweating this, the both of you

All God's children need travelling shoes
Drive your problem from here
All good people read good books
Now your conscience is clear
I hear you talk, girl
Now your conscience is clear

In the morning when I wipe my brow
Wipe the miles away
I like to think than I can be so willed
And never do what you say
I'll never hear you
And never do what you say

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

We just poked a little empty pie
For the fun the people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
The timid smile and pause to free

I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

Cup of tea take time to think, yeah
Time to risk a life, a life, a life
Sweet and handsome, soft and porky
You pig out 'til you've seen the light
Pig out 'til you've seen the light

Half the people read the papers
Read them good and well
Pretty people, nervous people
People have got to sell
News you have to sell

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be

Frenchie Burke,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone

He sits and stares through the backdoor screen.
And all the news just repeats itself
like some forgotten dream
that we've both seen.

Someday I'll go and call up Judy.
We worked together at the factory.
Ah, but what would I say when she asks what's new?
Say, ""Nothing, what's with you?
Nothing much to do.""

Sweet seventeen with a faraway look in her eyes

She said, ""I feel like a bird in a cage
Come September I'm flying away""
And I said, ""I'm gonna miss you""
Then I made her promise to write

Since we were tall as the corn in the spring
We shared every secret, shared every dream
So anxious to grow in the new summer rain
And bloom like a rose on the Calico plains

How could she hear as we laughed
On that warm summer night
The tiny heart of the baby, she carried inside

I stood beside her when September came
Watched her get married and caught the bouquet
And like those hand me down dresses she gave me
I made her dreams mine

From a seat by the window on wings made of steel
I stared at the patchwork over the fields
Where young tears that once fell like warm summer rain
Were turning to snow on the Calico plains

Sweet Abilena looks out at the midwestern sky
Closer to thirty but farther away in her eyes
She holds her babies like she holds her dreams
Each night she kisses and rocks them to sleep
While she reads the letters, she makes me promise to write

I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for the final moment
You'll say the words that I can't say
Every time I see you falling

Frente!,"Hello my friend
It's morning, time to wake now
In body, in mind
Entwined will have to break now
But I need your flesh
Your warmth to stay beside me
Oh how I wish
You could be deep inside me
Show me your eyes
Your low most tender feeling
And I'll give you mine
Be truthful and revealing

And it's you that I love
And it's true that I love
And it's love not given lightly
But I knew that it's love
And it's you that I love
And it's more than what it might be

When we're alone
I cannot always face you
Maybe my mood
Won't let these arms embrace you
But that doesn't mean
My love's somehow diminished
Give me the time
To show our love's unfinished

And it's you that I love
And it's true that I love
And it's love not given lightly
But I know that it's love
And it's you that I love
And it's more than what it might be

And every word I say is true

What can I say?
The words destroy all meaning
There's only cliches
To get across this feeling

This is a love song
For john and (? )'s mother
This isn't easy
I might not write another

And it's you that I love
And it's true that I love
And it's love not given lightly
But I knew that it's love
And it's you that I love
And it's more than what it might be

Of another lecture or another pointless drill.

I've already been banned from my friends houses too.
I wonder what I did to make my mum so mad
No perfect homelife but the only one I had.

Toi qui me donnes des ailes
Pourrais-je te rendre un jour éternelle

M'ont troublé, onde magique

I wonder how they sleep at night.
When the sale comes first,
And the truth comes second,
Just stop, for a minute and
Smile

Why is everybody so serious!
Acting so damn mysterious
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time.

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that (yeah)
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag

Ain't about the cha-ching cha-ching.
Ain't about the ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag.

We need to take it back in time,
When music made us all unite!
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes,
Am I the only one getting tired?

Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now
Guarantee we'll be feeling all right.

Seuls allongés dans les feuilles,
Tu t'es roulée sur moi
Juste le temps d'un petit refrain
Et de ta voix pour me bercer,
On a roulé jusqu'au matin,
Moi je rêvais même éveillé.

Hm hm
Oh hm hm

Avec tes petits yeux verts de malices parfois
Moi j'ai fini loin dans les airs
Pour toi bien plus d'une fois
Je me suis retrouvé par terre,
Sur le cul tu m'as laissé!
La tête et le cœur à l'envers
Tu m'as comme qui dirait séché

Avec toi le qu'en dira-t-on grandira
Lors de nos premiers émois,
Je me roule avec toi que dira-t-on
Si moi je meurs de toi?

Hm hm

Si dans ta bouche je me consume,
Dans tes mains je ne crains plus rien
Partons loin, loin dans les dunes,
Là-bas je m'y retrouverais bien,

Avant que ma tête ne s'enfume,
Sous tes airs de midinette,
On partira jusqu'à la Lune
Toi et moi demain peut-être.

Toi et moi demain peut-être.

Si moi je meurs de toi?

Sous mon nez ma récompense,
Mon cœur, mon âme en plume.
Toutes ces heures d'accoutumance,
Me mèneras-tu jusqu'à la Lune?
Dans ma bouche notre romance,
Des pieds aux poings liés.
Toi mon leurre sous tes avances
Me laisseras-tu comme un damné?

Avec toi le qu'en dira-t-on grandira
Lors de nos premiers émois,
Je me roule avec toi que dira-t-on

Now I'm talking spiritually
We got one eye on the future
And the other on our money
And all our feeling goes dead

Try to switch off my head
Use my soul instead

About how to be true without being corny

Eu só queria Mas eu nem sei mais

Então escolha de que lado vai jogar
Pois, ao meu lado, está sobrando um lugar
Ele é seu Eu sou seu
Então me diga onde é que você está
No meu passado, você não pode ficar
Acabou, acabou

O que o mundo vai dizer, quando o amor vencer?
Em quem a gente vai pensar quando a luz se apagar?
Eu quero um segundo
De silêncio, será que é pedir demais? Não
Eu só queria, mas eu não sei mais como é você

Então escolha, de que lado vai jogar
Pois ao meu lado está sobrando um lugar
Ele é seu, e eu sou seu

Können wir allein entscheiden, was später mal bleibt
Ob wir handeln oder schweigen und alles akzeptieren
Ob wir nur abwärts treiben und nichts erreichen
Oder ob wir was riskieren!

Wenn wir statt dem leichten, den schweren Weg gehen
Zu unseren Träumen bedingungslos stehen
Dann bleiben im Meer des Vergessens, noch Spuren von uns
Wenn wir weiter kämpfen, auch gegen den Strom
Solange wir leben, für unsere Vision
Dann wird etwas bleiben für ewig, in Spuren von uns

Denn solang wir an uns glauben, wird schweres plötzlich leicht
Einfach positiv zu denken, ein „ja“ statt „vielleicht“

Mit meinem Mann Sèkou aka The Ambassador 
Für 1999 
Und wir haben viel Liebe zu geben 
Check it out now 
Yo 'Kou, drop the verse 

There comes a time in your life you've got to go against the odds 
Take pause, try to get from small to large 
It's all good, struggle through and knock on wood
I might not have always done things the way that I should
Nor the way that I could now, grow to know how
Keep it on the low focus y'all brothers pow wow
Watch the hour I'm on some next moves for tomorrow 
Still my sunshine that's how we blossom the flowers 
Lost ones on the bottom hardly ever seen light
That's why the spark trouble, always starting the fight 
Walking up on my boys making noise and shit 
Talking 'bout FK how they hate my clique 
I never throw fits stay calm never alarmed 
That's how we last long, keep my life line in my palm
Yo, Don, turn the mic up, focus the view 
Ambassador write songs the whole world relate to

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind
All those who helped me up when I was stuck in a bind
Anyone I might have stepped on chasing these G's
One love one heart, all apologies 

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind
All those who helped me out when I was stuck in a bind
Anyone I might have stepped on chasing these G's
One love one heart all apologies

Yo, I grew up fatherless like most black males
It's like the whole lot of us is programmed to fail
But in the end new beginnings get it started again
God's speed lead your thoughts back to deep within
Keep my feet on the ground, watch who lingers around
A lot of hard luck niggas try to get at my crown
But I forgive them send 'em love I know what it's like
Doing shows for no dough and if the ends ain't right
So it's a must we bond and we can all cop this
You do for me I do for you we both top of the list
Wath your stock once you got it, set up shop
Keep your eyes on the clock plus stick to your plot
You may never be a rich star but I know who you are
And that will take you much further than your jewels and your car
We all got a lot to give so take heed to the song
'Cause I'm going to live what I say to the day that I'm gone

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind
All those who helped me out when I was stuck in a bind
Anyone I might have stepped on chasing these G's
One love one heart all apologies

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind

Yeah yeah 
We've all come a long way since it started 
Maximilian, DJ Friction, The Don (stay strong)

I took my time wrote it down line for line 
Take a look and you'll find truth lies in a wise rhyme
I watch the sky, follow signs of the magi 
Heard the most high that be the words of my third eye
Spoke with fire, lift this bloke out of the mire
Make it known I only quote those I admire 
My sole objective to spawn growth and inspire
Move across the globe like a soldier for hire
So long it's for a just cause we can spark to the cypher
Talk politics to the day we spot Elijah 
Could have sworn it I saw him rise on the hills of Israel
So reveal your true size and know if it's real
We no longer have to wonder where we got our next meal
The whole squad got stronger now we on even keel
Enough said we could break bread and all get fed
So take it as a compliment and let it go to your head 

To all my peoples left behind once I made up my mind
All those who helped me out when I was stuck in a bind
Anyone I might have stepped on chasing these G's
One love one heart all apologies

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

Spürst du was ich fühl' denn was ich fühl' is real
Es ist mehr als nur ein Spiel ich lieb' deinen Stil

Pitschpatschnass
Floh ich unter das Vordach
Des Fachgeschäfts, vom Himmel goss ein Bach, ich schätz'
Es war halb acht, doch ich war hellwach
Als mich Anna ansah, anlachte
Ich dachte, sprich sie an, denn sie sprach mich an
Die Kleidung, ganz durchnässt, klebte an ihr fest
Die Tasche in der Hand, stand sie an der Wand
Die dunklen Augen funkelten wie 'ne Nacht in Asien
Strähnen im Gesicht nehmen ihr die Sicht
Mein Herz, das klopft, die Nase tropft, ich schäme mich
Benehme mich dämlich, bin nämlich eher schüchtern
„Mein Name ist Anna“, sagte sie sehr nüchtern
Ich fing an zu flüstern „Ich bin Max aus dem Schoss der Kolchose“
Doch so 'ne Katastrophe, das ging mächtig in die Hose
Mach mich lächerlich, doch sie lächelte „Ehrlich wahr, Mann“
Sieh' da, Anna war ein Hip-Hop-Fan

Meines Geständnisses, Anna ich fänd' es schön, mit dir auszugehen
Könnt mich dran gewöhn' dich öfters zu sehen
Anna zog mich an sich „An sich mag ich das nicht“
Spüre ihre süßen Küsse, wie sie mein Gesicht liebkost
Was geschieht bloß, lass mich nicht los
Anna, ich lieb bloß noch dich, andere sind lieblos, du bist
Wie Vinyl für meinen DJ, die Dialektik für Hegel
Pinsel für Picasso, für Philippe Schlagzeugschlegel
Anna, wie war das bei Dada
Du bist hinten wie vorne A-N-N-A

Sie gab mir 'nen Abschiedskuss, dann kam der Bus
Sie sagte „Max, ich muss“, die Türe schloss. „Was, ist jetzt Schluss“

Manchmal lach ich drüber, doch dann merk ich wieder, wie's mich trifft

The rebel will come through
What them wanna do for stop you
When you're under your meditation and look through

What is this, a game?
For the lack of a better word, general
We call it war

We kick that progress report consort to make it happen
Set up forts in foreign lands expand for everlasting
The fam span across the atlas like diasporas
Escape from out the grasp ot the most wickedest captors
Hear the laughter of the Czars in the dark like Nabokov
Rebellion coup d'etat, shit is raw, cut they heads off
Those who were lost floss now living lavish
Destination be the pastures of the city of Nazareth
Catalyst the revolution move the troops from out pollution
Mobutu citizens get the boot right in they asses
Ambassador status bring the loot back to the masses
Who live like hostages, the system be abusive like the music business is
We exist in the abyss but images be marvellous like novelists
Picture this like hieroglyphics on the fines papyrus
The world is ours but is devoured by the hour
Spread the scripture like Egyptians while the wicked spread the virus
Through the lies I realize the righteous bare my likeness
But they spite us so let the weak recite this
Sow my seed amongst the captives let the fleet complete the cipher

What them wanna do for stop you
Mephisto can't strike we down

The rebel will come through
What them wanna do for stop you
You could never ever out the fire we are walk through
What them wanna do now

Block the enemies shields
Hack holes in his plaque
And aim for the heart

Kein Klugscheisser, der denkt sein Shit sei deep und stinkt nicht
Alter, mach mal Platten, jeder zweite linkt dich
Doch ich bin jung und open-minded, weiß wen
Ich als Freund und Feind hab, bereue keinen Tag
An dem ich redlich Revue passieren ließ und endlich alles verwarf
Weil erstens Ansichten sich ändern und zweitens ich das darf
Es ist in meinen Texten nachzulesen, ich frage mich
Wie lang man braucht, um sich aus der Namenlosigkeit zu lösen
Sich und sein Wesen zu offenbarn
Wo bleibt die Antwort auf die Frage die noch offen war?
Allein dieser Umstand nimmt uns schon die Illusion
Man sehnt sich nach Ruhm, Sensation will Fusion
Buhlt um die Gunst des Konsumkids, denk an den Stumpfsinn

Weiß nicht, ob es das aufwiegt, was ich aus dem Verkauf zieh
Lauf euch nicht hinterher für'n Platz in eurer Plattenkiste
Ich kenn den wahren Wert auch wenn ich nur im Schatten dichte
Banaler Rap ist Publik und macht uns
In Sachen Kunst zu 'ner Bananenrepublik
Nur das Gute liegt so nah, warum in die Ferne schweifen?
Wenn wir lernen und reifen, bevor wir nach den Sternen greifen
Jeder wähnt sich als Gigolo im Sakko nach Monaco
Träumt von Ruhm wie Jacko, hört er sieben mal den Gecko
Der Habit ist Deko, die Darbietung versteckt nur
Aber euer Mack-Getuh' bedarf meiner Korrektur

Und geiseln den Geist der Konterrevolution

Feel pata pata wie Miriam Makeba
Wir schlagen ein wie'n Meteor - Junge

Yesterday I painted our bathroom in all sorts of colors
And the day before I slept in, before I went shopping
And I cooked our meal, seemed to forget the dishes
And I saw a little TV and went to bed...

Now it's already Wednesday - half the week is gone
Yet another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane, that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday - How'd three days get wasted?!?


And today I went to an interview for a boring job
And the lady there was boring too - I started to fade away
Yet I smiled and begged, which took time and energy
Though she pissed me off - I could really, really use the money ...


Now it's already Wednesday - half the week is gone
Yes another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane, that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday - How'd three days get wasted?!?

It's already Wednesday yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah - It's already Wednesday
I'll make a list of things to do â?? (and) get as much as I can
Cross off what's done - carry the rest to the next day
John and Poul had ""eight days a week"" - maybe I could borrow one

Now cause it's already Wednesday - half the week is gone
Yet another Wednesday of things I haven't done
The week flies by like an aeroplane, that's got no destination
And now it's already Wednesday - How'd three days get wasted?!?

Isn't it strange who you end up with
Wanting other than you thought you did
Isn't it funny you're as different from me
As oranges from apples
As the Finnish from the French
As back to front and inside out
As starting from the end
As milk from wine
As snow from sunshine
As the sky from the sea
As Kate Moss from me?


You're apples
And I'm oranges
It's all the same to me
Without the dark night
There would be no daylight
So I'm gonna follow you like ""d"" follows ""see""
Like you follow me ...


Isn't it strange who you end up with
Wanting one thing - getting the opposite
Isn't it funny you're as different from me
As soup from ice cream
As those who sleep, from who dreams
As candlelight from spotlight
As coffee from tea
As the relatively straight
From those who'd take both
As those who go down
From those who think it's gross?


You're apples
And I'm oranges
It's all the same to me
Without the dark night
There would be no daylight
So I'm gonna follow you like ""d"" follows ""see""

You have grown a wishbone where your backbone use to be
And that is why a boy like you is walked all over by me


Nice guys are overrated, I know you want more than this
I know you wanna use your tongue when you and me kiss
You want an explanation why I'm making the first move
Your hesitation is why girls like me eat boys like you



When girls like me, eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to
When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to


When I first married you, it was for better, or for worse
50 years later I'm tired of ironing your shirts
The paint is off the picket fence, the hair is off your head
And that is why a boy like you is gathering cobwebs in bed


When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is we like to
When girls like me eat boys like you
The only explanation why is it passes the time
And you just taste so nice and we like to!

So I'll hold on
Can feel it waking up inside of me now
It would be so easy just to bring it to life
I always wanted for this to happen

Now you'll finally see that I'll always be the one

Here I go again, (echo), here I go again, here I go again, (echo) I really miss you, Now it's time to:
Beg pretty please, I'm pourin' all the geez my heart may never mend. (Chorus)And I punch holes in all my walls, close down all the malls, smash my sister's violin. And I hold your picture by the bed, you're still livin' in head. At least I can pretend, that your not over me, 'cause I can't be just friends, just friends, don't want to be just friends, la, la,la, la, laaaa...",Just Friends
Frickin' A,"I met her at the pool 
Yeah she was smokin' hot 
She told me maybe we should get together sometime 
She asked me if I could 
Rub oil on her back 
And that was fine with me 
And then I had a crazy fantasy, we were 

Naked in my bed 
One fling no strings 
Movin' all around the room 
Chicka chicka boom boom, and then we did it 

On the floor 
Against the door 
Up on the sink where we did it some more 
The sun was hot and we were both burning red 

We were naked in my bed 
She read her magazine 
Right in front of me 
The latest issue of Cosmo she said I should 

Check these positions out on page 69 
She pointed to this one, and said 
Looks like a lot of fun. Then we were
Naked in my bed 

One fling no strings 
Movin' all around the room 
Chicka chicka boom boom, and then we did it 
On the floor 

Against the door 
Up on the sink where we did it some more 
The sun was hot and we were both burning red 
We were naked in my bed 

Everyone will wonder where we've been
We can make up something oh but then 
We may never see the sun again

I can't catch a break

And I'm losing my dreams
Along the way

All I want
So much more
Like a place on the dance floor
I'm only one step away

And I'm falling apart
As I walk through the dark
I'm only one step away

I know I'm not blind
But I can't see a future
Unless I change my mind
Unless I decide

That all this comes right down to me

And tomorrow's new day
And I'm fighting my way back again
As soon as I let me I'll prove this is all in my head

she is walking home from a random dormroom
her arms are crossed she's staring at the ground.

there she goes again
she don't need a boyfriend
she's gonna have her fun

she was teasing all the freshmen
they were trying to make their moves but getting shot down
glitter on her eyelids 
in a lowcut t-shirt and miniskirt 
catching ever look owning every room in a town

there she goes again
going out with her best friend
getting up on stage
to play a little air guitar
and under that strawberry skin
she don't need a boyfriend
she's gonna have her fun
and never let it go to far
but she'll party hard, she'll party like a rockstar

and she won't remember your name...

there she goes again
skipping class at 8 am
don't you fall for her
you'll be hangin on a broken heart

Striped toe socks
Call the cops
I can't take anymore

I got the perfect cell plan 
With nights and weekends free
All the ring tones that I need
But no one ever calls me

I should paint myself green
Walk around in a red g-string

Put a band aid on my face

Wish I could start a trend

Clickin' through a hundred million channels

Here's the number 
To save your soul

Another Michael Jackson scandal

With nights and weekends free
More 'off beat' that I need

Put a bar bell through my ding-a-ling

I would start a trend

She's such a cutie
She'd be a beauty
If she could get an extreme makeover on that booty
I could bend her over 
And she lets me spank it

Take off my jeans
The zipper pinched my ding-a-ling
Cause I don't really fit in

Throw my hat away
Take that stupid band aid off my face
And I, I wish there were 
One more way to tan your skin
A reality show where no one wins

That falling in love with you, girl, is just like dying

Oh, don't walk away,
Oh, how can I make you stay?
Don't turn away,
I can still hear you saying those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through

Back in my schooldays acting the fool days
One and one and one makes three
And a man said: ""Kid, come and cut yourself a piece of the big time.""

Armour-clad horses, riding Trojan horses
Never made sense to me
I didn't want to be a part of the great debate on moonshine

[Chorus]
""Stop, pay the price,"" they said to me
Take this advice.  You're out of your head
Said: ""Stop, hold the phone, this has to be
Cut to the bone.  Too bad I see red
I see red, I see red, I see red

When the sly man stumbles, twists, and he tumbles
He always lands on his feet
And he sets his face towards the far horizon
Won't you come this way, can't you go that way?
But his rhythm don't miss a beat
'Cause he's doing everything he can to keep surviving
Stop, pay the price

So who wants a riot?  People should be quiet
Don't we give them good T.V.?

Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside
All the way from A to Z
I can live without that kind of satisfaction

As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth

The one dimension only shows one side

As you and I peer into life's kaleidoscope
To turn the stone
to turn the stone.

Now my heart is shattered
If I bowled it down the street
Who's to say it mattered?

If there's one that rode away
What would I be missing?
Lips that taste of tears, they say
Are the best for kissing

Eyes that watch the morning star
Seem a little brighter
Arms held out to darkness
Are usually whiter

Shall I bar the strolling guest?
Bind my brow with willow
When, they say, the empty breast
Is the softer pillow?

That a heart falls tinkling down
Never think it ceases
Every likely lad in town
Gathers up the pieces

If there's one gone whistling by
Would I let it grieve me?
Let him wonder if I lie
Let him half believe me

And I wonder if you ever
Will see this land again

And we brought it goodness

And left only emptiness
I am not broken

I wait and the darkness comes

And I wonder if you ever
Will see this land again

I hide my fear from everyone
But I've had enough of secrets
They're all lies we're scared to tell
I just need someone to be with
I just need to say you fell
There's nothing out here
But me and a whisper
And now it's failing
I won't even listen
I watch the fall and it's
Time that I was leaving too
I wait and the darkness comes
I pray for my only one
And I wonder if you ever
Will see this land again
I wait and the darkness comes
I pray for my only one
And I wonder if you ever
Will see this land again
I wait and the darkness comes
I pray for my only one
And I wonder if you ever
Will see this land again
I wait and the darkness comes
I pray for my only one
And I wonder if you ever
Will see this land again",Heart of the Country
Frida,"I hear the lines on the telegraph
Buzz in my head
I have to shut them out
My ears to the ground

But I try to stand up
And straighten out
Forget my doubt
'Cause I couldn't bear to lose you

You're the only one I care for
But I can't lock out the rumours
I shut my eyes so I won't see because

One little lie can go a long way (one little lie)
One little lie can go a long way (one little lie)

Would I learn to trust again some day
I try to ask but my tongue gets tied
When I guess the answer
If you turned you head away from me

I know I'd stand there forever
Caught out in time by a line
That I wanted you to deny
And you'd laugh and laugh 'till I cried and cried

I can't shut out the rumours
Burning inside me all the time

One little lie can go a long way (one little lie)
One little lie can go a long way (one little lie)

Would I learn to trust again some day
Every day turning away
I feel something new
If I can't put my trust in you then

We've got nothing worth hanging on to
It's hard to talk sometimes now
You seem so far away
Am I losing my mind

Oh help me please
Say it's not true what the people say
It hurts
In my heart

'Cause I couldn't bear to lose you
You're the only one I care for
But I can't forget the rumours
Don't shut your eyes so I won't see because

One little lie can go a long way (one little lie)
One little lie can go a long way (one little lie)

Frida,"We take so much for granted, he and I
We share a life in one dimension
Our problems always seem to cloud the sky
But we don't pay them much attention

And with every day
We drift apart
I can feel it in my heart
That man is not the man I used to know

And though a part of me still needs him so
There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly

No angry words and no heart-rending scenes
And we should take it as a warning
We keep on going through the old routines
Exchanging kisses in the morning

And with every day we drift apart
And the fear is in my heart
I read the signs and I should be mature
And yet a child could not be more unsure

There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly
Our passion's just a distant memory

And in its place a dull frustration
A cold indifference where there used to be
At least a frequent irritation
But a feeling still

Of tenderness
And of pity, so I guess
I'll be the woman in his arms tonight
If he should need someone to hold him tight

He's like a child
But I feel my love die
Slowly
That man is not the man I used to know

And though a part of me still needs him so
There's something wrong
And I feel my love die

Slowly, slowly
Slowly, slowly
Slowly, slowly

Fyra trötta, tomma ögon
Ett laddat vardagsrum
Två tysta spända munnar
Infekterat
Resignerat samtal
Vid två stängda dörrar
Ingen av oss vet nog varför
Vi fryser ut varann
Två brustna hjärtan gråter

Så bra maskerat
Känns nu hopplöst
Och passerat

Vem kommer såra vem ikväll

I'm wide awake
And my mind is raising again
I can't find the words
They all seem wrong
Like the meaning is lost in translation

[Chorus]
I have always been in love with you,
But,
You are unable to see that
I have felt this way, every night and day
Wishing that you would just come
A little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Closer to me
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come closer, closer to me

You must be blind
Believe me I have tried
But nothing I do gets you to see me
How do you feel
I need to know
'Cause my heart just wants to scream it

Frida Amundsen,"Can’t you see how much I’ve changed
Hardly any part of me remains
So you and I could be the same
I tried to be the way you are

But all that I’ve achieved so far
Is driving us apart
But I won’t be your mirror
I can’t keep doing what I do
I could turn myself into you
Who you want me to be
Is an echo of me

If I keep losing what I’ve got
I’m becoming into someone I’m not
All you love, don’t you see
Is an echo of me

I can’t be you; I won’t pretend
I don’t know why you don’t comprehend
You wouldn’t want me in the end
I never gave a guarantee

I’d adjust ‘til I could barely breathe
I can’t be all the things you need
‘Cause I’m not your mirror

I can’t keep doing what I do
Bleaching out myself til I’m you
Who you want me to be
Is an echo of me
If I keep losing what I’ve got
Turning into someone I’m not
All you love, don’t you see

Frida Boccara,"Dans les rues de Rio un enfant s'émerveille
en voyant défiler sous ses yeux
le cortège or et bleu
des fanfares en livrée de soleil.
Oubliant ses habits, ses pieds nus,
dans ses rêves éperdus
il se prend pour un roi conduisant le sabbat.

{Refrain:}
Au milieu des cymbales, des feux de Bengale,
les cieux pleins d'étoiles, les yeux pleins de fleurs,
dans le coeur de la fête il jette son coeur.

Dans les rues de Rio un enfant tend ses mains en chantant
et devient le copain de tous les musiciens.

{Refrain}

Dans les rues de Rio un enfant vit son rêve.
En marchant il se prend pour un roi conduisant le sabbat.

Et bientôt un enfant, dix enfants, mille enfants l'accompagnent
en jouant des cymbales, en entrant dans le bal,
en dansant sous des arches de fleurs .
Et l'enfant qui sourit à pleins feux se nourrit de chansons
comme font tous les anges oubliés du Bon Dieu.

{Refrain}

Dans les rues de Rio un enfant disparaît dans la nuit
et bientôt sur un banc il s'endort en rêvant
d'un million de cymbales, de feux de Bengale,
de fleurs et d'étoiles, d'étoiles et de fleurs,
c'est le coeur de la fête qui dort dans son coeur.
Dans les rues de Rio un enfant s'émerveille en rêvant
comme une fleur de faubourg au soleil de l'amour.",L' Enfant aux Cymbales
Frida Boccara,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeur

Frida Boccara,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Frida Gold,"Es ist schrecklich eng zwischen den Stühlen
Und ich vergesse zu atmen in dem Dunst dieser Zeit
Live fast die young ist wohl die größte Lüge
Die du mir erzählst noch bevor wir uns kennen

Und wenn du willst
Kann ich alles für dich sein
Woran du nicht mehr geglaubt hast
In dieser Welt voller Schein

Lieb deine Liebe schnell
Bevor's ein anderer tut
Lieb sie so sehr du kannst
Sie meint es mit dir gut
Riskiere alles was du hast
Besser gleich als irgendwann

Denn erst hinterm Horizont fängst du zu atmen an

Du liebst nicht mehr und schon zu lang
Hälst du Nacht für Nacht immer 'ne andere Hand
Du bist so kühl, aber ich kann dich fühl'n
Ich hör' dich atmen spür' den Puls deiner Zeit

Und wenn du willst
Kannst du alles für mich sein
Woran ich nicht mehr geglaubt hab
In dieser Welt voller Schein

Lieb deine Liebe schnell
Bevor's ein anderer tut
Lieb sie so sehr du kannst
Sie meint es mit dir gut
Riskiere alles was du hast
Besser gleich als irgendwann

Denn du wirst getrieben
Von falschen Strömen der Zeit
Die mit dir nichts zu tun haben
Sei auf der Hut und bereit
Dich neu zu erfinden
Egal wie viel du verlierst
Denk nicht, sprich nicht und küss mich
Und lass es passieren

Und wenn du willst
Kannst du alles für mich sein
Woran ich nicht mehr geglaubt hab
In dieser Welt voller Schein

Lieb deine Liebe schnell
Bevor's ein anderer tut

Frida Gold,"Ich bin mittendrin und geb mich allem hin
Aber schaut man hinter die Kulissen,
Dann fängt es immer so an, ich schlafe immer zu lang,
Krieg's nicht hin und fühl mich deshalb beschissen.
Ich erkenn' mich nicht in den Schaufensterscheiben,
Entdecke nichts, was mir gefällt.
Ich brauch' die schönsten Kleider und die stärksten Männer
Und eine Hand, die meine Hand für immer festhält.

Wovon sollen wir träumen
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
Woran können wir glauben?
Wo führt das hin?
Was kommt und bleibt
So wie wir sind?

Ich fühl' mich leer und die Nacht liegt schwer,
So schwer auf meinen Schultern.
All die Hoffnung, die war ist schon lang nicht mehr da.
Schon wieder 'ne Nacht einfach vertan.
Ich hab gesucht und gesucht, in den hintersten Ecken
Nach Augen, die mich interessieren.
Noch nie hat das geklappt, doch ich mag's nicht kapieren.

Wovon sollen wir träumen
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
Woran können wir glauben?
Wo führt das hin?
Was kommt und bleibt
So wie wir sind?

Wir lassen uns treiben durch die Clubs der Stadt,
Durch fremde Hände und wir werden nicht satt.
Wir wachen dann auf bei jemand anderem Geliebten,
Von denen wir dachten, dass wir sie nie verlassen.

Wir könn' nicht mehr atmen und vergessen zu essen.
Wir trinken zu viel, es bleibt 'n Spiel ohne Ziel.
Wann hört das auf? Wann komm' wir hier raus?
Wovon sollen wir träumen?
Wo sind wir zuhaus'?
Wo sind wir zuhaus'?

Wovon sollen wir träumen
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
So wie wir sind?
Woran können wir glauben?
Wo führt das hin?
Was kommt und bleibt
So wie wir sind?

Wir lassen uns treiben durch die Clubs der Stadt,
Durch fremde Hände und wir werden nicht satt.
Wir wachen dann auf bei jemand anderem Geliebten,
Von denen wir dachten, dass wir sie nie verlassen.

Frida Gold,"Zeig mir wie du tanzt und ich sag dir wer du bist
Und so wie du guckst weiß ich wonach dir ist
Zeig mir wie du sprichst und ich sag dir was du hörst
Ich will wissen wie du riechst und ob du mich betörst

Und so wie du tanzt kann ich fühlen wer du bist
Und fast wie in Trance lassen wir uns drauf ein
Und so wie ich tanz seh ich's funkeln in deinem Blick
Wir verschmelzen ganz sanft fast von allein

Zeig mir wie du küsst und ich sag dir ob's mir schmeckt
Zeig wie du dich bewegst und ob du meine Sinne weckst
Zeig mir wie du tanzt, tanzt, tanzt, tanzt - tanzt,tanzt,tanzt,tanzt
Zeig mir wie du tanzt, tanzt, tanzt, tanzt - und ich fühl dich, und ich fühl dich

Und so wie du tanzt kann ich fühlen wer du bist
Und fast wie in Trance lassen wir uns drauf ein
Und so wie ich tanz seh ich's funkeln in deinem Blick
Wir verschmelzen ganz sanft fast von allein

So wie du dich bewegst macht alles einen Sinn
So wie du jetzt loslässt kommt plötzlich alles hin
So wie du dich anfühlst so fühlt sich Leben an
Und dich nicht mehr aufführst so kommst du endlich an
Und dich nicht mehr aufführst so kommst du endlich an

Und so wie du tanzt kann ich fühlen wer du bist
Und fast wie in Trance lassen wir uns drauf ein
Und so wie ich tanz seh ich's funkeln in deinem Blick

Ich bin auf der Suche
Nach Liebe die so ist, so wie wir waren
Pur und ohne Versuche
Und ohne Angst uns zu verlieren
Wir waren nur down, sonst nirgendwo
Wir liefen einfach so
Unbefangen, unvollkommen, im selben Flow
Uns interessierte nicht
Das die Zeit rennt
Da war nur der Moment

Doch die Dinge haben sich verändert
Und wir verfehlen so oft das Ziel
Denn wenn ich heute an Liebe denke
Dann ist es so so kompliziert
Denn die Dinge haben sich verändert
Und jeder will grad viel zu viel
Und dann geht wieder was zu Ende
Ich wünsch' mir so du wärst noch hier (Du und)

Längst
Schon verbrauchte Lippen
War Küssen nicht die Sprache des Paradies?
Längst schon enttäuschte Erwartung
Worauf warten, wenn das Gute vor uns liegt
Du warum geht das nicht
Was ist da so schwer
So zu leben und zu lieben, als gäb's kein Morgen mehr
Ich vermiss das so
Wir waren im selben Flow
Euch vermisst ich so

Doch die Dinge haben sich verändert
Und wir verfehlen so oft das Ziel
Denn wenn ich heute an Liebe denke
Dann ist es so so kompliziert
Denn die Dinge haben sich verändert
Und jeder will grad viel zu viel
Und dann geht wieder was zu Ende
Ich wünsch' mir so du wärst noch hier.

Wir sind besser zu zweit
Hab den Mut zu riskieren

Du warum geht das nicht
Was ist da so schwer
So zu leben und zu lieben, als gäb's kein Morgen mehr.

I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Friedrich Gulda,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Friend & Lover,"I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I thinks it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness 
And you may find a friend

I knew a man that I did not care for 
And then one day this man gave me a call
We sat and talked about things on our mind
And now this man he is a friend of mine
Don't be afraid of love
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid to love
Everybody needs a little love
Everybody needs somebody 
That they can be thinking of",Reach out of the Darkness

The one who runs at you cold 
When you start with a look that's endless 
Pits me up against the wall

Frightened Rabbit,"The half-backflip
Conception state hospital birth
The most threadbare, tall story the country has ever heard
Brought home to breath smoke in the arms of her mother
The blunt kitchen knife, who just lays in a submissive position
Beneath a national weight, and the slow arc of a fist

Her heart beats like a breezeblock, thrown down the stairs
Her blood is thicker than concrete, forced to be brave, she was
Born into a grave

And in the limp through years of bored schooling
She’s accustomed to hearing that she could never run far
A slipped disc in the spine of community
A bloody curse word in a pedestrian verse
Spirits in graveyards and fingers in car parks
She cries on the high street just to be heard.
A screaming anchor for nothing in particular
At the foot of the fuck of it
Dragging her heels in the dirt

Her heart beats like a breezeblock, thrown down the stairs
Her blood is thicker than concrete, forced to be brave, she was
Born into a grave

The cheek of youth flashed red and turned grey
Now she lies on the pavement she is helped to her feet
All thighs, hair and magpie handbags
Saturday’s uniform for the ‘fuck me’ parade
Brought home to keep warm in the arms of a plumber, ruddy and balding
Who just needs a spine to dig in to
A chest for the head and a hand for the holding

Her heart beats like a breezeblock, thrown down the stairs
Her blood is thicker than concrete, forced to be brave, she was
She was

Her heart beats like a breezeblock, thrown down the stairs
Her skin is thicker than concrete, forced to be brave, she was

But if blood is thicker than concrete, all is not lost.

Frightened Rabbit,"Daybreak comes with the devil’s hum
A carcass starts to breathe
Wakes one more time to try and find
A place to count its teeth
And scrub the cuts from yesterday’s
Hot scuffle in the street
Show me the door
I need somewhere to go

Daylight
Woke up hurting
With tarmac to my side
I woke up with dirty knees
Not for the first time
I woke up hurting
Though I can’t quite say why
I woke up hurting
Woke up hurting

Slug through the day, sneak between
The houses I have made
And run sacred rivers up my sleeve
Pills by mouth with lemonade
As the hours slow down, they all clock out
Of the cracked up daily grind
I’m in a back back street, coming down
I wait for the beam of light
Show me the door
I need somewhere to go

Midnight
Woke up hurting
With tarmac to my side
I woke up with dirty knees
Not for the first time
I woke up hurting
Though I can’t quite say why
I woke up hurting
Woke up hurting

We should pray for abduction, pray it comes soon

Frijid Pink,"There is a house in New Orleans,
They call the rising sun.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor Boy,
And God I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor,
Sewed my new blue jeans.
My father was a gamblin' man.
Down in New Orleans.
Now the only thing a gambler needs is
A suitcase and a trunk.
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk.

Oh mother, tell your children,
Not to do what I have done.
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun.

Well I've got one foot on the platform 
The other foot on the train 
I'm going back to New Orleans 
To wear that ball and chain

And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

With years and years of living 
Tucked up underneath their arms

They walk away from everything 
Just to see a dream come true 
So God bless the boys who make the noise 
On 16th Avenue

With a million dollar spirit 
And an old flattop guitar 
They drive to town with all they own 
In a hundred dollar car

'Cause one time someone told them 
About a friend of a friend they knew 
Who owns, you know, a studio 
On 16th Avenue

Now some were born to money 
They've never had to say ?Survive? 
And others swing a 9 pound hammer 
Just to stay alive

There's cowboys drunks and Christians 
Mostly white and black and blue 
They've all dialed the phone collect to home 
From 16th Avenue

Ah, but then one night in some empty room
Where no curtains ever hung 
Like a miracle some golden words 
Rolled off of someone's tongue

And after years of being nothing 
They're all looking right at you 
And for a while they'll go in style 
On 16th Avenue

It looked so uneventful 
So quiet and discreet 
But a lot of lives where changed 
Down on that little one way street

'Cause they walk away from everything 
Just to see a dream come true 
So God bless the boys who make the noise 
On 16th Avenue",16th Avenue

Mama, I never will change 
These young desperados who can't be tied down 
Have driven me almost insane 

Mama, I never pick winners 
I've only myself to blame 
But I'd rather gamble on a young desperado 
Cause I've always loved a good game 

Why do I fall for those crazy blue eyes? 
Those mavericks who won't settle down 
But I never could stand the touch of a man 
Who'd brand me to keep me around 

Mama, please don't feel sorry 
I've known what I've done from the start 
Well I chose a man I could love with my body 
But none I could touch with my heart 

Why do I fall for those crazy blue eyes? 
Those mavericks who won't settle down 
But I never could stand the touch of a man 
Who'd brand me to keep me around

All the cowboys down on the Sunset Strip
Wish that they could be like you.

From Ashes Rise,"


In a free land, we watch our victories,
Killing our annoyances as the troops march away.
We talk of no more, for there's a price to pay.
In a free land, children starve and are beaten to death.
We rape when we feel, and we take no shit.
In decisive calm, mediated for viewing pleasure,
We cherish revenge to the sound of war.
This is not make believe.
This is so fucking real.
Dead mothers still there, dead brothers still there, dead children still there.
Now do you believe?
In a course of annihilation, in a fervor of terror to take control of who we are,
Death by design, a plan of war.
This is not make believe, this is so fucking real.
This is war.






",In a Free Land
From Ashes Rise,"


Next to nightmares, there are no dreams, shattered skulls in splitting seams.
The pounds of cancer, they just can't scream.
Six feet under, who would believe?
Days and night living with death, medicate the symptoms, but let them bleed.
We all live in hells.
We won't believe when the truth of lies is their belief.
We will bring you down the same as those you have taken from me.
Lies and deceit.
No more lies of stolen dreams taken from me.






",Nightmares
From Ashes Rise,"


Listen to the piercing cacophony that falls from your tongue,
To your own beating heart in the bedlam and hum,
To the bellicose turmoil in the breaths of the young.
Listen to the requiem.
Show your face or perish.

It’s still the same old story, it’s still the same old story

All of these days

That it died
Paths that we made
Left to decay
All from betrayal and pride
Feels like D-Day
When we stay
Like cars on freeways that collide
Let’s be safe
And not retrace
Mistakes that we made throughout time

If I make it out alive
I’ll make it my last goodbye

This is a train in the night
And now it's time for you to go
You know you've had a healthy life, boy.

You walk this world like you're a ghost
Your hands are coming through the needles
Sick of your tragic and the evils
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith, but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone
How are you feeling?
Seem a little sick to me now

This is a coming of the times
You are a witness to the movement

If all you're seeing is your lies
You had your chance, but now you've blown it.
You want this world so you can own it
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith, but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone

How are you feeling?
You seem a little sick to me

From the light on high
A chance to change your fate
Forgiveness falling down
On those who chose to wait
Remember the time
Find yourself home again
Deep within your life
Find yourself a home again find yourself home again
It's a choice
You have chosen your own

In the old days
When the world was young and bright 
If you raise the mask, who will lead us home tonight

Kid frost

This is big business, understand me?
Yeah, you can't take no for a answer

Welcome to the world of big business, lives get broken and made
You're walkin barefoot in a room full of razorblades
We're playin catch with a hand grenade
Cause what you faggot niggas caught
Spread you all over the asphalt
Walk the walk, talk to nobody
Spark the chrome shotie
Whenever they run up on your home, gotti
Gangsta, gangsta, read all about it
Xzibit get your whole shit crowded
And packed to capacity
You actually had the audacity
To want some problems with the x man
Lift you off your feet with the back of my left hand
Learn one of life's hard lessons
You can't negotiate with a weapon
When it's fully loaded and cocked
Hollow points shot
Next to the firing pin, with the hammer ready to drop
I took you off, so accept the loss
Crack open some olde english that's covered with frost
And it's like that

[ chorus ]
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for stackin the papers

Chasin my chips till my last days
Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

{frost}
I'm in pursuit of them hundred dollar big faces
Wrapped in rubber bands in em bulletproof briefcases
Please understand automatically
One squeeze of the trigger cause tragedy
Casually fucked around and got your whole family mad at me
My strategy: subtract enemies mathematically
Frost will kick your head off slow, you ain't as bad as me
50/50 - half gangster, half hustler
One side's about my business, and the other side's a muthafucka
So when I creep, I crawl, I'm like swiss-made
Fuck are you, bitch-made, I slice you with my switchblade
Razor, got the h-k with the laser
Slid the enterpriser, rent a 99 black blazer
I shot straight at merino
Thousand dollar suite, layin low at the peppermint casino
I been a player before I had riches
And now I'm eatin steak and crab and fuckin bad bitches

[ chorus ]

{jayo felony}
I don't give a fuck about not one of y'all
Disrespect this here, nigga, it's real clear I'm gunnin y'all
When night falls, nah fuck, night flies a kite
I take flight like delta, nigga, helter skelter
Who the fuck could you call to help ya
Nigga, good health couldn't help ya
Put the 's' in spit, bust your tightest shit, never felt ya
Could you picture yourself in the same room when I let these off
Two rivals, suicidal, take the strap and squeeze off
But before you do it, I take the heater and shoot both your knees off
Let him suffer, can't get enough of, I'm rougher
Go get my ammunitions and paper, nigga, cause it's a habit
Let off on ya in a 600, or let's call em rabbit
Is it tragic how the automatic made you breathe like a asthmatic
Static, what's that? that shit that get up in my fabric
I'm into bitches and beamers and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on em schemers when I dip, bitch

'Til through holes in the old rotten roof snowed the cold light of the morning
Back when you, substitute for girls
Surrogate for food and the passer of the time
In the aching dehydrated dawn
With my bruised up heart on the mend
And I'd hold you in my hand
Yeah I'll miss you my unusual friend

I knew that if you stuck around
One weird warm night you'd sneak in my room and kill me
And then float out of my lungs on a breeze
But I'll miss you my unusual friend
'Cause you were all in the world that I had
Yeah I'll miss you my unusual friend",My Unusual Friend
Fruit Bats,"Oh, the time that you broke down and told me that one dream
Your eyes a bit misty and so sincere
Where the rivers were veins so relentlessly pumping
And the sky was a monster made out of tears

I recall when you woke up and told me another
Of huge uncontrollable helium hands
And an antelope's heart and a quiver of arrows
were the gifts that you got from the primitive man

Or the time you were screaming and sweating and crying
Dreaming of a ride in a leaky raft
Down the rivers, the veins so relentlessly pumping
Deep into the heart of the primitive man

One two three stop",Primitive Man
Fruit Bats,"You'll always have smokes if you always give buckets of love
Like little sad Tad who was living on beetles and grubs
He had a blue-eyed merle
and loved an Indian girl
Lived alone in the warm wet fields in this corner of the world

You'll always eat bread if you always have seeds to sow
Like old Zen Ben who lived with a murder of crows
He wore a crown of beans
And a belt of weeds
Slept alone in the warm wet fields on a bed of mustard seed

You won't lose the beat if you just keep clapping your hands
Like sweet sweet Pete who clapped for the Ruminant Band
He had a broken lung
And a bit-off tongue
Lived alone in the warm wet fields under moon and sun",The Ruminant Band
Fruit Bats,"He got lonely every time the cantina lights came up on the Indian Casino Queen
Cause he'd loved her from the time she'd been the waitress at the Mexican place where he'd left his keys

She'd been there smiling at the lost and found
Then he took her to see Three Dog Night
They were playing at the fair grounds
Holding hands singing ""Joy to the World""

She was way too young but he did not care
He was all right with cashing in
a few fine moments before his broken heart kicked in

He died a little bit each time the night came in
And the stars fell over Michigan
'Cause he'd loved her at the bar when he saw her dancing to
""I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man""

Then he'd come over to his usual spot
Soon they were making out at 3AM in the empty parking lot
They lay together under the burnt out stars

She never loved him back
It wasn't even close
But he was fine to just pretend
That it was never gonna end
And it was worth it just to know
A little warmth before the snow",Singing Joy to the World
Fruit Bats,"I was born in Tegucigalpa the only day it ever snowed there
Was a frozen wave that killed the yucca and the Adam's fig
I always seem to bring the cold anywhere I ever go
That's just the way it's always gonna be

My family moved us ever northward up to the terra borealis
Along the crooked pikes of the ruminants and voyageurs
But my heart belongs to the smoke of Hamilton and Monongahela
And all the dirty cities along the way

But you know they all lied to you
Them there with the spider eyes
It'll always keep you warm
It'll always treat you nice

I was floated in just this morning
Woke up a thousand miles from nowhere
I'm a broke-legged paint in a herd of unicorns y'know
I always seem to bring the gray skies every time I ever fly
From all the dirty cities along the way

But you know they all lied to you
These folks with the spider eyes
I'll always keep you warm
I'll always treat you nice

I'll never snow on your parade
I'll never bring a cloudy day

Thank you all so very much you crossers of the many time zones
But I'm heading back to the place that makes sense to me
'Cause my heart belongs to the snows of Buffalo and Chicago
And all the dirty cities along the way",Tegucigalpa

Donde no llega el cariño, ni la voz de nadie,
Así me paso los días, y la noche entera,
Solo vivo del recuerdo, eterno de mi madre.

Ahí al fin, ahí cambiara mi suerte.

I look inside the mirror and look in myself, I'm hopin' for help
Everyday I'm hopin' for a brand new strife
The shores of North America, I'm bound to survive
Though I'm not the same, yo I carry a gift
Tricked and sold his cargo on the bowels of ships
But yo, I got my pride, tighten up my stand
Lookin' at the stars, the original man...
Never thought that it would ever come to this
Migrate really wasn't a time when life was great
I want to go home to the Bering Straights
A place where I know where my kid's is safe
Thoughts of runnin' foul like a rampant disease
Yet, my skin tone really couldn't bring the ease
Gettin' weaker by the day, months and years
Thousands of years we reign, but now I shed a tear

Don't want to use a gun, shoot drugs and dope
Don't want to wear a cross, 'cause it brings no hope
In the beginnin' as we know, started back in the land
Well defined, their complexion was just like mines
Come to find we was lead and upon direct
Now we cheat, steal and kill and lost all respect
How much pain would you take before you break the chain?
Most of us don't even care, we was planted with fear
We say the babies are the future, but what's the fuss?
Broken homes, growin' up, they act worse than us
Since we all been double-crossed, sins we wear with pride
Believe the lies, yet, still ain't open our eyes
Lookin' forward to the day that I fast and pray
These is questions that I always say

Goin' through a struggle, yeah it's hard at first
Bein' put down, shunned, ragged, tagged and dragged
The inner strength leave the soul through a body of one
Can't be mad, yo, I'm glad, 'cause I know where I'm from
Priceless, I'm like a treasure, I can't be touched
Made an image of myself from the grains of dust
Mold and shape the woman with the curves of a snake
Travel light years away and then return to base
Eliminatin' evil's more like a daily chore
Teachin' my ways, that's how I spend most of my days
Balance attack, never been scared to be black
Manifestin' only actual facts
Savin' the kids, spreadin' love, yo, that's how to life
Justice is my reward for the acts that I did
Think about all the things in time, seek and you'll find

Frumpy,"By the way
The only question didn't get an answer
Where we're coming from and where we're going to
On this dawn, leading us from somewhere?

Out of darkness we came, and land on mark these days
But to us
Guideless we let and fall just these ways
By these ways

For me, religion isn't just a tale
Telling from past times
It tells about a meeting
Between us and astronauts from distant stars
You have to read between the lines! 

Thousands of girls before loved angels
And want rescue ends
For if I look around, now all aware
Drop very same wond'ring face
By, by, Oh! 

Now all alone, it will take me along from here
Before you see offset

One day, when we fly at the speed of light
We'll find a star and not the human race

You try to unblock the understanding
And keep slowly blight and may be even bright
In time, too long era to last
Will I want go to the sun?

Gather, became a house of fools
With flaming roof and based on sand below
Heaven, got sagged and saled on mourning
But prepared by the inner soul
But break down, but break soon brings good

By, by, by the way
We really could find the answer
Where we're coming from and where we're going to
On this good dawn, leading us from somewhere

Out of darkness we came, and land on mark these days
But to us
Guideless we let and fall just these ways

Naughty, naughty, very naughty

There's a guy in the place 
He's got a bittersweet face 
And he goes by the name of Ebeneezer Goode 
His friends call him Eezer and he is the main geezer 
And he'll vibe about the place like no other man could 
He's refined, he's sublime, he makes you feel fine 
Though very much maligned and misunderstood 
But if you know Eezer he's a real crowd pleaser 
He's ever so good, he's Ebeneezer Goode 
You can see that he's mischievous, mysterious and devious 
When he circulates amongst the people in the place 
But once you know he's fun and something of a genius 
He gives a grin that goes around from face to face to face 
Backwards and then forwards, forwards and then backwards 
Eezer is the geezer who loves to muscle in 
That's about the time the crowd all shout the name of Eezer 
As he's kotcheled in the corner, laughing by the bass bin

He created the vibe 
He takes you for a ride and as if by design 
The party ignites like he's comin alive 
He takes you to the top, shakes you all around 
Then back down, you know as he gets mellow 
Then as smooth as the groove that is making you move 
He glides into your mind with a sunny Hello 
A gentleman of leisure, he's there for your pleasure 
But go easy on old Eezer he's the love you could lose 
Extraordinary fellow, like Mr. Punchinello 
He's the kind of geezer who must never be abused 
When you're in town and Ebeneezer is around 
You can sense a presence in the sound of the crowd 
He gets them all at it, the party starts rocking 
The people get excited it's time to shout loud

Come follow me now, mon
'cause Mr. Chip Fu is the Don
I think I'll tikki than I will tembo
Then I will no-so, then I will rembo
Paribari rucheep yo, Poc pass me that pen, yo, right
They can't catch this lyrical style that's wicked and wild
That I display
Slick and I'm quick with the rhyme tactic
Taught and brought by the teacher and the sinsa
So if you come test, I'm badder than the rest
Style and technique is perfect
Fighting and writing these lyrical styles my hobby and favorite subject
Buddha taught me and it brought me
Lyrical styles which is true
Done by the A the E the I, I mean Chip Fu
I drippity-drop on hip-hop
I love rub-a-dub because it's crisp
So you really got to rock, you really got to twist
You got to listen to this

He can't test you, he's a wimp
He'll be walking with a limp
So don't try to test Chip Fu, you fantail shrimp
What are you, Bullwinkle or Rocky
Don't start no beef or broccoli
So give it up, you lost, or you better duck sauce

Hey, check out our lyrical style, it's versatile
And while, yeah, we still get smiles
I bet you never heard nobody rhyme like us
We kick our rhymes like crazy fools
Eat MC's like Cheese Doodles
By Banton, yo, Pass the wanton soup, troop
He's talking caca
Yo, what's the shock of the day, hey
Say moo-goo-gai-pan, man, hey, I thought he was gay
So hold his wrist up
Now, I'm going to have to twist off his arm
Like my boy Chip-Fu said, you should have ""ringed the alarm""
He call you Buckwheat, with bucked teeth
Tall with Daffy Duck feet
Now that's for having on Bruce Lees
Your techniques stale, of course you'll fail
Against the super-dope fly ebony male
Ducktales! Huey, Duey, Louie, Fuey, chop suey
Egg foo young's on my tongue, hey, that's kind of gooey
I chopsticks with drop kicks
My chow mein's plain
I do the Tiger, the Snake, and the big daddy Crane

I love pih poh, which is hip hop
This backwards lyrical style that I drop from the pot ytippit, the tippity

(3x)

Ring the alarm, I don't want to stay calm cause
I'm about to rip this psalm
When the mic is gripped my lyrics do split up like
Bombs from Vietnam
Cause I'm sweet, neat, I don't romp or skinteet
Lyrics I lick with my tongue
And rhymes I nymn with my teeth
This lyrical prophet you can't stop this from the West Indies
You can tell I'm a lyrical prophet from the words spoken and broken up
In these books and scrolls that I unfold
The knowledge I use does make me bold
The intelligence in my system
Converts itself and becomes wisdom
Born in Trinidad, not Tobogo, land of steel pan and calypso
Cyop is a buck and a buck is a cyop
That's the real true thing and a natural fact
This lyrical man you can't hold me back
From the red, the white, and also the black
Island, which is my land, my place of birth
You can tell by the tongue that's swung
And the lyrical structure in me verse
So all MC's don't cross this border
Cause by now you should know sort of
Lyrically wise but now I despise
All youth that's out of order
Don't try to test any of the Schnikens
Cause I'm not done with the lyrical boxin'
The beatin' and the lickin'

Ring the alarm, another sound is dying, whoa, aye
(3x)

You two-facety, you can't face me
And my rhymes you'll bite and learn
Soon you'll acknowledge my lyrical substance just like a bookworm
Chip FU, then you will extend and show all the youth them
That me big boutcha under roots and culture
And the bad bull in the pen
Because when I grip the mic (yes, man)
All MC's they do stop yes and hush
Any mic I touch, any mic I brush, any mic I clutch
With these lyrical styles of such
And if I do unleash a lyrical masterpiece
Lyrics never cease, then a piece I'll unleash and make it brief
Please don't bite yes or thief
see-H-I-P FU is my name, it will stay just the same
Give me any mic on stage in a rage I'll engage
And drop rhymes just the same
Quote for quote, note for note, did you comphrehend
So jack it up and pull it up operator
Wheel and come again
Cause MC's try these rastafarianic raps and sound like want to-be's
But a want to-be's not what I want to be
See the FU-Schnickens have to be
The true prophets free
Free to preach FU-Schnick prophecies
We thee untouchable, matchable, stoppable MC's for unity
Me, a rastafarian, no not me but I do stun
I'm not faking Jamacian, so all MC's you better run
Because Mr. Chip FU man a come
And me sitdong pon de riddim sitdong pion de vibes
A de hartical don
True me full up a style and me wicked and wild
With peer pattern watch how me chat it in a verb
And capsize it in a noun
Uno better give I and I respect
When this Trinidadian I come
Sing out

Ring the alarm, another sound is dying, whoa, aye

Phenomenon one, phenomenon two, phenomenon three
Come follow me
POC FU's the rough-neck chicken and I'm the wild Apache
See I'm the see the H the I the P
Down with the P the O the see, the K the you the N the G
The M the O, yes and the see
And when the M the I the see is in my H the A-N-D
I preach and teach and educate all ghetto youth about unity
But wait, let me get set not to sweat
But to get something straight
All MC's come out with good styles
And all of them do sound great
But ring the alarm and don't stay calm
Because I won't procrastinate
These lyrical styles that I compile
To preach and teach and educate me
A new jack brother (who's that)
When you were at the parties rapping and scratching I did a chat
On tape, on tape and cassette, you'll hear me live and direct
Yes and who never hear me yet when you hear my voice it's perfect
So just pack up because your lyrics are weak when you speak
Don't step so just back up, wake up, take off the make-up
The mic because I'll break up
MC's limbs from limb, slim me trim
You see me, I don't follow no style and I don't follow no pattern
So take head to this lesson I bring or the lesson I brought
Which was taught to one and another
All slack MC's better ring the alarm

I just stay true to my roots and then I get ill
Twenty years of age, but yet I still see knowledge
And this year, was so-called, my Senior year in collega
But I chose to pursue, in a field called music
And with some hype beats and breaks you know I won't refuse it
Get on the board lay down the track and I'll do ten laps
Pass the pen, pass the pad, and I'll kick nuff RAPS
Just come inside your jam and witness who is boss
And it won't be Tony Danza nor Diana Ross
As small as I am, I still can pack jams
Do a freestyle, and step, but yet I still slam
Not tryin to say that no one can get with me
Not only is it the lyrics I write, it's my delivery
Name one rapper that you know who has this high-strung voice
My name's Malik and I'm unique, in other words top choice

reached up for the sky, but it always seems so far away

all the changes simply haunt and never go away
a friend will tell when I hit hell, I may not feel the change
