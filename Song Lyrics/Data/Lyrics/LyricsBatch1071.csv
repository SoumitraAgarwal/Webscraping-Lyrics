Orelsan,"Aujourd'hui sera le dernier jour de mon existence
La dernière fois que je ferme les yeux
Mon dernier silence
J'ai longtemps cherché la solution à ces nuisances
Ça m’apparaît maintenant comme une évidence
Fini d'être une photocopie
Finies la monotonie, la lobotomie
Aujourd'hui je mettrai ni ma chemise ni ma cravate
J'irai pas jusqu'au travail, je donnerai pas la patte
Adieu les employés de bureau et leurs vies bien rangées
Si tu pouvais rater la tienne, ça les arrangerait
Ça prendrait un peu de place dans leurs cerveaux étriqués
Ça les conforterait dans leur médiocrité
Adieu les représentants grassouillets
Qui boivent jamais d'eau comme s'ils ne voulaient pas se mouiller
Les commerciaux qui sentent l'after-shave et le cassoulet
Mets de la mayonnaise sur leur mallette, ils se la boufferaient
Adieu, adieu les vieux comptables séniles
Adieu les secrétaires débiles et leurs discussions stériles
Adieu les jeunes cadres fraîchement diplômés
Qu'empileraient les cadavres pour arriver jusqu'au sommet
Adieu tous ces grands PDG
Essaie d'ouvrir ton parachute doré quand tu te fais défenestrer
Ils font leur beurre sur des salariés désespérés
Et jouent les vierges effarouchées quand ils se font séquestrer
Tous ces fils de quelqu'un
Ces fils d'une pute snob
Qui partagent les trois quarts des richesses du globe
Adieu les petits patrons
Ces beaufs embourgeoisés
Qui grattent des RTT pour payer leurs vacances d'été
Adieu les ouvriers, ces produits périmés
C'est la loi du marché, mon pote, t'es bon qu'à te faire virer
Ça t'empêchera d'engraisser ta gamine affreuse
Qui se fera sauter par un pompier, qui va finir coiffeuse
Adieu la campagne et ses familles crasseuses
Proches du porc au point d'attraper la fièvre aphteuse
Toutes ces vieilles, ces commères qui se bouffent entre elles
Ces vieux radins et leurs économies de bouts de chandelles
Adieu cette France profonde
Profondément stupide, cupide, inutile, putride
C'est fini, vous êtes en retard d'un siècle
Plus personne n'a besoin de vos bandes d’incestes
Adieu tous ces gens prétentieux dans la capitale
Qui essaient de prouver qu'ils valent mieux que toi chaque fois qu'ils te parlent
Tous ces connards dans la pub, dans la finance
Dans la com', dans la télé, dans la musique, dans la mode
Ces Parisiens, jamais contents, médisants
Faussement cultivés, à peine intelligents
Ces répliquant qui pensent avoir le monopole du bon goût
Qui regardent la province d'un œil méprisant
Adieu les sudistes abrutis par leur soleil cuisant
Leur seul but dans la vie c'est la troisième mi-temps
Accueillants, soi-disant
Ils te baisent avec le sourire
Tu peux le voir à leur façon de conduire
Adieu ces nouveaux fascistes
Qui justifient leurs vies de merde par des idéaux racistes
Devenu néo-nazis parce que t'avais aucune passion
Au lieu de jouer les SS, trouve une occupation
Adieu les piranhas dans leur banlieue
Qui voient pas plus loin que le bout de leur haine au point qu'ils se bouffent entre eux
Qui deviennent agressifs une fois qu'ils sont à 12
Seuls ils lèveraient pas le petit doigt dans un combat de pouce
Adieu les jeunes moyens, les pires de tous
Ces baltringues supportent pas la moindre petite secousse
Adieu les fils de bourges
Qui possèdent tout mais ne savent pas quoi en faire
Donne leur l'Eden ils t'en font un Enfer
Adieu tous ces profs dépressifs
T'as raté ta propre vie, comment tu comptes élever mes fils?
Adieu les grévistes et leur CGT
Qui passent moins de temps à chercher des solutions que des slogans pétés
Qui fouettent la défaite du survêt' au visage
Transforment n'importe quelle manif' en fête au village
Adieu les journalistes qui font dire ce qu'ils veulent aux images
Vendraient leur propre mère pour écouler quelques tirages
Adieu la ménagère devant son écran
Prête à gober la merde qu'on lui jette entre les dents
Qui pose pas de question tant qu'elle consomme
Qui s'étonne même plus de se faire cogner par son homme
Adieu, ces associations bien-pensantes
Ces dictateurs de la bonne conscience
Bien contents qu'on leur fasse du tort
C'est à celui qui condamnera le plus fort
Adieu lesbiennes refoulées, surexcitées
Qui cherchent dans leur féminité une raison d'exister
Adieu ceux qui vivent à travers leur sexualité
Danser sur des chariots, c'est ça votre fierté?
Les Bisounours et leur pouvoir de l'arc-en-ciel
Qui voudraient me faire croire qu'être hétéro c'est à l'ancienne
Tellement tellement susceptibles
Pour prouver que t'es pas homophobe faudra bientôt que tu suces des types
Adieu ma nation, tous ces incapables dans les administrations
Ces rois de l’inaction
Avec leur bâtiments qui donnent envie de vomir
Qui font exprès d'ouvrir à des heures où personne peut venir
Bêh, tous ces moutons pathétiques
Change une fonction dans leur logiciel, ils se mettent au chômage technique
Á peu près le même Q.I. que ces saletés de flics
Qui savent pas construire une phrase en dehors de leur sales répliques
Adieu les politiques, en parler serait perdre mon temps
Tout le système est complètement incompétent
Adieu les sectes, adieu les religieux
Ceux qui voudraient m'imposer des règles pour que je vive mieux
Adieu les poivrots qui rentrent jamais chez eux
Qui préfèrent se faire enculer par la Française des Jeux
Adieu les banquiers véreux
Le monde leur appartient
Adieu tous les pigeons qui leur mangent dans la main
Je comprends que j'ai rien à faire ici quand je branche la 1
Adieu la France de Joséphine Ange-Gardien
Adieu les hippies leur naïveté qui changera rien
Adieu les SM, libertins et tous ces gens malsains
Adieu ces pseudo-artistes engagés
Pleins de banalités démagogues dans la trachée
Écouter des chanteurs faire la morale ça me fait chier
Essaie d'écrire des bonnes paroles avant de la prêcher
Adieu les petits mongoles qui savent écrire qu'en abrégé
Adieu les sans papiers, les clochards, tous ces tas de déchets
Je les hais!
Les sportifs, les hooligans dans les stades
Les citadins, les bouseux dans leur étables
Les marginaux, les gens respectables
Les chômeurs, les emplois stables, les génies, les gens passables
De la plus grande crapule à la Médaille du Mérite
De la première dame au dernier trav' du pays!",Suicide Social
Orelsan,"Au fond j'crois qu'la terre est ronde
Pour une seule bonne raison
Après avoir fait l'tour du monde
Tout ce qu'on veut c'est être à la maison

T'as besoin d'une voiture pour aller travailler
Tu travailles pour rembourser la voiture que tu viens d'acheter
Tu vois ce genre de cercle vicieux,
Le genre de truc qui donne envie de tout faire sauf de mourir vieux

Tu peux courir à l'infini
Et à la poursuite du bonheur la terre est ronde autant l'attendre ici
J'suis pas feignant mais j'ai la flemme
Et ça va finir en arrêt maladie pour toute la semaine

J'veux profiter des gens que j'aime
J'veux prendre le temps avant qu'le temps me prenne et m'emmène
J'ai des centaines de trucs sur le feu

Fais c'que tu veux dans ta vie mais surtout fais de l'argent

A quoi ça sert de préparer l'avenir si t'oublies d'vivre?

En caleçon qui m'sert de pyjama
Au lieu de lécher mon patron pour une avance qu'il m'filera pas
Ce soir j'rameuterai l'équipe
En attendant merci d'appeler mais s'il te plaît parle après l'bip

Orenda Fink,"Where are the ones who lived before?
They are the cold winds in the north
Where are the ones who teach us how?
In sweet magnolias in the south
How do you hear the elders speak?
In the rains across the east
And what about the spirits' breath?
Their sigh, a dust storm in the west

Who are you?
I am an animal

Where are the ones who lived before?
They are the cold winds in the north
Where are the ones who teach us how?
In sweet magnolias in the south
How do you hear the elders speak?
In the rains across the east
And what about the spirits' breath?
Their sigh, a dust storm in the west

Who are you?
I am a man with will

Where are you?
I came from the hill

Where are the ones who lived before?
They are the cold winds in the north
Where are the ones who teach us how?
In sweet magnolias in the south
How do you hear the elders speak?
In the rains across the east
And what about the spirits' breath?
Their sigh, a dust storm in the west

Who are you?
I am the invisible

Orenda Fink," I am happy every hour of the day
Every hour that I stay
In this lighthouse
Where the doors don't open
I'll forget what I had once been
Only hours before

I am happy every hour of each day
Every hour that I remain
In this blind asylum
Where it can't be seen
What I had once been
Only hours before

A demon was all they'd seen in me
In the morning I'll close my eyes
And leave
Bu tonight, I am happy
",Blind Asylum
Orenda Fink,"Trace your bloodline
They'll take care of you
They're still your family
No matter what they've done to you

And the cold air stings my eyes
As I take his hand, he says,
""Just let your body do the rest""

Slave plantations
Got a lot of grass
It was my own temptation
But I made a lot of cash

And the cold air stings my eyes
As I take his hand, he says,
""Just let your body do the rest""

And the church bells ring 
One million miles away from here 
Where nobody ever rests

It's all over now
It's in my soul
There's no way out
If I catch you breathing

And the cold air stings my eyes
As I take his hand, he says,
""Just let your body do the rest""

Orenda Fink,"In a flatbed, in a trailer
You are royalty there
Among kings and their jailers
You speak the truth with your open mouth
Oh, to be a boy
In the dirty south

In the rec room
When the rains came
She opened her arms to you
You tried to love her, well,
You only ended up in jail
The dirty south
Is your living hell

A tree, you stand there
While they sharpen their blades
To cut you down

Beautiful things can come from
The dark I once said and I
Hoped that you would believe and
Rise up from the ashes, but now
You've been beaten down
By the dirty south
So, let's give a crown
A gold, shining crown
To the dirty south

To be a boy
In the dirty south",Dirty South
Orenda Fink,"Those were shards of glass that cut your foot
From the dishes you smashed, I knew you would
Standing there helpless, like a child
The fight's over, and you won
But against who? There's no one there now
But me and you
I put you to bed
And close the door, but there's still war
On Easter Island

The demons they hover
Your father, mother
The things they did to you
Like no other
Over the years, have been forgotten
But not in your heart and
It's still fighting
On Easter Island

High low, high low
I'll search that stretch
Come back home
From Easter Island
Come back home
From Easter Island
",Easter Island
Orenda Fink,"Something's happened, now you're far away
You had to leave, no time to explain
I called Brother said, ""Mother's gone
The red bird came and took her off.
I asked, ""Will she be in heaven above
All over my shoulder like a carrier dove?"" 

He said, ""One, two, three, four-
There ain't no devil, there ain't no Lord.
Five, six, seven, eight-
Only love, only hate.""

I went to preacher to seek the truth
The wisest man that I knew -
The preacher had fallen, his collar torn
He slept with the bottle, his face unshorn
He looked at me with bloodshot eyes
A beaten man can tell no lies- 

He said, ""Prophets, pimps, angels, whores
There ain't no devil, there ain't no Lord.
Money grows to fill the preacher's bank
He saves your soul for himself to take.""

I travelled the world to understand
The words he spoke were no man's
I came to an island of beauty and pain
Shimmering souls, untamed
And now children, talking bright
Sing to me in the night-

They sing, ""One, two, three, four,
There ain't no devil, there ain't no lord.
Five, six, seven, eight,
Invisible ones guard the gate.
Invisible ones guard the gate.""",Invisible Ones Guard the Gate
Orenda Fink,"I make it each day
With the help of the good lord
But late night
I comb the streets
Looking for a way to feed

Hell came in the way
Of a war and a child
They never returned
He never returned

We raise our hands and pray
Les invisibles
We hold our heads in shame

And as my weathered hands 
Cracked and colored
With years of pain
Of the broken hearted
Frame their plates
Of white and gold
You take no note of your warm presenter
Would you like to know what I've done for dinner
And why I've outlived my boy?

Justice serve it to you
You've waged this war

Orenda Fink,"On a bridge by the mill
I laid down my life
I opened my arms 
Embraced the night
And with no wings to fly 
I fell
I leave it all 
I leave it all

The things that I said 
I'd take them back if I could
The god to whom I prayed, 
Played a trick on me good
Now I see his face, it's just as well

Orenda Fink,"A bed of cotton and lace
Hair down to her little waist
She waits for the sun to go down
Her visitors leave back to their
Town of pain and grief
They'd laid their hands on her gown
And prayed for a miracle
The girl works miracles

A room of things she's never seen
Surrounds her while she sleeps and
Reminds us of the child inside
A body that's been barely alive for years
And the people, they can't stop their tears
As they pray for a miracle
The girl works miracles
We heard she works for miracles

Her mother shows for all to see
Statues cry, walls bleed
The desperate ones line up each day
Hoping she will take their pain away
One touch of her hand 
Is all they crave-
And hope for a miracle
The girl works miracles
We heard she works miracles
The girl works miracles
The girl works miracles
",Miracle Worker
Orenda Fink,"It was the year of the floor
It was the hand of god
The strength of a monsoon
A revolution

I put my hand in the cup
Drew my name from the mud
I had changed it once before
But that didn't change things

We still came
We still come
And we still go
But I can't live without you, though

I put my face to the glass
But it's you that stares back
I had changed it once before
But that didn't change things

The year of the drought
It was the hand of god
The absence of water 
Made us fearful

After all I could find
Were the wells of my mind
I had changed it once before
But that didn't change things

No evolution
No evolution

I know there's a circle of death and birth
But I won't wait and lose you to this big black earth

No evolution

I put my hand on your face
With men laws to replace
The ones that say that
We must leave each other one day

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

And I hear them singing

Organized Konfusion,"[Pharoahe Monch]
By the grace of God, I give a speech like Malcolm
Expressin, flexin, flaunt the style that's wicked (UHH!)
Inflicted, addicted -- now people can't understand
the particular way that I've kicked it
Smooth (mmm) is it not?  (Yup!)
Is it dope?  (Yup!)  Is it hype?  (Mmm-hmm)  Is it hot?
Easy for you to hum along to whenever I'm rappin
Keepin your feet, tappin, and keepin your hands
comin together you may think you're nice but I am Alpha Beta
Glee and clap on the microphone, to kick a rhyme like, this one..

[Prince Poetry]
Artistical formulas, label me as a hip lyric professor
Pressin to be the one a lyrical chauvanist
Study facts my brother, read all about it
Cause Prince Poetry and Monch gets on down undoubted!

	Somethin smooth yes, prepare for the audience pleasers
	United together, through thick and thin forever
	Just for the people's pleasure
	This is something new for you
	We are.. the simply too positive MC's

[Pharoahe Monch]
Design a rhyme like an inventor
Intertwine, combine the centrifugal forces in the center
giving it a steady a flow, who's like dope (you are!)
Better yet, I'm like acid
Cooler than Lake Placid
You're loving it when I'm passing it off, slick (slick)
So that you know (so that you know)

[Prince Poetry]
Well it's me, your majesty, Prince Po, I flow
like spring water out of a faucet when I complete it
the text like toss it cause I will toss it to the Pharoahe
Capital M, lowercase O, then the N, then the see-H
Witness the presence of the two N-E-W
Intellectual through rhythm I went interjectin you
a few messages, paragraphs, stories, a few laughs
When it comes to steppin yo there ain't no quarters
or even a half like poison, I subject to feed you venom
I find em, line em up, I fold em up, and Monch will KILL EM!

[Pharoahe Monch]
Curteous!  Givin a high-five or handshake
but I can flip, like a chef at the House of Pancakes
When I speak, I create a new strange tongue
MC's clingin I bring on a new swing and they swung
off the tip I'm well equipped to stick to the cut when rhymin
The kind of MC you find, with the mind of a ?mizda?
Chronological timing or maybe Simon Bar Sinister

[Prince Poetry]
Hmmm, mm mm mmm!  Yo
Sometimes I'd rather stop acceleratin and flow
to a slowwwwwwwer tempo sit back relax bust the
introduction that you're sleepin on, I must awaken you
Now come with us cruise in, cause me and Monch
is takin you to another dimension, keepin you up to par
Look up to me as an advisor
Much wiser than the average rap star/struck you
not as another but a brother who's hype
Sim-pl-ly too positive MC's too dope too trife
to comprehend, this is finally the end
To my foes and my skeezers, the audience pleasers

Here we go again with the funky intro
People approach me knowin I`m the Prince Po
e-t, are-why, and I`m the first batter
The Pharaoh usually go first, but it don`t matter
Funky slices of beats like this
Comes once in a blue, but it`s not hard for me to chew
So kick off your shoes and don`t forget your socks
I wash and wash them emcess like Clorox
Skills I have, good and plenty
If you want dope lyrics but still gimmicks gimme
Beats, equivalent to just something that I can
Flow [flow] flow [flow] FLOAT ONnnnnn
It`s gettin heavy so heavy and keep ya coat on
When I, proceed to, light the party
In the summer, somethin like a Mardi, Gras
Bikinis, panties, bras
Juicin em and I`m suckin the girls up like straws
OOPS upside ya dome
I don`t answer the phone when I`m home not alone
on the bone
Leave your name and your number and a brief message at the end of the tone
BOOP!
Oooooh, and I like it
Cause I`m Poetry the psychic
Intellectual level would rather
nah, nah I don`t like that
{talking} one more time
Rollin lyrics, off the tip of my tongue [swing]
I swing [swing], I swang [swang], I swung [swung]
Bringin you the news like Kaity Chung
But I`m not a pretty oriental specimen from
`Hong Kong Fooey, numba one supa guy`
I love the women but I don`t try to see em
I`d rather make the money bein on the cover of E.M.
Get MCs mad make em flare up nostrils
I`m Poetry the rap fanatic I get hostile

Verse Two: Pharaoh Monch][
Pressure presssure pressure pressure pressure pressure cooker
I leave the party when I mass a lot of hookers
Slip and slide, I slid the sludge
[fudge] fudge [pudge] pudge, but I never hold a grudge
Up against the wall, I caught you with the drugs
[The organism`s on the jury] guess who`s the judge
I hit the hook HEAVY
Ready no chitter-chatter I figure since I`m bigger why pitter-patter
Props in no particular poetry persists to pertriculate ?
You`re just a pussy [MEOW]
Cat when I`m deckin you
Disrespectin you
Clever whenever I select a new dialogue
One plus one get it together
Girls don`t despair cause I`ll be your `Fair Weather Friend`
No I don`t have a Benz and no I don`t have an Infiniti
I figure the eight inches of ME, will be the remedy
Cause when I pull up to the bumper
Cause I`ll be down to thump a girl like Heather Hunter
I tell you now you never hated

Organized Konfusion,"There's just too many rages
Too many infinite screams at night, we're living in concrete cages
Another child is doomed, to be torn in his mother's womb
by the spark of the twelve gauges
Sometimes it seems like I can't go on, I can't go on
But when I envision a black man with thorns in his hand
on a crucifix I get strong
Never will I ever let a devil deceive me again (HA!) mislead me
Cause what I'ma hit you with's gonna hurt (yeah)
Because the flesh is meaningless it remains amongst the dirt
But the soul is uplifted
10-31-67 I'm God gifted
MC's are changing it grows like a fungus
Beware of the evil that walks among us, behold
a fallen angel, hark, the rebel
The mark of 6-6-6, the Devil
You better beware cause he's comin behind you
No it doesn't take long for him to find you
It's a sneak attack black, he's gonna smack you
In the form of a rock that's inside of a capsule
Or maybe in the form of a man
that says to trust me and then begins to shake your hand
But when you examined your hand you learned
you're alarmed that your palm was disfigured and burned
No no no no, it's not surprising
Open your book, look to the horizon
Start scoping, open your eyes and strive to
study the holy Qu'ran or read the holy Bible
I'm making a getaway, plan it's gonna be a better way
There's gotta be a better day

Hmmmmmmm... and now I ask, Lord have mercy upon me
and grant me sight, for what I can't see
For you are the shephard and I shall not want
to front, yes to be blunt, I won't flunk
For I am blessed with the gift of knowledge (yeah)
without college, but now let's shift
into the specific dimension that we call Earth
Where God gave us the gift of birth
Last but not least Ephessians 6 tells you to teach the child
Revelation tells about two day swarms, the guns and diseases
Homicides over epidemics and crack vials
Got guns going BUCK BUCK BUCK BUCK
And when you look up you see a kid got struck
But mentally the blood pours out of the mother's heart
Cause it hurts to lose to Lucifer's part (mmm, yeah)
Yes, for I have seen the light
That shines bright even in the dark of the night
And I (I) thank (thank) thee (thee)
For constantly watching over me
There are about, four hundred and fifty-thousand homeless without housing
Brothers sharing cells and sharing beds
They can't seek a job with this hair that's dread
Sit back and face reality with these lyrics
I hope they can uplift your spirits
(we're living in the last days, we're living in the last days)
Cause God made water and trees food man woman
land fire grass animals clouds and sunrays to shine
on the parents of those twenty-six kids that died last year (last year)

I'm not the type that you can walk up and EFF with
Don't sleep, just peep the whole damn connnnn-cept
I'M OUT TO WRECK!!  Sucker MC's steppin to me with garbage
I'm Goldilocks and I'm, taxin your porridge (yeah!)
Ooooooh, cold but yummy
I slept in your bed, and your girl sucks funny
I'm out to bash, beats and, drop snares
Crush tables and smash up chairs, YEAH
So consider me on a rampage
I spread out and hit ya like a sawed off twelve gauge
So back up, don't play me close
Most boast to be the best, but you can't, and will never
ever in your life, come close to a mic, assassinator
I'm playin you out like Beta
I'm, watchin you, front
Flaunt your puss-head lookin just like bark
This is just a verbal whippin
for all you who don't fall, but you keep slippin
Shootin the gift for the GUH-GUH-GAB
I'm gonna dunk on your neck just like Kareem
Ab-dul, yo and ain't cool
So don't let me act like a fool
Cause I'm takin off from the tip-top of the key
with the rock passed by the Pharoahe M-O-N, see-H
the chosen lyrical soldier who backs me up
when punks verbally and, physically try to get over
with no skills, no comp..petition
havin you reminiscin about a brother
who don't give a DAMN about dissin
Black and white, clever like a superstition
Cause concepts flow, with the use of a
pen, a sheet, and when braincells meet
Brain-bustin MC's try to get hype but
smell like doo-doo cause they can't even wipe butt
Stuck-up and quite conceited
Your one hit song, all year long, at shows
everybody knows it cause you're gonna repeat, like reruns
Put your iron away, cause I got three guns
Now that we've got things up and out in the open
and clear yo, grab a chair
Cause I swing with a style that's rather ill
The illiterate can't consider it legitimate so I
kick simplistic rhymes for the plain
For the peanuts, I commence to go insane
Shredder of a competitor, makin it better for
rap listeners, cause I'm headed for
the top of the hill where Jack can't chill
Just me and Jill cause Jack has no skills
Now tell me why everybody wants to be a Prince
No skills, no sense, NONSENSE
I'm steppin up front, and to be quite,
blunt a radical creator of a poetical hypnotical mathematical
slang slurs punch, that stuns and amazes
PRINCE POETRY SHOOTS POWERFUL PHRASES
Interrupting your braincells, dilutin your thoughts
Causin side effects fully disintegratin body parts
Cause I stalk when I pray upon in the form of the flesh
Now weaken when Prince Poetry commence speakin
Side by side I rock with the Pharoahe
Watch you decomposin MC's, and look there's only a shadow
Too late, cause I'm gone, I explode
and I drop a hip-hop again, atomic, atom bomb
Releasin lyrics that you better not be usin
Organizin beats that you find Konfusin

Yeah.. here we go..
Aiyyo umm Prince (yo!) Brothers try to swing on me
nut I don't think they can hit it (nah)
These (these) styles, MC'S they, JUST CAN'T GET IT (why?)
The way I are-ti-see you-late my flows (my flows!)
Sometimes I think I know some shit
some MC's just don't know; THE
quicker I'm kickin the style
slippin and stickin the words hit quicker
better figure the verbs are thick in you
while the poetical fanatical rap acrobatical style
static never had any so I'm packin a black
automatic pistol itchy by the C.I.A.
By the way, my display of rhymes that I will lay
down on wax, distributed from a zodiac
Digitally, with a funky appeal
From the reel to reel, it doesn't matter
I still got the skill to get ill
Straight literature when you try to hit em with your
WACK STYLE, the critics are sore to crack smiles
So back up black cause you lack the skills
when I ask your girl, tax your girl
She said she wanted it from the back so I WAXED your girl
So why would you try to swing, on a nigga
with a itchy trigger finger better bring a bigger auto
hit, swing a nigga if you want to get rid of me (damn)
Your first mistake, was to consider me
a new jack black when I ahhhh-lready knew that
So get back, step back, move back, out of my way
when I roll offbeat (offbeat) again
Again and again and again and again and again
Blending the style, mending it like this
so that you can check it out when I flow awkwardly
Awkwardly I flow, yo, let's go
Most don't recollect me as T-are-O, why
cause I'ma get fly, with a microphone
dope with a microphone, you can't cope with a microphone
cause I'ma be illin, buckin off into your grill and
fillin your face with knuckles and watchin the blood spill in
down the sewer, always knew I could do a brother
with a crew of, good MC's
Or maybe even a few are stale MC's
I scatter data that'll catapault a metaphor
The epitcle epilogue editor
Trendsetter, letters are formin together
in the jaw side of my mouth, I'm alphabetic
Call me a librarian, rhymes are scary when
I mix verbs and phrases and put the vocabulary in places
where, only the M-O-N-see-H can do it
So don't ever despise
Red is the color when you look in to my Organized/eyes
you'll see Konfusion

I stand here before the forces of evil with a style
The poetically God-gifted child
Bringin forth the story of a lyrical soldier
Blessed to manifest in the eyes of the beholder
Words of wisdom never abuse the lines
they increase, as I release a phrase like a uzi 9
from the larynx
Shot in repitition, words never heard before
but still the rendition of rap will enable me to attack
from dawn to dusk, for liberation
Driven I will never give in to interrogation
The rank, given to me, the Pharoahe
Cause every bro flows like a crossbow
Equipped to pierce your soul with a poison-tip arrow
Any man wearing a blindfold can be misled
but wise are the ones with the eyes in the backs of the head
Here's the key to unlock the door:
Imagine a poet without poetical form
Rhymes are for sure as an attack
cause they adapt to combat for the prisoners of war

[Prince Poetry]
I drop smash and causin damage equivalent
to a hy-drogen bomb, raidin villages like
a poetical soldier in Vietnam, Poetry
releasin deadly gasses, bodies deteriorating
as they stalk past the fatal acid
As a rebel of rap, I stop, load the Luger
as I maneuver with the caution as I verbally counterattack
Striking like a mad sniper cause I'm the type of
hyperactive viper to wipe away the enemy with no remedy
cause I'm the epitome so don't try to get rid of me
You little itty-bitty twenty-five automatic, you're killin me
cause I'm a glock 9 that will rock your mind
Distortin it, shorten your brainwaves
as the rhyme intertwine with the sign of the times
Don't sleep cause I creep attackin from the side
that is blind, therefore I gotta be hard to the core
And I walk, as a prisoner of war

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wake up to the mathematics of an erratic rap
Rejuvenator of rhyme, that sort of come automatic
Poetical medical medicine for the cerebellum
I divert em and flirt em insert em then I repel em
a breakdown, poetical shakedown
Fifty-two pick-up a stick-up so get on the floor facedown
The ammo to keep the people steppin
breakin open the vault because I'm like a verbal assault weapon
I'm mathematical, acrobatical
Attack the wack take rap to the maximum
You're strung out you're hung out when you heard the style
that I brung out of faint air must come out my mouth
where I stick my tongue out in the at-mos-phere
Take a good look at what's happening here
On the microphone, I'm RAPPIN
Pickin-em-stickin-em up, breakin-em-shakin-em up, and bashin
the lyric dictator, the aviator of antonym
All beware to prepare for the guillotine
Rhymes go express, expert, extreme
Be up to par with wisdom and intellect
Detatching one's head directly from one's neck
Still I've been illing and drilling your brain
like a villain I came in the darkness to spark the literature for sure
when I rhyme for the prisoners of war

[Prince Poetry]
There is strength in my men-tal-bolism, brains to spare
upon info, knowledge, data, greater aspects
affects my future environment
So in the event I drop science to suit ya, uproot ya
Hunt ya down
Verbally attackin from the ground up to intellectually shoot ya
Lurkin through the shadows of darkness, shots fired
the spark hits the trees, releasin lyrical ammo
while I camoflouge in the flash of my stature
Mentally cease MC's, that be surrounded I capture
And enemy lines are crushed, bumrushed
And plus your government officials are corrupted
cause they're down with us; poetical rebels on a rampage
of wrecked dialects, blown lyric projects
Heat is scopin you through my infrared twenty-twenty
scope lens, steppin upon base that's when the
Organized Konfusion massacre begins with a blast
Never will an intruder approach cause they will never ever last
cause the task is total termination

Running upon the jagged edge, FUCK, THE ROUGH LIFE
when you have to gain much respect
As an individual keepin negativity minimum
requires havin courage respect him his intellect
so you gotta be on THAT specific type of SET
Like Roosevelt, especially when your cards are dealt
You see me, frankly, I don't give a hoot
about the blanks you shoot out of your mental bank see
I like Roosevelt, cause he ain't booty
Moody maybe, baby you're mad cause he smashed up your cutie
Playin the courts, takin the loss, to wherever
some clever college edu-ma-cated individual
With financial status JUST to mess what the BANK stated
Girls love it, and you can't look above it you hate it
Peeped his method, you laid, you waited
You never ever contemplated if I pull a automatic
will I leave the artillery out or just flight
Check in the night, you're out to snipe, my man
you can't stand upon sight of him
Out to fatally ignite him
Roosevelt felt staticky, he knew things were shady
Grady had, Bradley's uzi, but he always packed a clip or two
belongin to a nickel-plated .380
Givin off the impression of a clever nerd
Never was a suspect when a homicide occurred, in the suburbs
He was referred, to as a respectable intellectual
Highly acceptable rebel from the ghetto on the level
of an intelligent rapper, create him just like Giupetto
The aggresive type, and he's not your puppet
Stickin quickin enough to pull a skeezer with repetition
after takin aim and buckin and blowin the smoke away
then tuckin and jettin home, hopin that no stunts are stuck in it
He needs sleep, for eight o'clock class
so as fast as he crash, he might last
for six hours of bed passed, cause Roosevelt's a scholar
Ivy league material, cully-head kid with BRAINPOWER
Six foot two, and we wear the same size shoe
He drinks brew, and he runs with my crew, my herd
on a continuous basis, in the same, places
Rollin out five deep, but it's only four faces
So I don't, give a two, drip-drops about, what those have felt
And if I die (and if he die) and if I die (and if he DIEEEEEEEE)
And if I die it's because of my man Roosevelt

	Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt Franklin
	Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt Franklin, Roosevelt Franklin
	Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt Franklin
	Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt Franklin, Roosevelt Franklin

Ooooooooooooh I'm so confuuuuuuuuused.. DAMN, IT HURTS!
People persist to treat me like dirt
I don't sleep at night, time cause dimes I DON'T DROP
I sling and clockers cease
Commanders in Chiefs when I pop rocks
Dig deep within, you might recognize me
I'm the one with the bloodshot eyes
Hot rays of sun, beat down upon my face as if I'll melt bacon
Why the hell my mother named me Roosevelt Franklin?
I .. don't .. know, so I strive to gain
only the Lord knows my eyes have seen the pain
Tears comin down my cheeks like rain
I was abused, they stripped the mind for amusement
Now I walk the path of ORGANIZED KONFUSION
But it's only a temporary formality
Cause my man Scott turns illusion into reality
A loaf of bread (a loaf of bread), a stick of butter
Somebody's mother lies, dead in the gutter
So I move QUICK FAST, to get past quickly
Swiftly, at last, cops can't get WITH ME
Can't hit me, nah never I'm TOO NIFTY, people SHITTIN ME
Products in the projects so I pump FIFTIES
in soda cans so dogs won't SNIFF ME
I'm takin the proper precautions (yeah)
Cause once my mother told me she was gonna get an abortion
I can't keep track.. of the fluctuation.. of time
Hallucinogenics keep, abusin my mind
Gotta pick up, gotta pick up, gotta pick up, gotta pick up
more product, gotta move, gotta go I can't get stuck; not here
Not if I want to become Roosevelt Franklin the employee of the year
I wear baseball caps over my eyes so you can't make out
me at night when I'm standin on the corner eatin Chinese takeout
.. damn I almost forgot, yo yo I have to break out

	Yo don't forget your moms told you to get that stuff
A loaf of bread, a stick of butter, container of milk

Organized Konfusion,"South Side's a town with a lot of hustle and bustle
A kid got stuck for a buck under the trussle
Died with pride, he thought he had a big heart muscle
He fought back, but the attack was brutal

Futile to his survival and the event that his crew will
Seek revenge on the assailants who rushed him
They crushed him, snuffed the life all out of his body
He had friends, a Benz with rims by Gotti

Guys wanted to beat him, girls wanted to greet him
Kids wanted to be him when they saw him in the Coliseum
Lots of cash hoppin' fast on the avenue
Pump up your system loud and he'll laugh at you

And a Glock 9 when he stops at the light
Pumpin' rides into the top in

Playing the game of survival going uptown to pick up
Supportin' the taste with leathers and bamboos and black Timbs
Benz parked at the curb while puffin' herb

Cruisin', one-six, oh, with the lean
Sportin' BV's on the Beamer with the Italian wintergreen interior
While the Alpine pump, you get open
Hoppin', hopin' to catch them all open, girls scopin' as you unlock

Now you gotta go, gotta go
Hoppin' down Merit to get back to the four, oh

And personally there's no particular name that's written
On the side of a slug, damn, it's bugged
When pretty women begin to bend over a drug

She used to be the type of girl that was flashy
Now the scars from the concrete make her knees look ashy

Cops constantly stay on high speed chases
Trying to remember faces from previous arrest cases
Bulletproof vest is the hottest items to invest in
Shots fired, one was hit with the hollow-tip and it caved his chest in

Kids are gathered around him coffin' quiet
Softly they're standin' 'cause there's baby left as an orphan

So instead you drive a sterling, lime green

Gettin' ready to hop under the summer weather
Armor all glistenin' in the sun, it's four cars

Hoppin' to the beach with a jeep
Full of Chinese cut broads passin' by perpetrators

Rain support roots that implants the tree
There's a breeze - in the park, kites fly high
Under the branches, con-vertibles fly by

I bypass Howard, and detour Benson
Cause I don't really feel like fencing today
So I chill in my own dimension and listen to the sax blow..

But at the same time, it attacks you
In this particular era of darkness
Bust a rhyme that might enlighten the mind and spark this
trail to follow the light that's guiding you from
the evil that you walk into the sun
From what I see it's an addiction
I'll explain to the brain about pain affliction
Grab my hand, hold it tightly
Close your eyes and maybe you might see what I see

My hayfever is actin up, so I took a couple of antihistamines
WHEW!  I got struck with relief
Now patiently, I wait for the summer
Cause the spring brings pollen and that can be a bummer
A terrific brother was havin a specific get-together by the beach
Rolling Rock's, plus Peach Schnapps, served on the rocks
The Organisms play the boardwalk, pullin numbers from Pros' Peak
The scenario, where we go pumpin the Alpine stereo
Hop along the turnpike on our way to the merry-go-
-round up the herbs at six flags; we're on a mission
Hittin the streets of New York in zig-zags
Walkin to the park, hark, the herald, named Erald
who creates with charts
Central Park swarms with intellectual dialects
With the potential, of the city's best emergency medical techs
So I dip dip dive
Listen to the musicians in the park play live
The Funky Drummer was drummin even though he was a bum
Some couldn't comprehend, the vibe that blended
With the sum, there were some, who wasn't dumb

Days way back, in the seventies (seventies)
The only AIDS you used to know was cool-AIDS
Corn-bread, corn-rows, and corn-br-AIDS
Pull up a chair, read a book like Dr. Seuss
Peel off the skin, eat all the meat
Nibble on the bone, and then suck the goo
Man if my mother was the Colonel, her chicken woulda sold
It even taste better THE NEXT DAY COLD
Chick-chicken.. chick-chick-chick-chicken
When I collect my thoughts I recollect
I used to listen to my moms (to my mommy)
""Damn it!"" everyday,
""Boy you better clean up your room before you go outside and play""

Yo Monch you can remember when we used to play skelly way back
Blastin wax, side or tops, Prince don't play that
Uh-oh, it's six o'clock, I'm late for dinner
If my girl wasn't his girl, I was definitely in her
Got in them print skirts (yo you was feenin for a chicken fix)
Ran in the kitchen and put my finger in the cornbread mix
..
Mom yells dinner's ready, cause she's the boss
All I needed was my ketchup, and my hot sauce
and my, cornbread, now I'm, ready to dig in
Pick the meat off the bone, and then I ate the skin

Only to laugh again when my moms made fried..

chicken barbecues in the summer was the move
Whoo!  Hah hah, hah hah hah, Grand Groove
was the jam Grandmaster Vic played in the park
past the dark, I seen the spark, so did me, Troy and Mark
Went to the rib shack, ordered chicken and the collard
greens but there's no money left in my wallet
But I kept fifty cents for my juice (word?)
Now we would go to Troy's house and get loose (uhh)

[Pharoahe Monch]
I'm.. just.. looking out of the window (window)
Watching the asphault grow (grow) slow (slow)
My best friend, was a G.I. Joe
although he had bald spots in his afro
Play with the kids your own age, that's what they used to tell us
I got jealous, when we couldn't run with the big fellas
Bullies on the block used to beat us
I was quick as a cat, in fact, I was a cheetah
Es-pecially when we played, follow the leader
Little Suzy May Robinson used to play
show and tell with my peter

[Prince Poetry]
I used to rock my British Walkers to church
After the choir sang the preacher started to preach
so I had to search
for a pen and some paper to keep myself occupied
But the aroma from the kitchen came and sat by my side
and said, ""MmmmmMMM! You know I smell good""
I said to myself, ""Please oh please reverend now would
you speed up the sermon so I can determine
whether I'ma have peas or collars greens
with my chicken that I'm yearnin""
Turnin to the usher in the back, whispering,
""Please keep the chicken monster from coming through
the crack of the door!""  Later at the table
moms poppped my hand until it was sore
Cause I ate the chicken, before
the preacher said grace, but I'm ready to go for self
But there's not one piece of chicken on the table left
(What happened to that wing man?)
(Where that chicken go?)
Chick-chick-chick-chicken
(Where that chicken go?)
Chick-chick-chick-chicken
Chick-chick-chick-chicken
Chick-chick-chick-chicken

[Richard Pryor]
You know that chicken I put in the refrigerator last night?
Well I expect to find it when I get home, or else!
But I'll tell you, what my mother would say..
""Somebody stole my piece of chicken!""

	""I didn't take your chicken Pop""

[Prince Poetry]
Just wait til I get home, cause ain't no chicken left

But sometimes you gotta slow down the flow
Blow up the spot and let the whole world know

So I bring the Jamaica funk (Uh!) That's what it is

I used to watch my grandmother catch the Holy Ghost in church
For her soul she would search
Five years later now I'm off to work
In a department store, I'm foldin pants and shirts
At the end of the week, lord
Just enough loot to put some cheap sneakers on my feet
That's when I made a promise to my momma I said
""I betcha you see me at the Apollo one day and I'ma
Be kickin' that fat funk shit

Still have one hundred miles to go, escape from the
Crack vials, so, you can feed that baby
I used to ride the elevator with the crazy lady
A year later I made demo cassettes with the Monch
My stick was on the fader, rhymes ran out quick so I
Encouraged Monch to start writing rhymes
And Mrs. J cooked dinner then we came into same hard times
Sour contract shouldn't have been on the plate
Two apes escaped, back to L.A. with our demo tape
The state of mind I was in since Paul C died is that
I gotta get mines, representin 40 projects so I'm
All-in, gotta make papes and all that
Close my own record deal cause I can't fall for that
Old snake shit, hissin' in the grass
For the cash, little cents, intuition listen

Condensed into a bullet, pull it, now I'm making moves

The hall walker, who stalks bodies in Central Park
Soon emergency services'll outline that body in chalk
Then I begin to walk away and spit
Then when I walk away I talk shit!
Huh, a driver sprayed my face with mace
She didn't know that I enjoyed the taste of radioactive waste
When I'm in the backseat of your mid-town taxi
Don't even ask me for the cash G
The four cabs before didn't pick me up
Now ask yourself who the fuck's gonna stick me up

Styles I file are not decaffeinated, I'm rough
Tougher than Tonka, why I even electrify the sky

Not to sell units, you know
They say motherfucker, bitch-ass and glock

She got a kick outta my jeep and a meal at Burger King
I shot her ego down with my maturity
Getting papers from Port Authority doing security, uh
She just used to climb up in my whipper whip
Just to stress a nigga quick, young chick on a ego trip
Whip ping ha ha I had to stop the pigeon
Step, find a dove who comprehends exactly how I'm living
So I met a girl around the way from the Uptown set
We used to drown in sweat, uh
She was my darling til I lost my 9 to 5
She started dissing listen pretending then shitting on my pride
She tried to crush my pride so cut off so to the next
Uh, not for the sex, this one used to run through the projects
Gossiping with the next about the next
Loved to cover her neck, for stress gave her a cat as a pet
Itchbay didn't know which way she wanted to flow
Flowing with this nosey hoochie when I was out doing my shows
Doing a dem bow, dem bow, dem bow, dem bow
You can't front, you used to bust all over Prince Po
And fall fast asleep into the morn

They warn you, they let you know, about your friends around you
People around your circumstances
One must have belief in order to believe
One must see in order to know
These little things I tell you is what's kept me here
Is what's made it, possible, for me to tell you this story

Chuck Cheese! Everybody neighborhood's fuck-up
A wild shorty, touched, heads got stuck up
Under the trestle wrestle with your chains 'til your neck muscle
Veins pop out, GIMME, paper cut your bled vessels
So what you real?  He'll test, no question
Always on the ave in plex mode, impressin'
Baby girl with jewels and his pretty boy complexion
He was makin' them lose their minds, packin' two-two's
Ready for testin' plus prime time
Stickin' your A-T-M, expert, vickin' your two-week's work
Jerk settle for lickin' ya if any funny moves is made
Known through the PJ's for puttin' bodies in graves
All over the tri-state, now why wait, when crime pays
That's what he started sayin' from way back in the days
He had plans, to stick up the bully, and his mans
But got caught up with the heat
When Jake rolled up in two fifty passenger vans

(Aiyyo! Aiyyo! Get up off me man.
 Get up off me. I didn't do nuttin man!
 Yo, yo, whassup yo? What's the problem?
 What's the problem?)

Thugs bustin' slugs, shorty's down for his respect

Anyway after puttin in three or three-to-five
You thought Chuck would be happy just to be alive
Now thoughts of cash connections
Occupied his mind first, a nigga didn't waste time gettin' work
When he seen the scheme gettin' less green
Chuck Cheese got grimy, him and about fourteen
Was countin' paper on the line at Green Acres
And behind them was the shiny link, it's victim, a move-faker
And so they caught him on the way to the car
In the parkin' lot a shot was heard from afar (whassup now sup now?)
Money's grazed, shameless, without all of the frontin'
Chuck, you know the one with the new link he's now manhuntin'
For more, who get ten G's a wop, on the low
From two hot shot spots in Hollis bold G's that stole
Pushin' weight, through the Metro, he's contracted
Twenty's a hit on his head, jealousy didn't like the way that he acted
Now Chuck heard the news and got attracted
Ready to bring racket to the wrong full metal jacket
Bold, he got some love on the street, he knows about it
Now a tactic or patient retaliation is routed
He gets outted!

(Yo f'real, this little skillet-head nigga.
Runnin' around disrespectin', you know how we get down on South side.
Word to strength, he gots to go. I don't care how it happens!)

Yo, the word got back, to my highest of rank
This cat's burnin' my ears son, his suicidal tendencies
Got me askin' about him, the word on the street is
Y'all ALL want to out him, all present and accounted
There ain't no way around this dilemma, he's stoppin' cheddar
Seen the better part of life so yo he keeps a Beretta
But all we gotta do is, follow plan A through
To the letter, y'all choose the in and outs on you

And just two days later Gator and Chuck was creepin' up Sufton
Out of the dark called yo Chuck they advanced and started buckin'
(What the fuck?) He screamed with no time for duckin', six struck
Rules even apply in these mean streets nigga with no discussion

Yo grip, you got your eyes fixed on me like as if a bitch
caught me in a glitch reachin at cases no beef just fish
Straight pitch, what the fuck is the problem?  You and your man

Yo move back, y'all rap niggaz take this shit too far
I'm like an ox, brother my box-cutter leavin a scar
All my peoples are connected
That shit y'all spit on records is infected and dead
You'll get injected with lead
Ain't no need for me to sweat no man, my crew makes stacks
You just be black and ass nigga plus your records is whack
You'll get fucked up (I'll get fucked up?  Nah I don't think so money..)

Violatin my 360, his niggaz started revolvin
That problem needed quick solvin so we started to brawlin

Callin for nobody, determined just to keep these niggaz fallin

Him and his man transform into these six rowdy-ass kids

I never went since Prince struck first, bitches dispersed towards the corner
Too many enemies for me to overpower
I want to at, least take one nigga down with me
If I have to go out, I'm goin scrappin no doubt
First nigga up to bat gets bent (bent) pinned (pinned)
Immediately, up against the wall (ha) him (him)
Wig pushed back, thumb to windpipe
Reacts numb his whole face contorts when eyeballs contract

When shit comes down to it, no hesitation
Actions speaks louder than words in all situations
Do what we gotta do, set it off, let it loose
Fuck it, we ready for confrontation

(Do what we gotta do, set it off, let it loose)

I can't believe these whack rap niggaz is swingin on me
The dark-skinnned kid caught me in the eye now I'ma bring it to G
I square him up while Chuck tries to trip him, fuck he's too fast
Over the top, duck, champagne and the glass struck
Now Moet's all over the floor and I'm slidin through it
Pharoahe I got your back, splittin him, exposin bodily fluid
From fraudulent foes, with points to prove, and no holds barred
Raw dog like out in the yard

I'm peepin out how their security maneuvered and selected
in multiples of 3 random niggaz end the beef to be ejected
Collected my thoughts, connected with members of medicine men
Who explained to me that DT's got the block locked seized
They wouldn't let us in
Sighed, slide to the midstream, plus swallow your pride
(This is the second time swine, one-time, had to spoil it)
Pull the lids on the commode and drop the glocks inside the toilet
If we, move swiftly, we just might make it
If the opportunity arise to bounce, let's take it

Recognize me nigga, look into my eyes
See raw visualizations of hate reincarnated
In it's most unadulturated form I breeth evil incarnate
Only for the purpose to mislead, what was once promising seeds 
Are now destroyed and misplaced with mischievous weeds for greed
The purpose, inseminate the bitches
Eliminate top rappers, throw their remains insides of ditches
Nigga political snitches, Abe me which is
The very reason I'm able to strike so vicious
Yea
Take these keys, that for years were not found
Allowing all Simeons to be freed that's locked down
It returns way back to the block
Only to cop more Smack, Rock from cops that act
not in a manner for you to prosper
You are Ab-so-lete unless
You can handle the ball during a full-court press
When the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope
Kneel to your master nigga, invoke the strongest emotion
known to mankind HATE!
Awww, you are sadly mistaken if you think my Aryan race
can be taken out by the likes of you Apes, Kikes
conservative nigga loving Gooks, Spooks, and Dykes
My Spikes, bald headed white laces
Braces the fact that I'm prepared for vicious acts of war
WHITE POWER!

A fucking taxpayer who salutes to a Confederate flag
My chain and thoughts is on the rag
Aryan ways learned from my grand-dad
I'm on my toes around these monkeys and spics
I thank God that I'm white, pure and don't mix
We need to snatch up these niggas and fags, reissue slave tags
Regain job positions, remain in control of opposition
Placed here to be the scum of the earth, serving us hand and foot
I'll rape 'em and slave 'and trade 'em from birth
Never to overlook the main crook who disperse shook
Versions of the bible, Sabotaging shit since Christophers arrival
Hate!
Making them Indian pay for survival
Now life for Ricans and Coons is homicidal
We Neo-Nazis seek nothing but world domination
God's plan is for us to seek and destroy man's false creation
It's exerted in the good book of Revelations
Set up to destroy spades and Jews from hidden stations
So my offspring's can end all this confusion for good
No more smooching off of welfare for jiggaboos in the so-called hood
Sickle cells decreasing your death rate, you black bitch
But I like the way you suck my wood
Germ grenades now in the form of A.I.D.S. were made to wipe you out
But now them queers got that shit semi-reversed running about
I'm off to college with a knapsack of sacrilegious artifacts

Now she smoke crack, sit back, and listen to talk shows
I hope she don`t eat pork fried rice tonight

See, the cholesterol already got my arteries tight
I might select even before she injects her lethal chemicals
To wrap the umbilical cords around my neck
Shit, I`m pissin` in the abdomen

Two and a half weeks old, already thoughts of stabbin` men
Unravelin` plots and plans for thievin` and shit
Immune to the gospel, not believin` in shit
Where the fuck do I go from here?

'Cause when the afterbirth disperse it`s hard to persevere
I swear I can`t fuck with it
She hits about two packs of cigarettes a day and I`m stuck with it

Fear it but very coherent that there`s a fifty percent chance that I might
Not make it in spite of the fact, it`s my life
And can`t take it, knowin` that I`m losin` this fight to contradiction

Umbilically inflicted, watchin` my life go down like Christion
Understand mommy dearest is confused right now
But my faith brings us through someway, somehow

The coke`s tokes and tell-lie-vision violence already got me scarred
Disregard what the devil allowed on my set

Bet I could probably run for mayor on some shit like that one day
Or get my hustle on, just like my dad, quiet as kept for the long stay
Flow as a positive form to first step
I want some friends and a ill-ass fuckin` neighbourhood rep

600 Benz gooseneck with a Nakamichi system in it
Graduated from a rookie, rolled-up windows tinted
Desire presented for ice cream, Big Wheels, local rented movies
From Power Rangers, Lion King, Toy Story and Goonies

But the bomb, at least that`s what I heard
Beyond my 9 to 5`s I write a dope rap song
But with your insides gone the vision is frail
Dreams can`t set sail

From all that unprotected sex and cold Ballantyne ales
Oh well, I still prevail, God always has something in store for me outside this hell, move on 
Torn in the eyes of Allah, scorned when the dawn distortion upon
My abortion clinic visit in the morn

Yo, I got a question - in hip-hop, who they followin? (Right)
The niggaz with skills or them niggaz who be hollerin?

[Pharoahe Monch]
Them niggaz that be hollerin be substitute, modelin
The niggaz with the skills forever keeps a followin

[both]  Swallowin pride
[Poet]  Never we be imperialistic
[both]  Who rips shit, without bein materialistic
[Poet]  Statistics show
[Monch] Ask Duke, he knows
[Duke]  Cause them niggaz got dough don't mean they got that flow
[Poet]  Hahhhh
[both]  Cause them niggaz got dough don't mean they got that flow

[Pharoahe Monch]
Pleeease man
I done burned some of the most fattest MC's like chromium percolinate
It's not even tangible for them to understand the holy weight
It takes soul to make a crowd animated
Prince stated, hey wait 'til we get off that label
and I waited twelve months (twelve months) for the perfect opportunity
To thump (thump) bump (bump) somethin loved by my community (c'mon)
I'm movin on all you punk Bambino bastards
Your style's depleted like muscles without amino acids
I blast kids with mass times matter
Forever clingin to endeavors defined, clever words
thus waiting never, frustrating verbs to rip
My rap ratings erradicate (erradicate shit)
For me to take rhythms and mate 'em with rhymes in mating season
Creating shit never before made it
I'm makin hybrids, created potent enough to open eyelids
and leave pupils dilated, stress is alleviated
Now it's easier, plus economically feasible
for me to leave rap listeners queasy and inebriated
We made it we came, dedicated we rated supreme
Even with or without the cream

[Poetry] Yo, yo Pharoahe
[Monch]  Yes sit
[Poetry] Brother why don't you explain
How did hip-hop get caught up in this ill rap game?

[Pharoahe Monch]
Nahhh I got a question - in hip-hop, who they followin? (Uhh)
The niggaz with skills or them niggaz who be hollerin?

[Prince Poetry]
The niggaz that be hollerin is substitute, modelin
Niggaz with skills always and forever keeps a followin

[both]  Swallowin pride
[Monch] Never we be imperialistic
[both]  Who rips shit, without bein materialistic
[Monch] Statistics show
[Poet]  Ask miss she know
[Apani] Just cause them niggaz got dough don't mean they got that flow
[both]  That's right

You know deep inside I want to sex you like no other 

Chasin you down Jamaica Ave 

A ghetto dope Cleopatra, nigga shorty was bad 

First she was iggin me son, sliding up in strawberries 

Suckin down a sugar cone with nuts, sprinkles and cherries 

Excuse me miss, but-uhh pecan 

Can I get a lick? 

I be the Prince Po, the rebirth of slick 

So its cool like that 

Me and you can make it all that, four flat 

Into this elevator exotic world with the tall black 

Ghetto dope Don Juan ready to see reflections in Amazon rivers with ya blue 

watters 

Matchin straw hat, see the picture 

Love it but it ain't perfect 

We can exchange this data and later respectfully work it

Hard to explain it , I'm getting tongue tied like 

I hate when I wheez, stublin over the words 

mumblin, fumblin over my opening line 

Jumblin rhymes together, you know my palms get all sweaty 

And I uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh! 

Misses, I can't explain how much I want to be up in it 

And I know you ain't had no dick in a minute 

Oh, you smoke beedies, see you go 

Couldn't you see me and you stressed out in bikini's on the beach in Tahiti? 

See me I'm very selective even though I could be greedy 

My main objective is to write our names together in graffiti 

And are be (?) so y'all can see me, speedy 

(naw see) 

You can be my centipede like we-be-fore-play 

Cause I gourmet my food up like eatie and Maxwell 

Similar to that smooth kid's see-D

Chorus 



Pharoahe Monch: 



This one little chick she pissed me off 

Comin out the store, now I'm holdin the door 

To the Bodega, she got a little man with her 

Figuring if I kicks it to the kid then I could get her right 

Say listen 

I see you around every night around seven o'clock 

You walkin up the block (?) with the rocks on the side of the crib 

With your kid on ya hip and ya close top notch, 

You know the thirst baby 

First we can deal with the math if you search through your purse for a pen 

We can blast off 

Like Hubble Space Craft material 

I'm aware of you and your concern about vanirial diseases 

If it pleases you, shit, Jesus 

I pack profolactics that stretch to my knees 

She squinted, with a demented look behind a tented glass of a girlfriend 

Rented, Benz E-Class vented hate 

But still hinted like I was self centered 

She said speak to the hand 

y'all know that shit that girls invented 

Aww, see it didn't have to be be like that wit you fiberglass 

Backboard ass that's mad flat bitch 



Shugah Shorty why you backin up, got a nigga out here iggy actin up 



Hurricane G: 



Who that big flat piece of chocolate 

Sparkin it, rockin it, ""uhh, uhh-uhh,"" rockin it 



Prince Poetry: 



My name is Prince, boo 

Now few who speak don't be true 

But you, you got this lovely but rugged stiggy 

How you do? 

Get out the car, lemmie see you 

Now what's your name? 



Hurricane G: ""Star"" 



Prince Poetry: 



Body was bizarre, yo Star, where you live? 



Hurricane G: 



Far 

Rockaway Beach out in the boons 

My niggas put five on it and stack all I like the Loons 

Packin twos 

So Pappi what you say? 



Prince Poetry: 



When I'm grown I don't hump, I bone 

I ain't playin 

I'm a man who likes a treat 

Message feet of the independent Queen 

To throw up some heat 

Shit girl I can fix you something to eat 

Prepare a five course meal while I'm makin the beat 

Already got two things in this beautiful universal common 

That's lovin a tight ass fuck, and some tight ass rymin 

So what 

We into somethin or your frontin, pilgrum 

I ain't askin a protif be for make children 

I'm skilled in body messages and sexual healin 

I'm gentle, but I'm runnin wild just to make a million 

We buildin baby 

So here's enough for you to handle 

That'll light you up and blow you out like candles

Hey, hey, hey
Ease back, who is that, Getting up in your ass crack
Ooh Shit
Say now, who you listen to
Park your ass like municipal, invisible lyrics
Not difficult to understand man
Spiritual, hit what you go, back-a-van
Lyricals aren't impossible
All opticals are not inside the plan
Let me see your hand
And if it does not have triple six's in the palm
Do not be alarmed, I am the Sandman
My oracle waveband expand from the wasteland

You can not oppose me
God has choose me to battle against evil and win
You can not oppose me
God has choose me to do battle against all who sin
And even when I'm gone
My energy returns to it's original form
Thus must warn

(All humans who do not meet the required specifications
For salvation will perish)

I piss into the face of the crowd
Lyrically I squash shit
Toss mic stands and fans
Before leaping into the mosh pit
Harshness isn't it? Ha, ha, ha, ha
Exquisite with the style that I be using
Choose to compete, you will lose
Poetical implants placed in my ears
Make me cause a catastrophe to the
Kick, drum, I'm the sinister of 
Snail Peak Creek 
Never sleep, be aware
Who will escape unscaved 
From a bombardment of scattered fragments
Released from hidden compartments
My Termi-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-nology 
Is equivalent to Trig-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-nometry
I leave no optical footprint
Within sight of the stands of time
So it's impossible to follow me
You swallow leave and digest
No nutritional value
Never learn how to bow to the ones
Who allow you to wallow in the mist
Peacefully co-exist
With the men of medicine, 
The lyrical antagonistic

You can not oppose me
God has choose me to battle against evil and win
You can not oppose me
God has choose me to do battle against all who sin

[Prince Poetry]
Check it
Intelligent wordz, iz colaz
Inside of this rap visual, liquid dye
Focus, clistion unlike baptism
I bless souls through the worldz second religion
From the left With angles to enlarge the prizm
Prince Po, I, out of the south-side slums
Claimin spots around all these hypo-critical tongues
Repeatin tha same topic, misleadin the sea topic
Wit 2 yearz outta da picture
I still rock it and rock well
A level that my stiggy gets you gel (what)
I strickly international ghetoo, clientel
Freaky like James Bond, wit infra-red views inject propellin
Was a 7, my steps, and wit da few 
I make power jewels, drop jewelz, wit da crewz
Inside a, outta da eyez of god can't lose
batter and bruise crewz
and let the heat spark, the feuls
Got ya boyz cryin while you're stretched out in front of da church fews
Foolz hit da dance floor, to shake shoes
Intect ya like a hip hop monsta who sucks Oooohhhs
Outta da power that I used that I used ta sock prower
Want more, I stick ya butt naked and raw

Chorus

[Pharoahe Monch]
Only inches beyond my eyez, lord hail out the soul
Of a nigga who fights the lyrical which's inside himself
Pharoahe, egar to see febal intermediate MCs
Immediately, to leaded, repeatiatly
y'all know the unpresidented without herb
every single word'll be verbally demented
Presented, so that when it desinigrates
unsentaments, are meninetated
Standin aloneit gets you tinimented
It's it bug how I bust lyrical slugs
And thugs that mug niggaz for loot and sell drugz
When the band gets struck, by thesis
I'm only rollin wit da most superior Profile, to my species, see my thesis
Release these bombz by all meanz
Yes, attack the mic rapz until itz a crack fiend
Mase the bass with aids and misplaced the vaccine
Pharoahe pullin out on the pole
To compare cause ??? wit scriptures that I wrote and know
My physical form iz like Nam and sane like Sadaam Hussein buit still calm

Organized Konfusion,"[Pharoahe Monch]
Yes yes yes yes yes
Yo Mr. Soundman!  We would very much appreciate it
(yes indeed) if you add a tad bit more mids
and a little more lows to the mic (word up)
I'm on mic number one, Prince is on mic number two (yes yes yes)
A little bit more but RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT THERE, yeah
One more, c'mon, uhh (recognize)
c'mon, right yes, yes, right here, uhh, c'mon, down

Sorta similar to the way I remember to be the wordsmith
Pharoahe, God's gift to vocabulary
My personal soliloquies be killin me softly
still I be packin artillery, y'all feelin me yet?
Props don't stop HERE nigga
I knock MC's out of a six-sided figure
My strategies be tragedy to MC's
who receive certificates from rap academies
I'm terrific with wordplay (wordplay..)
Specific with verbs, say we step it up, to the next level
See if I represent God..
.. then all my competition is exclusively Lucifer
See y'all used to the niggaz who would say Devil right? (right)
But I ain't them (nah) they ain't me (uh-huh)
with some bullshit college-ass rappin degree
But let me show you how we do it, duh duh duh
Done with the disco fluid, duh duh
But if it ain't LOUD enough
we tell the soundman turn that shit up up up!

Yo Pharoahe, hold up hold up, check it
Let me introduce myself
I'm Senor El Chocolate, creme de la creme, a la cheddy
Prince Poe, God's gift to vo, cabulary
Very visual, every lyrical slide
is spiritually projected, forever inside
Never to hide but to shine like, diamonds inside mines
Let that ass marinate and Poe free flows over basslines
I'm, takin elevatin to next
plateaus rippin shows with this cosmic sex
Love on CD's and cassettes and DAT's (now all rise)
Now who masters the Funk, when it's time to Flex? (Organized!)
From the Southside, spar chump MC's
thinkin they comp, but soon to get smoked like trees
I eat MC's of ALL kinds, spit out the rhyme
Regurgitate their mindstate, cause I don't eat swine
Set it straight, online, internet programmed to climb
You might catch me in The Grind straight bumpin a dime
Now let me tell you how we do it (yeah yeah)
With that old disco fluid (uh-huh!)
And if it ain't LOUD enough
tell the soundman to turn that shit up (up) up (up) up, UP!

Tinted V8, buck and a half on the dash
All weather Pirellis, the exterior color is cash
Black Italian leather, Nakamichi system to blast
Full metal to the pedal when we Organize on that ass
I last, amongst the mass, gettin the cash
But in the stash fast before the stock market crash
Splash, five quarts of straight water fortified
First place to get this partyin on
In any club or on the corner in the box with pops
In barbershops ladies got with it in hoopties some in drop-tops
Look at love-love, fuckin with this top-notch
boombastic, ghetto dope now, fly gymnastics of passion
with verbal toxic, rock shit (daily)

I'm sendin them in YO' face!  Spinnin them quick wit
Synonym blendin them in wit, homynyms entered in

No need for me to go get old hit, records to go gold wit
Yo' shit with absolutely NO innovation whatsoever
You and all your mens not clever!
y'all need to be TOLD that shit
You ain't bold black plans of promotional schemes and scams are so wack
Tracks are trash to me, nigga actually
your platinum plaque should even go back to the factory
People want to be like Michael and when
recyclin when the fans want to hear FRESH MATERIAL
From imperial rap pros who ORGANIZE
Gettin very intolerant at rap shows like lactose
In fact those niggaz that act up get smacked
backwards for bein so anti-climac.. tic
Watch any mack get, put on his back with
lyrical tactics utilized without practice
This is how we do it (YEAH YEAH) duh duh duh
Done with the disco fluid (UH-HUH) duh duh

But you find your strength anyway
Courage is when you're afraid
Courage is when it all seems grey

Courage is when you make a change,
And you keep on living anyway
You keep on moving anyway
You keep on giving anyway

You keep on loving anyway",Courage [Lacey Version]

Home,
the road still leads me home to you
Sometimes I don't see the signs, 
The headlights make me blind

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

And feel the softness of your lips
When I can melt into your loving embrace

From facing your failure
Facing your loneliness
Facing the fact that you live a lie

Yes, you live a lie, tell you why
You're always preaching not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach from feeling alive
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive

Are you really jealous

I found myself in a desert
Called Cyberland

It was hot
My canteen had sprung a leak
And I was thirsty

Out of the abyss
Walked a cow, Elsie
I asked if she had
Anything to drink

She said, ""I'm forbidden
To produce milk
In Cyberland, we only drink
Diet Coke""

She said, ""Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon""
""They've closed everything
Real down""

""Like barns and troughs
And performance spaces
And replaced it all with lies
And rules and virtual life
But there is a way out""

Leap of fate, leap of fate
Leap of fate, leap of fate

""Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon
I gotta get out of here
It's like I'm being tied to the hood""

""Of a yellow rental truck
Being packed in
With fertilizer and fuel oil""

""Pushed over a cliff by
A suicidal Mickey Mouse
I've got to, got to, got to find a way""

""To jump over the moon
Only thing to do
Is jump over the moon""

Then a little bulldog entered
His name we have learned
Was Benny

And although he once had principles
He abandoned them
To live as a lap dog
To a wealthy daughter
Of the Revolution

""That's bull,"" he said
""Ever since the cat
Took up the fiddle
That cow's been jumpy""

""The dish and spoon
Were evicted from the table and eloped
She's had trouble with that milk
And the moon ever since
Maybe it's a female thing""

""'Cause who'd want to leave
Cyberland anyway?
Walls ain't so bad
The dish and the spoon for instance""

""They were down on their luck
Knocked on my doghouse door""
I said, ""Not in my backyard, utensils
Go back to China""

""The only way out is up""
Elsie whispered to me
""A leap of faith""
""Still thirsty?""

Parched, ""Have some milk""
I lowered myself beneath her
And held my mouth
To her swollen udder

And sucked the sweetest milk
I'd ever tasted
""Climb on board"", she said

And as a harvest moon
Rose over Cyberland
We reared back

We sprang into a gallop
Leaping out of orbit
I awoke singing

'Cause her cold eyes can burn
Yet you yearn and you churn and rebound

And called you 'Pookie'? Never
Have you ever doubted a kiss or two?

Gotta look on the bright side
With all of your might

I'd fall for her still anyhow
When you're dancing her dance
You don't stand a chance
Her grip of romance makes you fall

So you think, might as well
Dance a tango to hell
At least I'll have tangoed at all
The Tango Maureen

Gotta dance 'til your diva is through
You pretend to believe her
'Cause in the end, you can't leave her
But the end it will come

Still you have to play dumb
'Til you're glum and you bum and turn blue

Why do we love when she's mean?
And she can be so obscene

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

A nasty little high dollar habit
I'm gonna lose my arm

Instead of draggin' it out
I'd a permanent vacation

But when I liined up to talk to God
I kinda didn't like the looks

Original Casts,"And now I'm all alone again
Nowhere to go, no one to turn to
Without a home, without a friend
Without a face to say hello to
And now the night is near
and now I can make-believe he's here

Sometimes I walk alone at night
When everybody else is sleeping
I think of him and then I'm happy
With the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head

On my own, pretending he's beside me
All alone, I walk with him 'til morning
Without him, I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my eyes and he has found me

In the rain, the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
in the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me, forever and forever

And I know, it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself, and not to him
And although, I know that he is blind
Still I say there's a way for us

I love him, but when the night is over
He is gone, the river's just a river
Without him, the world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers

I love him, but every day I'm learning
All my life, I've only been pretending
Without me, his world will go on turning
The world is full of happiness that I have never known

I love him
I love him
I love him
But only on my own",On My Own (from Les MisĂŠrables)

Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face

Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Ya' decide to smile

Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look
Slap on a happy grin

And spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine

I knew a girl so gloomy
She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing

So spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
So, put on a happy face

Brother in the sneakers slammin jams through my speakers
Won't you write a rhyme that's designed just to freak us
Can ya huh? Can you make it sound swift?
Yes I can become the flavours who I'm down with
Plus I make the moola with a well-rehearsed script
From my feet to my hips then propelling from my lips
You claim to have style while I, huh crack a smile
You can give it up because you know you're livin foul
It took a hot minute now I'm in it like a champ
You want to feel the bass pump up the amp
Brothers bop their heads to the funk y'all
So many non-believers said I would fall
But now I'm hangin out with the live crew
Dan Dash, Darien, Clark Kent too
The Future Sound, Sean Wan, brother Suave and Kirk
It doesn't take a genius to know that we do work.

[Suave Lover]
Can I break it down to the bone to the core
Without a loud yell or a thunderous roar
Still you get wrecked by the intellect
Rumour has it that payroll is fronting
On the checks and they did so the kid
Had to break out in a dash came the cash
Among with much clout now I'm living well
Never living poor even doe see doe
From doing all our tours skins in the air
When the wind blows not down with H.I.V.
So I say hell no universal lingo drop dead
On a single play it and you'll find I got more flavour
Then a pringle fresh pair of sneaks
Jean hanging from my bottom rap is expressed through the way
That I'm dressed can I get a ho from the crowd?
Uptown in the boogie down Bronx.

8 more bars until I reach the stars
Picture perfect quest yes without any flaws
Streets go by now the while was worth waiting
Although I'm kind of tired from the months of creating
Patience is a virtue that's protected through time
That's my main motto when I write a new rhyme
But everything revolves around my lifestyle
Combination with a 4-count beat
Yeah.

[Suave Lover]
Time again for the Suave to bust the spit out
To all those non-belivers who had their doubts
Now I'm in the door making it legit
And when I write my rhymes I'm writing just for hits

Original Mirrors,"Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Reflections of
The love you took from 
Reflections of
The way life used to be

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Now baby, why did you do it?

Original Prague Syncopated Orchestra,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Tired as fuck just woke up what's goin' on?
Gun Clapper 3 yelling sound thee alarm
This ain't no drill move your fuckin' ass cause they here
Pass the mask tear gas is tossed in the air
We're surrounded street is crowed can't wait no more
First break fuck bust through that front door
Poppadidick and if they double up they get splitted
Hit 'em did 'em no damn good Benedic Arnold

Calm yourself there's no need for panicing
Slugs to him chest leavin' himself stiff like manakins
Men it is, the fuckin' worst way to die
But when I die I'm goin' all out with my five

But hold on son I got your back you got mine?
First pick flinch or move leave 'em spine
On the table, spit belly from the navel
Unable to talk his trash I stalk kick that mayheim

Let's move along, you know we stand strong
Allah got our backs so we won't go wrong
Cause shit is all hot up in our face
I think we should slide to a place where it's safe
Come on

Time's a wastin' no lookin' back or move fakin'
Devils of all kinds cross lines so now I'm thinkin'
Escape route (no doubt) cause odds is far from even
No joke loc I just hope we see this evening

Just be ready for whatever, come dress for action
If we gettin' pass him if not we just blastin'
Him so let it not, have to come down to that
But for now son keep the fuckin' mack where it's at

It takes one time and a word to start my niggas to envy
You don't know how it is after dark
So stop figuring that we give a fuck
Cause you know me not give a fuck
In this jungle walk we stalk with the shottie
The pumps, come try and put yourself in our boots likkle youth
Better face behind this madness you done started in your root

So who be you copy cat standing over there
Trying to come clear and face to face with my dry tear
I raise hell smells from my inhales
My minds not here and I don't think you want to go there
So stand clear, or get ripped from the rear
To your head, O.G.C. payed dues to get you red (fed up)
Whatever, bring your flame you can call it ruckus
We make shit so hot you can call this Waco Texas (boom)

That I be kickin' ain't for real, pack more steel
Then four wheels at the dog hill
Commercial rap get the gun clap

You was on my dick til Buckshot 'got ya opin'
Too hot to handle, no I can't stand y'all
Punk ass niggas get blown out like Orlando

It's a shame, Mr. Starang, hang ya like a picture frame

And brains blow, so I say fuck this
Let my nigga Rock bring the Ruck-us
Niggas talk shit, then they leaving here in crutches

I, cock, back, relax and swing
Ringin' ears, is what the Sluggah from the Ville be
Upon them weak crews, them can't do me nothing
Them can't do me nothing
Dare cross this path, gassed up and making something
Huffin', bluffin', punk in my path
Voice raise glass, and I don't think that you can ask routes

So whose a dandy, he, L-O-U-I-E Ville Sluggah
Coming for ya, so muthafuckas run for cover

And go' around, like them punks from underground
Catchin' beatdowns, they not hard to the core

All of y'all out there might think that I'm strange
But the wild cowboy never lived on no range
The only prairie I seen was in the library
And the last Indian I seen was headin towards Cleveland
y'all can believe in what y'all believe in
But stop the bullshittin and deceivin
When the O.K. Corral bell rings for the winter
I'ma flash back to '79 with Thelma drinkin wine
You could see that it was me even with that small screen
Al Green had a major string of hits
And I want to be like him, in the fact, that each one was a gem
My man Mashburn is killin 'em down in Dallas
I seen him one day after this bullshit show called Alice
The wild cowboy is hard to resist
Make the play, get the assist, girlfriends hate genesis
Me and Diamond D +Dug+ deep In The Crates
Been rhymin for high rates, did wild show dates
My name is X yo my name is X, worth more weight than gold
Precious than your baby who's a year old
Step to war without your armor, results in trauma
Mad drama, I'm the mad bomber
Young girls stay away 'cause I'm dangerous
I'm a grown man, don't force my hand
I'll judge off 'cause I can (Cuz I can and I will..)

Hey I got a lot of family on both sides of the tracks
Some is livin positive while others is sellin crack
Two sides to livin yo step up and place your vote

Now should I clear myself for samples?
Or make cats examples of my cowboy status Boyd Roger?
You ever see Oliver Twist and his boostin man Dodger?
Takin wallets in the street, sign my name in the wet con-crete
A big X, so wide ya break ya fuckin legs
For me to be dead-ass, have bread and water in a tall glass,
is lunacy, madness, and I ain't on no badness
But in this point in time I can't take no backward steps (Uh-uh)
I like crisp, green, money, and a lot of it
In big bills, 'cause money right here make this whole world spin
Say you went on a gin, 'cause honey go home with strange men
Dance by the light of the silvery moon
Then wake up in the mornin with the hay in your eyes
Your purple with that herpes bump, who want the rump?
Some niggas joint got a lump from that late night hump
What does it take to be a cowboy? Hold on down boy
'cause I don't got no contracts in my pockets
Kids run up our amp like they stuck they hands in sockets

Originoo Gunn Clappaz,"Smack, and when you hear that in ya
Know that it's the quiet riot stormin' in the center
No doubt, do it like this and like that
Put the change in the streets from fists to gats
Feelin', loosy, you see off the liquor
Can't shut these lips up, never slip up
But on point, just like a stick-up
I shoot my gift to ya gut, like a jailed jukks
And run my line up ya spine like a bomb book
Shook crooked booked, ain't no time for jokin'
Provoke this light gun, smoke some nice and hopin'
Soaked in acid, eating can be that bastard
Eleven thirty fire, sound burn, ashes to ashes

Rips and tears when you hear that, then ya
Know that it's the Big Kahuna, next on ya menu
(Lord have mercy) do it like this and that
Makin' changes on the streets from fists to gats
Heh - erase, to the new unknown
No one is home, so I relax my chrome
Temporalily until I come face to face with these
Fake ass slackers who try to bury we
You better be, mentaly, physically fit
Cuz O.G.C., comes equipped for yo lip
No flappin' having heartaches when we comin' through
Ya back door, and you still askin' for more
Of Top Dog, but you don't really want no more
They all fall, and they all spoiled

Boo-yah! And when you hear that, then ya
It's the beast from the east, don't enter
(No doubt) Do it up like this and that
Make the change in the streets, like from fists to gats
Niggaz don't be knowing, what be going
On, when I be flowin', wilder than Samoans
Bitches get dissed, because they Miss like Jones
When it's my turn to throw, you get hit with stones
Now I guess ya, whole crew's under pressure
Don't mess around with the sarge, man, I'm Large like Professor

When I ran around town, doing things I did
Buckin' shots at them criminal kids
Many tried to infiltrate through my mind state
But my mate, the line break, kept my fuckin' mind straight
Bitches get put up, and punk shot down
Frowns on they faces, when they niggaz draw the tre'pounds
Clowns, front, act like they don't know
But OGC aggrees that that's a no-no
Cryin', whynin', like that lion
Far from bows, so hop ya ass on that fuckin' yellow road
Sowed up, from the toes up, emcee's get no leeway
(O.G.C.'ll split ya three ways)

From the parts unknown, I have sparked and blowned
Any punk who wanna test, or any mark with the chrome
It is known, that my style increases
Like the deficit, you best to get outta my face
I'm on the next shit, yes it gets
Hectic, like Chill Rob, Ill Squad
Who pull the cards on retards, we scar
Anybody, and make niggaz wanna party
So don't act rowdy, cause in this room it's mad cloudy
Now we, walk around with the glock in the pound, g

And you knows that, there's no stoppin', Fab 5, Ruck & Rockin'
Originoo Gunn's, make other crews run like stockings
Hype when the mic's inside my control
Tighten up my grip so I won't fold
Wettin' niggaz, I play too much, I leave 'em damp
I'm the champ (Starang) you know from the Boot Camp
The illest, obselete fleet from PJ'S

From the beginning, niggaz knew they wasn't winnin'
Ninety-now is the ending of them niggaz that's pretending

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans

Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord,

And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

How those eyes could flash at you (How those eyes could flash at you)

But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store

But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store

Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store

But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town)

Orion,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

I can still hear Papa, what he said
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you",Patches

And in whose arms you're gonna be

Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go
I love you oh so much

Orion,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird

A los cervantes soy del rabu caballero 
No se amontonen en cuadrilas, espias por que les cojo el pellejo 
Callejero, sigo siendo mi reflejo 
Dejo impreso 
Sobre un sello 
Como fino tabaquero 
Rebuscando en mis notas los consortes de mi zona 
Repitiran : que bola
Y seguira este drama de la puta calle
Rellenando tu cerebro ahora (ahora, ahora) 

Pa' todos los moñeros, filetes y chaperos 
La gente del dinero, tabaquero que bola
La gente la bola, tremenda herizadera 
Como en una nevera, tremenda pasmadera

Pon atención a las palabras de mama 
Pon atención a los consejos que te da
Si era consigo pana 
Pero mañana en la mañana 
Tu familia es la que sufre cuantos estas en gana 
Cosa cotidiana cuando el money money llama 
Y te reclama 
Cierras la boca, ante el jurado 
Sino tu muerte aclama 
Los hombrecitos como tu son los que en gana 
Pero te digo, mira 
No habra camino en tu vida 
No habra salida 
No habra destino 
Y si no ya sin camino 
Las esperanzas 
Seran ya parte de tu venganza 
Tras de la reja, tu mundo veras como se aleja

Leyenda que contaba chulo viejo de barrio en barrio 
Boca a boca, en la calzada 
A los oídos del curioso rellenaba 

Ah había una vez, una pareja desprovista poca vista sin dinero 
Pensando atónito, tónico, crónico como vivir 
Salir del negro fango que le ahogaba 
Tramaban, andaban, entre besos una cámara silente

Aquel que hablaba mal mal, plas plas, de mi

Yo no te he olvidado, sigo en el vedado
Tanto pa? mi pueblo sincero que sin querer he dejado
why andando sigo por estos terrenos helados
Con mi gente de mi zona en mi memoria se ha quedado
Pica, pica, en lo que da en la rodilla
Te agita, este es mi flow que te fatiga
Para la cima toda mi gente de latina
De aspirinas pa? lo que te desafina

Entro mi ¿? desde el 95 why tú

Sin mirar tras mi luz

Mi gente me escucha, mi gente me quiere
Eh, chsst, tú asere (x 2)

Te veo desesperaíto mijo
Esperando que cayere el trabajito rico
Una vez más yo te demuestro que no es facilito
Como el puré que preparaba tu vecino lino.
Yo, en esta rima yo no te quiero a ti decepcionar
Pero yo sé que mi gente mi guateque va a apoyar
Una vez más tu vecino aquí me va a escuchar
why mi cd segurito lo va a comparar

Esperando que esta nueva historia que ha llegado
Acabe en la Gloria como el pasado
A lo cubano, yo, botella why ron
Como el cañón del morro hoy disparo
Ah! Nueva canción para ti mi gente
Que nunca me ha fallado en la emoción
Para terminar gracias a tó mi pueblo

Para mi gente traigo este discurso hecho canción
Para esos que han seguido sin dar un solo paso a tras
Fieles a disentir, tratando de evadir
Las malas lenguas why al que habla sin más
Pido una vez más su comprensión why aceptación
De nuevo estoy cantando espero no decepcionar
No canto por cantar, canto por no llorar

Gamins frangin et déjà ça castagnait
On jouait les durs mais l'un sur l'autre
Tu sais qu'on pouvait compter
La vie nous a séparé, chacun son taff chacun son quartier
Fallait pas s'perdre de vue on s'voyait aux fêtes

Adiós no dije, hoy te los mando
Van uno, dos, tres, millón de besos
Pido que me perdones en brazos
Con Dios te ibas, mi ausencia en el velorio deambulaba
Heridas que no cierran, infancias que perduran
Momentos tristes viejos no llegan
A veces vivir cuesta duda, sin duda

No ha terminado
De la lengua seguirán contando
Los chicos del barrio

Imagínate quién es ese
Espero que el fuese
El tipo que controla aquí la chacha
Siempre te contaron mal la historia
Pero aquí retorna
Con gloria
El rey de la pachacha

Abra bien los oídos
Que ahora quiero a contarles
Una historia verdadera
Joven de valor prestigio why libertad
Era rey de La Habana entera
Era rey de La Habana entera
Repito
Una noche ebrio de todo
Preso de desilusión
Sin conciencia ni control
A su novia why a su amigo
Liquidó por confusión
why claro fue condenado
A veinte años de prisión
Dieciséis meses más tarde
Directo hacia el pelotón
Derere rabadero rebodipodá badá badá

Imaginare quién es ese
Espero que el fuese
El tipo que controla aquí la chacha
Siempre te contaron mal la historia
Pero aquí retorna

Abro mis ojos why veo mi gente
Que me cita a salir, a compartir
El mundo que he dejado aquí a mi paso
No quiero rechazo, al caso
Seguir la misma historia
Que en mi gloria del Vedado
El barrio que le canto
Con los pinches a mi lado
Al business yo progreso Cayo Hueso
El barrio que le debo lo que yo he hecho
Solo el pecho
Fumando cosas de esas que te ponen
Mala la cabeza, he confundido
Armonía por tristeza
why no me pesa
Si Dios me bendice
El diablo me confiesa
¿Quién es esa?
¿Quién separa el territorio de mi hogar?
Sin preguntar, quiere robar, sin mas hablar
Coge el bate que sofoca, golpe a la cabeza
Sangre brota, prendó la luz que toca
Miró en el suelo se encontraba
Sorpresa grande loca me esperaba
Yo no sabía nada

Imagínate quién es ese
Espero que el fuese

Al otro día recibes palos

¿Cómo pretendes que siga a tu lado?

Has olvidado, el viejo si refrán del barrio
Uno recoge lo que en vida a sembrado
Y no asombrado
Yo me he quedado de tu salto
Pues vacunado, ya estoy contra ese perro sato

Si de comer muerde la mano
Y te aconsejo, te respeto

En un rincón nocturno de mi pensamiento
Buscando la manera de calmar ese tormento
Que te tiene alucinado
Que te está martirizando
Pobre de ti
No estas en ná se ve
Pobre de ti
Preso de tu pensar

Tu canterado intento amanecer
Y chocó con el sol
Después de tanto jugar a perder
Dime ¿qué vas a hacer?
Confianza es la palabra
Percutiva como aquel tambor
Sonando monte adentro
Alertando al negro cimarrón
Tu pantanoso sendero
Te empeñas en hacer brillar
Sabiendo que resta tiempo
Tan solo para llorar

Tu mente calculadora fue final total
Para muchos al no confiar
El fracaso veían llegar
Tres contando líos han quedado
Orishas sigue igual aquí representando
Controlando

Recapitulando, ya se sabe
Eso aquí no cabe
Sintetizar es un fastidio, ya sabes
La duda está servida en plato hondo
Eres bueno en los cien metros
Pero nunca corredor de fondo

Representar, hoy me a tocado
A esos que nunca le han cantado
Cubanos que de mientras se han salvado
Y en vano prosigo, y digo:
¿Qué has sido?
¿Amigo o enemigo?

No hay palabras para mencionarte
Tampoco momentos lindos
Para recordarte

No queda nada de lo de ayer
Sin caminar no se puede correr
Tu ves
Sentado aquí masticando estrellas
En un rincón nocturno de mi pensamiento
Buscando la manera de calmar ese tormento

Ha llovido tanto después de ese paso
Del famoso caso del fifty nine
Esto no es un insulto creo que ha llegado el punto
Que se moviese un poco esta city life

No es un porque tampoco un falso brebaje
Que es lo que veo cambio de ambiente
Todas las mentes preparadas como guerrilla
Esperando la partida porque todo sale urgente

La misma trama panorama no more drama
Publicitario será cuestión de un cambio de bando

Con el saco de dudas que nunca se irán
Y ganas que tengo, de saber un poco más
Creo que nada será más eterno

Que aquel que fue dueño de tantas
Y tantas ventanas, desde aquella mañana
Unos dirán que su hora llego
Otros irán a pedirle a Dios

Que aguante un poco más aunque no crean ya
En la palabra que les dicto
Sin preguntar si quieres o no
La que los elevo o la que los hundió

Que será, pasara, que vendrá, donde está?
Las vueltas que da la vida
Que vendrá, pasara, donde está, quien será?
Las vueltas que

Y no me digas que la cosa no es tan fea
Cuando siento el sonido retirada
Mi gente apagada sea contenta
Y los que están felices se atormentan

Que será de al machete cuando no hay machete
Que será de mi manada cuando empiece la rodada
Sabanas blancas colgadas por toa mi gente o mama

In these drab, loveless buildings that all look the same
You are my teacher--but I am contained

I may laugh, but I am only to blame
Words that could SAVE me I kept so contained

In that tip of a summer, nothing could mar 
Those tentative times in that wreck of a car
I was yours for the asking, a child afraid
Sent unfettered letters, postage unpaid

In identical avenues that no one would miss
The world could not touch us, but we could not kiss
For in this life that is measured out in bus stops and rain
You were my teacher--but I was contained",Contained
Orlando,"Through no real fault of your own,
You were born with a withering tone;
And through no real fault of your own
You were born.

And on the day when the teacher asked us:
""What do you want to be when you grow up?""
You stood up and said, ""What I want doesn't get""
And you proved it...

And while you're out on the town
Making people impress you,
I sit and rot at home--
I've been kept at arm's length
With industrial strength
From the word ""Go.""

So I don't have to tell you, I don't go.

Just for a second
You lowered your defenses,
And confessed what the world had guessed:
""Deep down I fear I might actually be
Unremarkable.""

Well my dear, I have spent years
Just waiting for this moment
Because I'm afraid of being alone
And I'm afraid of being not alone.

But fun with you sounds too much like hard work.
Love with you: too much like hard work.
And the truth is unfurled: I'm not part of your world,
Which is fine, 'cause you're not part of mine.

You want no part in mine...
So do I.",Just for a Second

At last all too well
I can see where we all soon will be.
If you strip away The myth from the man,
You will see where we all soon will be. Jesus!
You've started to believe
The things they say of you.
You really do believe
This talk of God is true.
And all the good you've done
Will soon get swept away.
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say.

Listen Jesus I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.
You have set them all on fire.
They think they've found the new Messiah.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of God then, we called you a man.
And believe me, my admiration for you hasn't died.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.
Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood He'd have made good.
Tables, chairs, and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have caused nobody harm; no one alarm.

Listen, Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?

For we are getting much too loud.
And they'll crush us if we go too far.
If they go too far

Please remember that I want us to live.
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour.

Sets the screen aflame 
Silent music starts to play 
One tear from my eye 
Makes the whole world cry

With one look 
They'll forgive the past 
They'll rejoice: I've returned at last 
To my people in the dark 
Still out there in the dark 

Silent music starts to play 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one look 
I'll ignite a blaze 
I'll return to my glory days 
They'll say Norma's back at last

This time I'm staying 
I'm staying for good 
I'll be back 
Where I was born to be 
With one look 
I'll be me",With One Look [From Sunset Boulevard]
Orlando Pops Orchestra,"Don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye",As If We Never Said Goodbye [From Sunset Boulevard]
Orlando Pops Orchestra,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man 
I was slap in the right place at the perfect time
Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can","High Flying, Adored [From Evita]"
Orlando Pops Orchestra,"Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behavior
But how long do you think this pantomime can last?

Tell me before I ride off in the sunset, there's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're a savior
When those who oppose you are stepped on
Or cut up, or simply disappear?

Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?

Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do, I don't care what the Bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them but to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two

There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental
So what are my chances of honest advances? I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin than to lose with a halo

Tell me before I seek worthier pastures and thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
Than have no impossible dream?

Allow me before you slink off to the sidelines
I'll pay your fair gift three cheers but first tell me who'd be delighted
To witness me the top world's greatest problems
From war to pollution, no hope of solution
Even if I live for one hundred years

There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental
So go, if you're able to somewhere unstable and stay there
Whip up your hate in some tottering state
But not here, dear, is that clear, dear?

Oh, what I'd give for a hundred years
But the physical interferes, everyday more, Oh my Creator
What is the good of the strongest heart
In a body that's falling apart? A serious flaw, I hope You know that",Waltz for Eva and Che [From Evita]

Goodnight and thank you Huevo
She is in every magazine
Been photographed, seen, she is known
We don't like to rush, but your case has been packed
If she's missed anything, you could give her a ring
But she won't always answer the phone 

(Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But we have pretended enough
It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves

(Che:)
Which means...

(Che and Eva:)
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them, you're the same

(Che:)
Goodnight and thank you Emilio
You've completed your task
What more can we ask of you now?
Please sign the book on the way out the door
And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call
But I don't think that's likely somehow

(Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But when we were hot, we were hot
I know you'll look back on the good times we've shared
Which means ...

(substituting ""blame her"" for ""blame
Them"", sung only by Che)

(Eva:)
There is no soap, no soap like Zaz
No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower
It's the mother and father of luxury lather
The talk of the bath, the great ointment
One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic
You're scented, you'll be sent

(Che:)
Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio
We'll think of you every time she's on the air
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way
So do up your trousers and go

(Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
The decline into silence and doubt
Our passion was just too intense to survive

(Che:)
Which means ...

(Lovers:)
This is a club I should never have joined
Someone has made us look fools
Argentine men call the sexual shots
Someone has altered the rules

(Eva:)
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes
Is all very well but every girl knows

(Che:)
She needs a man she can monopolize
With fingers in dozens of different pies

Orlando Pops Orchestra,"People of Europe! I send you the Rainbow of Argentina!

Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes--it doesn't matter much
She's the New World Madonna with the golden touch
She filled a bull-ring--forty-five thousand seater
But if you're prettier than General Franco
That's not hard

Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
More important, current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset
Your trump card

Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts


Would Evita win through?

But the answer is yes!

There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where we go
The whole world over--just the same
You should have heard them call our name
And who would underestimate the actress now?

I'm not underestimating you--just do the same thing in
Italy please

Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome is not so good
She hasn't gone down like we thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini
Can't think why

Did you here that?
They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!

But Signora Peron
It's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
yet I gave up the sea long ago

Things aren't all that bad she met with the Pope
She got a Papal decoration and a kindly word
So even if the crowds gave our lady the bird

The Argentine/Italy axis does have some hope
She still made a fabulous impact
Caught the eye

Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts


Would Evita win through?

But the answer is

A qualified

Yes!

Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like the sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the carefree days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired

Tired? Eva tired?

Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now

It wasn't on the schedule anyhow

You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home triumph
Is required

Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts
Would Evita win through?

And the answer is

Yes

And no

And yes

And no

And yes, and no
Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success

Who the hell does the King of England think he is?
Tea at some tinpot castle of his--what kind of invitation
is that?

Darkness stirs and wakes imagination

Music is deceiving
Hard as lightning, soft as candlelight

And the truth isn't what you want to see

That the truth is what it ought to be

Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight

Close your eyes, start a journey through a strange, new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Close your eyes, and let music set you free
Only then can you belong to me

Floating (floating), falling (falling), sweet intoxication
Touch me (touch me), trust me (trust me), savor each sensation

You're still the one -- I want to talk to in bed
Still the one -- that turns my head
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go (wanted to go)
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow

You're still the one -- that makes me laugh
Still the one -- that's my better half
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You're still the one -- that makes me strong
Still the one -- I want to take along
We're still having fun, and you're still the one (yes you are)

Even though we grow old, it grows new

You're still the one -- that I love to touch
Still the one -- and I can't get enough
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You're still the one -- who can scratch my itch
Still the one -- and I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun, and you're still the one

You are still the one -- that makes me shout

What breeds in the darkness
Blossoms in the light

Thrust without warning
Into life all over again

Running from pain

By its light that winter night

It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way

Che questa mia generazione ormai non crede 
In ciò che spesso han mascherato con la fede 
Nei miti eterni della patria o dell'eroe 
Perchè è venuto ormai il momento di negare 
Tutto ciò che è falsità, le fedi fatte di abitudine e paura
Una politica che è solo far carriera
Il perbenismo interessato, la dignità fatta di vuoto
L'ipocrisia di chi sta sempre con la ragione e mai col torto 
E un dio che è morto
Nei campi di sterminio, dio è morto
Coi miti della razza, dio è morto 
Con gli odi di partito, dio è morto

Ma penso 
Che questa mia generazione è preparata 
A un mondo nuovo e a una speranza appena nata
Ad un futuro che ha già in mano
A una rivolta senza armi

In ciò che noi vogliamo, dio è risorto

And I dreamed the night
and almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
and no one can take her love away
Ooo love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
and no one will take her love away
I wanna be love

And I mean all these words I said
And you don't have to guess
what's going on inside me head
Just try to know
All the things that our heart says
Listen to love and always
get love to lead the way
Whenever you love

You know for love
I'd go anywhere
I would go there
For love to the end of nowhere
And for your love
(And for your love)
I would,
I would
I would love
To just spend all my time
With a girl who makes me
feel her love is mine
Someone you see
Who would only dream of me
And she be in love
just because she wanna be
She wanna be loved

could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far

And go no matter how far

It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

¡Si aquella boca mentía
el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos
yo habría dado siempre más!

siempre se vuelve
al primer amor.

tuyo es su querer.

hoy me ven volver.

tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

Orquesta Riverside,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

Orquesta Romantica del Casino de Hawana,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

High up on the hills
A place for making noises
Noises like the whales
Here she built a chapel with
Her image on the wall
A place where she could rest and
A place where she could wash
And listen to the wind blow 

She dreamt of children's voices
And torture on the wheel
Patron-Saint of nothing
A woman of the hills
She once was a lady
Of pleasure, and high-born
A lady of the city
But now she sits and moans
And listens to the wind blow 
I see her in her chapel
High up on a hill
She must be so lonely

A husband to our Catherine?
A handsome one, a dear
A rich one for the lady

Where true love was torn apart
But then I met the heavenly Father
Who made a home inside my heart

I am a man with the chains of addiction
Dragging me down for way too long
But I came face to face with redemption
And now those chains are gone

Does anybody know what I'm talking about?

Lost in the mirror, no self-esteem
But God made me in His image
And that makes me a beauty queen

I am a wife and the mother of three
Trading my dreams for a busy life
Searching for my lost identity
And I'm happy to announce that I found it in Christ

Does anybody know what I'm talking about?

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

I am so awfully misunderstood

The lights all fade to gray
Don't think there'll be an encore
For our secret passion play

It's time to play the final card
In a game I now despise
To me it seems so obvious
To you it's such a big surprise

It's already over
If I stay here I'd only make you cry
It's already over
We can't move forward, so let's move on, bye-bye

Oh, they say parting is such sweet sorrow
But I'm still looking for the sweet
I feel just like a baby now
These tears don't miss a beat

And I'd rather be anyone but here
And any place else but me
I'll just climb inside my head a while
My demons have a date with me

It's already over
If I stay here I'd only make you cry
It's already over
We can't move forward, so let's move on, bye-bye

So go ahead and hate me now
For breaking up on the phone
But I know that I'd crack if I saw your face
I deserve to be alone

And I hate that I still love you, girl
And I only wish you well
But I'll never be man enough for you

And then you took all my money
I was blindsided by a smile that wasn't what it seemed

I'm talking about last night
Last night, last night
Last night, last night, last night

Your mouth was making words
That seemed at the time very sensible
Your body trembled and secretly called my name
You said, ""Can I see you later?
'cause I'd like to spend some time with you""

How could I know that it was only just for show
'cause when the light came on you were gone
I was standing all alone

Get on the floor, and then you're back for more
And I'm praying to be your prey

Délaisser de sang froid 
Ou se replier sur soi, triste choix

II n'est pas facile de laisser derrière
Tout ce qu'on a

On les retrouvera

Au-dessus de moi le monde a ses lois

Je I'ai vécu cent fois 
Mais j'érige sans y croire des ponts de paille

En nomade sans lois

Peuvent se fermer
On les enfoncera

Et déjà je suis roi
Je peux lever la voix, montrer la voie

Dès le premier pas je vais tout droit
Et rien n'entravera mon bel envoi
Une porte, une loi

Je ne connais que le bon endroit
A l'envers le décor est trop incolore
Pour vous et moi

Libre à moi de libérer le soir
Je peux rompre le sort qui nous endort
Lever le voile

Cent flammes devant moi 
Ne m'éblouiraient pas

Cent bras autour de moi 
Ne me contiendraient pas

Du hasard je ne sais que la chance
Et jamais l'infortune n'aura de sens
Sous cette lune

Qu'elle éclaire ce qui sera ma rampe
Et lorsque je m'élance, les étoiles dansent

II n'attend rien du sommeil
Comme 1'erreur paraît exemplaire
Comme la foule semble déserte

L'heure tourne pourtant les aiguilles s'arrêtent
Il court mais le décor est immobile
Ici, rien n'est utile
Ni le sens, ni les signes",De Ce Monde
Orwell,"Quel est ce courant qui m'entraine ?
Une lame de fond qui m'éloigne du sommet
C'est un autre qu'on aide
Qu'on hisse, qu'on lève

Quelle est cette route qui s'arrête ?
Un chemin de traverse qui en tout sens me dessert
C'est un autre qu'on sème
Qu'on laisse à la traîne

Elémentaire, patriote sans frontières 
Toujours dans mon élément sur terre

Quelle est cette guerre qui me guette ?
J'ai vendu mes armes, rendu mon âme en paix
C'est un autre qu'on perd
Et puis qu'on enterre

Quel est ce discours qui s'élève ?
Mon proche voisin n'a rien d'un congénère
C'est un autre qu'on blesse
Puis que l'on fait taire

Elémentaire, déserteur populaire 
Jamais dans mon élément sur terre",Elémentaire

Aucun revers
Les yeux lavés

J'ai tout oublié
Le sens des armes
Le goût des larmes
Trop de choix désarment
Et certaines armes ne laissent pas le choix

Même sans mémoire certains souvenirs survivent
Gommés de l'histoire, on sait les retenir
Au fond de soi
Un son, une voix

Ce qu'on m'a pris, ce qu'on m'a donné
Des coups, des trophées

Something in the way you run
Tells me you're right
When you slow down
Ooh, why don't you come out ?
Something in the way you hide
Tells me you're wrong

Des conquêtes, des chantiers
Lorsqu'on n'a plus rien dans les bras
Il faut pouvoir tout lâcher

On regarde autour de soi
On se dit que le jardin a changé
Que le vieux saule n'est plus là
Et que l'herbe a trop poussé

Il est fini le temps des cascades
Des rafales, des cavales
Lorsqu'on n'a plus rien dans les bras
II faut savoir tout lâcher

Et soudain je n'ai plus froid
Car la lumiere est entrée

Il faut pouvoir continuer",Tout Entier

Aprende depressa a chamar-te de realidade
Porque és o avesso do avesso do avesso do avesso

Do povo oprimido nas filas, nas vilas, favelas
Da força da grana que ergue e destrói coisas belas
Da feia fumaça que sobe, apagando as estrelas

Tuas oficinas de florestas, teus deuses da chuva

Eu vivia vestido de dourado
Palhaço das perdidas ilusões

Cheio dos guizos falsos de alegria
Andei cantando a minha fantasia
Entre aplausos febris dos corações em
Meu barração lá no morro do Salgueiro

Tinha o cantar alegre de um viveiro
Foste a sonoridade que apagou
E hoje, quando do sol, a claridade
Forra o meu barracão, sinto saudade

Da mulher pomba-rola que voou
Nossas roupas comuns dependuradas
Na corda, qual bandeiras agitadas
Pareciam um estranho festival

Festa dos nossos trapos coloridos
A mostrar que nos morros mal vestidos
É sempre feriado nacional
A porta do barraco era sem trinco
Mas a lua, furando o nosso zinco

Salpicava de estrelas o nosso chão
Tu pisavas os astros distraída
Sem saber que a ventura desta vida
É a cabrocha, o luar e o violão

Quando anoiteceu
Nenhuma luz na nossa casa se acendeu
Aonde você estava?
Aonde estava eu?
Se tudo parecia nada
Ainda assim
O nada era mais do que o que
Você deixou no fim
Quando aconteceu

Quando algo em que a gente acreditava
Se perdeu
Por onde você andava?
Por que não me socorreu?
Não é o fim do mundo é só o fim de tudo

Também trocou de sexo e de Deus

You ought to get some sleep
Get you instructions, follow directions,
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day,

They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace,
The burning keeps me alive

You could make me believe by the fall of your eyes

That love was such a killing thing

I keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be

Share a handshake and a tender tear or two)
But it's always good luck how we got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my randezvous

Though I drift through town and city I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home

All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone
(I'm just driftwood on the river and I'm drifting on
Till this weary river meets the deep blue sea)
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes the careless one who has forgotten me
In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regret

""I miss you so much,"" it went on

And mom we will carry them through

As I sit in jail and hang my head in shame 
With a smile I try to greet each early dawning
But they've given me a number for my name 

Many a little raindrops are falling close to me 
Makes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can be 
It's raining, raining, raining here this morning 
As the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

How I wish that I could see my little darling 
And hold her in my arms just as before 
I used to tell her every day I loved her 
But now she doesn't love me anymore 

She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime 
And said that she'd be waiting there for me 
But she has found somewhere else to wander 
Where the Mississippi flows on to the sea 

Its raining, raining, raining here this morning 
And I am just as weary as can be 
I wish that I could follow all the raindrops 
Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea

So I will have to suffer all the shame 
Go and tell her for me little raindrops

Eve and Adam had a garden everything was great
Until one day a boy says ""Pardon Miss my name is Snake
See that apple over yonder if you'll take a bite
You and Adam both are bound to have some fun tonight""

It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it, you don't wanna waste it

The Lord had said in the beginning, ""Everything is free
'Cept that apple that leads to sinning so let that apple be""
But Eve got tempted so she tried it and as chicks can do
Teaser her man till he decided he'd just try some too

Go on and eat forbidden fruit

It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and bite it, I bet you'd be delighted

I hate to tell you all what followed the Lord was most upset
Saw them making love and hollered, ""What have you to add""
And when they made a full confession the Lord said ""Well I see
I'll just have to teach you a lesson about not minding me""

Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit

The Lord made Eve be Adam's madam have his kids and all
Placed some labor laws on Adam and he made the snake to fall
Ever since the days of Eden this world's been sinful my
Nowadays they're even eating apples in their pie

La la la la la la la la la la, cómo
Cómo, la noche

(Esa carta desgraciada)
(Puño y letra de mi amada)
Mujer que ingratitud
Mujer, que padecer, mujer

Mira eso lo sabes tu, pero tenerte
A mi lado es como cargar una cruz
(Esa carta desgraciada)
(Puño y letra de mi amada)

Cómo
Denme claridad que voy
A leer la carta que me dejo sin luz
Vente mamita linda
Quiero saber si eres tu

Gózalo, sabroso
La grúa, la grúa
Sabroso

Esa carta que tengo en mis manos
(Esa carta de mi amada)
La tiro, yo la tengo guardada
Que casi no se ve nada
Ya casi no se ve nada

(Esa carta de mi amada)
Quiero tener a mi lado a mi amada
Quiero tenerla abrazada
(Esa carta de mi amada)

Junto, junto, junto, junto
Con esa carta desgraciada
Que me ha dicho tantas cosas
(Esa carta de mi amada)

Pero que no entiendo nada
Y esa carta desagraciada
Jajajaja

Oscar D'León,"O le canto a la luna
Yo le canto a las flores
Le canto a las estrellas
Le canto a los amores

Yo le canto a los sueños
¡Ay! Cuando digo tu nombre

¡Cómo!

Esta canción no será bonita
Esta canción no estará bien hecha
Esta canción no estará en la radio
Esta canción no me hará una estrella

Esta canción no tendrá armonía
Ni melodía ni buena letra
Ni un estribillo de esos que rompen
Pero la canto porque me llena

Porque no parte los corazones
Porque no pide a nadie que vuelva
Y se compuso con mucha guasa
Está compuesta pa' los que sueñan

Y yo la canto y la canto
La sigo cantando cuando estoy sereno
Cuando estoy borracho

Y yo la canto y la canto
La sigo cantando cuando yo me acuesto
Cuando me levanto

Esta canción no llora por nadie
Esta canción no tiene poema
A lo mejor no andará en tu coche
Pero la canto porque me llena

Esta canción no dice, ""Te quiero""
Y nadie va a cortarse las venas
Esta canción habla muy poquito
Y dice más de lo que aparenta

De esta canción no se harán canciones
Esta canción no estará en baratas
Esta canción no será tu agosto
¡Cuanto lo siento Sr. Pirata!

Oscar D'León,"Se ha retrasado más de una hora
¿Qué pasará que no llega?
Y los deseos de tenerla cerca
Hacen más larga la espera

El tiempo corre y no aparece
¿Habrá olvidado la fecha?
Ya son las 12 y me voy a casa
A organizar mi cabeza

¡Te esperé! nunca llegaste
¿Que pasó? De la cita te olvidaste
Me fallaste

Por segunda vez
No me busques, no me llames
Porque no te quiero ver

Yo tan seguro de que vendría
Ya había ordenado la cena
No imaginé que me haría lo mismo
Que idiota, confiando en ella

Tan preocupado por esa cinta
Y preparando su fiesta
No habrá motivos ni contratiempos
Que justifiquen su ausencia

Yo aquí muriendo por verte llegar
Y me pongo a llorar
Porque no te vi
Entro a ese lugar y allá

Me encuentro a Oscar
Me pongo a preguntar
Y a Oscar le pasa lo mismo que a mi

No sé si fue intencional
O será que de mi te quieres burlar
Otra vez que no llegaste

Pero ya no lo vuelvo a hacer
Pero ya no lo vuelvo a hacer
No confío más en ti

Me fallaste mujer
Otra vez que no llegaste, no puede ser
¡Pero soy feliz!

I want to lead you into Nature's hall

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's A Small Hotel

The mystery of their fading light
That shines upon our Caravan
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep
Across the sands so I may keep

This is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms
You beside me here beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert Caravan

Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you

I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light

Oscar Peterson,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.

My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Oscar Peterson,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours

Once I had a man and he was right for me

He called me baby

He said, ""Baby can't you see?""
""Baby understand?""
""Baby you're for me""
""Oh won't you take my hand?""

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

when you knew, knew I build my world around you
I knew I had those feelings and I didn't want it to be

It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight. 
For we're together, the moon is new, 
And oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight! 

What appeals to me 
Is just your charm and dignity,
Not what you wear, 
But just an air, of great repose. 
You are quite perfect from your head down to your toes 
Both night and day, 
I am moved to say. 

Lovely to look at, 
Delightful to know and heaven to kiss. 
A combination like this, 
Is quite my most impossible scheme come true,

Oscar Peterson,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

She loved him though he was cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
And he showed her how to kick the gong around

She had a dream about the king of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with p-platinum wheels

He gave her his townhouse and his racin' horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them all a million times

Oscar Peterson,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

Tearing my fear apart,

And miss it each night and day

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for

Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Oscar Peterson,"Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side

I get so lonesome, I get blue

It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone

Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June
Are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you

Heaven and earth
Are you to give me
And when your youth and joy
Invade my soul
And fill my heart

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, could there be lips like yours

Oscar Peterson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Oscar Peterson,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?

We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

Oscar Peterson,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
