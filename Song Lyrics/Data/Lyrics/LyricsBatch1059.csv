Nelson Riddle,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

It's phony it's plain to see
How happy I would be
If you believed in me",It's Only a Paper Moon
Nelson Riddle,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa.",Mona Lisa
Nelson Riddle,"Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend

Remember, anyone can dream
And nothing's bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got
Could be a lot if you pretend

You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine; it can be yours, my friend
So, why don't you pretend?

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine; it can be yours, my friend
So, why don't you pretend?",Pretend
Nelson Riddle,"The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, ""Now, listen, Jack
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top""
The buzzard told the monkey, ""You're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free""
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
""Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie""
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top",Straighten Up and Fly Right
Nelson Riddle,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""

When I marry sweet Lorraine",Sweet Lorraine
Nelson Riddle,"It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought of it 'bout the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So goodbye, dear, and Amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

Just one of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

But it was just, just one of those things",Just One of Those Things [From Can Can]
Nelson Riddle,"Oh, the snot has caked against my pants
It has turned into crystal
There's a bluebird sitting on a branch
I guess I'll take my pistol
I've got it in my hand
Because he's on my land

And so the story ended
Do you know it oh so well
Well should you need I'll tell you
The end-end-end-end-end-end-end-end
And

Yes I've seen you sitting on the couch
I recognize your artillery
I have seen you many times before
Once when I was an Indian
And I was on my land
Why can't you understand

Served my time
Served it well
You made my soul

Write the rules
In the sky
But ask your leaders
Why why

Oh, the snot has caked against my pants
It has turned into crystal
There's a bluebird sitting on a branch
I guess I'll take my pistol
I've got it in my hand
Because he's on my land

And so the story ended
Do you know it oh so well
Well should you need I'll tell you
The end-end-end-end-end-end-end-end
And

Served my time
Served it well
You made my soul",Live and Let Live [From Can Can]
Nelson Riddle,"There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
The corn is as high as an elephants eye,
An' it looks like it's climbing clear up in the sky.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the cattle are standin' like statues,
All the cattle are standin' like statues,
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.","Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin' [From Oklahoma!]"
Nelson Riddle,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love [From Oklahoma!]
Nelson Riddle,"You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me?

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
Cause you do something to me
That nobody else could do

You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You got the power to hypnotize me?

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
Cause you do something to me
That nobody else can do
That no one else in the world can do",You Do Something to Me [From Can Can]
Nelson Riddle,"When you were very young, the world was younger than you
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky
Above the ring you loved so well
Now the young world has grown old, gone are the silver and gold

Sit there and count your fingers, what can you do
Old girl, you're through
Just sit there and count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on are the raindrops 
That fall on little girl blue
No use, old girl, you might as well surrender
Your hopes are getting slender, why won't somebody send a tender
Blue boy to cheer up little girl blue",Little Girl Blue
Nelson Riddle,"This can't be love because I feel so well
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
This can't be love, I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the skies

My heart does not stand still, just hear it beat
This is too sweet to be love
This can't be love because I feel so well
But still I love to look in your eyes, oh yeah

My heart does not stand still, just hear it beat
Oh, it's too sweet to be love
This can't be love because I feel so well
But still I love to look in your eyes
But still I love to look in your eyes",This Can't Be Love
Nelson Riddle,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream
Nelson Riddle,"The moon was all aglow
But heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

The stars all seemed to know
You didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears
I sigh but there's no regretting
In spite of my tears

Who wouldn't believe those lips
Who wouldn't believe those eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears
I sigh but there's no regretting
In spite of my tears

The Devil was in your heart
But Heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies
Those lies
Teeny-weeny little white lies",Little White Lies
Nelson Riddle,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All
Nelson Riddle,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Nelson Riddle,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

Nelson Riddle,"Hear my voice where you are
Take a train, steal a car
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me
Catch a plane, catch a breeze
On your hands, on your knees
Swim or fly, only please, come back to me
On a mule, in a jet
With your hair in a net
In a towel wringing wet
I don't care, this is where you should be
From the hills, from the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the highway to dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world, only just come back to me
Blast your hide, hear me call
Must I fight City Hall
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me
What on Earth must I do
Scream and yell till I'm blue
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon
Or to wreck and to ruin
Mademoiselle, where in Hell can you be?
Leave a sign on your door
Out to lunch ever more
In a Royce or a van, wrapped in mink or Saran
Anyway that you can, come back to me
Hear my voice through the din
Feel the waves on your skin
Like a call from within, come back to me
Leave behind all your own
Tell your flowers you will phone
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me
Let your tub overflow
If a date waits below
Let him wait for Godot
Come by rail,
Come by mail, COD
Par avion, par bateau
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux
Come by steam, come by gas
Call for free on a pass
On the drags and the glass, come back to me
Leave your bills all unpaid
Let your bed go unmade
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me
Come by sail, come by freight
In a box or a tray, keep your head on the plate
I don't care this is where you should be
Come in pain or in joy
As a girl, as a boy
In a bag or a trunk (Shut up!)
On a horse or a drunk
In the flora or faun, come back to me
Come back to me, come back

Nelson Riddle,"There may be trouble ahead,
But while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Before the fiddlers have fled,
Before they ask us to pay the bill,
And while we still have that chance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Soon, we'll be without the moon,
Humming a different tune, and then, 
There may be teardrops to shed,
So while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.

Nelson Riddle,"Last night I had a dream of you,
My heart began to cry,
I saw you kissing someone new,
But dreams can tell a lie.

The moon was bright,
He held you tight,
I heard you softly sigh.
Two silhouettes were swaying,
What words were you saying?
No wonder I've been praying
That dreams can tell a lie!

For where there's smoke you'll find a fire,
And in my dreams I saw the gleam of your desire!

Tonight we'll meet along the street
And all my fears will fly,
Your loving arms will hold me,
And as they enfold me,
Your kiss will soon have told me
That dreams can tell a lie.

Right then, at the start

Just a brief romance

Seeing you alone
With the moonlight above
Then I touch your hand

I kiss you

Oh, me and my baby are Goin' Steady,
We ain't married but we're gettin' ready

Now that I've found her I'm gonna keep her;
Finders keepers, losers weepers,
She's my baby, she's Goin' Steady with me.
Well, I've been honky tonkin' 'round
Nearly all my life, 
But now I've got a steady babe 
And I'm gonna make her my wife.
All you Rovin' Ramblers can leave her alone!
Don't even try to date her on the phone!
'Cause she's my baby, she's Goin' Steady with me.
 
Well, now, sweet baby, that we're Goin' Steady,
I'll pull up and ask your daddy 
What he thinks, if you and I are wed.
'Cause I love you and you love me,
We're both as happy as we can be, 
And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me.
We'll get the ring, then be on our way
To see the preacher man,
And when I say: ""I do, sweetheart!""
I'll slip the ring on your lovin' hand

I'll be yours and you'll be mine,

It was 1-9-8-6
I had the crack in the mix
Makin my propers, gettin paid, stackin a grip
From 20's to bitches, from haps to hoes
On the corner pushin boulders, livin way too bold
My bank roll start gettin hecka big
Then a snitchin rat bitch cold turned me in
Went and bit my lip, got swoll' and shit
Now it's 1995, I be tellin the tip
Some brothers is dyin, some brothers gettin rich
Callin theyself 9-5 crack dealer pimp
Ain't that a trip, that's how I thought, fool
Lookin at these young bucks I see myself, dude
But they don't hear you though
I'm tryin to tell em so
When you're broke as a joke, player, you can sell dope
Puttin your life on the line, you gets no hoe
All because you want to be the man sellin kilos

If he bangin, hangin, or tryin to come up
Got that lleyo when he pumps it for the fiends to smoke
Cause he really ain't down with bein broke
He does it on the under, and teach young fools
Don't want the spot hot, player, keep it on the cool
He takes no losses, avoids all snitches
Cause life ain't nothin but money, fuck bitches
And when you cross the gate he never hesitates
He'll hook you up straight, cause he always got weight
Bodyguards watch his back, he watch them too
Cause if they catch him slippin, they'll jump this fool
And though he makes his money from fools gettin high
He's doin what he's doin tryin to get by
Cause a pusher's got a purpose, the pusher's got a plan
He's king of the kilo, but the pusher is a man

I know you know the subject
So all you bustas get checked
Pusherman's a hustler that you gotta respect
He likes nice cars, and lots of guns
Saves 50's, 100's and burns the 1's
He's large, no doubt, that's what it's all about
And when he's high-sidin, can't keep playa out his mouth
Say that dope is his thang, and he does it the best
But at night he tried to sleep, but could not rest
So he centered his life around all that crack
And had two bodyguards watchin his back
Got his crew together and didn't waste no time
Till some sucker-ass nigga straight dropped the dime
And told the feds everything he knew
About the pusherman and his so-called crew
They say what goes up, will take a nose dive
The pusherman didn't make it to see '95

Meine ganzen Indianerkleider einfach her

Da bleiben sie, es sei denn du entscheidest
Dass du dich dem Leben stellst auch wenn du leidest

Bist du doch mit Worten viel zu weit gegangen
Lachen hilft und das kannst du von dir verlangen
Wozu die Last, die du auf deinen Schultern trägst

Du weißt nicht ob du morgen noch lebst

Ob du deinen Garten öffnest oder schliesst

Nimm dich nicht so ernst mit deinen Sorgen
Zauber dir ein Lächeln ins Gesicht
Geh mit dir in einen neuen Morgen
Umarm dich selbst und such nach deinem Licht

Du leidest mehr
Als die, die du nicht magst
Sei lieb mit dir
Pass auf wonach du fragst

Apreció mucho mi vida también a mi compadre mayo
Si vino hablar de negocios usted diga en donde empezamos
Tengo barcos atuneros, submarinos también aeroplanos

No soy bueno pa' las despedidas

Pero intacta quedo su alma
Era jefe en las decisiones
Y un ejemplo en la familia
En las juntas y reuniones

With his hands in his pockets and his crocadile feet
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
At the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Tell it like it is. Check out this DJ

So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race

At the wrong time and in the wrong place
You turned around and said ""I'm all shook up""

You're lying, you're lying, you're never satisfied

Hard, hard you think you're so hard
If you meant what you did it wouldn't been half as bad

You took my man and didn't mean it
But you did it to hurt my feelings
What I should do is slap you in your face
You left me here with a pain below my waste

You lose a guy you move into the larder
You got no style, why don't you try a little harder
Chocolates, bananas, doughnuts and salami
Ain't gonna fit cause you're full of bologna

And then strike back, that isn't where I'm at

You're like one of those cabbage patch creatures

By now you'd be dead meat

Everybody knows you're a phoney
You just want his alimoney

With a puddle of misunderstanding like a sea between us.

When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago.

Come rain, come shine, I'm leaving this love ghetto.
Come rain, come shine, I'm leaving this love ghetto.

Chasing you is haunting me, but I know that girl is lying.
You upset my chemistry.
Baby I'm sick of crying,
Forever is only like the sky and the sea between us.
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago.
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago.

Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto.
Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto.
I can't see a way everyday we are the same
Turning 'round and 'round I pick you up and then you let me down
Never will I blame, never will I hate
I'll just have to go saving you from saving me.

Your girlfriend is on another date with the hero in your dream
Turn around, ask yourself. So, you think you're gonna win this time Manchild? 
Is it the pain of the drinking
Or the Sunday sinking feeling
The car never seems to work
When it's late your girlfriend's on a date
And the hero with her in your dream
In your sleep it seemed to like you
Turn around and ask yourself
Turn around ask yourself 

Manchild, will you ever win
Manchild, look at the state you're in 
Could you go undercover
And sell your brand new lover (could you)
Be someone else for a night
Maybe someone else will love you
You sell your soul for a tacky song

Accentuate the positive and give some illustration
See Manchild, you're no one, you turn the microphone on
Control communication when I'm kickin' it and so on
To the point that I need, the air that I breathe
Into an audience that's waiting and ecstatic to receive-
For the meantime another mean rhyme, I keep on sayin' it
I know what the time is the crowd will keep playing it
Through the speaker boxes loud's my diagnosis
'Cause I believe in miracles and words in heavy doses.

Just believe that all you need is the air that you breathe.

Manchild, look at the state you're in
Manchild, he will make you cry

He's the apple of your eye 
Once bitten twice shy, why don't you bite me again
Just take it in the right and go tell your friend
Are you ready for the words I turn the microphone on
A figure of speech to reach you at the back and so on

What am I gonna do when the night is through?
I got an obsession and you know that's you
Pumping in my body, driving me crazy
In a dry land you're like an oasis
Making me hot, making me lazy, you amaze me.

So you be the train and I'll be the track
You turn me into a mono maniac
There ain't no stopping me when I go off

I don't show off, I need to cool off

So why don't you stop phoney ladies in my face to cramp my freedom,
Phoney ladies that mess me up, calling names to cramp my freedom

Nobody's gonna grab my freedom, nobody's gonna mess me up.

Neneh Cherry,"I can see this picture of myself
In a green dress I felt lost
The first time I went to school
I was 4 feet 2, 6 feet scared and so distressed
This dress was green, I was the best dressed
I'd ever been, first day at school
I said teacher teacher I know my ABC's
I want to read and write, I want to understand
Why the sky never ends and why the sky is blue
And not white - right
But when I spoke my heart broke
'Cause it was plain to see that school
Would never be the picture for my fantasy

I know where I'm going and where I'm coming from
So here I come, so here I come
I know where I'm going and where I'm coming from
So here I come, so here I come

Slowly I came to discover
Time, heals, time feels so young
When you're having fun
At 13 my kiss was sweet and not deep
Covered in blush kiss 'n tell
My lips were deep red and shiny as hell
In my stairwell kiss ""n"" love discovered me
Undercover my fantasy my first kiss hit and miss
He wasn't impressed 'cause I wouldn't get undressed
Wrote my name on the wall - my hair was pressed
He had blue balls

If you want to rock you've got to roll it
If you gonna live you've got to show it
And if you're gonna do it, you got to do it right - don't you know it

I know where I'm going and where I'm coming from
So here I come, so here I come
I know where I'm going and where I'm coming from
So here I come, so here I come

On the rooftops I seen panties drop
And through the windows behind the screens
In the red light after a fight love was made
Love was saved

I might have been lost but now I'm found
I got my two feet on the ground

So here I come, so here I come
I know where I'm going and where I'm coming from
So here I come, so here I come

",So Here I Come
Neneh Cherry,"I'm just another voice from the street,
And since it's my choice, I feel that I must speak.
Now I know that you won't listen to little me,
But I can't rest unless I get this off my chest.
See the city's my home, the streets where I roam,
But still I leave the drugs and violence alone.

And so I try to stay in the right frame of mind,
Although I know some people who might say that I'm
Crazy and lazy for not breakin' out,
But the city has soul and that's what I'm about.

I have an appetite that must be fed,
No longer blind and being led.
The type of freedom that you can buy,
My bank won't lend me yet.
But still I can get by, and even smile.
So don't judge me by the colour of my skin;
My blood runs as deep as your runs red,
Which takes me out of the rap.

[Chorus]
The choice is mine,
With my joy and pain inside,
And I ain't gone under yet!

See bodies with souls living in the street.
No one wants to live with nothing to eat,
But to climb over living people and feel 
That they brought it on themselves 'cause 
They lazy or would rather steal is a mystery.

So don't judge me by the colour of my skin;
My blood runs as deep as your runs red,
Which takes me out of the verse.

[Chorus]

Your under is my over; I've never seen your over yet,
But don't forget
I ain't gone under yet! 

Your under is my over; I've never seen your over yet,
But don't forget
I ain't gone under yet! 

Your under is my over; I've never seen your over yet,
But don't forget
I ain't gone under yet! 

Your under is my over; I've never seen your over yet,
But don't forget
I ain't gone under yet! 

I don't steal, I don't run tricks or scams,
'Cause I'm a strong young woman; yes I know who I am.
But sometimes it's so hard to get by,
Tough circumstances make me want to get high.
But I don't go too far 'cause that ain't my style,
So why don't you come live next to me for a while?",I Ain't Gone Under Yet
Neneh Cherry,"I've got a little piece of mind

Nothing in this time is done
With peace in mind
So I claim a piece of this world
To get peace in mind from

That left me colorblind
So I'm taking daily bread and wine
To keep me cool inside

I had a home
Inside of me

Acoustic
Acoustic loneliness

I knew a young girl by the name of Suzie
Now she sleeps with her arm on a Uzi
Cause she sleeps giving up what she's got for free
Acoustically trained in love
She talks in mono monologues

They have all just past away
They slip through my fingers
Now their all
Just history

By the store lays your mountain bike.
You on the floor still looking hardcore.
The colour is red under my shoe,
And the friend is gone who put a hole
In you.

Insensitivity took a hold of me,
And I felt it colour me blue inside,
And I left taking a part of you.
Like red, red paint on the sole
Of my shoe, nothing to do with
Common sense or...

Sensitivity. I'm feeling cold
Like concrete.
Your dignity's reflecting
In the way I feel it.

Open minded.  The thoughts are clear
From feeling, regardless.  
Heart beats with pain.
You were oh so happy just the other day;
Now heartbeats with pain took it all away.

The cradle did rock for you too.
Looking out from the inside,
While life turns to blue.
Watching all the glass faces
Leave their red, red footprints
On our...

Takes you away, I'm on my way home.

I must have dreamt myself astray.
The only milkyway I have is in the middle of the day.

Good Sundays are better than somedays;
Today I'd even take a bad Monday.

Return on days like this,

You know you've got to feel it
Feel it over you, under you

Talking to your little sister now
Tell her how you turned to liquid love
Don't get beaten by the tide, boy
You've got so much to give of yourself

Some of the things you said
Been living in your head you know
And what you feel are just trade marks of your suffering
But you're looking for a reason for everything
'Coz you know that there has to be something in

Every little thing that you're
Feeling, feeling, feeling, over you

Voices on your shoulder
Pounding in your temple
Like a bullet in your head
Waiting for release

Your simplistic measures
Your holistic treasures
What you want and what you need
What you feel in your dreams

Been around and fought a lot of wars
Before you could walk, yeah
But then again you walked
A lot of miles before you could talk
And now you know that you feel it

What you gonna, ohh
Can you, can you feel it, feel it, feel it over you? Ohh
Can you, can you feel it, feel it, feel it over you?
Can you, can you feel it, feel it, feel it over you?

I saw you somewhere farther down,
Did I expect it?

Now I'm overcome with fear
Mama get me out of here
I've gone farther down than I ever wanna go.

To the city sky-lights
In a faded aspiration only left in our minds
Let us shake up the system,
Lets go and rattle their frames
Lets take the highest road away and avoid these trappings

And your eyes, they ate my soul
Begged me to come back down,
they begged me to come back down
Then the ground ate my legs, so I looked up to the sky and said
I don't wanna go back down
Oh Ive been so far down
Heaven help me, heaven help me for the way I've been.

Singing to the voices in the halls
Every time we drive the coast
Heaven, all Las Vegas in your car

Playing on your broken speakers
Me asleep and warm inside your arms

Maybe it's just never really was

But every night when I get home
I can hear your voices in the halls

That you once played for me
It had all the right chords
And a sweet melody
It was back when we started

And it’s all because we’re through

And do you still sing alone
When you’re all by yourself
Or do you switch to the next one
Sing for somebody else
When you’re cold don’t forget
How this song kept us warm
You would dance on my bed
I would lay in your arms

Workin' at the pretzel station at the mall
Beautiful lips like Strawberry Quick

I won't be surprised if you don't call me tonight

Don't you think its time you tried a different kind of guy

How can even make you understand
When I'm wearing the pants with the elastic waistband oh no
Saw you on the bus laughing with your pretty friends
I was in back with the retarded kids
Tried to say hello at the high school dance
Then I wet my pants

Neri Per Caso,"E' un'incognita ogni sera mia...
Un'attesa, pari a un'agonia. Troppe volte vorrei dirti: no
E poi ti vedo e tanta forza non ce l'ho
Il mio cuore si ribella a te, ma il mio corpo no
Le mani tue, strumenti su di me,
che dirigi da maestro esperto quale sei...

E vieni a casa mia, quando vuoi, nelle notti piu' che mai,
dormi qui, te ne vai, sono sempre fatti tuoi.
Tanto sai che quassu' male che ti vada avrai
tutta me, se ti andra' per una notte...
... E cresce sempre piu' la solitudine,
nei grandi vuoti che mi lasci tu!

Rinnegare una passione no,
ma non posso dirti sempre si' e sentirmi piccola cosi'
tutte le volte che mi trovo qui di fronte a te.
Troppo cara la felicita' per la mia ingenuita'.
Continuo ad aspettarti nelle sere per elemosinare amore...

So - no sempre tua, quando vuoi, nelle notti piu' che mai,
dormi qui, te ne vai, sono sempre fatti tuoi.
Tanto sai che quassu' male che ti vada avrai
tutta me, se ti andra', per una notte... sono tua...
... la notte a casa mia, sono tua, sono mille volte tua...

E la vita sta passando su noi, di orizzonti non ne vedo mai!
Ne approfitta il tempo e ruba come hai fatto tu,
il resto di una gioventu' che ormai non ho piÃ¹...
E continuo sulla stessa via, sempre ubriaca di malinconia,
ora ammetto che la colpa forse e' solo mia,
avrei dovuto perderti, invece ti ho cercato.

And I spent the day in a sidewalk café writing
I wrote thirty postcards all to you and every one said
'Having a good time, wish you were here'

I was supposed to meet Maria, but we got our signal crossed
So I walked along the Rive Gauche multiplying
I bought raspberries and the Daily News
And something to take home to make you happy
I hope it works, it'll have to

And I dreamed last night
Of how the moonlight shines in your old room
And the fight that put me on this flight that brought me here
With no one to talk to

I took myself to the cinema and mostly closed my eyes
But every now and then I paid attention
And every now and then there was a word I understood
I got the joke and that's enough for today

And the fight that put me on this flight that brought me here

Keep your soul

All content seen in context, it just reflects
When the beat pulses the system

Once again another set from the S.A.B.R.E
Headphones set alight from the heat we supply
Voltage on high elements elevate to the sky
Derive the means like slim
But never shady on premier
Cultivating, Navigating, air raiding through sound layers
Debutant when first dropping beats elevating vinyl cuts
You didn't see it coming till the force pressured motion to bust
Raw facts, True essence don't echo through all raps
We need to counteract bringing them soul claps
Ignite roots connection, Express new projections
Innovative, Creative styles in which were blessed with.

Nesli,"E se non trovarsi mai vuol dire perdersi
Io ho perso tutto e mi ripeto ancora ""vai""
Sono il buio fuori la luce
In mezzo all'odio fuori la voce
Chi ti ha insegnato a voler bene portalo nel cuore
Chi ti ha voluto sempre bene adesso sta altrove
La mia penna allevia la mia pena
Inseparabile da me appena

Via, via da qui, va così
Questa vita dice no, poi di si
Poi però, poi non so
Quindi vai, senza dai, senza ma
Senza rinunciare mai
Non lo sai come andrà
Se alla fine non lo fai

E che dirai davanti a lei
Davanti ai guai
Davanti ai mai
Davanti ai tuoi hai messo
La vita per te stesso
E ora lo sai che cosa sei
Più simile alla natura
Impassibile a ciò che non dura
Possibile come un uomo che vola
Che storia quella che vedi
Per ogni persona in gloria
Quello in cui credi impressiona
Per ogni parola vera
In un posto un sogno si avvera
Un'ora o una vita intera
Un'ora o una vita intera

Via, via da qui, va così

Poi però, poi non so

Nesli,"Do retta al tuo cuore, ti lascerò andare
Ma poi non tornare perché fa più male
Do retta al cammino, restarti vicino
O correre lontano andando verso il mio destino

Do retta al tempo che tutto lava
Che fa sbiadire quanto mi amava
Quanto mi odiava, do retta a questo
Alla prigione che ogni giorno costruisco
Senza catene addosso è solo il bene che ora posso esprimere
E ridere perché ho imparato solo adesso a vivere

C'est pour les balafrés du faciès, scarface
Ici pas de scène de liesses
Dans le maquis personne acquiesce

Une pluie de bastos le jour de ton mariage
Poussière d'empire, je suis prêt pour le grand pillage
Huit mois dans la jungle, c'est fini les copinages

On s'entretue aujourd'hui, on vit une époque de bâtards
Y'a plus de gares-ba, une bastos t'envoie au sbetare
La rotba du 11.43, interminable cauchemar
Ensemble, on a péta nos premières 103
Mon premier cost-la, portable Motorola
Ma première gova, premier grossiste un byle-ka
On bicrave le chocolat, la savonnette chez Milka
Sans le savoir, on est tombé dans le piège
Y'a plus d'innocence dans nos yeux, elle est loin l'époque du collège
On crève la dalle sous le hall on veut les mêmes privilèges
Sur un siège éjectable, la météo annonce la neige
On l'a pas vu venir, ce nuage de poisse
Millionnaire on va le devenir, ensanglantées seront les liasses
Et on va se faire la guerre pour une place
Hier encore t'étais mon frère, l'terrain rend fou
Même ma mère tu la menaces

Hey te rappelles-tu quand on était frères?
Ensemble on rêvait d'avoir le monde
Aujourd'hui on se fait la guerre
On se tire dessus, que Dieu nous pardonne

Où on était ensemble, toi et moi contre le monde?

Hey aujourd'hui on se fait la guerre

Ta mère m'appelle ""mon fils"", ma mère t'appelle ""mon fils""
Et aujourd'hui les balles qu'on s'envoie ne sont pas les mêmes que Gaël Monfils
Stringer et Avon, c'était toi et moi
Mais la rue est une tronçonneuse qui sépare les frères siamois
On a vécu le pire ensemble, on rêvait d'empire ensemble
Réduit ces pitres en cendres, mit le biz enceinte
Les 400 coups, on les faisait à deux
On se faisait la guerre des boutons, aujourd'hui on se fait la guerre du feu
Putain de sale époque, les valeurs n'ont plus la côte
La dalle bouffe ton auréole et le cœur de ton meilleur pote
On s'essouffle que pour ce qui rapporte
Sous alcool et drogue on paranoïe à chaque partage de la récolte
Un cul débarque et tout part en couille
Les dossiers qu'elles portent te foutent la honte, donc tu parles en douille
Les embrouilles s'accumulent, on les règle sous la lune
La rue nous a éteint frangin, voilà pourquoi on s'allume

Entrer dans le milieu, c'est plus marrant que d'en sortir
Les camés suivent la came, parsemé de cadavres sera mon empire
Ralentir, la concurrence attend que je tombe pour m'anéantir
Plus de sentiments dans le coeur, j'ai transformé la rue en stand de tir

Regarde-toi t'as plus de valeurs, plus de principes
Tu niques le biz, tu réfléchis qu'avec le slip, t'es devenu un parasite
Tu ne remplis plus les poches mais les cimetières
T'as mis des pétales de chrysanthèmes sous les pieds de nos mères

Sur la table, on pose le salaire de nos mères en bouteilles
On prend de la bouteille, kheye on fait de l'oseille
Les ennemis, ils viennent de partout et même du ciel
Kheye, entre nous plus rien ne sera jamais pareil

Kheye, j'regrette le temps où on était frères
Kheye, le temps où on rêvait ensemble de se faire la belle
Kheye, la rue a enterré vivants nos rêves de gosses
Kheye, aujourd'hui on se parle qu'à travers nos crosses, kheye

So you say you've tried but just can't find the measure
People around you are giving you pressure
Try to resist, all the bad things all around you
If you taste them, they will haunt you
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah, get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
What ya, what ya, what ya, what ya know?
Watch all the stars, they lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can. I know we can, I know we can, I know we can

Not even a text to eat lunch
Maybe they'll check after a couple months

Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading

Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile
We could close the door and sleep all day
It's a September sky with pretty pictures in my mind
That's lost its feeling of so afraid

It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading

Grown sleepy now as the rain falls
As children draped in flowers form a chain
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls
As night falls into dust and it's day again

I'm calling softly from the street
Always a lonely widow
Half awake and sleeping on my feet

No quarter phone booth calls to home 
Just late television
Inside my bedroom all alone

There is no use in waiting 
Offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings 
Etched in the middle of the night

Let me hear the rain tap on your street

Makes babies to breathe
With their hearts hanging open all over the sheets
As soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer

And with bees in her breath and the rest of her ringing
They'll sting through her chest with a force hard and beating
Till wonderfully wet she will get
Until she's soaked inside her clothes

And there is no sorry to be sorry for
For a roll around the floor some afternoon so sound and soft
It made her swallow all her sweat
With every bit of breath she coughs
And when the day it came to pour all her babies
All across the bathroom floor
She will be swimming in them all forever more",A Baby for Pree

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

Of a dead and hanging man 
Who was kissing foreign fishes 
That flew right out from this hands
And when I put my arms around him
I felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eeriness surrounded when his tongue began to speak
And he said...Oh boy you are so pretty
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string. 
And when I finally kissed him the whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over

And pretty girls and the burning men 
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays

Threw a nickel in a fountain 
To save my soul from all these troubled times 
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take 
To soothe my mind so I'm always sober
Always aching, always heading towards 
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country 
Finds a nice cliff to drop off 
Oh when this life just gets so grating 
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you
You're too wonderful to die

And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
When all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day

When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving
Any love worth living for
So I'll sleep out in the gutter

As it's reflecting off from you as it shines
You're in the bathroom carving holiday designs into yourself
Hoping no one will find you but they found you
And they took you and you somehow survived

So wake up and if the holidays don't hollow out your eyes
Then press yourself against whatever

Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun

Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again

With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart

And here is the room where your brothers were born

As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for

And this is the room

And from above you how I sank into your soul

While you and your mother were asleep in the trailer park

So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
And pluck all your silly strings and bend all your notes for me
Soft silly music is meaningful magical
The movements were beautiful all in your ovaries
All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
Smelling of semen all under the garden was all you were needing

But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flo'
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And to show you that I'm real

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me (oh my god, baby)
Dare I ask?

Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back

Return of the Mack

So, I'm back up in the game (hustling sound)
Running things to keep my swing (whole night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (oh, oh, oh)
So baby, listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

(Squah!) you lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me (oh my god, baby)
Dare I ask?
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack, there it is
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back

'Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
I had dreams of being up
And I ain't never leave you stuck (oh my god)
And you say you will never turn on me, baby, aye
You played me like a tournament, baby, aye
You know I gave you the best of me, baby
Oh man, I thought you were next to me, baby
I guess I gotta show you I am the one that you were with
That got you swerving in the whip
And putting diamonds on your wrists, baby
Still making hit after hit, baby
I bet you'll let me hit after this

You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack, yea
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again

Nevada Tan,"Ohne Licht auf dunklen Wegen ganz allein
Meine Umgebung w??chst

Zu viel getrunken und zu wenig gelacht
Nichts mehr gegessen und die N??chte durch gemacht
Warum blick ich nur auf, wenn's keiner sieht? 
Warum blick ich nur auf, wenn es dich nicht mehr gibt?

Eine neue Hoffnung
Ein erneutes Ende f??r mich
Wieder ein Kapitel
Doch meine Rolle stirbt f??r dich
Jetzt lass schon los, denn ich muss gehen! 

Bilder der Vergangenheit holen mich wieder ein
Tage und N??chte sehe ich dein Lachen und Weinen
Ziele der Vergangenheit zu Asche verfallen
Ziele meines Lebens sind abgebr??ht und kalt
Warum blick ich nur auf, wenn es keiner sieht? 
Warum blick ich nur auf, wenn es dich nicht mehr gibt?

Ich wusste immer es wird schwer sein allein zu sein
Nicht mehr mit dir vereint zu sein, man
Ich m??chte bei dir sein
Zu zweit wollt ich immer alle Wege beschreiten, doch
Jetzt steh ich mir im Weg, 
Verzweifelt allein dabei
Mein Spiegelbild anzuschreien
Kurz vorm heulen
Vor deinem Grabstein zusammenfallen
Es ist viel zu viel f??r mich
Deinen Totenschein in der Hand zu Halten
Ich bete darum
Dass du mich siehst und mich sp??rst
Versprich, dass du mir hilfst und mich ber??hrst!

Allein, ohne mit dem sch??nsten Menschen aller Zeiten

Nevada Tan,"I can't stand it
I always have to prove myself
Rules here, obligations there
Yeah sure
Am I just here to do whatever you say?
School, parents, state
I ask myself what's going on?

Now look into our classrooms- look into our eyes
Many say that the youth takes too much advantage
But we don't believe in your ideals
Do we want your initials printed on us?
Hmm wait! is that a trick question?

These days the world is spinning differently
The big question is- do u check it at all?
No matter what we say
We are running against walls
Because none of you sees what's up with us
Every day we get swamped
Drowned by lies
And quickly we know
We don't get anything for free

Always analyzed and errors mathematically uncovered

Never mirror our situation

Every pupil is dumb and is just hanging around

You are not like us
And you never will be
It's us alone that will be the winner
We even run through the walls without tailwind

In germany the revolution has begun
That's why we put the "" fuck you "" t-shirts on

To slow you down so we could find

A drama queen that just won't agree
I am just the accident

I'm terrified from all the things that it said
Hang glide from the most vivid dream

I shut down when I need to stand up
Crashing out when I'm supposed to wake up
Let's come down like we're coming of age
An inside joke that doesn't quite play

I want to float away into yesterday

I've got to step up
Can't you see I'm hanging by a thread
As I creep up, I'll float out
I have to find some peace in my head

I speak up, you say the time has come
Waiting for the answer on the tip of my tongue
So what, I'm just half at ease
Cynical screaming and laughing at me

I want to float away into yesterday

That we would stay together

I realize now more than before
That I'm for her and she's for me

And look me in the eyes and
Feel the same way as I do
I'm here all alone there's no one
Around but I'm being blinded
By the sound of her voice
Sitting here on the ground
I'm laughing out loud

I called a girl I barley knew
I only knew her by first name
I have probably been there
She lives on Penny Loafer Ln.

Laid it apart but I did not respond 
And you ask me what I am thinking of

No longer can we share the love that was never there
When the moon has lost its light
And the stars no longer bright 
And no longer can we share, the love that was never there

For the country I come from, is called the Midwest.
I was taught and brought up, to the laws to abide.
That the land that I live in,has God on its side.

Oh the history books tell it,they tell it so well.
The Calvaries charged,and the Indians fell.
The calvaries charged,and the Indians died.
Oh The Country was young then, with God on its side.

The Spanish-American, War had its day.
And the civil war to us, was soon laid away.
And the names of the heroes, I was made to memorize.
With guns in their hands, and God on their side.

The First World War,it came and it went.
And the reason for fighting,I never did get.
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride.
For you don't count the dead, when God's on your side.

In the nineteen-sixties,came the Vietnam war.
Can someone tell me, what we were fighting for?
So many young men died, so many mothers cried.
No I ask the question, was God on our side?

I learned to hate the russians, all through my whole life.
If another war comes, it's them must fight.
And to hate them and fear, to run and to hide.
And accept it all bravely, with God on my side.

Through many dark hours, I've been thinkin' bout' this.
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss.
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide. 
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.

Now that I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell.
The confusion I""m feeling, ain't no tongue cna tell.

That if God's on our side, he'll stop the next war.

Like the walls of Jericho, they will come tumbling down

While nearby an old man cries
Brother, can you, can you spare a dime?
Mother's feed their families words of hope
Keepin' faith in their fellow man
While they cope with rejection and despair

While the chance of living is going down
Though some may say things could get worse
Tell that to a hungry child or a dad without a job
When hungry homeless families become an angry mob

One man's pleasure is another man's pain
But the tables can turn
What goes around today comes back around tomorrow

She waits and she watches all night long
Calls to her lover then she sings this song

I will be there for you, whatever comes
I am as constant as the beat of a drum
My love is stronger than the noon day sun
Over Africa, over Africa

It's a force of nature, it's the power of need
It'll heal your baby, then make you bleed
I will be patient, I will bide my time
I will be waiting like a mama lion, mama lion

I will be there for you, whatever comes
I am as constant as the beat of a drum
My love is stronger than the noon day sun
Over Africa, over Africa, over Africa

See that love and money
Between quiet and sin
We are just wild things
Underneath the skin

In the cradle of creation
We were made this way
Run together
To our dying day
(Change rope)

It's the law of the jungle
It's the angst in trees
Built by your census baby
Die by the tomb

I'd walk through fire
I would swim the seas
As long as I live and breathe
You belong to me

I will be there for you, whatever comes
I am as constant as the beat of a drum
My love is stronger than the noon day sun
Over Africa, over Africa

Sento..
Dentro I tuoi silenzi le parole di un addio

L'odore della pioggia
Rivedo una partita
Che sto perdendo

Come contro il vento

There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray

New Blood Revival,"Diane I am hot
And I am cold and
Hard and swollen

Come relieve me
Kneel down beneath me
Tear me open and release me

I'm being taken
Half-way swallowed
Hair is up now
Cheeks are hollow

I feel lifted
She is gifted
My legs trembled
My hand's drifted
Behind her head
I think that I might be in love

She'll give in and 
She'll get on it 
Once she knows how bad I want it
And she'll turn herself around
My hands clamp tight around her shoulders
With one arm she'll push off the wall
And I'll bend that body over

I swear once I get up in her
She completely melts around me
She gets wetter than Seattle
Her lakes deep enough to drown me

Every man needs a Diane

I bit her bottom lip
She pulled my head down
Her stomach quivered
As I moved my tongue around

First the outside 
Around the edges
Below the belt now
Behind the hedges

Then the inside
I pull her open
One hand's positioned
The other hand's groping

A slender neckline
A heaving chest
Her thighs grip tighter
She tears at my flesh
I think that I might be in love

She'll give in and
She'll get on it
Once she knows how bad I want it
And when she starts to come around
I push her up against the wall
I can feel my insides tightening up
I can't feel my limbs at all

I ride her harder 'till she's caving in
My blood pumps through my veins
My heart beats against her back
And then I scream out ""What a shame!""

Every man can't have a Diane",The Lift

got her makeup on, bracelet on, and the heels make me wanna take that home
Should I take her to my room? Quick think.
I took her to my room, and we hit sinks, counters, dressers, sheets, stairs.
We got done, told her ""You can sleep here.""
The next day, I woke up at 12, at noon, I rolled over, and I screamed, ""Who the hell are you?""

And it's pretty obvious that you're kinda trippin', like
""Who the hell is this bitch lookin' a hot mess
What you fell for this chick""
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it
I'm like, ""you need to go somewhere else with this shit
Because I ain't gon' put up wit you
Talkin' bout how she make you uncomfortable
I mean, shit I'm only 17
And um, a perfect couples only in a dream

I met this girl named Chanel
From ATL
An actress and a singer
She was paid in mills
We first spoke
I thought I found a bad chick on the spot
'Till I noticed that her breath
Smell like fat kids in a box
I met this girl named Jill
Who wanted my baby
I always told her no
But I ain't know she was crazy
I was in I had to bust
I was like wait Jill
She put a gun to my head
And was like (stay still)
I met this girl named Laneice
A freak but ugly
Stripped for me once
And her butt cheeks was musty
Every time it got loud she would sneak a small fart
Chick passed so much gas
She could make a car start
New this chick named Shirley
She acted so perky
But lil did I know that the chick had herpes
Tried kissed me in my sleep I got up and screamed
Chick had a cold sore that looked like John McCain
Now I'm sitting on my couch (couch)
Thinking how it get to the point
Where I can't even get a decent sounding chick
One more try to holla I'm a mase him in the lip
I never thought it would be bad that I got way too many chicks

I met this one chick
Named Miley Checks
I was so fascinated by Miley's breast
She said she had a gift
It was probably sex
She took her wig off
She looked like Kanye West
I met this girl named Teeka
She was not no groupie
She was a black belt
Starred in Kong Fu Movies
I liked her, but I had to dump her on the second date
Cause every time she moved her mouth
Her words will come out second blaze
I met this chick named Ivett
Who invented sex
I got her naked in an hour
The we hit the bed
She was twitching so much
Like she had the best
I found out the real reason
Cause she had torettes
There was one teacher
Named was Mrs.Chandelier
She was so bomb
That I would skip lunch just to see her
Til she snuck up from behind me
And I kicked her out of fear
Sounded like Ja Rule
Was tryna whisper in my ear
Now I'm sitting on my couch
Just thinking how I can't even get a decent sounding chick
One more try to holla I'm a mase him in the lip
I never thought it would be bad that I got way too many chicks

New Boyz,"He wouldn't let her breath
She had to let him go
She was a free spirit
She had to let him know
Her friends were relieved that she was finally free
There were so many things that she could finally see
She ain't know where to start
But knew she start tonight
Her girls said the club
She said she probably might
She always knew she had sex appeal
So tonight she about to dress to kill
I'm feelin' good, hey

She finally dropped her man
First night going out without a ring upon her hand
The drinks just kicking in and she feelin' good
Especially 'cause how she not alone
She spent hours in the bathroom
Just making she tat her hair all good
She can finally show her tattoo
Tonight she don't gotta hide, she's getting excited
'Cause she,
The way you walk in with that black dress
The way you walk in with that black dress
The way you walk in with that black dress
The way you walk in with that black dress
She finally got it on
She finally got it on

She headed back to the mirror
Head over her shoulder and her confidence on 10
Any girl try to step in, it'd be over
She just like a model
Dress from the bottom up
And she feel like the dress too long so she lifted the bottom up
Show them legs girl
You ain't committed now
Them niggas that used to be on you is your victims now
Her ex does not approve
But she always right
She on that Weezy shit
Single Friday night

She finally dropped her man
First night going out without a ring upon her hand
The drinks just kicking in and she feelin' good
Especially 'cause how she not alone
She spent hours in the bathroom
Just making she tat her hair all good
She can finally show her tattoo
Tonight she don't gotta hide, she's getting excited
'Cause she,

The way you walk in with that black dress
The way you walk in with that black dress

Who gon', who gon', 
Who gone love you better than me?
Who's gonna kiss ya, 
Who's gonna touch ya baby better than me?
Yeah, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody baby, can't nobody 
Nobody, nobody, oh nobody baby 

She the reason why my clothes 
Stay pressed while I pack and go 
And she the only one at the airport 
When I'm back from the road
Took me home, two ribs on the stove, 
My favorite how you know?
Hit the couch and she already had the game on, 
Tivo cause it ended hours ago
She screamed when kobe hit the game winning jumper, 
Ran through the house like a playground in summer 
She wrapped her legs around me and I spunned, 
Kissed her forehead and said that I love her
She ran the water for me got down in the lingerie, 
And said that she gon' model for me perfect way to start the day.

[Chorus]

I don't think anybody made, 
You the only who got it made
Like every time I see you, 
Our love gets stronger by the days
Take you to different states, 
Every day a different place
You never heard or seen that race, 
I'm different people different faces
You wanna be kind, mommy you mine 
I get to work like overtime 
I'm past that up high, 
I know you wanna met someone who you can fit
And so I step up to the plate, 
Who run this shit

If you want to ooh
And baby you can go if you think this is ?
Baby where you should be, 
But don't nobody know you like me
If it takes you ?
And baby you can go, 
But like I said before, can't nobody

Her coochies a flood, my stick is a dam
I found twenty thousand she just found my dick,
So I guess we both just hit a lick
I tell her welcome, welcome to the good life
Heard you had a bad day, well, let's make it good night

On a scale of one to nine, sorry shorty

I know you mad cause you caught me with a jump off
Jump off fuckin' down in my room
But I say it ain't what it seem, what if we switched places
I'd feel same way too (And let you leave)
Baby girl I promise (And let you leave)
That it ain't what it look like (I'd let you leave)
I'm just tryin' to be honest (Gon' let you leave)
Baby it was just one night

I had a girlfriend, I finally settled down
She gave her all to me, seven pounds
She had a boyfriend, who career was rappin'
He gave his all to her, unless a girl distracts him
I ain't even wanna go sexin' her but
I mean the girl kept on blowin' my text up
Like ""Legacy, come over, your girlfriend cock blockin""
And she had food can't turn down a hot pocket
I guess my actions led to your packin'
I know you walked in but I swear it didn't happen
how your brain processed it to be
I tried to run from her but she wasn't lettin' me be
See, what happened was she put pills in my cup
Threw my clothes in the tub and went down as I slept
Wait, where you goin? Baby calm down
Okay, I lied to you, but before you walk out

[Chorus]

Look, I know I'm wrong for the things I done
I passed up a couple of chances because I'm sprung
We've been together for four months, she pushed my buttons
Can't forgive it little daddy girl I messed up once, haha
I don't like her, she was a one nighter
If endin' love was a girl, we can both fight her
Of course bro I like her, I was 'bout to wife her
If she don't let me go then yeah, I'm gon' wife her
LOL, I'ma send her ass a text
Talkin' 'bout ""I miss you baby what's up next?""
And if you don't get back I'ma call her up next
Let her know I love her have to say what's on my chest
I didn't do it yet, but I'ma still count seconds
And if I get my girl back then I got all my blessings
Grabbed the iPhone and the service started ringin'
And she picked up the phone ""Look baby I was thinkin'""

Front page vixen and that's my love
If you see me cuffin' hard with her it's only because

You lighten up my mood, even when you make your mad face.
If I called you beautiful, it must have been your bad day.
Since you left your ex, all your friends think I'm bogus.
You got your nails done, I bet your ex wouldn't notice.
Swag on point, she don't shop at all the local spots.
Without makeup, she look like she been photo-shopped.
You had a deal, you'll get Marbury meals.
If you on the front cover, you'll be off every shelf.

Talking about a five star cover girl vixen.

I had too many girl friends com in, in her house
She told me if I show her one more of my girlfriends, 
She's kickin her out, her out, her out

Okay, that's cool, that's cool, care to take a seat
That's messed up, y'all split and you nearly made a week
Ah! Well you can meet Mrs. Badder Bitch
She the reason why you gone on some magic shit
One difference between y'all is she like to say trim
She got rid of the Bush like Obama came in
And you broke, need the bank to spendin'
Two quarters in your pants like Chelsea Handler
You not mean just ?
But they mistake you for a bitch like Kelsey Grammer
But it's cool, cause I know it's not legit
You just hella insecure and like to talk a shit
But don't mistake for bein' a nine when you greased up
The square root is threesome, so what's the deal?

She fucked me like a porn star, you ain't do shit
Fine young swag grown and committed
My girl workin' good I had to maker her my assistant
Old chick politic, go mingle
New Boyz are nothin' girl your man's still wrinkled
He called me ""one hit wonder"" as far as my singles
You can't be browned up when your boots albeeno
Albino, sorry I get salty like Pringles
Skinny nigga dope well say I buy a kilo
My girl fly in bed, Red Bull give her wings though
Center of attention, A plus ?

Think it's pointless, but you like to start to,
Like I heard this, she said that,
And then my friends told me they must be facts,
Here we go with this stuff again,
You just met these girls, and you trustin' them?
And she put it on me, screamin' so loud,
That I'm left with no choice but to tune her out,
(Stupid mother) I love you too, you workin' out girl? I love them shoes!
Yeah I love you want to, if that's what you do,
Cause I like when your mad, I think its so cute,
I shut her up by the compliments,
That's really the only way I can stop the fits,
So every time she start yellin' in here,
I close my eyes and put my hands on my ear like

Na na na, say what? Na na na I cant hear you!
Na na na what's that? I cant hear you!
I swear it's like you talkin' to a wall,
Cause I ain't listen to you at all,
But you keep tryna talk talk talk, but wah wah wah,
But talk all the shit you want cause I be zonin' you out.
Same old brand new station,
I aint listenin', I be zonin' you out,
You talking like it's the end of the world,
When you aint got shit to say, I be zonin',
Out my ear, out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out
Out my ear, out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out

Damn get out my ear though,
Got these old folks lookin' at us like weirdo's,
Can we just sit and talk about it?
Instead of you tryna tell ya pops about it,
You don't needa go that far, it's just me and you,
Your daddy too old what that nigga gon do?
Oops my bad, you know I aint mean it,
What I'm tryna say is we needa quit beefin',
She smiled at me and said
""Your right, but who was that girl you was with last night?""
She started going off like burnt lights,
At this rate we gon' never work right,
That's when I planned somethin' different,
The only way to deal with her is to not listen,
So I put my hands on my ear till she stopped trippin' like

Na na na, say what? Na na na I cant hear you!
Na na na what's that? I cant hear you!
I swear it's like you talkin' to a wall,
Cause I ain't listen to you at all,
But you keep tryna talk talk talk, but wah wah wah,
But talk all the shit you want cause I be zonin' you out.

When you aint got shit to say, I be zonin',
Out my ear, out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out
Out my ear, out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out

Seem like all you want is for me to hear ya voice,
Even if all the things you say is true, there's still no point,
For you to be trippin' like you are, it ain't that bad,
I even left my ex girl for you,
And she ain't that mad, here we go again,
Here we go again with same damn argument
I don't know the chick I don't know the chick,
Will you please get off my ear,
Think about all the times
You find out a lie just to bring you down,
You're way too loud, if you gon' try and shout,
Then I'll be zonin' you out like

Na na na, say what? Na na na I cant hear you!
Na na na what's that? I cant hear you!
I swear it's like you talkin' to a wall,
Cause I ain't listen to you at all,
But you keep tryna talk talk talk, but wah wah wah,
But talk all the shit you want cause I be zonin' you out.

New Coon Creek Girls,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

   Since my sweet thing she ain't around

Couldn't sleep last night, just thinking of you
Tossed and turned tears in my eyes
Wondering why you said goodbye

For true love is hard to find
It's too late to turn back the time",These Old Blues

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

On the same
Argument
We could sit around and talk it over 

Or take a trip
To clear our minds
At the entrance of Mount Wilson
It's feeling like the right decision

Some times you go outside
To get inside
If I could only hear you say
That you are down but you're ok

We should have said the things we felt
Is it too late
Park the car and hit the trail
The air feels sharp

On our skin
We'll see the snow as it is melting
Spring must be on
Her way again

We didn't see her coming for us
I guess that's mother nature's way
Sometimes you go outside
To get inside

That you are down but you're ok

Into your keeping, oh
Lead me on, the awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, lead me on

Shoulder to the wheel
For someone else's selfish gain
Here there is no choosing, working the clay
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain

Fire in the field, underneath the blazing sun
But soon the sun was faded and freedom was a song
I heard them singing when the day was done
Singing to the holy one

Lead me on to a place where the river runs
Into your keeping, oh
Lead me on, the awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, lead me on

Waiting for the train
Labeled with a golden star
Heavy hearted boarding, whispers in the dark
Where are they going, is it very far?

Bitter cold terrain, echoes of a slamming door
In chambers made for sleeping forever
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar
Cry to the lord

Singing lead me on to a place where the river runs
Into your keeping, oh
Lead me on, the awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, lead me on

Man hurts man
Time and time again
And we drown in the wake of our power
Somebody tell me why

Comforts the seeking, oh

New Direction,"I was messed up, dirty as I could be, 
I was on my way to hell
But I heard the preacher, 
Preaching the Word of God, 
Confess your sins and repent 

I came to Jesus as I was, 
Weary, worn, and sad 
I found in Him a resting place 
And He has made, made me glad

I asked the Lord, 
how could He love me, 
I have sinned against Your will 
But He said, repent and I will forgive you, 
The question's who will you serve? 

You might be dirty, messed up inside, 
You may even have lost your will to live
Don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel, 
Confess your sins and repent so you can be like me

I can feel the fire moving deeply down into my soul, 
Warming up my elements where my spirit was cold. 
It got my bones spiritually heated because I have been treated 
With God's holy anointing which was something that I needed. 
I excel to another level, I'm serving God and coming against this lying devil, 
How could I fail 'cause I've got this whole armor on,

Shook in a ice cold sweat
Curious of what real love feels like
It hasn't hit me yet, it hasn't hit me yet

You'll reach that stage in your life
You wonder what love will be
My mama told me that would be our find
You will find love in reality, she said

?Baby, you don't have to wonder
Just kickback and love will come
Love will tap you on the shoulder
Kickback and love will grow?

I see the look that's in a young girls eye
As I watch TV
This thing called love, I've got to try
Leave this script for me

It's time to learn all about
True love without a doubt
Can't fight the feeling when it comes around
You will know when the girl you found, mama said

?Baby, you don't have to wonder
Kickback and love will come
Love will tap you on the shoulder
Girl, kickback and love will grow?

My mama said, ?Kickback and love will flow?
Mama said, ?Kickback and love will grow?

Now I'm kinda young and I don't understand
What it is about love that attracts a man
Could it be you got to be of age
Or tell me Mike, is love just a stage?

Love, when does it come, how, when and why?
Does it bring happiness, does it make you cry?
My mother told me, one day I'll know
Just kickback and love will grow

Baby, you don't have to wonder
Just kickback and love will come
Love will tap you on the shoulder

Well listen.
When I was very young I used to sit around the house watching oil can harry battle mighty mouse
Until my mother said, son, that's not the way to be. you've got to go to school and learn your abcs.
I said, is that it, mom? 
She said, that's not even half. you've got to go to school, you got to learn some math.
You got to learn you to count- 1, 2, 3- and then get freshed up on the history.
My first day of school I'll never forget. my teacher said, recite the alphabet.
I said, a e m e l r, and, as you can see, I didn't get very far.
The teacher said, son, there's nothing to it. before the day's over, you'll learn how to do it.
And not only that, you'll learn how to read, and that's one thing in life you'll always need.
Well, school's not all work. there's fun things to do like gym, lunch, and recess, too.
Kindergarten was easy. it was mostly play. what I was worried about was elementary.

S c h o o l, you got to go to school and beat that bell.

Ha! now something got wrong. I took another turn.
I didn't want to study, didn't even want to learn.
Didn't want to go to class. I was always late because school became something that I started to hate.
Started hanging with my boys; didn't mean no harm. we was going around the school pulling fire alarms.
I was a chilly homeboy, yes, I was down because I came to school just to mess around.
I started hanging in the halls, writing on the walls, until I got started playing basketball.
But I didn't have a job so I couldn't get paid and I couldn't play ball because of my grades.
But I still used to practice each and every day in case the coach decided to let me play.
But it didn't work out the way I planned, so I ran to a man who said he can understand the troubles I was going through.
He said, son it's all about going to school.
So I e-mail, what goes here? ________ and now I'm moving up to the big leagues: high school.

I'm feeling cool 'cause I was going on to something they call high school.
And I feel important, 'cause things aren't the same, wondering why nobody knows my name.
That became something that I started to miss, and now that I'm here it feels like a big dis.
But, anyway, I had to leave. I had something to achieve.
It was singing- yeah- that's what I wanted to do, so I got a tutor, because I'm no fool.
Dropping out of school is quite absurd, and it's something new edition just spread the word.

Center stage N.E. was groovin'
The beatwas hard
And the girlies were movin'
There she was third row center coolin'
She was cold

Last note of the last song
House lights up they came on
When I looked she was gone
It was a 3rd row heartbreak

People think our life is easy
'Cause they think we've got it made
But we're living underpressure
Just to be on top
And to give the best that we can give you
And to never let you down
We'll keep strivin' for perfection
N.E. heartbreak is coming to your town

Beware of N.E. heartbreak
Spreading fast and there's no cure
No need to run from heartache
It's gonna get you, get you for sure

Called up my girl and said
Meet me on the tour
I got a suite cold chillin' on the 50th floior
And I'll leave your ticket at the door
And baby don't forget the pumps

She lost her backstage pass and the room key
Then got stopped by hotel security
And I spent the whole night lonely
And it was a hotel heartbreak",N.E. Heartbreak

You're not an man until you come of age

I don't wanna see her cry but it's hard to live a lie

is for us to be apart

I think she will understand
If I tell her straight then she can only respect me,
even if we don't agree
I don't wanna treat her cruel, but I like honesty baby,
so what am I gonna do?

Is that I'm down for you and treat you right

You should be giving me your love too

Hey yo cutie what's up with this attitude?
I thought I was bein' real good to you
I treat you sweet take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post, but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from 9 to 5
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you 12 yellow roses and candy too
I like to be up front, and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl it's like a heart attack
I'm a real troop-trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side big dollars I'll clock

We used to hang out tough
Just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad, I can let you go
Cuz' there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
Roll to the fact that I want you Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start illin', tryin' to make a killin'
Though about the dollars I make,
And you were willin'
To be with me, Bobby B.

You gotta be the same way that another girl would be

New Edition,"In store signing autographs at the mall
Next in line was a fly girl standing tall
Signed my name and said give me a call baby ya know

the girl screamed and fainted panic on the floor
The body guard pulled us the back door
I never saw her anymore- it was an in-store heartbreak

Live at five interview for Channel 2
Saw a cutie thought she was on the T.V. cre
She said after the show (I'll be waiting for you) cool
After the show she got into the car and what a scence
I didn't know she was only thirteen
It was a young girl heartbreak

People think we don't get lonely
But we're far away from home
One minute 20,000 people
But then they go home, we're alone

It's off to another city
Where everybody knows my name
But when I meet that perfect honey
Is it me she wants or is it my fame

Girlies and groupies and parties all night
Is the life that can lead you to a N.E. heartbreak
From city to city our friends and our fans
they're the ones who can keep us from having
N.E. heartbreak

Center stage N.E. was groovin'
The beatwas hard
And the girlies were movin'
There she was third row center coolin'
She was cold

Last note of the last song
House lights up they came on
When I looked she was gone
It was a 3rd row heartbreak

People think our life is easy
'cause they think we've got it made
But we're living underpressure
Just to be on top
And to give the best that we can give you
And to never let you down
We'll keep strivin' for perfection
N.E. heartbreak is coming to your town

Beware of N.E. heartbreak
Spreading fast and there's no cure
No need to run from heartache
It's gonna get you, get you for sure

Called up my girl and said
Meet me on the tour
I got a suite cold chillin' on the 50th floior
And I'll leave your ticket at the door
And baby don't forget the pumps

She lost her backstage pass and the room key
Then got stopped by hotel security
And I spent the whole night lonely
And it was a hotel heartbreak",N.E. Heart Break

please disregard my opinion
I try to only care when I'm asked
It helps to get off my chest

you say you're so overwhelmed with grief
And it's because of me

Don't you say, you know anything about me
Don't you say, you know I heard you said you know

It haunts you,

Get you the words you said out of my head
Out of my head

I'm taken back by you

And nothing beats not knowing
What's gonna happen next
For all the nights you've held me so long
I'm taken back by you
",Taken Back by You
New Found Glory,"I wonder what life would be like
If my shoulder could bare the weight
Of all this adding up, I feel the breaking point
It's close enough, it's feeling real again

You have my heart in your hands
You have my heart, so don't, don't let it go
Check my pressure, patch me right up
You're too good to be

It's true, we both make sacrifices
There's proof, it came as no surprise
It boiled up as we always let it do
We made it through again

You have my heart in your hands
You have my heart, so don't, don't let it go
Check my pressure, patch me right up
You're too good to be, yeah

You know you have my heart in your hands
You have my heart, so don't, don't let it go
You have my heart in your hands
You have my heart, so don't, don't let it go

Don't let it go, don't let it go
Check my pressure, patch me right up
You're too good to be
You're too good to be
",Too Good to Be
New Found Glory,"Now I have finally accepted
We will never stand in the same room
I can never hear your voice of reason
At least you didn't, didn't feel a thing

When I was younger, you would tell me
That I should wait to grow up
That things don't go always as planned
At least you didn't, didn't feel a thing

No, you didn't, didn't have to feel a thing
No, you didn't feel

When I die, I'll be fine
'Cause I know you're always there
When I die, I'm alright
'Cause I know you'll be there, you are home

Now I'm standing at a crossroad
Don't know which path is calling me
I wanna follow in your footsteps
So you know you're never alone

No, you didn't, didn't have to feel a thing
No, you're never alone

When I die, I'll be fine
'Cause I know you're always there
When I die, I'm alright
'Cause I know you'll be there, you are home

I'm still here but I'm waiting
For our long conversations
I'm still here but I'm waiting to go home

When I die, I'll be fine
'Cause I know you're always there
When I die, I'm alright
'Cause I know you'll be there, you are home
(No, you didn't, didn't have to feel a thing)

No, you didn't, didn't have to feel a thing
You are home, you are home
",When I Die
New Found Glory,"Focus on me
There is more to see
But use discretion
This ride isn't free
I'll prove them wrong
I'll prove them all wrong
The more I sit here,
The more that I think

Every mistake I make
From now on
I'll turn around
I'll make it, I'll make it right
And every truth I fake I
Might hurt someone
I'll make it, I'll make it alright

Pins and needles
Are up and down my spine
I'll pull them out one by one
I don't need it all
Give it away
The more I breathe in,
The more is seaps through
It's a numbing feeling,
This is what I'll do

Every mistake I make
From now on
I'll turn around
I'll make it, I'll make it right
And every truth I fake I
Might hurt someone
I'll make it, I'll make it alright

Every mistake I make
From now on
I'll turn around
I'll make it, I'll make it right
And every truth I fake I
Might hurt someone
I'll make it, I'll make it alright

I'll make it alright",Make It Right
New Found Glory,"This could be the song everyone relates to
Another melody something we go through
This could be the words to use in good fortune
To keep in the bag of my foiled backup plan
It?s the beat that keeps you marching on
So take your chance I got armour on
Reasons will reveal itself into time
So for luck will you cross your fingers?

You and I girl, we?ve got something golden
Did you now they say it never lasts
And oh-oh-oh, we?ve got something golden
We can?t, can?t break, everyone, everyone?s wrong
Everyone, everyone?s wrong

This could be the verse always reminding you
Of your battle scars all your could have been?s
Only I know what I?ve been through
But for luck I?d still cross my fingers

[Chorus:]

I could have used this long ago
You took my good advice
I could have used this long ago
Should have crossed my fingers

[Chorus:]
