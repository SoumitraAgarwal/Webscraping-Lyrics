OutKast,"Drowning in the gray cell
To dwell in earthly hell
A pimp warrior fell
One-two! Sir Lucious ""L""
Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth
Lucious! (Lucious!) Sir Lucious Left Foot has just entered

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!

First rule in this thing, never let 'em see you sweat!
Never let 'em be a threat and your feelings you must protect 'em!
As well as your rectum! Must keep self out of harm, out of danger's way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on!

True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail bondsman to go on and post that bail,
You would be happy as Hell
You thought you were happy until that court day came
Couldn't afford that case, nobody to take your place, family Hummers at stake
Too late to escape and you're on the run

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!

Once upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child (Flip that smile upside down now)
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny
Didn't have many, but had enough to get by, enough to get fly

Only to start the new year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went like mom and dad's relationship
Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the hot sauce

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!

1979, Dirty South, Local lounge (Flip that smile upside down now!)
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit!
Graphic language, mild violence and the silence of the fams!

No members to remember but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said we executed the game plan
'Cause we got that hot sauce!

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!",Unhappy

As I, struggle to keep my balance and composure
I'm 'posed ta, propose a toast to players on every coast-a
The lyrical roller coaster, mind-bender
'Stead of watching these sucker MC's
I'm seeing just how they lying to the general population
Don't be patient, get up and stand up for your life
Don't you agree or understand we lost some rights at 1-1-9?
Come dumb, come young, come blind unwind confined
To the situation, we facing, cause in time, tick tick boom

Tick, boom, tick, tick-boom
Tick, boom, tick, tick-boom
Tick, boom, tick, tick-boom
Tick, boom, tick, tick-boom

""You're gonna die here""

When will we all, awake up out this dream
Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers are human beings
Man acting as if he was the supreme being
Clocking the souls of men out like he was G-O-D and
W-A-Rrah, there'll be no tomorrow but sorrow
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars
Politicians, modern day magicians
Physicians of death, more health care for poor health
Who making us ill, they making us kill
That's making me spill my guts (chill Big, lay in the cut)
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nothing all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal
That followed, and we all watched the nation, as it swallowed
And chalked it up, basically America you got FUCKED
The media shucked and jived now we stuck - damn!

""Can't be heard clearly""
""You're gonna die here""

Operation Anaconda, ask yourself
Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price
For his life and his wife plead twice?
See Al-Amin got life and Fred got dead, Hampton
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers
They got they answer for ransom
As we read together, as we dream together
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better
But it got to, you gave me this microphone so I must rock you
Your brainwaves, airwaves, energized and shocked you
Y'all got me, well I got y'all, long as I know y'all listenin'
I'ma always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen

Skinny, slim women got the camel toe within them
You can fuck them, lift them, bend them, give them something to remember
Yell out timber when they fall through the chop shop

Now let me listen to the stories you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail on the loco

OutKast,"Caroline!(Caroline!) Caroline!
All the guys would say she's mighty fine(Mighty fine!)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you cussed out, or coming up short.
Yeah, now dig this, even though(Even though!)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide(To divide!)
The time it took to look inside and realize that
Real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah!

[Chorus x2]
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink
But lean a little bit closer
See that roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-oo

Caroline!(Caroline!) See she's the reason for the word ""bitch""(Bitch!)
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Trying to hurry up to get to some
Baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror
And crash, crash, craaash.. into a ditch! (Just Playing!)
She needs a golden calculator to divide
The time it takes to look inside and realize that
Real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah!

[Chorus x2]

Well she's got a hotty's body, but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said ""Pardon me, are you ballin'?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pursing""
Oh so you're one them freaks, get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game, been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost
Must take me for a geek, ah, quick way to eat,
Ah, neat place sleep, ah, rent-a-car for a week, ah, trick for a treat..Noo
Go, on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved without our lawyers
And judges, just to hold grudges in the courtroom,
I want to see ya support bra not support you!

[Chorus x4]

Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasin' cars
What happens when the dough get so low
Bitch, you ain't that fine
No waaay...no waaay...noo waaaaay

Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasin' cars
What happens when the dough get so low
Bitch, you ain't that fine
No waaay...no waaay...noo waaaaay

Stupid ass bitch,
Old punk ass bitch, 
Old dumbass bitch,

Oh, oh, oh, aww shit!
Big Boi, Big boi

What if everything you ever knew or known was lost
The needs tend to freeze you when you gatherin' yo thoughts
You pause for the cause,try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
Cause your mind ain't free, constricting by the motherfuckin' boundaries
An ounce of weed or an pound of dro
Couldn't place you on the planet where 
I'm transmitting life from bro brother, bro hem
Cadillac on bows, strike a pose then the door slams, 
Wham nigga wham, don't they say that in they show damn
For show man, acting like a tadpole out of gonads, 
You now how catch the truth, hit the booth we making more jams
Spread the strawberry preserves on your nervous program, fuck the learning curve
We took our ramp to no man's land
Hello,is anybody home, is anybody giving dome
Serve me up I want some

[Chorus]
Buggface toe jam, from the face up cause you don't give a jam
Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jamming, shoving it up your monkey jam
Buggface toe jam, from the face up cause you don't give a jam
Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jamming, shoving it up your monkey jam

When I'm left alone I get to thinking to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste so use it until none's left
Like everything is alright clearly tight to death
I can see clearly now analyzing every step
Clearly you can feel me cause it's beating through your chest
And you can see me clearly through the window paint drip wet wet
With no tint not yet,clearly I'm a vet
And not a veterinarian, but clearly pitbulls are the best
Like the O-U-T-K-S, cleary nigga you know the rest
And if you acting like you don't, cleary nigga you trying to test
Crystal clearly I confess, and I suggest, you clear the runway
Cause the ticket is a one-way, clearly back we won't be coming

Wow first come the love
Now then comes the marriage
1-1-1 baby 2 baby 3 baby carriage baby

Welcome to my world
Oceans vs. mountains
(Welcome to her world
Oceans versus mountains)
Call me the poor girl
Cause I love to fight them
(Call her the poor girl
Cause she loves to fight them)
I'm quite sweet
If you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart rattles around
Like a bone lost deep inside
See I'd like to fall in love
But not that type of guy

you got my clouds on fire
We're tightrope walking
And the world's the wire
Remember kissing on Broadway
You'll die
I was bein' your baby
And ticking your tock in yo' clock
See we done jumped the broom
And now you're no good
And I was dreaming about children 
Emily and, oh darling baby
With the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me 
(It meant so much to me)
And I needed your good love
Baby how could you just go
And change it all
You turned my spring to fall
I needed you, you know
But when the love is gone
It's time to go

If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone

We was only in our teens
Our dreams was simplistic
Jumped the broom
But it seems I tripped 
I must have slipped
After exchanging of the rings
These things, you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride
The dipping of the groom
The shit that make a nigga
Up and leave up out a room
More like ""boohoo"" then Boo
""Fuck who?"" then ""fuck you too""
(Fucking bitch) kids, cover them ears
It appears that your mama want drama We need a comma
Or some space between words
For better or for worse
This is not what I deserve
The worst that I can take
Actually I want the cake and eat it too And plus your plate
But wait now,
Don't you get the house kids cars
Everything we built together was ours
Now it's all yours!
That's hard it's all yours,

Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far
Still battling in this racial war
Trying to find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books lets stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good you into my hood you won't be finding much
Hope that when I'm gone y'all remember this
What we stood for ""fuck that fame and that glitz""

Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars,
Success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce
Hollywood divorce

(And I'm a star!)
Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong,
Oh, but you right, if you just put a little ice on,
And cut your mic on
But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra. 
I'm so not sober.
I'm high like a Hollywood coffee or soda.
You can call me a roller. (Hold up)
Your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different.
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know.
And did you know I'm the creator of the term?
I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long. 
They just making it burn.
Make a movie of our lifestyle,
But they earn like a dead body burned on a mantelpiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax 
Like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga
Cooler than anti-freeze 
Defrost on your window pane

But in Hollywood it's Little Wayne
Don't make me nut
So that's why I got a pre-nup

A is for Adamsville
Be is Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck 
If you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, 
I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither
I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back 
Three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap 
She ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your un-
Divided attention I'm
Gonna say this and run 
Under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack 
Promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest 
Three fourths of it all
(For what?) 
So your kids' kids' kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? 
Get get get get get on your knees
Cause 'wealth' is the word (yep)
'Rich' is 'round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? 
Shoot me a bird

Tenth grade 
The way was paved 
For me and Dre. to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein 
The arts and crafts
Now could we make a difference
Antoine Patton and Andre Benjamin
Been jamming for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint 
Public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears 
And think it's dismissed
Part two, the sequel 
All new cast
Just ain't the same 
Gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name 
Behind that screen name
They're lame 
And their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face 
Straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
(What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot?)
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen (Nigga please)
But even she can walk 
We'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes 
Must be something bigger waiting

[Chorus]

(I do) 
Love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, 
It's game time
Do you take this here 
As your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her 
For all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share 
Take you there
And me and you together 
Baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time 
We walked a thin line
Others say they got you 
But you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence (Is that right?)
But you love the dog
Gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growing up 
Showing up 
Blowing up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me 
Like a game of football
Used to feed me 
Need me 
Dress me
Now it's so messy 
Straight cut out and left me

Hollywood divorce. 
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing.
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talking about music
Everything else too.
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over.
But it's cool.
We just keep it going and make new shit.

Take our name
Give us a little fame

They read one magazine and wanna think that they gon' get warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the north pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, he's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's OK just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, ya'll crooks might even move

Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you make it right

Waiting, now that's a virtue

Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid
Go head recycle, repackage and put it back in my cabinet

5 o?clock in the morning, I be calling You

I?m totally lost with out Your light
I?m finding my self on the strive all the time
Not a single day goes by

I?m out to fight the devil but never fought myself
Read a thousand books but never read myself
My souls starving it needs to be fed lord I need your help
Hell with the devil my biggest enemy?s myself
It makes me wonder am I doing this for the right reasons
I mean the money the fame and game all sounds appealing
Instead of entertaining I prefer to enlighten
But then again who am I to be in a position
To represent a whole generation of kids and to make them believe
When till this day I still struggle to uphold my deen
I read a 100 God is great in less then a minute
And though my tongue is fast like twista
My hearts not in it

Mmm any given time He?ll be there
I don?t really have to say no more
Mmm any given time He?s right here
Embedded in my living soul ? oh for sure
Oh any given time I see
The beauty that has always been
In any given time

By the one in whose hands my soul is there is no match
To think a spider couldn?t´ weave a curtain just like that (break)

I wouldn?t be here without Your light
I?m finding my self on the strive all the time
Not a single day goes by

Sí que tengo fervor, devoción para dar mi granito de arena
Y mi aspiración mantenerla serena
Yo Tengo buen criterio aunque a veces esta difuso
Yo Tengo mi firmeza de la cual a veces abuso
Yo trato de ser justo, me sobra lealtad
Coraje valentía, me falta sobriedad
Diferentes situaciónes,diferentes actitudes
Afectan mi progreso y todas mis virtudes

And my aspirations keep them serene

Outlandish,"As I got up this morning
You watched me and hoped I'd talk to you
Even if it was just a few words
Askin' your opinion

Thankin' you for something good that happened, Lord
But you noticed I was too busy
Tryin' to find the right clothes matchin' with the right shoes
And I ran around the house getting ready

You knew there would be minutes to stop
And say hello, but I still, I were too busy
And at one point, I had to wait doing nuttin'
Then you saw me spring to my feet

Thought I wanted to talk
But I ran to the phone
Called a friend, wassup

Okay, now it's time for us to talk
So I find an empty room but hesitation is in my heart
A look down the hall, nobody there, so I close the door
Take of my new jacket, man, I can't put this on the floor

I'm a have this conversation standin' or my jeans will get dirty
Better yet, I'm a sit on this chair right here 'cause I feel a bit lazy
Almost forgot to pull the curtains so no one can look in
And just when I'm about to utter you some words

Someone steps in
Embarrassed by the moment
I jump up and come up with some stupid excuse
Like I was looking for something

All while you were watchin' me patiently
Ready to give more chances with the hope
That eventually at some point
I will speak to you

You give me so much
You wait all day for a nod
A prayer or a thought
A thankful part of my heart

To all my moros back home
All day workin' hard
Struggling all week
Every dawn standing tall

I know you noticed that before lunch I looked around
I felt embarrassed to talk to you
That is why I didn't bow my head
Glanced 3 or 4 tables over, saw some of my friends talking to you

But I did not, there is still more time left
Hope that I will talk to you yet, but I went home
And seemed as if I had lots of things to do
After that what is on TV

Suddenly I felt too tired to talk to you
Fell asleep in no time without a thought for you
I know it's hard to have a one sided conversation
Well, give me some days to try again, and again, and again

Pase por enfrente de tu casa esta manana muy temprano
No me dio ni por llamarte, saludarte lo cual es muy extrano
Ahora que la luz esta apagada estoy pensando
Si solo cuando yo lo necesito conversamos

O si solo cuando temo me haces falta
A cada instante tu retrato esta en mi espalda
Me equivoco en muchas de cosas
Why defectos tengo mas de cien estoy luchando, tu lo sabes bien

Faults, I have more than 100
I'm struggling, you know I am

Appreciatin' is something I be forgettin', every second
24/7, I'm a forgetful servant, I gotta be prayin' though
Appreciatin' when suffering, calamities call
My soul be hospitalized and all gonna be alright

To all my moros back home
All day workin' hard
Struggling all week
Every dawn standing tall

To all my moros sheddin' tears
Still greet with warm smiles
Patiently throughout the years
Give praise to the most high

To all my moros back home
All day workin' hard
Struggling all week
Every dawn standing tall

To all my moros sheddin' tears
Still greet with warm smiles
Patiently throughout the years
Give praise to the most high

To all my moros back home
All day workin' hard
Struggling all week
Every dawn standing tall",Appreciatin'
Outlandish,"With my right foot first
I stepped into the holy mosque
Upon the cold white marble
Where day and night people sat worshippin?, praying
Right and left the mosque being cleaned
Shinin? not a particle of dust
The carvings of marble, the plates of gold
The symmetry of the whole mosque
Yeah the largest of it all
The came the grandest of the whole
The big beautiful house of Allah
Covered with black cloth and gold leaf writin?
My life flashed passed me, the good and the bad
Such a feeling my brother, never ever felt I had
A special bondage to the almighty
A sudden chill in me
Lookin? around the large floor was filled with unity
Circling the beautiful house
Chanting, people sitting, prayin? for forgiveness
Prayin? to do better I witnessed
Takin? a deep breath, tears was runnin?
I ran around the black house, the ancient black house
Built by Ibrahim, peace be upon him, circlin? 24 no doubt
I got closer, as did my heart, as did my soul, amazing
How everyone had their attention only on worshippin?
All concerns forgotten, focused on prayin?
Forgettin? everything matters and happenings just living
I looked up in the sky thanking Allah for this journey
Sayin?: I swear I didn?t schedule to be here this early
I thought I?d come here like pops in my forties and fifties
And the doe I paid for the ticket, was meant for some hobby
But who am I to say if I will be alive tomorrow
Or 20 years from now, will my health be able to follow
For a moment I pictured my self 6 feet deep
In the cemetery, my corps in the same white sheets
Allah holds the master plan and it?s already written
The pens are withdrawn, the pages are dry... it?s written!

Looking back on my life
Life that?s gladly been given to me
Open my eyes and embrace the smile
Given to you & I

Con mi mano derecha abro la puerta
Mi madre me recibe con un periódico y una carta
Veo fotos de mi padre abatido por disparos
De momentos ya yo espero
Que mis lágrimas caigan, me preparo
Me sorprende que mis ojos estén secos y mi alma esté calmada
En mi cuerpo no hay dolor por una persona ya olvidada

Translation:
[With my right hand I open the door
My mom welcomes me with a newspaper and a letter
I see pictures of my father fetched down by shots
In that moment I?m only waiting
For my tears to fall, I?m prepared
But to my surprise my eyes are dry and my soul is calm
In my whole body there?s no sign of grief for a forgotten person]

Staring outside, there was something I realized
Tomorrow the sun will rise, and together
Will see the beauty of eternity

Salgo a caminar y despejar mis pensamientos
Lo normal sería sufrimiento
O un parecido sentimiento
Le pido a Dios que lo amparé en sus últimos momentos

Translation:
[I go out, take a walk and clear my thoughts
The anticipated feeling would be suffering or something similar
I ask God to be merciful in the final hours]

Looking back on my life
Life that?s gladly been given to me
Open my eyes and embrace the smile
Given to you & I
Looking back on my life
No regret only the sweet journey
Lessons from the simple steps
Taking by you & I

With my right hand first
I open the door to the room where my woman gave birth
To my first born son
Only minutes before
I was in the waiting room, nervous
Moms giving me comfort
Family support
As I approached I could hear him crying
I didn?t notice
That my tears were running
Pictured myself for a moment in the arms of my father
Flashback to the bended shoulders
On which I?d sit
Grabbing his finger
Taking my first step
Would I become like him?
After a certain age bottle up
Stop showing love
But cold handshakes throughout the years
Replaced by hugs
Father whispered in his ears
The family was gathered
Pictures were taken
My hands still shaking
My joy was beyond words
Him in my arms
3 generations of tears running so calm
He came with Gods blessing and grace so we named him Faizan

If I worship U in fear of hell, burn me in it
And if I worship U in hope of paradise, exclude me from it
But if I worship U for Your own being
Don?t withhold from me Your everlasting beauty

And if I worship U in hope of paradise, exclude me from it
But if I worship U for Your own being

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 

..(chorus).. 

You used to inspire others with your way of thinking and speech 
People came from afar just to hear us teach 

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
Mosques are empty, refrigerators are stocked 
We lost our deen, we feel secure because our mansions are locked 
In my teen years salat really wasnt that tight 
Now i gotta pray each one of them twice. 

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
Brother we prefer light skinned women 
while righteously maintain our deen against raicism (and tribalism)? 

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
can you

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
We used to smile at each other with faces full of light 
Now we frown on each other, we bicker, and we fight 
Pops in the mosque praying, 
kids in the streets haitin 
kids on the corner selling pot and in the mosque preaching? 


What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
The Quran has left our hearts - stranded hanging on our walls

9 out of 10 of us cant even read it or write 
1924 seems distand like way before Christ

It's time to rush with no fear
It's time to crush and prepare
Follow the leader but the leader is a jerk

Outlandish,"Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
You don't see a damn thing
'cause you can't relate to me
You're blinded by our differences
My life makes no sense to you
I'm the persecuted one
You're the red, white and blue

Each day you wake in tranquility
No fears to cross your eyes
Each day I wake in gratitude
Thanking God He let me rise
You worry about your education
And the bills you have to pay
I worry about my vulnerable life
And if I'll survive another day
Your biggest fear is getting a ticket
As you cruise your Cadillac
My fear is that the tank that has just left
Will turn around and come back

Yet, do you know the truth of where your money goes?
Do you let your media deceive your mind?
Is this a truth nobody, nobody, nobody knows
Has our world gone all blind?

Do you know the truth of where your money goes?
Do you let your media deceive your mind?
Is this a truth nobody, nobody, nobody knows?
Someone tell me...

Ooohh, let's not cry tonight
I promise you one day it's through
Ohh my brothers, Ohh my sisters
Ooohh, shine a light for every soul that ain't with us no more
Ohh my brothers, Ohh my sisters

See I've known terror for quite some time
57 years so cruel
Terror breathes the air I breathe
It's the checkpoint on my way to school
Terror is the robbery of my land
And the torture of my mother
The imprisonment of my innocent father
The bullet in my baby brother
The bulldozers and the tanks
The gases and the guns
The bombs that fall outside my door
All due to your funds
You blame me for defending myself
Against the ways of my enemies
I'm terrorized in my own land
But am I the terrorist?

Yet, do you know the truth of where your money goes?
Do you let your media deceive your mind?
Is this a truth nobody, nobody, nobody knows
Has our world gone all blind?

Do you know the truth of where your money goes?
Do you let your media deceive your mind?
Is this a truth nobody, nobody, nobody knows?
Someone tell me...

Ooohh, let's not cry tonight, I promise you one day it's through
Ohh my brothers, Ohh my sisters,
Ooohh, shine a light for every soul that ain't with us no more
Ohh my brothers, Ohh my sisters,

America, do you realize that the taxes that you pay
Feed the forces that traumatize my every living day
So if I won't be here tomorrow
It's written in my fate
May the future bring a brighter day
The end of our wait

Ooohh, let's not cry tonight, I promise you one day it's through
Ohh my brothers, Ohh my sisters,
Ooohh, shine a light for every soul that ain't with us no more
Ohh my brothers, Ohh my sisters,

Ohh let's not cry tonight I promise you one day is through
Ohh my brothers! Ohh my sisters!
Ooh shine a light for every Soul that ain't with us no more

This ain't a story 'bout race, color or creed
It's a story 'bout hate, envy and greed
Talk about ambitions but don't want us to progress
Ya talk about assistance but all we get is the stress
You don't really wanna see me grow
Hating on me choking on my flow
You say we rude, don't like our attitude
We crude, ain't got no gratitude
But I wasn't born to be low, I was born to rise
Wasn't born to pretend or keep my faith in disguise
Ain't got no freedom of speech
No freedom to teach - make our kids out of reach
Wanna break ties - alienated in their own land
Running riot in the streets, day by day getting out of hand
You don't want me to be an inspiration
You wanna blame me for agitation
How can you tell me 'bout participation
When all you really want is segregation

Una palabra no dice nada
Why al mismo tiempo
Lo esconde todo
Como aquel viento que esconde el agua
Como las flores que esconde el lodo

[Translation:]
One word contains nothing
And at the same time
It contains everything
Like the air contains water
Like the flowers contain the mire

Is it my religion - you keep seeing as a threat 
You think it's all about - murder, violence and death
But do you care to find - find the truth
Or is it easier to keep fronting and oppressing our youth
Is this why I'm a be awestruck? 
Damn these lies just make us stuck
Bow down to something greater
Nah forget that maybe later
Really must be joking, deceits and lies is all I see
Should I be your enemy or should I trust your lies
Should your treatment of my peeps make us forge them ties
Got to tell me the truth as it is
Or we'll be keeping coming back right here to this
Second class citizen in my own home
Been 30 years gone - and still no dome, still gotta stay strong
Thinking I'm thick trying to sell me this hypocrisy 
Heard it before, you must be kidding me! 

Wanna dictate who I marry
And even what my sis? should wear
Then prevent her from a job
Stuck on welfare - seems
To provoke and oppress us is ok - seems
Racism is cool - despite what you say
Wanna blame us for ya shortcomings
Just want a scapegoat
Still seeing us like a problem
Like we just off the boat
Guess you wanted cheap labour to build ya home

Una palabra no dice nada
Why al mismo tiempo
Lo esconde todo 
Como aquel viento que esconde el agua
Como las flores que esconde el lodo

Una Mirada no dice nada
Why al mismo tiempo
Lo dice todo
Como la lluvia sobre tu cara
O el Viejo mapa de algún tesoro

[Translation:]
One word contains nothing
And at the same time
It contains everything
Like the air contains water
Like the flowers contain the mire

One look contains nothing
And at the same time
It contains everything
Like the rain on your face
Or an old map leading you to some treasure

Where the next Abu Dharr at?
Where the next Khalid Ibn Walid aka Sayf-Allah at? 
Tell us how we fuel this crime
Everyday statistics, everyday media - plenty of us doing time
Why should I take the blame or shame
When I know you just looking for someone to frame
My individual freedom; abused
Redicule of my deen, my beliefs, guess I be the new jew
I've become the new ni**a of the world
Product of your society, adopted your values in their entirety
Wasn't born like this, I was made this way
You like it or not, player - I'm here to stay
We walk the same streets, breathe the same air
Add to this state, but do you even care? 
Guess you gotta reciprocate
Want us to be people of faith or people of hate?
You got your deen, I got mine - okay?

Compassionate action, with purity of heart

Siempre me imagino Viejo y arrugado

Y la luz de luna a revelado
Que tu palpitar es por mi, que siempre a sido asi
He practicado que decir muchas veces
Y cuando Dios lo quiera estaremos frente a frente
Será el momento de embrujarte
Ojalá que en tus ojos me retrates
Que aceptes mi pasado, que mis locuras yo no pague
Yo te prometere mi vida

My children grown up, grandchildren by my side

Not limited by typical Bollywood scenarios
Or by statistics when problems occur we leave
?Cause I know t u´ll stay till I no longer will breathe
Or if I?m crippled, blinded or anything else
I know I can rely on u helping my every step
Love is not just limited to butterflies and sex
It?s to recognise and respect each others intellects
Lots of regrets many things we shouldn?t have said and done
But that?s just part of our journey and it?s just begun
Define beauty ?cause one day looks will fade
But a beautiful mind still be young at an old age
And I know it?s hard me being away for so long
But I respect u so much for being so strong
I remember U being pregnant going to school
Cooking food taking care of my parents and the whole house
All in one something a man could never do no doubt
So I thank my mother for the day she brought us together
And I pray for our reunion in the afterlife forever

I ain't no hater, but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin mo' (gettin' mo')
And never your feelings, he's chasin' millions fo' sho'
Uh oh (uh oh), now you 'bout to have his baby? (damn)
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much mo' livin' to do 
I'm spittin' this to you
'Cause you deserve more than what he givin' to you (that's right)

A new millennium dime-piece, so fine she
Got 'em all stuck, standin' still when she come through
Baby, take a little mo' time

Now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you? (Damn)
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those ain't my seeds, nothin' really I could do (nah)
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids
Locked down for life
Shoulda chose me
She 'bout to O.D. from the pressure
Hell nah, I won't let her

Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off nigga, what?

I do my shootin's on a knob, prayin' to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin' he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin', shots hittin' up my spot like midnight rains hailin'
Got me bailin' to stacks more green

Gods ain't tryin' to be trapped on no block slangin'
No rocks like bean pies brainstorm on the beginnin'
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion? Gods words all cursed like crack
Shaitan's way of gettin' us back or just another
One of my Black Jesus traps

Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud, Black Jesus

Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
'Cause I swear, they tryin' to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin' down at this volatile pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus

All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail

Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm

Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin' new in school I knew
E'rything I read wasn't true, Black Jesus

To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggaz pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggaz play together

We die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wishes nigga smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
I'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily

Cops patrol projects, hatin' the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous

Blast til they holy high, baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?

And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell

Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties

Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums this ain't livin' Jesus

It was more than a tragedy

Emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky
We tryin' to figure what happened
Burnin' churches, fearin' God

Who can be so cruel
We all ignorant to AIDS
Till it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans

Listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions
We should leave them a choice

Breathes and stops
All this judgement on other lives
Needs to stop

Givin' more back than takin'
On my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned
'Cause Pat Buchanan say I'm greedy

You can take my taxes, send me to war
But can't feed me
It's so easy to regret things
After they done

Babies catchin' murder cases
Scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need
Love in doses

In times like these we feel closest

It seems the good die young

Can anybody tell me why

Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin like a star

And this murder got me 
Feelin' like my death ain't far
And the land of stolen cars
Don't get no better

Don't get no weaker or no harder

And my father

I'm making money moves mandatory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture niggas we rushing and still busting
Til the cops come running, duck in abandoned buildings
Ditching my gun, homeboy the motherfucking villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legit list
So I laugh til I cry, when the law come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds
In a dirty bitch, waiting to trick me, not the life for me
Living carefree, til I'm buried, and if they dare me
I'm busting on niggas until they scurry, I'm clearly
A man of military means in my artillery
Watching over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Selling dope to all the fiends, at times I want to cry
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowing if this game'll last, feeling ashamed
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I selling my soul?
Got tired of small time livin, niggas telling me no
I got mine! Fuck them other suckers! That's the mentality

Listen tho' I'm missing dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell no, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words

They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuck son
Dying luck none supply us with much guns

Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they coming for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me? Getting blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walking close to my third, I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for busters
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler

O-U-T, L-A-W-Z ain't nuttin' fuckin' with that
We bustin' back comin' back for the stacks
Laugh last cash cash, all I want is the paper
Givin' them fuckers tool whips, I rule haters

The boss niggas, definitely, put it down strictly
E.D.I. Amin, until the law come for me
Kill em all for shortie, ninety-nine Killuminati

They got me thinkin' strugglin' and hustling's my only fate
Toppin' grams on the kitchen plate, tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is rollin' three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preoccupied by the greed, in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's simpin' naughty thangs
Real as these tatt's on my body, and it's Killuminati

Outlawz,"Uh, dear Mr. President
Whats happenin'?
I'm writin' you because, shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin' changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected, they ain't came true

Tell me what to do, these niggas actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President (Me and my homies is wonderin' what's goin on, holla!)
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
Cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies want to die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed up
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get ride for M'Thulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops (What should I do?)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Oh you'se a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
Cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crashed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a star ship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Want to ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin' pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin' to drastic measures tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin' better
But you keep, tellin' us, that it is
While your motherfuckin' troops keep killin' our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin' with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Strapped and angry, with no hope and heart broke
Fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin' and things, squeakin' on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's'll freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President
Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
And it ain't gon' get better

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up
Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I want to meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin' let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President, hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

Word motherfuckin' life
Fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin'?
Motherfuckers crazier than a motherfuckin'?
Nigga this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz nigga

It's gettin' harder and harder for a motherfucker
To make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit, I hear you screamin' peace
But we can't find peace
Til my little niggas on these streets get a piece
I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out?
Sayin' you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the fuck I'm fightin' for?
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin', all the blacks and
Police beatin' me in the streets, fuck peace

Locked in the slammer, while I'm laid cocked back like a hammer

No difference here, with the 25 to life sentence

This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggas hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blase me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle

Outlawz,"Dear Lord
As we down here, struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch (my nigga Johnny J)
Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go
The only place for us
I know, try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my life's story
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
And can't nobody live this life for me
It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride

Somebody break me I'm dreamin', I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin' stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin' white Jesus
will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin'
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin'
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryin' to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin' to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man Ishmael Reed
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga
That Hennessey'll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, ""Keep it real G""
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry

I stay sharp as always
Runnin' ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
Dumpin' crews like two's, nigga all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems though, be placin' triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans

Now I plan to keep my glock cocked
If trouble was searchin' for me then why not?
Show em what I'm made of plus raised on, on my block
Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street, thugs snatchin' bags
We out for power, makin' cash it wasn't fast it'll make me mad
I'm just like, pimpin'
My homey on the corner with his gat tucked, in
Youngest they buckin' somethin' the life he leads
the life he don't need, don't we all know
He tryin' to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise

Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still I rise now I float cowards ghost
Whenever we come around, I'm runnin' down
clutchin' a pound, live as sirens, duckin' the sound
I used to hustle with my moms til the sun came
My homey Harm doin' time from this drug game
Stolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw
Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only ten learn to duck cops

In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blastin' bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin' ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin' more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
Leavin' ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker
and still I rise, and still I rise

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)

They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
(They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin')
(Somebody's gonna die tonight)
Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin
Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars (will they survive?)
(Two semi-automatic nines, them niggas died)
(Plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate
To death and wish they could die) So peep the lesson
But wait a minute back to Precious
She's snortin' dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus

Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets

(Don't let these ghetto streets get you, Precious)
(Was the victim, from a dime to a nickel)

Hopin' God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
(All he wanted was to be a thug)
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
(Here's where it gets ya)
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now (not knowin' he ain't the daddy)
But Precious was lonely while Lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin, now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
(Hand in hand, couldn't understand)
How his baby's mama could disappear with another man
(And his best friend)
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
Just the smoke from the cap peelin' a man with no feelings

Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Bury you dead and look ahead
A man with no feelings
Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
That's all we got left, that's all

Now with the problems of poverty
And the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die
How many'll live to tell
Although best friends before
Lil' Trigga and Mo
(They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know)
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out

Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
Think it's Lil' Mo (was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger)
(Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga)
All the while let's look at Precious
Too dumb to see what's goin' down (too doped up to ask questions)
Used to be comrades (but now we blast on sight)
What could be so bad (God, will we last tonight?)
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin' Ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin' me
They open fire, three bodies drop, so call the cops
(Precious, Lil' Mo and Trigg)

Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone
Ey QB III in this motherfucker
Teardrops and closed caskets
We dedicate this to all the fallen comrades (that's right)
All the homies that didn't make it to see this day (rest in peace)
Will I, forever be alone
Yaknahmean? I know it's hard out there, hehe
With teardrops and closed caskets
It's like that's all we got to look forward to these days
Murders, brothers dyin, funerals
Will I, forever be alone
Shit, it's like I done ran out of suits homey
I done ran out of tears
Know we gon' have to do somethin y'all
We gon' have to do somethin
Will I, forever be alone
'Cause I know all these mothers is tired of seein the same thing (rest in peace)
Teardrops and closed caskets
I send this out to M'thulu Geronimo
And to, all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers
Will I, forever be alone (to the homey Boonie, rest in peace nigga)
All the homies that fell, all the homies
May God bless your families
May you always live in the motherfuckin' heart
Will I, forever be alone
In a thug niggas heart forever (that's right)
Rest in peace nigga
May your enemies be deceased, dead on the streets
We can't have peace til the niggas get a piece

Been waking up to another muthafuckin' day
I'm the type of soldier, 
A nigga that seen 
Everything in my muthafuckin' eyes
I seen my parents get killed 
To my muthafuckin' eyes
I seen my brother kill his-self in my eyes
I seen Pac, yak, die in the struggle in my eyes
So I know anybody can be touched
You know what I mean?

Oh God forgive me
Somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents
But they was never there for me
Believe in everything they feed me 
I'm seeing demons
I wake up screaming
 Who believe me or was I dreaming?
Five fingers on the .45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this
I'm living blind writing rhymes 
Til they capture this
And if we die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes hate to see a young thug cry
They seeing us inside a casket
That's how they see us
Oh God forgive us ghetto bastards 
We human beings
They leaving us inside this hell-hole
Just waiting to fail so they tell us 
That's what jail for
Adolescence young teens turned violent
It's floating, in a world turned silent

Moving a million miles per hour
Towards my destiny
Making decisions carelessly
Yeah it's me, yo nigga man child
Bomb first stand proud
Ain't looking for hand-outs
Twenty-five years up in this bitch
And I'll be damned if I ain't leaving rich
And leave my kids a grip
I let my blood drip off in this thug shit
You can be touched, I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission
Like right now, 30 dollars to my John Hancock
Try to get mo' so my shit don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go
I pray the Lord hold me (You can be touched)

I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggas 
That ever breathed
And I was big when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My nigga, Lonnie just got hit with 10, 10 years
For trusting a friend
They left him stuck in the Penn
I love him, we all here just to die here, plus
Nobody cares what got here
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and I'll never be bored
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Y'all praise the thug ways 
So forever it's on, baby

God forbid I'm touched, y'all keep living it up
Look and learn
Next it could be your turn, word

That got me here thinking robbery
Day to day all year long 
Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught and supporting me 
So in these streets of hockey
I play the goalie, 
Secretz to war licks, and score shit
Share between clients and homies 
Remember what Patcino told me
Before he past
Watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
Cause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm point like a thong 
And it's survive for the strong

A wise hustler once told me, it's on you

Though it was dreams when he first told me Now it's true
I got love for you only to a certain extend
Niggas ain't worth shit
Cops and ride dick permits

I heard this and heard that 
About them O-you-T Lawz
Some of them soldiers got shot
Some of them soldiers fell off

Fuck y'all now everybody tied to us
Hollering out a nigga name 
But never said what up
That shit critical, despicable, unforgivable

I too like Hot?
Your own fan won't remember you
Thuggin' but we still spiritual, clear lyrical
I'm like the fuckin' Deff Squad

Now I been trapped down 
And fucked since day one
This instructional style of mine ain't no fun
Where I'm from

You sure to see about 10 niggas in a bedroom
Eating off the same spoon
Sweeping with the same broom
It's hazard, it's you don't want yo life 

Well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone
With a glock-nine young marriage
It's critical

Then one of them sat down living so 
Mystikal and impious
With a heart full of anger it's so ridiculous
So give me some with 21-gun soldier salute

With a 19-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
I'm straight from the strong, thug to your life
Right to yo wrong, I'll put the good to your evil
I'm the shells to your chrome, you dig that?

I'm life, I'll bring the moon to your night
I'll put the dick to your wife 
And I'm the Jesus of your Christ
You dig that? respect this

I'll bring the end to your claw
I'll bring the loc to your heart
And I'll put the snoop on yo dogs
You hear me? 

We follow, this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that ecstasy ain't promised tomorrow
With this two man mades
Me and my soul death astrayed

I watch my parents get blowed away
Now look what it made
I'm something to face
This lunacy then with me, then with chemistry

Got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
I'll be frying you, cause y'all don't know me

We will never fall
Through the war, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers

When we was kids, the loving felt good
But of course have the respect
Though it's even better
Now for this cheddar

Niggas is laying deader 
Then Malcom and Martin put together
Oh Lord only knows where we'll end up
Remember what 'Pac said

Watch the fuckin' signs
But we wasn't listening
Too busy trippin' off his shine
Now one time for my muthafuckin' Outlawz

Napoleon, Noble, and Kastro 
May we all roll
And if you don't know 
We got the rap game petro

Scared cause we bout to release

Yo, I've been abducted by the block
But I had to escape
Imagine my fate
Traveling and stacking the cake
After my wake
Bust 25 for me
'Cause I'll ride for y'all
And y'all ride for me

Me and my people all we want is glory in the end
I ain't gonna tell you again
Start thinking about your future nigga
No extra weight 'cause we ain't got nothing to do with you
If  time is money you wasting the clock
Pacing the block

Thinking of Pac and Yak
So we mash blinded

Till the gats find me
And you can ask 1-2
He used to be on new
And you can ask swift gotti
Don't shit get by me
Ask tommy showtime if I did my time
And you can ask L Dog if I ever felt y'all

Hmm, damn, I feel ya
Turn, nope, don't nobody care
These Outlawz feel y'all (yup)
Yeah, don't nobody care
Sometime it get like that (When it feel like don't nobody care)
It seems like nobody care (nope, not nobody)
I care though, listen

[Kastro - Verse 1]
I been so sick lately, bellyin and not achy
These issues keep me with pistols for safety
I got plans that the cops ain't included in
And not a handcuff or shell could hold em in
Right at the end of my road, who been there before?
Now that I'm dead, it's like I've been dead before
Same story, it's raw, I'm an outlaw
A bread warhead, K-Dogg is a warrior
And when I stand, I stand on my own two
If I fall, I land on my own two
A soldier, and it been like that
Pac and Yak see us now and they could see all that
Who really care? Fuck the tarry hair
And the rest of the Outlawz was without a share
Don't nobody care, just like I thought
So I just stare at the world like I don't give a fuck

[Napolean - Verse 2]
I remember them days when it was dark outside
The only thing I felt I had was my nuts and my pride
I was different than them niggaz on the block sellin drugs
But I was always with em, actin like a thug
Runnin through the mud cause the cops was on us
We just walkin home from school but they always on us
It's like this, the streets is so lovely
I love the streets, because the streets made me
The ghetto seems so in peace
Man, that I moved to the suburbs and there's more police
Where I'm from, a fiend'll pack a gun
Overton, Jersey the harder the slum
But I made it up outta there, thanks to the Lord, kid
But I'll never leave my box alone, nigga I swear (swear)
And to the young kids wearin the streets do
I know nobody don't care, but the Outlawz do (cause we do)

[Chorus - Young Noble]
We stack clips, glack licks in the air
Smoke sticks on the stairs, dog, nobody care (nobody care)
We shot the fear when everybody was there
Beat each other half to death, but homie nobody care (nobody care)
My momma wasn't there and my poppa wasn't there
Couldn't find em anywhere cause nobody cared, yeah
We split mills, pop pills and shit
Ten on the floor, ten in the bed, damn, nobody care

[Young Noble - Verse 3]
Yo, hard times as a youngsta
Scarred by the hunger, wonder
How many gonna die this summer (die this summer)
We loud like thunder roamin the strip
Now everybody act cool, we approachin the vip (come on, come on)
Smokin a stick, hit, cause we live for this (live for this)
Just like shit is hard raisin kids in this
I got 'Outlaw' tatted on my stomach and all (stomach and all)
We can fight and hang out later like nothing is wrong
Laise your Timms up tight cause the ride is rough (uh)
You can tighten my cuffs, I'm still likin the cuffs (come on)
Fuck this and that, cause I'mma get you back (uh-huh)
I know you mother fuckers sick and wish that I couldn't rap
Hatin already waitin till my pockets is fat (uh)
Would you rather see me incarcerated, locked in the back? (come on)
Cockin a strap, have your whole block in a gat (yeah)
Every body down flat, where them dollars at? (uh, oh yeah)

[EDI Mean - Verse 4]
I put my faith in the Lord, pray for patience in war
Now only time'll tell if he heard me before
I see myself in the mirror, young nigga full of flaws
But in the streets, I'm a hero cause I give it to em raw
I'm just my momma's second son, and I just bought me a gun
Cause some niggaz want some, and I ain't got nothin for em
Me and my niggaz stay hungry, strivin for the old and gray money
Ridin while these niggaz think it's funny
But ain't a damn thing funny to a nigga like me (nah)
When you sittin on your ass broke and thirty
And don't nobody care about your sob story (nah)
I work so hard homie, you better be about your money (homie)
Oh yeah, it goes both ways, and momma used to say
'The Lord'll help those who help themselves'
I keep my eyes on the prize so there ain't no chance for me fail
Cause don't nobody give a fuck when you livin in hell

Chorus x 2",Nobody Cares
Outlawz,"Verse 1: Young noble 

Yo 
I don't want no open caskets 
Don't be crying to me 
I don't want nobody standing there lying to me 
Talking about if you was there you would've died for me 
Took 5 for me 
Shoot blind for me 
Save the pipe dreams dog 
I'm gonna be aiight 
And even if I die tomorrow 
I'm gonna be aiight 
The only time I see my family 
When a relative die 
When you gone 
No pain 
Is it better to die 
Baby girl think I'm shy 
But I'm crying inside 
No tears in the jungle 
I'm a lion inside 
Nigga don't cry 
Like I said on the song 
God forbid I die early 
Please accept that I'm gone 
I lived mine 
Accomplished a lot in my time 
Soldier 
I sold mils for Pac 
Still I Rise 
You sympathize 
But I don't need it all 
But while we hearing breathing 
With the love that y'all 
We Outlawz 

Chorus 2x : Edi 

Some day 
One day we gotta go 
When and where 
Whom and why 
Nobody knows 
But when that day comes 
I'm ready to roll 
'Cause they won't roll when I go 

Verse 2: Edi 

Man 
Shit ain't right 
Yo it just ain't adding up 
My closest is gone 
I'm mad as fuck 
I'm more hurt than anything 
Not knowing what to do 
Completely wrapped up in confusion 
No clues 
Trusting other niggas thinkin shit is all gravy 
Mind unfocused 
'Cause I'm smoking daily 
Rolling with big ass body guards 
Niggas 
No guns 
Supposed to be protecting your ass 
He having fun 
Man fuck a vest 
My nigga did with one on 
Too much of a shock to my brain 
I could not mourn 
Do not shed a tear 
Close my eyes 
Said a prayer 
Hoping the lord let him in when he got there 
Still ride for Pac and Yak 
Seike too 
Still fucking the world 
You know how Edi do 
But I'm still crippled by the pain 
Still feel like I'm to blame 
Still want to go insane everytime I here your name man 

Chorus 2x 

Verse 3:  Kastro 

They say blood's thicker than water 
And I say love is thicker than blood 
Who's wrong 
And what's love 
With no honor and trust 
So I'd rather not bother 
Nothing much to discus 
These cards 
Dealt by God 
To my table 
Ain't the best 
And pretty much unstable 
And I don't know 
My friend from my foe 
So I move fast 
Think about shit slow 
Rightfully so 
I got my gun 
And walk through the slums 
Bubbling like gum 
Wide open 
I think I need more Motrin 
These streets is hot 
Man these bitches is smoking 
And everybody for out for self out here 
Man ain't no love left out here 
Just blood in my eye 
I can't even cry 
I wonder why 
So I don't even try 

Chorus  4x",When I Go

[Kastro - Chorus]
You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
You know a million people die everyday
Breathin' in second hand smoke
You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
Did you know a million people die everyday
Breathin' second hand smoke

[Young Noble]
I'm like a ball of smoke
Blown from a crackpipe
Into the hands of the street
My.. father to be since the age of 5
Real cold you gotta be just to stay alive
We the second hand smoke of a fiend generation
Swear we will
But they know we won't make it
Smoking a ciggarete
Breathin' ya last breath
Tasting my own death
Rest on my home steps
And just vision all the karma and all the drama
Inherited the pain of a lost father
Heavy black raining
With no umbrella
Life's like a dice game
You can throw whatever
And it might not be in your favor
And now ya worst enemy becomes ya neighbor
And that's life
Everything happens twice
Breathin' second hand smoke from my ancestors' pipes
(God help us)

[Kastro - Chorus]
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
You know a million people die everyday

[Napoleon]
The streets dog gave birth
Another nutty baby
Plus the son of a ghetto widow might make him crazy
On his own since he 16
Turning the block out
Sleep in the crack house
Making his cash routes
Fiendin' on the side
This nigga scheming on the side
This nigga....
Cream is always on his mind
Ain't been the same since he bought that .9
Promised him a life of crime
But he ain't been the same since he bought that .9
He was once a child of god
But he ain't been the same since he bought that .9
Listen to me closely
I'ma tell you how it roast me
He's a victim of second hand smoke and choking
It's only cause he lonely cause his father ain't home
Became a victim of the gunsmoke..... he gone (damn)
Second hand smoke

[Kastro - Chorus]
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
You know a million people die everyday
Breathin' in second hand smoke

Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
Did you know a million people die everyday
Breathin' second hand smoke

[Kastro]
I'm all the way real
And you could see it in my grill
And I can't chill
Too much my blood don' spilled
I give you the deal
Just to see if you can feel
I grind for mines
I don't cheat and I don't steal
I'm about a half a mil from a half a mil
And I'd still be this real without a rapper deal
And thus.... I fight a truck for a pot of luck
And bite dust so my kids don't hurt this much
We come a long way
Still we got lots to learn
We.... toss and turn like a roster burn
So I'm concerned
Youngster, I'm still amongst ya
We grew up in the sewer
Raised up in the dumpsters
It's like we all suffer for somebody other
Born from my daddy to my baby mother
All my folks
All born with high hopes
Crying.... dying from second hand smoke

[Kastro - Chorus]
You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke
Dog trust me
It ain't no joke
Did ou know a million people die everyday
Breathin' second hand smoke
You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke
Fuckin with them folks
You gon' choke

All you fag niggaz gotta move on

Hold the fuck up nigga why you lookin so tough
You don't know that I'm an outlaw and I'll fuck you up
Punk nigga, the street change everyday,
But I'ma change a long will 'cause the streets where I lay
Nowadays it ain't about runnin your mouth
It's bout (gun cocked) and (gunshots); assed out
Turnin me out nigga, I turn the streets out
With this underground thug shit that killers come out
Where the gunz be at, where the money be at
I stand full, nothin but the uncut shit I'm hardcore
And ain't nothing changed since back in the day
Just new money frays and new hand grenades
When the war pops off I'ma knock the street lights off
y'all some paper back soldierz nigga you too soft
And killin in my raps I'm too real for that
But if I say I'ma do it, if you say you have too, prove it to me

[chorus]
It ain't nothin but a freshin to me
And if ya fuckin with me,
Then you can die if you want to nigga
And all my life I had issues with me

The street made a slight killah for me
And if you soft too me
Then you can die if you want to nigga
You act tough
And you can die if you want to nigga
You in a rush
And you can die if you want to nigga

I'm a street nigga, check my background
I did a couple of driveby's with the fo-pound
And I was never ever scared to bust a couple of rounds
It's all in me, my whole family was raised wrong
Nigga, my whole team strong, buck buck, double glock dead wrong
And imitatin Pac nigga, you know you wrong
And runnin your mouth will get a gun in your house
There is money down south so I gotta take some
There is money on the west coast I gotta chase some
There is money on the east coast I gotta take some
So I bought me a gun, I'm bout to rob everyone
It's like a 2000 jack the rapper, fall down
Empty down your pockets nigga and pass it around
And what was you thinkin when Pac was around
He wasn't trainin Outlawz to burn shit down
I strategize for the dough dough, cock block with the fo-fo
send four more at the po-po, his whole ass like Zorro
it's real nigga so I'ma bleed for mine
with money on my mind I'ma get it, it's mines nigga

Loyalty....
Some of why'all niggaz don't even know what the fuck that is
A whole lot of niggaz (yeah)
Some of why'all niggaz'll never know Loyalty
want to hate on me?
Nigga fuck you and yo family
I stay true to what I know and that's Outlaw (who?)
It ain't no me in this muthafucka without why'all

We went from nothing to something 
Hustlin' and bubblin' 
And ain't ask niggaz for nothin' (shit) 
Shit that made other cliqs I split 
Made us tighter
Fuck the industry
Cause I ain't no dick rider
You see me nigga
I ain't lost a pound
Still eatin', still breathin' 
Still reackin' off that cali shit
And I ain't never want muthafuckas to handle shit
You see me pushin' .22's? 
Nigga handle it
Feelin' good like we just won a championship
New money, new label 
Keep it crackin' bitch
And I'ma get the last laugh 
You can count on it
And stay away from you mutherfuckas that's counterfeit
Loyalty..................... snitch ass nigga

Somethin' bout loyalty
It always avoided me
As far as my eyes can see
I can only depend on me
What's loyalty?

[Edi - repeat 2X]
It's like a jungle sometimes
We keep on hustlin'
But they want to take us under, under, under

[Napoleon]
God damn I'm glad you set it off
Used to be hard
Now you just went soft
Poison, young nigga, bitch to society
Once had love for em
Why the fuck he lied to me?
Kicked out the crew cause his soul ain't strong
Started sniffin' herion
Nigga you wrong
And I ain't never hang around fag ass niggaz
Rappin niggaz alseep in the county ass niggaz
My family strong like the mafia
It ain't no thang to put a slug through ya
Scary ass nigga
Damy ass nigga
won't throw rice in a wedding ass nigga
Loyalty

[Kamikaze]
I can't stand the fake and the snake never
Worse the betrayal
You scared of the heat muthafucka? 
Stay away from the barrel
And I ain't never been a rat
Or been scared to ride
A lot of niggaz act tough
But know they pie inside
Death before dishonor
But you really scared to die
We could spit a verse about you
We put yo life on the line
Military mind ain't never put his nose on the line
A real souljah never retreats
When it's time for a crime

[Young Noble]
Hey yo....
You can talk that shit
But how many of why'all can do what we did?
Muthafuckas talkin' bout the Lawz ain't shit
Bitch ass nigga should get off the Lawz dick
Muthafuckas mad that we got our own label

What's Loyalty?
When a nigga say he love you
But all awhile he don't think nothin' of you
And that's just what love do
Stab ya in the heart
Grab you in the dark
And rip families apart
Damn... we was supposed to be fam
We had plans
Now I claim to understand you
I guess life is a gamble
I shook the dice
But I betted on the peasent
Then I took a dive
Like oohhhhh.... 
How come I ain't know
I should've seen it was simply soul
Now I know.... what's loyalty
It's all clear to me
These words is for the birds
You ain't real to me
Life is a liar
Got me spinning like the tires
Hug a drunk driver, back and forth
you ain't ready and you petty
So I laugh it off
But it's a cost to be the boss
You gon' pay for not being loyal

[Ed Bone]
My life's a blessin'
My life's a lesson
And if it's ride or die
There ain't no question
ain't no time for second guessin'
We ain't bustas
Niggaz ain't new to this shit
We some muthafuckin' ridahs
And why'all niggaz is the opposite
I sense bitch like a dog sense fear
So why'all better act right
Anytime that I'm near
Live in yo ear
Everyone's a ridah in here
Cross game
Watch them ridahs appear

That's where I'm from..... man

This is our life
Even tho' the sun don't always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright
In living your life

[Napoleon]
I'm damn near 'bout to go in tears
Writin' this verse here
I feel like I'm cursed here
I'm choked up since I lost my peers
But I know one day we be back again
One love to my Mexicans
Tryin' to run across the border
To see freedom all over again
Man... One love to my Africans
They try to kill us with AIDS
But they smart again
It's like I die once that I be born again
With the grace of Allah
Kept away my sins
From the ghetto where they play with heavy metal to win
Lost my parents so I moved with my next-of-kin
Life.... just so mych pain to me
To tell the truth I don't want to die angrily
Makaveli and Kadafi, them trained me
I feel y'all in the dark steady hatin' me

This is our life
Even tho' the sun don't always shine
It's still our life
If you keep yo head up everything will be alright

In '96 we was on top of the world
Videos, movies, money, jewels and girls
Rolls Royces, Hummers, Jagz and all that
Hard to believe one night in Vegas changed all that
Fast forward... 6 years
Man, we still here
Despite be hated on (huh) 
We still clear
Until the end of time you can't stop destiny
Back for everything they owe
Now let's go

[Young Noble]
I got the spirit of a angel
The heart of a soldier
The mind of a militant
Was blessed by my mother
The inspiration of my life
She 4 years clean
With 15 years on the pipe
And she just got married
I felt pain... ya sayin' Pac smilin' at the wedding
Never forget her mah'
y'all baby fool, I promise to ya Imma stay a trooper

We forever move

Oh... I'm on, pens and needles
Needles and pens
These 2 Tims was my Beemer
Before I heard of a Benz
I got lost tryin' to find my ends
And got crossed tryin' to find me a friend
That's life.... 
We sacrifice for better days
We pray for a better way that never came
Hey! (hey.. hey)
What's more precious then a innocent child, smilin'
??? was foul, look at his smile
School's not cool
Them big body rules
The workin' mans a fool
If he can't afford the jewels
Look at how life use ya
Abuse and confuse ya
Remember we was suppose to be the future?
Now we grown
The future is here and we gone
Oh where did we go wrong
Let's live...
And do right by these kids my friend
They the only shot we got at living life again
c'mon

This is our life
Even tho' the sun don't always shine

She can spend that shit on me
Instead of mines up
Bringin' it back to the days when it first started
Bringin' it back to the ways that were cold-hearted
Noble farted like my shit don't stink
I like her mouth real wet
Her pussy real pink

But don't nobody notice it really you feel me, we must rise

(Verse 2-Napoleon)
Pause nigga 'fore these shells fall with ya
'Bout to four fifth ya, still don't get the picture
Thuggin on 'em actin sleep when I'm plottin on 'em
This little bitty bullet will make his body turn rotten on 'em
Sick them rottweiler's on him, did snatch some dollars from him
Bling bling that punk nigga, take the diamonds from him
Never had no love for him, nigga we solo
Passin out bullets like they promo
Oh no, Outlawz comin through
Nothin but trouble too, we still do the shit that Pac used to do
Who would of knew, that I'd be pointin guns at you
Takin funs from you, makin fun at you
Busta, ain't nothin but a Jersey ride nigga
Have my fanny so white, enough to sniff lines nigga
Napoleon, a.k.a Maximus 
My plans for this, is rise up, stack chips, nigga rise

(Chorus-Kastro)
We was taught, at all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss
And countin big funs is the favorite sport
We must rise, maximize our size
Look alive, be advised it's a war outside
It's like dodge city, not pretty
But don't nobody notice it really you feel me, we must rise

(Young Noble)
Addicted to adrenaline rush
That the streets give off from 5-0 when the heat bust off
And I paint it the same 'cause I mastermind
And every game ain't the same gotta change with the times
And get left behind, blessed by God
The judge tryin to stretch the charge
Young niggaz gotta rise up fuck the narcs 
Motha fuckaz can't take orders
You ain't a souljah nigga don't blame Noble
It's the life of ya kid 25 to life bid
Four five to wig, dyin tryin to live
The streets is a restin place and yesterday
And nigga ain't no such thing as extra pay
So give me mine today, and get yours tomorrow
Nigga Pac left the Thug Life love to follow
And I'm O-you-T loyal 'till my casket drop
Hustle hard 'till it's hard for the cash to stop, we must rise

(Big Syke)
Makaveli Kadafi, meant to Big Kato
Only ridaz in this day that's killin willin and able
Gang related incorporated, you can't fade it 
Haters gotta hate and ridaz glad that we made it
Make it take it to the next level
Now change the game, fuck the fame
Bang 'em scrape on the hang
It ain't no thang to rise above the rest
Pass any test, you mention Thug Life you mention the best
So invest in a vest, come bang with the best
The sunrise in the East but my set in the West
Still risin for my nigga Stretch, keep a tech
My paper stay risin whether cash or check

(Chorus-Kastro)
At all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss
And countin big funs is the favorite sport

So many stories in the city I live in
I soak up the game, that everyone plays
I'm not the one so when they get caught sleepin
Out for the glory, there's so many stories around my way

It's been hard on us, day by day
Watchin my step gotta play where I lay
Now why this mother fucker want to test me out
It's this thang I'ma protect myself and blow his brains out

Cold on the streets never talk on the phone
And the main thing is never bring a snake in your home
But that's hard black, why?
'cause half the time them niggaz be in your face

smilin and shit but you don't know that
And I don't know why that nigga jealous of me
When he could do the same shit that pay me
In the streets breed a lot of killaz

That's why corners full of hate and the young ones is cap peelers 
But they don't feel us when we're drownin in our own blood
And they don't know when we go home it's no love
So what's the use of us carin and shit
And that's the reason we buy guns, load 'em up and spit 'em at shit

I know niggaz that was kings that turned into fiends
The nigga lost everything jewels and dreams
He losin teams, the murder rate higher than ever
Niggaz need more than weed gettin higher than ever

Nuts in the streets my roots ain't nothin but deep
Niggaz roam with the heat just for somethin to eat
Niggaz sell to under covers then snitch on they brothers
Everybody sayin fuck us, I know God love us

(Mil a.k.a Hellraza)
I was raised when I cried in the household
Turned me into a nut
But these niggaz didn't know 
Just from bein home I seen enough before I learned the streets

I knew all about a gun 'cause my background was deep
A little dirty nigga holdin my pants when I run
It's a chance you gotta take everyday in the slums
This for the hoods where, certain people scared to come
I had a heart as a young nigga, now I don't fear none

I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
What more can I say it been that way a long time
And anybody, who think that rude
Can suck my dick until they spit my baby girl need food

I was young, when Pac put my hands on a gun
And told me life is what you make it
And stripes you gotta take them
It took a while for me to over stand

I was only 12 but I felt like a grown man
And livin on, and that which does not kill me can only make me strong
But ya'll niggaz don't hear me though
My souljah story, for glorious pain

While I'm game you niggaz playin, played out and lame
This shit hurt, my mind blind my dick in the dirt
And I'm so sick of bein tired, and tired of bein hurt
I search out the truth, and that shit worse

I swear it's a curse that the church can't nurse, come on

The dawn comes after the night
And there's a silver lining surrounding every cloudy day
Seems like hard times been a friend of mine I can't shake
Still I rise with a clique of thugs they can't break
Pain mixed with rain and no sunshine
And all we wanted was to be happy just one time
We had no choice, no voice, only our faith in God
And the hunger to hustle and get this paper, Lord
Out in the cold, lost souls, nowhere to go
Hooked up with Jay [Name] then we found a home
See, with y'all on the side the world can be against ya
And they still gon' lose, that's the realer
Feel us, we ain't killers, we just riders for the have-nots
Cause some of us ain't got it all, tucked in a stash spot
Oh yes, we're back, baby, run and tell a friend

Waitin for revolution, with a love for shootin
At each other, even brothers kill each other stupid
And that's the way it been since I could remember
Born into a storm 3rd day of December

Popped out mommy twat, how did it come to this?

I know this young nigga who love to keep his gun in his pants
14, little Ant will snatch your shit to enhance
He lost his moms at a early age, pops was cracked out
His brother ran a drug house where they slept with they Mac's out
And where we from, fuck them basketball teams
And your neighborhood PAL cause it's all about makin cream
He stayed dirty, copped a clip for thirty
He'd rather be sellin drugs early instead of young, black and nerdy
He had his hard hat, born ready for war
This young nigga heart's gone and I saw this before
He lived day by day, prey by prey, stray by stray
Blunted on Chancellor Ave. 380 hallway
He bought a AK and I know he gon' sway, it ain't no damn way
That this young nigga can turn his life around, mang
Now where is God when you need him, he's internally bleedin
Little Ant's barely breathin but he gotta stay eatin
So he robs again but this time he all smoked out
He put his finger on the trigger and let the death fly out
Some man got hit, he's layin on the pavement stiff
Blood drippin from his face and he drownin in it
Now what a surprise that little Ant can't come around
That it's his own man dead on the ground
Dead on the ground

Baby girl, I can see you in that crazy world
Spinnin out of control, nowhere to go
At one point in time, huh, you could've been mine
But you was movin too fast, couldn't take the chance in losin yo ass
In high school, we was homies, but that was before we
Started keepin each other from bein lonely
With my mama workin all the time and your daddy drinkin
Sneakin, tryin to bump and grind, what is he thinkin?
We escaped in each other, became friends before lovers
More like sister and brother, at least we can trust us
But I had dreams, yeah, my plane leavin soon
Had to hook up with Pac, huh, continue to bloom
I called twice just to see if you alright
Both times you wasn't home, I knew somethin was wrong
And then I knew I was right, when they said they found you one night
Barely holdin on, tell me where did you go wrong?
Was it when you started strippin for tips?
Then sellin it for mo' chips?
And sniffin powder just to deal with it
Can you tell me, I guess that you can't
Cause I'm hearin you about to take your last dance
Let the game get the best of you, baby
Shoulda called on a Law, he was testin you, baby
But now you gone before you can be found

I love him to death but bullshit he stays in it
I'm gettin older [Name] middle school around the corner
The drug dealers need and teach what they want to
""Moms, can I go to the park and play?""
Didn't play, I was countin every single cent them niggas made
Then his moms lost her job, no more money-stackin
On her way home she slipped on some ice and caught a back spasm
And that's what happened to Aline
She said she had lotta pains, just an excuse to be a fiend
Low on food, though it was good what my mama made
But you know a hungry nigga at school can't concentrate
be	 to an F student
Think about the bitches and the sneakers, my whole childhood ruined
I made my first sale ( ? ) in a alley way in 164
I was scared as shit
I wasn't scared of the cops though, this is true
I was more scared of what mom duke'd do
So I chilled for a few instead of ( ? )
Spent weekends with my peeps just escapin the block
Little [Names], I knew em since seven
We had a room, they had a house, just no way to compare it
But they parents taught me shit and gave me shit
Fed me, treated a nigga just like family

It's on again, young niggas born again
I wish somebody coulda told me then
That we was gon' grow up to be some lonely men
Now I found out I really don't got friends
Cause nobody come around when I not spend
I walk around this fuckin planet feelin boxed in
Smokin stoge after stoge like it's oxygen
When there was 10 of us we all ate from one dub
Let's turn the dirt to glory for Pac up above
Yak one love, I know you gotta be free
Havin conversations with you when there's nobody but me
I guess whatever don't kill me make me stronger
But I don't know if I can take it any longer
But I got to, cause family live they dreams through us
It's like 5 million lost souls that cling to us
But I know one thing, it ain't shit without y'all

Just made 2, drugs and love made my daddy split
Mama's now forced to turn a boy into a man
Impossible task, still she doin all she can
And I'm growin quickly, slowly started seein things
All the wrong in this world, taught me not to believe in things
Not even man, cause we all change daily
Best friends be tryin to bring each other death quickly
Only the strong survive
As long as I'm alive I ride
Hooked up with some niggas that I knew had my side
O-you-t-l-a-w-z
Me for you, you for me eternally

And all I got left is my Outlaw niggas
My cousins and my brothers and some Jersey drug dealers
I keep my faith in the Lord and stay strugglin
He keep on pushin me forward to stay hustlin
And when Pac died nobody never knew
Or gave a fuck on what the Outlawz was goin through
We kept your heads to the sky and our guns too
We had to ask straight for a dollar to split a cold brew
And through the process our family was still dyin
I got a grip of this shit, there's no complyin
And I'ma be the solid rock that I am, nigga
And I'ma give it all I got to raise my kid, nigga
I got the blood of Malcolm X in me
I got the dirt from the cemetery runnin in me
One way up and that's how we goin, nigga
Now put guns up, the world ain't friendly, nigga

And just wait, I bet you try to up your salary

Chorus x2",Don't Look Now
Outsidaz,"[Az-Izz]
I'm Az-Izz, y'all can't stop me
Make a G a day sellin stolen drop three's
Ain't nuttin funny, run up on you when its sunny
Pump two in your tummy, all for the money
When I coped the five, with the Batman eyes
You could ride, but first hustlin ?Q-4-5's?

[Young Zee]
Yeah, yeah
Niggas live for it, niggas die for it
End up on the run, with thirty-five warrants
Ya boy will get'choo shot with'cha gun
Leave you layin there screamin at the top of your lungs
Zee rob white guys with nice lives
I'm tight cocked, only mess with girls that got five jobs
Do crack wit'choo, sit around and they laugh 
Those same niggas get you for a pound and a half
Beef start, better keep the spark
'cause a fool and his money will soon depart

Chorus: Zee (Outsidaz)

I'm tryin to keep money (Keep money, money, money)
Deep money (Deep money, money, money)
Weed money (Weed money, money, money)
Leave my seed money (Seed money, money, money)
I need trick money (Trick money, money, money)
Quick money (Quick money, money, money)
Get me real rich money (Rich money, money, money)
I need... (Money, money, money)
I need... (Money, money, money)

[Yah Yah]
Yo...
You on the frozen budget, I'm holdin dutches
Anything I want to do, I goes and does it
I'ma shine like a pile of golden nuggets
Catch me in GQ posin rugged
Nasty fellow, pick my nose in public
Wipe the snot on my clothes, shockin the hoes
Chillin with Chris, smokin pot in the Rolls
For the love of money, I'ma stay down
Trade pounds, and jail bound
Bringin drugs on the Greyhound

[Denzy]
Yo yo
Aiyyo, Denzy, Benz Jeep, ten freaks behind me
(I like) M-P's and rhymin
(I like) M3's and diamonds
(I just) empty the nine if you attemptin to rob 'em
Start wilin', gettin money from bricks from Long Island, uhh
Give me that paper dogg, I gotta have it
White ?liver? pockets so money is automatic
We done bought the carrots
And you still lookin sorta savage
there's a whole lotta money out there, you oughtta grab it

Chorus

[DU]
My creation is free basin, replaced 'em
Won't see do on VH1, you's a wannabe DJ Run
We lace blunts, peer pressure
At least take some, he play dumb
Always and forever heat wavin
Put a mask on y'all meet Jason
This paper need chasin
Roll with teenagers, smokin green acres
Smell that free fragrance, that's bomb weed baby

[Nawshis]
Keep your raps up, you'll be the king
Shoutin ""Can't nobody do me a thing""
With mad jewelry to bling
Sittin chunky, then dip this honey
Pushin Excursions and Suburbans, gettin money
If these fake players and playa'rettes
They get me major vexed
I wave a tech, have 'em comin out they Avirex
So your ?willie pad? is gettin recalled
I'ma teach all y'all to speed ball

Chorus x2 with some variations","Money, Money, Money"
Outsidaz,"""We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn""
Outsidaz' Night Life
""Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon"" 
Outsidaz' Night Life

This rap hell has got skells and mac twelves
Over past gels, crack sales, and blackmails
When your people get clocked it hurts
They quit thuggin, run and join a baptist church
We pushin white see-3's with five TV's
The Outsidaz, its on the Night Life EP

See, Axe the trife type, live the Night Life
Amongst dark alleys and bright lights
A heist might, end it all for the right price
Guess who's back in the house, Axe and the Outs
The wack crap you yappin about get you cracked in the mouth
Want to be president, put me in office
My old ??? ran for European horses
Skiing off cliffs, G'ing off this
Rob banks, clearin Porsches
Me and Nawshis, y'all shoulda been being cautious

My Night Life'in, make cats get liars
When Axe pass the striker, I rapid fire
Nauseous, I'm main coursin', no appetizer
The emcee sacraficer, like a rap messiah
Run up on you, 'specially if that balls sellin
Catch him on stage, get put in a full nelson
This the O-you-T flow, for rappers finito
But'cha girl could get the EP tho'

""What'choo want, what'choo want, what'choo want, what'choo want?""

You corn like the cereal Pops
Get ripped torn over my stereo box
Ya'oufits on like stretch and pops weapons cocked
Get skipped like records, then I'm stretchin ya drop
Out's, we love cream, guns, and bitches
Don't trust fiends, nuns, and snitches
Want funds and riches, bombin sisses
Plus we out for fame like Bonnie and the Pointer sisters

You could feel it
The floors is shakin, wars is wagin'
Across the northern nations
All before daylight savings
The Night Life on location
Gun and smoke risin' like undertoe lake reservations
Under y'all faces, its hip hop John Wayne ?Gaisees?
With laced weed and bass beats
We got grow six, explosives, and overdoses
For you and your associates
While we sweep the coast'es's
Outsidaz transendin
The hip hop world as you know it, is now at an endin'

This rap hell has got skells and mac twelves
Over past gels, crack sales, and blackmails
When your people get clocked it hurts
They quit thuggin, run and join a baptist church
We pushin white see-3's with five TV's
The Outsidaz, its on the Night Life EP

Roll up the crime crime, organized crime dime
Between love and hate there's a fine line
Some people hate how we gettin it, some people ride mine
Cheer for me like they got pom-poms in the nine-nine
We straight rockin it, two G, we lockin shit
Outsidaz' Night Life a gift to the provocative

Where I'm from we miss Biggie
Flip keys, so if you stick with me
Its strictly bright lights and big cities
No dough, its a lotta caffeine, gotta have cream
That's why we run this rap scene like a Carl Lewis track team
D-you'a, representin New Jay-ruz
Pump six holes in you like pool tay-bles

Yeah, we stack dough get wet like tadpoles
Y'all fags though nigga, all pussy like black gold
With the mack fold, punk you ain't gon' do shit
Don't pull it out if you ain't gon' use it
These are the last days before I get cast weight
Its a must, I have to Rock Hard like Cafe
Mother

Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?

[Az-Izz]
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outs in a fear of family presents

Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies

[Pace Won]
Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block,

I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what?

Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

[Chorus]

[Slang Ton]
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever want to get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills

Or steal my reel-to-reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsiders, we hot as Hell's flames is

And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges

[Eminem]
I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?)
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha)
Right off the top, then go back to the top
And then repeat it (Ha)

Write it down on the paper
And still be able to read it (Sorry)
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear)
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!)

I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outs for ten thou-sand years
([Pace Won] So done, here?)
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear

Lauryn, huh? Hill?
([Pace won] There's more than one?)
What? You want me to stop? Here?

[Chorus]

[Young Zee]
Yeah
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
'Til she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outs never pay cabs

Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave
Yea, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome?
We selling twenty million albums

Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack

[Axe]
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace

Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee

Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me

Yeah, Outsida style, yo Axe, D.U., Nawshis, come down!

[D.U.]
See me in a wool cap, black boots, takin' Prozac
Gives me a rush like a full back
When my niggas wild out they don't act human
I punch out gorillas lookin' like Pat Ewing

[Axe]
Pull out the gat, clap to it; no protection from the blow
Smith & Wesson turn your bulletproof vest into a robe
On another level, dig it, with the metal spitted
Beef got settled with it, roam the ghetto (?) rockin' devil fitteds

[D.U.]
Yeah, Axe...
Underneath their ski masks haters be mad
See me in the green Jag' playin' Sega Dreamcast
Sometimes I be on some He-Man shit
Pilted up, more sticks than tree branches

[Axe]
We can't miss
Ill like Arabic soldiers, bustin' shots at cop cars
Blowin' shit up, yellin' (???????)
Hardcore cats, gettin' dough like pop stars
Ski pulled out the glock, turned your block to hot tar

[D.U.]
Now, before the beef get any further
I make y'all see-Murder like Master P's brother
I pack a 4-4 nozzle that's so-so-colossal
Now when I cock it back it'll blast off both nostrils

In the Bricks I get drunk and hang warriors
Plus there's more than four of us; y'all can ride assorted nuts
I make niggas trade places like Mortimer
Slaughter 'em 'til their house boarded and girl's been fucked

[Nawshis]
We be ridin' through your block slow, like 5-0
And hit up your Tahoe with more shots than Dialo
Call me Nawshis, poison's my blood
I'm more than a thug and iller than the boys in your hood

[Yah Yah]
Gats, you know I ride aimin' 'em, gray titanium
Buttin' niggas over the fist in Shea Staduim
Ever since the raid I gotta wait because I wave the gun
Save the lump, Outz blazin' up with laminated rum

[Nawshis]
Comin' through the back door
Nawshis spits like chewin' tobacco, two in your backbone
I'm tweakin' lungs like Cheech & Chong's (?) bong
y'all ain't seein' mine like Peeping Tom bein' blind

[Yah Yah]
Boys, you'll lose if you ain't glocked up, payin' your dues
Plus the college don't fuck with the neighborhood schools
Got tools, better sleep with a pair
'Cause Brick layers start sprayin' right after early mornin' prayer

[Nawshis]
Catch us swervin', son; chickens chirpin' from me workin' 'em
Sippin' Bourbon rum, not givin' a fuck like a virgin nun
You herbs is done when I start releasin'
Call the preist in; I got a indecent art of beefin'

Outsidaz,"Is it, I loose my cool, every once in a blue moon
Leave a girl stranded in a hotel room
Cuz ain't nothin' worse then flirtin' and teasin'
Trynna lift the skirt (I'm a virgin) I'm leavin'
You a virgin? You know you do this often
You're thing is so deep you can drown a school of dogs in
It's like every M.C., she done did it
Redman tapped, Lil' Weezy done hit it
Even them Boys from the Beastie done did it
Lil' Cease and R&B singers split it
Rumor has it from word of mouth
That ya thing's more dirtier than the dirty south
And I keep model chicks screamin' out, he a dog
Bust his ears hard, now she look like Nia Long
So, cute girls come jump in my ride
And all you buffalo gals go round the outside

I'm leavin', I think I'll take the plane
It's the same, and nothing's ever changed
Sorry, beggin' you, I'll blow the range
Since we be owed to you, was actin' strange
I, never thought that I
Could ever be wit such a guy, would always cheat and lie

She fell in love wit a star, the life, the car
The ""HUH, HUH, HAH!!""
Open like what wit a butt like Kim
When I seen it, it made me wanna nut right then
Yo, we got fly, we talked, she stopped bye
Lit the choc' lye, and passed it clockwise
Let me knock the boots, 'Til I was cock-eyed
And now she trynna act like she ain't got time
I told her, think of this before you try to be foul
There's ladies at the bar that could be buyin' me rounds
And all type models that be eyein' me down
I stay and you say good-bye to me now?
Fuck that, diss me, that's what's up here
You better get ya fat ass back up stairs
And if you try to creep, I'mma tie you in the basement
Catch ya little boyfriend and beat his little face in

I'm leavin', I think I'll take the plane
It's the same, and nothing's ever changed
Sorry, beggin' you, I'll blow the range
Since we be owed to you, was actin' strange
I, never thought that I
Could ever be wit such a guy, would always cheat and lie

Now all my sisters in the place
No matter what the race, we share a common cause
Everything be everything, get treated like a queen
'Til we give up the drawers
Now just when I thought, everything was cool
Let a brother even have a key
I said I let him use the car, then he took it too far
Brother out there cheatin' on me
Time to face the truth, when I really didn't want to
How the hell all these hoes keep gettin' my number?
Who was it? A distant cousin, came to see you
In prison, they said you already had a visit
Beefin' wit these strangers, how do you explain this?
Came this close to lettin' you put it in my anus
Wakin' up, middle of the night, brother out
Time to get the steppin', back to ya mother house, boy
I'm leavin'",I'm Leavin'

What you want wit the underground kings from the Bricks
I've been at it since Clyde Frazier played for the Knicks
Packin' 3-5-7's wit the raw hide grips
Rollin' 4-5-6 on ya cross eyed tricks
War type shit, so get off my dick
I'm wet like Pirelli's on the vet
Here I go, pull up in the stretch
Ballin' like the Nets, like ten pass ya marks on my net
Woman love me, wantin' lust for me like people do money
They hungry, I might start livin' too lully
Got a A+ average and I'm bound to make honor roll
Jumpin' in and out of holes, lives like geronimo
Put it on wax, make it sound kinda comical
Bitches listen to it while they work they abdominals
G's listen to it while they out playin' dominoes
Outsidaz try'nna match the face on the article

We doin' it to girls look like Tyra Banks
Drop the CD, girls hawkin' a nigga
They still want to creep, they know I'm talkin' to Digga
You think you raw, I'mma test your jaw
You don't have a clue like Ernesto Shaw
See me on ya block, better give me those props
Before I start another beef worse then Biggie and Pac
We got macks and 4-4's to bust
And we don't buy clothes for girls, they buy clothes for us
Peace, to my homies doin' time in jail
And to ya niggas that be hatin', ya'll can rot in hell

Without rappin' bout my chain and my range
While everybody else talk, sound the same
(Yo me and Zee) {we just try'nna get brains} and run trains
(Yo hot like gun flames, we copped enough grade
Take the story make the front page
All about a man wit a bulletproof coatin' chrome shotty
Ain't takin' shit from nobody)
And punk ya'll can make me use the steel and blast ya Coupe D'eville
Hit the right side up, make ya loose a wheel
Outsidaz drunk, can't walk a straight line
Me and Pace blind off the 1-8-9
(Tell the cops that the gun ain't mine, some may find and go
All day shine, I'm no joke
Pacewon, the type of man, that you don't play close
Better throw up ya hands when my folks say so)

We bust slugs for the music

Talk about sex, packin' chrome, techs, hero' bones

Washed up M.C.'s, whose styles have been grown
Like 40 years old, still pickin' average poems

And now it's on, ya niggas want to get beat
Just bring that shit around 20th Street
Don't get me wrong, thugs come hopin' to bust
But uncock their glock when they know this is us

Harriett step up to bring real rhymes back
You know shit is bad when the rapper can say
They ain't even in the game for the lyrics anyway
Well that's okay, the underground stay shinin'
Those runnin' for the door gonna end up resignin'
And years later, I'm gonna still be the tighter
Majority's splurger, call it all the tax writer

[Nawshis]
It's the Outsidaz faculty
Throwin' up the finger in ya magazine

Outsidaz,"[Pace Won]
Who that smoked-out kid that do more drugs than a rock star?
Not far from bein' in the back seat of a cop car
Top dog that falls the fuck off, now he fiendin'
The need for drugs got his ass stealin'
He asks you for pocket change and cigarettes every time you see him
White shit around his lips; he got open sores, bleedin'
Kid blast more fast than Pete Rock could flip a remix
Hope he don't OD like River Phoenix
Hope his ass gets himself together and his people live to see it
All his felonies become misdemeanors
He shootin' up hot heroin, one dub, intravenous
Robbin' niggas cleaner than the cleaners

[Chorus - Pace Won]
Yo, some people fiend for it, spend some cream on it
They slip and get addicted, drop a G on it
Next thing, they trip and they think their house haunted
Niggas never should've got what they wanted

[Hook - Pace Won]
Yo, if you crack the fuck out you need rehab
Dope the fuck up you need rehab, rehabilitation
It's drug therapy for a patient
Kickin' cold turkey got them kooky niggas shakin'
Yo!

[Az-Izz]
Az-Izz, ex-Mad Math wiz
Now I'm addicted to pills, hash, and acid
For denouncin' Jevohah, first time I got high, it was over
Got drunker than Grady off JD and Coca-Cola
I broke bread with dopehead (??) that broke legs for mopeds
Plus Axe fatter than the ass on Jennifer Lopez
Sniff lines with cokeheads and bring the Rawkus like Mos Def

[Nawshis]
Remember this; bad habits only get worser
When your lungs insert lye, they just tryin' to reach the first high
I used to smoke, drink mad brew straight
Still be sober, so I had to graduate
Nawshis; I'm addicted to gettin' lifted
Didn't know not to, havin' rap a role model
Until I heard Redman hit the rope
I heard Mobb Deep sniffed coke
Yo, Yo!

[D.U.]
I'm the rehab specialist
Checkin' shit from testosterone to female estrogen
Stethoscope, check your pulse, detox shock treatment
No eavesdrop, it's top secret
Yo, Dr. Giggle; I jot down notes and start to scribble
I figured out the riddle; ain't shit wrong with you
(??????)I take acid with pain tablets
A strange habit but that shit keeps my brains blasted
Unbalanced chemicals bend the rules; break in lockers
Stealin' tennis shoes; back in the day you should've finished school
Was the man of the playground, now you're waist down
Here's a shot of redemption; go make some cake now

Cats trynna diss, got me in Whoop Ass Anonymous
Wit a bad case of droppin' kids that's poppin' shit
Stop it cause, I get the money
I say I'm Young Zee, I fuck girls that talk country
My girl got a crib and a range
Low budget hoes trynna knock ya game
Like did Courtney Love kill Kurt Cobain?
From close range, turn his brain to shrimp lomaine
Cats make you want to bash their mouth
Til you AWOL'in out the half way house
We rock til it's time to fuck to go
Fifty Outsidaz throwin' up the O, it's the sign

Rougher than rugby
Your girlfriend talk about this 'cause she love me
She know I got money
So quit wit the rah rah, lookin' at me funny
Before I make the situation ugly, buddy
I don't want to wild and leave ya chest piece bloody
Besides my girl more chocolate than chunky
Sweat the perm out, leave the bedroom funky
Whispered in my ear, said she only want to fuck me
Ride around, give me head in the buggy

When we go wild, it's my rhyming design
Throw up the Outz, it's the sign of the time

It's like now we probably teein' off like Howie
Seein' stars geein' off, best be beatin' off my sty-lee
I ain't the one that set you up wit a scuzzy
Trust me, I bust you and ya bosom buddies
Outz great flows that annihilate foes
Frontin' days found out I violate hoes
Outz all carry gats, and test more drugs than laboratory rats
Fuck how you niggas want to act
I slaughter cats off sacks fattest quarterbacks
Guns cock back, crackin' all of that, it's more than rap
Bless my turf, and all those curse
'cause how it is in the heavens, it shall be on earth
But til the subside, you tough guys and for a rough ride
Like DMX's squad, when I puff lye, plus ya
Hotter than San Fernando Valley out in Cali
Realer than clear Muhammad rallies, throw up the sign

I'm sure you heard all the rumors
D.U.'ll flows stay nighty like Kaluma
Turn around and battle ya back
Dramatical acts, this is mami of Samuel L. Jackson
Take 12 aspirin's then start gaspin' for breath
Nigga don't do it to ya self
Liquid Snake, Metal Gear Solid dick
Knock a man off a cliff watch him land in a pile of shit
Telepathic, Capri's dolphins, I teach often
Wit a heart Stone Cold like Steve Austin
Revelation's settin' dates of verse now
Throw up the O, it's the sign of the times

Then by next Friday, I'll have you on the runway

Nawshis, feed 'em my sausage like it's gourmet
We play 'pass the body'
When they have Bacardi in the after-party
With all the women there, nappy and pretty hair
Some who clits be pierced; they body's like Britney Spears
So never will I rape a date
Too many whores on tour, when I'm goin' state to state

My piece in D.C. love me to pinch the clitoris
Ran trains on dames in Arizona when we visited
Chicks askin', ""You think you all that?"" Yes!
My bitch in Cali mad cause I ain't called back yet
Tricked in studios, owned by Dallas Austin
Got my dick sucked off, when I flossed in Boston
Got head in Boulder - in New Orleans I'm a no limit soldier

To get a hoe, try to dig her out like the Flipmode

Five bitches bring me dough, five bitches sendin' me clothes
I guess I'm just nice with it; I only fuck a tight bitch

Outside,"Now first of all I want to let you to know that
I've been known for some minor

Were doing me wrong

Hold my tongue for then
Bad relationships and people I thought were friends
And people judging me
Before they get to know a thing
When you decide to step to me,
It shows me so clearly
You just want to see, see the other side of me

And you don't know what I'm going through
And you might think it's all about you
But it's everything I've been holding back
It's just bad timing to come at me like that

I try to keep my cool, thus, that's what I try to do
But it's so hard dealing with people just like you
I try to walk away from situations that run
Into complications that make me loose control
If I give in to you then it's what you want me to do
And if I loose my cool then I'm only pleasing you
You know just how to push me,

Que es peligroso soñar
Que hay que pisar con cuidado
Cuando se trata de amar

Hay que ponerse en acción
No tengas miedo puedes empezar
Con el primer escalón

Jugarte el corazón
Sacudirte el polvo
Y apostarlo todo

Atrévete a
Cambiar tu dirección
Encontrar tu rumbo
Y comerte al mundo

No viene al caso que pienses
En lo que puede fallar
Que si el amor es mentira
Que si el dolor es verdad

But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

I follow the moonlight to where I'm sure I've watched her shadow dance,
But the light she casts in these eyes bears an unknown wavelength,
So I sorrow to be cursed with my condition.
The night laughs, this lens is flawed
Cause I cant bend the light her heart still casts in darkness
There I go again, lost in my heart's persistent questions,
Is it wrong? Can I survive if morning never comes?

Refract her light in me,
I believe that she's there , I've watched her waiting.
I believe that she'll save a little space for me in the night
Chasing a constellation.

I never knew a kiss could kill till I got burned,
But now there's a way I've found to allay a yearning heart.
Needed to know whether my soul was bound to this earth.

Assure me, when its done and I've come down that you won't quit waiting for me...

How you build me up.
The cross-tolerance could kill an army Of friends
The way your love blinds like a drug,

I know its no use, there are times I watch myself surrender so thoughtless
But you've no will you're just the scapegoat I abuse

Illusions I've let in.

Till my indignation spills
Though I still feel empty.
Sometimes I see beyond the haze

Coming home has never been the hardest thing.

Is anybody listening yet?

Or would you save yourself?

To nurse a wounded world

I love the shape that my mind takes
Whenever she is on it, wherever she may be

Everyone wants a proof
Some kind of rule to latch onto
We all wanna peek outside the box
We're all caught up inside staring just trapped inside

We need to see all of our just little thoughts
Racing out of control, then the speed of light

And nothing but truth

Go ahead, try to find yourself
As a part of every perfect thing, yea

They're sure will open every question

I wanna give it away

I get so scared, with eyes wide shut
I'll fail to find hope near to them

If what's concealed tends to reveal itself in time

So get right, all that you like.
Cause I know we share more than smiles,
And all this down-time gives us reason to confide
Everything I can fit onto one line.

Watch the sun set over wasted time
Wish upon a California sky
I think you know this time
I'm through with wasted time
And it may take one last night
What goes around comes back again in time.

Should I whisper our secret
It ain't hard to see your heart would know.
Its never easy to forget mistakes and afford some room to grow.
In a heartbeat, on the heels of each soft word to break the quiet.
I remember a season I forgot...and it fills me up with fire.
I'll never fear the night, never fear the night with you.




",Wrong Way
Over It,"Bent out of shape we make our way straight
I would never take a chance on it if it didn't paralyze me
Completely

sure you think its all fun, but games are all I've won in this life
I wouldn't give it all up if it meant id never feel so weightless

rebuilding the puzzle I've found scattered all around

I invent myself with every breath
To take a step I look ahead
And size up anything that makes me tremble.

I can't tell if the shifting pattern exists
Before I make it, but does it matter?
You've got the time to find out for yourself.

Over the Rhine,"Is it because I cannot see you
That you feel so free to steal
My excess baggage
Full of darkness and despair
While I fumble with my locks
You're content to stand and knock
Yet I know your knack for theivery is rare
Do you know they call it arson
Setting fires without permissions
In my heart for sure and maybe elsewhere too
Though your lack of inhibition
Captures my imagination
I end up a wiser person thanks to you

The sympathetic vibration
Your train is at my station
Within without
Then there is your flare for murder
There's a dagger in the border
Of your cloak and I suspect a captain's gun
As you put to death suspicions
Kindly kill my fears as well
Exorcise and slay the demons one by one
Though I'm usually pacifistic
You are mercifully sadistic
And I didn't know that murder could be good
But the roses came crimson
Springing from the prison
Of the floorboards where there once were stains of blood

Broken glass and a little cheap wine
Is all that I can find.
And bundles of contradictions,
My heart full of loose connections,
Hands across my eyes.
I cannot disguise I'm everyman's daughter.

It's always the same old question.
Who am I and whose invention?
This armour's full of dust.
There's so much of us in each other.
If I hate you you're my best reminder
Of all I wish I was.
I hate you just because I'm everyman's daughter.

Who do you think that I am?
It don't matter long as we can understand.
I am hurting someone.
I am hurting someone just like, just like you.

Insulting the wounds of others,
My sisters, my brothers,
My vision's way too good.
I carry the inward aching.
Like you, I too am naked.
I don't look that good,
But this is flesh and blood. I'm everyman's daughter.

Look at all the blood we've spilt.
I can't deal with all this fundamental guilt.

And those whose lot in life is sweet

She wore it only on Sunday
Kept it safe in her room in a chest with a key
We found it anyway

They'll only join us like the sky that blushes red tonight
And makes the wind die down, calms the troubled sea
(More out of duty than pleasure, but out of pleasure nonetheless.)

A song I should have known all along
I feel you move like smoke in my eyes
And that is why

That sing from my eyes like carillon
Ringing only on Sunday on the roof down our street

Ring for you, ring for me
Finally, forever

Discarded all your beauty in despair
Declared yourself a concubine
Filled the bathtub full of wine
Bathed and drank the night away
And said there'd never come a day
When politics would ever mean a thing
Last night I dreamt you came and crowned me king

Last night I dreamt you cut off all your hair
And laid it at the bottom of my stair
And waited by the garden gate
For one more rendezvous with fate
Kept a pistol in your dress
(the iron loved your sweet caress
As trigger-finger twitched at your command)
Last night I dreamt we fell upon the sand

Last night I dreamt you cut off all your hair
And sold your stockings at the county fair
And how the clowns did dance and sway

With a little of the lining hanging out

I never know just what on earth I'll find
In the faces of a stranger
In the dark and weary corners of a mind""

As far away as you are from yourself
No matter just how bad it gets
It does no good to blame somebody else""

On the left side of the dawn
Leaving the the traces, forgotten the faces

Of the last December morn

Am I Overkill each death a sin.
Questions linger as I walk the path
I am Overkill, the Devil's wrath!

So when you walk alone, in the night
And your bones are chilled, skin so tight!
Beware the sound of a galloping horse
Overkill has another corpse...

Breakin' and burnin' me
Until I die

Stone cold occupied
Thoughts that I thought I knew
When only you seem right
I seem to walk right through you
Face down in the comfort of
What you've given me
I have resolved myself
To what will never be
Walking next to me
The stark reality
Of what will never be

[Chorus]

If I had my way
I'd tear it down
Start anew, up from the ground
And dare I say
I want you near me
To live inside this world so cold
Another day
Another kill me
Another shot to be so bold

Dope black suicide
And eyes that like right through you
Dead white feeling fine
I could never hurt you

They got a rope around the sun

With their shields and their swords
To fight the fight
They believed to be right
Overthrow the overlords

To the town where there was plenty
They brought plunder, swords and flame
When they left, the town was empty
And children would never play again

From their graves I heard the fallen

There were many more to die

An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go
