Pastor Hezekiah Walker,"This is my testimony everybody
How God favored me in spite of my enemies
And if God did it for me he'll do the same thing for you
Don't worry about your haters
Your haters Can't do nothing with you
Listen to these words

Love is patient, caring, love is kind
Love is felt most when it's genuine
But I've had my share of love abused
Manipulated and it's strength misused
And I can't help but give you glory
When I think about my story
And I know you favored me
Because my enemies did try
But couldn't triumph over me
Yes they did try
But couldn't triumph over me

I'm still here
I'm still alive
I'm still blessed
On my way to my destiny
Because the favor of God is on my life
Let me tell you about love

Love is patient, caring, love is kind
Love is felt most when it's genuine
But I've had my share of love abused
Manipulated and it's strength misused
And I can't help but give you glory
When I think about my story
And I know you favored me
Because my enemies did try
But couldn't triumph over me
Yes they did try
But couldn't triumph over me

They whispered, conspired, they told their lies (God favors me)
My character, my integrity, my faith in God (He favors me)
Will not fall, will not bend, won't compromise (God favors me)
I speak life and prosperity and I speak health (God favors me)

They whispered, conspired, they told their lies (God favors me)

My character, my integrity, my faith in God (He favors me)
Will not fall, will not bend, won't compromise (God favors me)

Say yes (yes), yes (yes), yes (yes) God favors me
Say yes (yes), yes (yes), say yes (yes) God favors me (God favors me)
Say yes (yes), yes (yes), yes (yes) God favors me

Pastor Hezekiah Walker,"I told somebody I was looking for a miracle and then they go
And try to conjure up a resolution for my hang-ups
But it cannot be done
I told them what I need was a supernatural act from God
Then they looked at me like I was so crazy
Like it was too hard

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

I want to pray like they did in the upper room
I will not leave because I need to hear from you God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough
I want to walk in Your will and be favored
No matter how long I must put in my labor God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough.

I told somebody I was sick in my body and they they read
Me a list of all the doctors in this pamphlet but not if they’re human
What I have it doesn’t require a vaccine or anything
What I need is the healing virtue of the Father not a doctor

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

I want to pray like they did in the upper room
I will not leave because I need to hear from you God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough
I want to walk in Your will and be favored
No matter how long I must put in my labor God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough.

Some people try to help me out others try to pull me through
But they cannot figure out what they can’t get it right
Sorry but it’s not your fault- I’m in need of a breakthrough
Everybody’s praying for me putting in petitions for me
Trying to keep the faith as wait for a breakthrough
Wrestle with the angels until we get a breakthrough

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

I want to pray like they did in the upper room
I will not leave because I need to hear from you God
And my mission won’t stop

"Pastor Rudolph McKissick, Jr.","Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

Streetlight, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anythin' to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
And now the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

Streetlight, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight, people

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight, people

I suggest he take that stupid shit to Sunset
But naw,but naw he want to play bad Billy bad ass and shit
I'm flawing my game like I can't perform the hit
I threw on the fucking plastic bag
wrapped my hands around his ass the squeezed
til the nigga can't breath
Limiting cheese about my trap,how the fuck imma catch the mouse
If you busting ya gun and steady runnin ya mouth
But down south I ain't no hard ass nigga
But best believe real come the thriller
Motherfucka I feel ya
Blast them hollow points,'cause hollow points get points across
They want the juice but they don't want to pay the cost
Now who's the boss
My nigga ask these hoes
I'm nuttin in they mouth and they nose
They eyes if they ain't closed
The lifestyle that I chose who knows may make me rich
But if them feds kick down them doors then lifes a bitch
I'm sittin in the patty wagon thinking bout the snitch
And wit my phone call I know exactly who to hit
My niggaz Don Perry we got some bodies to burry
Hide them niggaz with rugers and hide them lugers with Karen
Now its very nescesary that this bid go through
'cause I already know my niggaz threw

A million hoes, now I got a gurl that loves me
It's kind of funny cause I never been the one for love

Young rich nigga, hoes a dime a dozen
The older that I grew, I knew a ho ain't nothing
It's more than fucking that was high school shit
I moved my gurl in, it's me her and the pits
Six in the yard, I give thanks to God
For making it easy though they say it would be hard
And me and my gurl gone stack it up for a while
And when I wake up, first thing I see is her smile
And when she has my child I'll be the happiest on earth

Hung up the phone, contemplating on who help me do it

Bow down nigga make room for a pimp

[Peter Tha Disciple]
You can't pimp me potnah because I'm pimpin myself
I got my game from the old school straight off the shelf
I be the maca to the roni, the chedda to the cheese
I roll wit' DSGB, so is better than me
A Aug representative, I got the game on lock
I hit the street with them thangs, went to movin the block
So fuck the cops, we makin money, we stay on the grind
I'm bustin strawberry Phillies while I break down my pine
And I ain't blind, I can see it, you already know
So get the fuck out my face 'cause you can't pimp me hoe
You see the doe don't let it hit ya', you gets no play
And I'm the dro' you the philly get ready to blaze

Don't hit the cell phone, it's turned off

[Chorus]",About to Go Down
Pastor Troy,"I will always pray for you, Atlanta

Yeah, yeah we crankin' this for all the G's on the east side
We doin' this for all the Gangstas on the west side
We doin this for all the kings on the south side

A-T-L, A-T-L it's on, and it's on A-T-L it's on, and it's on, it's on

As I look at you road from the window
Reminiscing on the places that I been yo
On the road doin' shows fuckin' thugged out
Crank the club up get a player drug out
This is clear though, on the road pleasin' my fans
From city to city sometimes it's hard man
My girl is 'bound to have me trippin' though
She tellin' me she love me more than I will ever know
I miss the crib yo, I'm in the streets
Doin' shows four nights out the week
Yeah, sometimes the king misses his own throne
Pastor Troy and I miss home, A-T-L

Atlanta, I'll rep for you, I'll always be there for you
Atlanta, I'll rep for you, I'll always be there for you

I done seen more hotels than my house
I done seen my home boy running his mouth
I know it sound crazy but baby understand
Every night I'm out at least ten grand
So we can rock Louis Vuitton and have fun
While puttin' up a college fun for my son
And when we sip we sip Dom Perignon
And when we dip it's an Aston Martin
I know sometime it feel like I am just headed for the cheese
And every time you want to chill it's like I up and gotta leave
But baby I am your king and the crib is my throne
I can't wait 'till I get back home, to A-T-L

Ayo this ya boy Pastor Troy checkin in right, yuh
(This from the soul)
Ayo, on this joint right here man we bout to just break it down to you
man just the transition to becoming..a man (This from the heart)
That some of y'all gone have to go through man everybody on the sound
of my voice (This from the soul)
Everything gone be cool man, From Boys to Men

[Verse 1] Pastor Troy
No one to doubt me, I'm not here lonely
Childhood secrets still wid my homies
I recall days when I blazed up on the hill
Not knowin' wud the future would hold, just kept it real
We ridin' on the 'Lac with the boys to other schools
We catch 'em at dey football games and act a fool
And everybody know my name, it's Michael Troy
We made all them bullies respect Falcon Boy
I got my folks worried, I'm suspended everyday
Sometimes I ain't tell 'em and caught the train to the A
The FirePoint Station, Supreme location
I'm only 15, tho at the lil' scene

[Chorus] 
No one to pry me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
He'd shelter from the rain..to ease the pain
Changing from boys to men

[Verse 2]
I've done seen stabbings, i've done seen shootings
I've done seen a robbery, i've done seen two
But I ain't even 15, so when i turn 16
I'm'ma get dat chrome thing wid da beam
My team was da wreckin' crew, like juice
The type of niggas on our side do, who was the truth
I bet them killaz on his side respect game
That other nigga from the southside, was lame
My name is Stone, Charlestown to the bone
Lil' Wayne and Scooby, we rocking MCM and Gucci
I'm nine years old, that nigga let me touch a Uzi
I wanted to kill, just like i saw up in the movie
No wonder one of my friend shot himself in his head
Playin' wid the gun from under his mothers bed
Don't want to call his name too tough, we'll call him Fred
We watch my nigga while he bled (when we was young)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3] Eight-ball
Lord knows we be tryin hard, God watching over us
Mama told me ""baby dun be goin to school cuttin up""
Did I listen, hell naw, listen let me tell ya'll
Streets transform mamas only into eight-ball
Errywhere I go, niggaz know I speak that poetry
See my +Chilouette+ like I'm +Alfred Hitchcock+ and they know its me
Bottom line met a lot of niggaz on the grind 
getting them dimes
Murder they ass, escape the scene like I committed the crime
A friend of mine, don't rap he doing illegal business
18-Wheeler, Fed, X, bricks, did wid killaz
He smoke and dipped'em drunk with Crys and get to beating his bitches
Them bitches down though, come straight back after they get through strippen
I'm outta' town, next to the church see his lil' brotha cryin
Told me his brotha killed himself, I said nigga you lyin
He put the gun to his mouth and blew his brain out
He couldn't handle this goddamn shit that we sang 'bout",Boys to Men
Pastor Troy,"You've got your home of the brave 
And I've got my land of the free.
You conform to what society says
And I conform to me.
Looking for light in the corners, 
Getting caught in the spider web.
You look at me as though I'm giving a performance
When I'm just feeding my head.

And you know that I'm doing alright
And I won't explain myself to you just to avoid a fight
How I'm living ain't correct, 
But for me, its just right

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

I've got a pair of ruby slippers that 
I don't wear much anymore
And if I had the nerve, 
I'd click my heels and return
To the wonderland I knew before.
I'm waiting on a slow boat to China, 
Gonna sail away to the sun.
I've been searching for myself, 
And I know I'm gonna find her
If I break away from everyone.

So, the way that I act may not fit in.
Just because I have a mind of my own,
Doesn't mean its a sin.
I don't ask you to give up; 
Don't expect me to give in.

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

Some like to live for the moment, 
Taking life into their hands every day.
And if they don't get killed, 
They get so high off the thrill,
They could float to heaven anyway.
And others want to save for tomorrow,
Thinking money is security.
Well, I understand the need, 
But I don't get the greed.
Y'know, they all seem pretty crazy to me.

You can tell by the expression I wear.
Though I seem a little strange to you
I don't really care.  I've got the freedom to be;
There are others like me everywhere...

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

Pastor Troy,"The pain enhances the misery swells
I'm screamin' ya name from a mountain in hell
I'm so low that the grounds above me
It seems as if no one cares to love me
Maybe I'm crazy, addicted to pain
Maybe the cocaine destroyed my brain
Private conversations with kurt cobain
I'm drownin' my fears in the acid rain

chorus
Demonic intentions take ova your mind
Like leaping from a building for the 50th time
Stay away from drugs little boys and girls
Unless you wanna live in the under world

(the under world the under world unless you wanna live in the under world x2)

the sun goes down as the darkness prevails
Loss of conversation with jazabell
She's so high always treatin' her nose
Her blood run black when her cycle flows
Maybe I'm psych'd out for layin' her down
Knowin' she done been wit every man in town
Maybe I'm hellbound for living insane
I'm drowning my pain in the acid rain

chorus:
Demonic intentions take ova your mind
Like leaping from a building for the 50th time
Stay away from drugs little boys and girls
Unless you wanna live in the under world x2
(the under world the under world unless you wanna live in the under world x2)

All of the heartaches and all of the pain
All of the tear drops from acid rain
There's one drop gone 'cause they think I'm insane
Its all in my mind with the use of cocaine
Like drinkin prefusily and flying a plane
So intoxicated I can't stay in my lane
Private conversations with kurt cobain
Drownin' my fears in the acid rain

Pastora Soler,"Tenemos la mala costumbre de querer a medias
De no mostrar lo que sentimos a los que están cerca
Tenemos la mala costumbre de echar en falta lo que amamos
Sólo cuando lo perdemos es cuando añoramos

Tenemos la mala costumbre de perder el tiempo
Buscando tantas metas falsas tantos falsos sueños
Tenemos la mala costumbre de no apreciar lo que en verdad importa
Y sólo entonces te das cuenta de cuántas cosas hay que sobran

Hoy te daría los besos que yo por rutina a veces no te di
Hoy te daría palabras de amor y las caricias que perdí
Cuanto sentimos cuanto no decimos y a golpes pides salir
Escúchame antes que sea tarde antes que el tiempo me aparte de ti

Hoy te daría los besos que yo por rutina a veces no te di
Hoy te daría palabras de amor y las caricias que perdí
Cuanto sentimos cuanto no decimos y a golpes pides salir
Escúchame antes que sea tarde antes que el tiempo me aparte de ti

Tenemos la mala costumbre de buscar excusas
Para no desnudar el alma y no asumir las culpas
Tenemos la mala costumbre de no apreciar lo que en verdad importa
Y sólo entonces te das cuenta de cuántas cosas hay que sobran

You must have felt me shiver,
Shaken by a wave of fright,
That you calm with a whisper.
And fear gave way to better things,
Like a warm summer and sweeter dreams.

The way you call my name, when we make love.
While the world outside my window goes insane,
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain. 

When living leaves my pride bruised up,
I'm fragile as a feather.
The storms of life just won't let up,
You're like a change of weather.
When dust settles on my dreams,
You wash them clean.

That he never should have been 
And the thunder rolls

In her faded flannel gown

When he pulls into the drive 
She rushes out to hold him

Motorbike ride in the mid-day heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run, though we run it still burned our eyes
Oh, yes we can walk on the wild, wild side of life
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise, you can take my hand
And show me the way to understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
Yes, if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

A reckless night in a nameless town
And we moved out of sight, with a silent sound
A beach that wept with deserted waves
That's where we slept, knowing we'd be safe

Now you may think you can walk on the wild, wild side with me
But there's a lot I can learn, and a lot that I've yet to see
You know you've got my life lying in your hands
It's up to you to make me understand

But you do what you want to do
You do what you feel, no one can feel like you
Out in the summertime city, ain't it a pity
There's so much to tie you down
You're leaving tonight to somewhere you can't be found
While down at the edge of town
At a pool hall where they all hang around
You hear them talkin' about the girls they knew
And talk about what they're gonna do
Then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?
Is it right, or is it wrong?
Does it matter what's right, in the heat of the night?

Out in the streets tonight, under the neon lights
You're searchin' for something new
But nothin' is real, and no one can feel like you
They say that eagles fly in this red hot sky
But were they just passin' through
Or did they look down, and see what you found was true

But still in the back of your mind
You've got somethin' to believe in, but there's so much to find
As the bright lights dim, and the night closes in
You thought everything is ending, but it's yet to begin
And you ain't seen nothing yet!
But what you see you'll never forget, and you'll say

Did it take you so long to want something more?
Why oh why)
Did you never get off on this before?

Well, here it is, the love you've been waitin' for
Why oh why)

A certified genius at the age of five
They planned his future so carefully
He was everything they hoped he'd be
He was a model child, a devoted son
Loved and admired by everyone
He played out every role, a ""T.V. hero""
He lived his life in a video fantasy

He was good at school, never failed a grade
They gave him hopes and dreams, and taught him not to hate
He had rules he learned to break for fun
Now he's hidin', 'cause his fingerprints on the gun

I live with emptiness, without your tenderness
You can take the dream I had for us, and turn that dream into dust
I watch a phone that never rings
I watch your door that never brings
Brings you back into my life, and turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house, turn this house into a home

I need your touch to comfort me
Your tender, tender arms that once held me
Without your love, your love inside
This house is just a place to run and hide
7 rooms, that's all it is

I live with emptiness, without your tenderness

Watching a clock that ticks away
Another day, another way, another reason for me to say
I need you here, here with me
I need you darling, desperately
I'm all alone, all alone in this house that's not a home

I miss your kiss that was my very, very own

It will lead us to the higher ground
One day every eye will see truth before the light, let it be done right now

Some wait, so long, because our love is strong
This hard road traveled on will lead us home, forever

Yeah he's gone unto his father's land
Africa tonight, for we truly are one in our hearts

One day every eye will see truth before the light, let it be done right now
One day every voice will speak strong against the night
Let us be one right now - so let it be

Where people cry for a nations scars
And heros sleep beneath a blanket of stars

Pat Benatar,"There's two kinds of people that I just can't stand
An evil hearted woman and a lyin' man
But don't you lie to me, don't you lie to me
Because it makes me feel like it's as evil as I can be
Told me that you loved me a long time ago
The woman that you had, you don't want her no more
But don't you lie to me, don't you lie to me
Because it makes me feel like it's as evil as a woman can be

You told me that you loved me a long time ago
The woman that you had, you don't want her no more
But don't you lie to me, don't you lie to me
Because it makes me feel like it's as evil as a woman can be

Hey, don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me
No, no, don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me
Because it makes me feel like it's as evil as a woman can be
Don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me baby - no

Pat Benatar,"I've got papers on you baby
You gotta do what I say
I've got papers on you baby
You gotta do what I say
I mean business darlin', I'm too old to play
I've got papers on you baby
And I mean you're mine, all mine
I've got papers on you baby
And I mean you're mine, all mine
If you do just what I tell you darlin'
We're gonna get along real fine

Now the red light means stop
Green light means go
Tell you something once
I ain't gonna tell you no more

I've got papers on you baby
You gotta do what I say
I got old baby, and I'm too old to play

Well I see that you eat
And I see that you got a place to stay

But as long as live in this house
I ain't gonna let you have your way

Pat Benatar,"Bells will be ringing, the glad - glad news
For what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone and I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Oh, crowds will be singing Silent Night
Christmas carols by candlelight

Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night

Friends and relations, send salutations
As sure as the stars shine above
Yes it's Christmas, Christmas my dear
It's the time of the year, time of the year
To be with the one you, the one you really love

Oh won't you tell me, we'll never grow old

Christmas and New Years will find you home
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain
Because I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again

Please come home for Christmas baby
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain
Because I'll be happy, Lord I'll be so happy
Happy once again",Please Come Home for Christmas [*]
Pat Benatar,"The hammer lands, the verdict stands
The walls come crumblin' down
The color code, rule of thumb
Shadows on the sun
Can you tell me, where it's really at?
All around the world tonight
People watchin', people waitin'
All around the world tonight
People feelin' - Disconnected
(Somebody better plug me in)

The jukebox plays a toxic waltz
A factory belches steam
A sidewalk ends in baby steps &
A widow maker screams
(And it sounds like this)
Hear her call your name

All around the world tonight
People watchin', people waitin'
All around the world tonight
People feelin' - Disconnected

The page is turned, a city burned
The whole world falls apart
The plug is pulled, truth escapes
The space between our hearts
Space between our hearts
Space between our hearts

All around the world tonight",Disconnected
Pat Benatar,"Everybody go round, go round, go round
Everybody lay down, lay down, lay down
Don't nobody make a sound
Everybody lay down
Everybody give up, give up, give up
Nobody hang tough, hang tough, hang tough
Life a little too rough
Everybody lay down

Everybody say hey, Don't nobody say no?
Everybody say wait, Don't nobody say go? (CHORUS)
Everybody lay down

Everybody cry loud, cry loud, cry loud
Nobody too proud, too proud, too proud
To tell you what they're all about
Everybody lay down

Everybody don't care, don't care, don't care
Nobody play fair, play fair, play fair
Maybe everybody too scared
Everybody lay down

Everybody lookin' higher
Everybody want to touch the fire
Nobody willing to lay it all down

Everybody want heaven
Everybody say Amen
One thing is certain, you gotta lay it all down

Pat Benatar,"Just like every cross you ever carried, every badge you ever wore
Every vow you ever taken, every oath you ever swore
Every kiss you ever stolen, every moment that you waste
Everything you ever loved, and all you've come to hate
It's a great temptation, in your hour of need
But there's no shortcut to salvation
Searchin' for the Kingdom Key

Just like every vision you neglected, every dream you left to die
Every hope that you rejected, every truth that was a lie
Every road you ever travelled, everyone you turned away
Everything you ever loved, and all that you betrayed

[Chorus]
It's a great temptation, in your hour of need
But there's no shortcut to salvation
Searchin' for the Kingdom Key

And the light before him was all that he could see
Like fingerprints on the hands of glory wrapped 'round the rosary
His love is like a chain
That would not set him free, would not set him free
Lonely soul on a mission of mercy, Hey Yeah... Mmm

Just like every cross you ever carried, every badge you ever wore
Every vow you ever taken, every oath you ever swore
Everything you ever loved, and all you've come to hate

[Chorus: x2]",Kingdom Key
Pat Benatar,"He used to be somebody's baby
Someone used to hold him close, and rock him gently
He used to be the light in someone's eyes
He used to matter, he used to matter
Someone cared if he lived or died
Someone held him in their arms - when he cried
And when he hurt, someone kept the world away
Someone loved him, someone loved him

He used to be somebody's baby
Someone used to hold him close, and rock him gently
He used to be the light in someone's eyes
He used to matter, he used to matter
He used to matter

That was then, that was so long ago
Long before they came and took his soul
Long before he became invisible
That was when, he wasn't human garbage then

He used to be somebody's baby
Someone used to hold him close, and rock him gently
He used to be the light in someone's eyes
He used to matter, he used to matter

Pat Benatar,"We're running with the shadows of the night
So baby take my hand, you'll be all right
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight
They'll come true in the end

You said, oh girl, it's a cold world
When you keep it all to yourself
I said, you can't hide on the inside
All the pain you've ever felt
Ransom my heart, but baby don't look back
'Cause we got nobody else

So baby take my hand, it'll be all right
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight
They'll come true in the end

It's all moving way too fast
Use every alibi and words you deny
That love ain't meant to last
You can cry tough baby, it's all right
You can let me down easy, but not tonight

We're running with the shadows of the night
So baby take my hand, it'll be all right
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight
They'll come true in the end

And now the hands of time are standin' still
Midnight angel, won't you say you will

Surrender all your dreams to me tonight

Of breaking little hearts, like the one in me

Racin' through the human jungle at night
I'm so confused, my mind is indifferent

Pat Benatar,"Just when we think we conquered it
It seems we lose the fight again
But there's just no stoppin' it
It's like a bad dream that never ends
It puts up walls between us
That get harder, and harder, and harder, and harder, and harder
To remove
But we let it continue, like people in love always do
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

Lets not pretend that we're unique
'Cause everybody's tasted loves illusion
We try to hide the fact that we
Got lost between the chaos and confusion
And the love we feel
Is gettin' deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
By the minute

But we let it slip away
'Cause we don't know a good thing while we're in it

Pat Benatar,"It seems I loved you for so long
It seems like all of my life
Just like a child who doesn't belong
You'd turn, 'til even the sun became your shadow

Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away

Where all our dirty little secrets go

Nobody's perfect, certainly not us
We've all got secrets to keep
I would have kept yours safe in my heart
You would have always known where to find me

Sometimes I believed, what you had to say
Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away
Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know

Sometimes it hurt so bad that you cry
Then there's the times you wish you had died
Sometimes the truth is worse than the lie, sometimes
Sometimes it's best to lock it away
In a place that's secret and safe
Sometimes you just pretend you don't know

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
Woah, we are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're making me to go, you're begging me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love, and I'm chained to your side

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

And if I'm losing control will you turn me away or touch me deep inside?
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this could die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing

Pat Benatar,"I see a house, a house of stone
A lonely house, 'cos now you're gone
Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness

You took the dream I had for us, and turned that dream into dust
I watch a phone that never rings, I watch a door that never rings
I need you back into my life and turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house, turn this house into a home

I need your touch to comfort me, your tender tender arms that once held me
Without your love, your love inside
This house is just a place to run and hide
Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness

Don't make me live from day to day, watching a clock that ticks away
Another day, another way, another reason for me to say
I need you here, here with me, I need you, darlin', desperately
I'm all alone, all alone in this house that's not a home

I miss your love I once have known, I miss your kiss that was my very very own
Empty silence surrounds me, lonely walls, they stare
Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness

And all the windows are painted black, I'll wait right here 'til you get back
I keep waitin' and waitin', 'til your face again I see

(I want you back now) I keep waitin' and waitin', I want you back now

Pat Benatar,"Why do I have these thoughts go through my head
Do they come out of the air
Suspicion always washes over me like a disease
I cannot share I can't ignore the way you treated me sometimes
So go ahead and convince me otherwise

[Chorus:]

Tell me it's okay, that every thing's fine
Show me that it's possible not to cry, swear that you'll
Never leave and you'd rather die than hurt me
Just tell me that every thing's gonna be fine

Give me a reason why I should stay
One I won't regret in the end
This time say something I can believe
Something you haven't used yet
I can't ignore the way you treated me sometime
So go ahead and convince me otherwise

So many empty words were spoken here today
So many promises I'd like to dream away

It seems we lose the fight again
But there's just no stoppin' it
It's like a bad dream that never ends
It puts up walls between us

And harder and harder to remove
But we let it continue, like people in love always do
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Let's not pretend that we're unique
'Cause everybody's tasted love's illusion
We try to hide the fact that we
Got lost between the chaos and confusion
And this love we feel
Is gettin' deeper and deeper and deeper
And deeper, and deeper by the minute

But we let it slip away

Pat Benatar,"They cry in dark,
So you can't see their tears.
They hide in the light,
So you can't see their fears.

Forgive and forget,
All the while...
Love and pain become one and the same
In the eyes of a wounded child.

Because--hell, hell is for children!
And you know that their little lives can become such a mess
Hell--hell is for children,
And you shouldn't have to pay for your love

With your bones and your flesh...
It's all so confusing,
This brutal abusing...
They blacken your eyes

And then apologize...
""Be daddy's good girl,
And don't tell mommy a thing""...
""Be a good little boy,

And you'll get a new toy--
Tell grandma you fell from the swing.""

Still hears my broken song of love

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Pat Boone,"When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup
O'er hills and meadows we'd strayed
Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimming hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out

So the years sped along and at last he grew old
His eye sight was fast growing dim
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can't do no more for him Jim

With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun
I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it I wanted to run
And I wished they'd shoot me instead

I went to his side and I sat on the ground
He laid his head on my knees
I stroke the best pal that a man ever found
I cried so I scaresly could see

Old Shepy he knew he was going to go
for he reached out and nipped at my hand
He looked up at me just as much as to say
We're parting but you'll understand

Now old Shep is gone where the good doggies go

And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep

Pat Boone,"How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was wadded in fortune and fame
Everything that I longed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

My friends and my loved ones I'll leave them no doubt
But there's one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind",Satisfied Mind

And reminisce with you that's my desire.

I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.",That's My Desire

some fools rave of happiness

Blissfulness
togetherness
some fools fool themselves
I guess

But they're not fooling me I know it isn't true

No
it isn't ture. Love is just a lie made to make you blue.

love scares
love wounds and mares any heart

Pat Boone,"I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me.
I opened doors for little old ladies,
I helped the blind to see.
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers.
They can't be seen with me and I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean.

No more Mister Nice Guy,
No more Mister Clean,
No more Mister Nice Guy,
They say he's sick, he's obscene.

My dog bit me on the leg today.
My cat clawed my eyes.
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle,
And dad has to hide.
I went to church incognito.
When everybody rose, the Reverend Smith,
He recognized me,
And punched me in the nose.

Pat Boone,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water
Pat Boone,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

Ooh, it makes me wonder, ooh, it makes me wonder

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
Just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
Ooh, it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold?
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When the being one is all and all
To be the rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to heaven

From a need that keeps messin' up her mind
And she finghts the gentle pressures
That keep pullin' on her heart strings all the time

Wakes the sleeping passions inside of her
And she fights that lovin' feeling 
Until I can love the fight right out of her

By a man and her love for him was strong
Then the love she knew was shattered
When she woke up one day and found him gone

Is still ever present in her world
And she fights that lovin' feeling

We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said

Angels were singing a hymn to your charms

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

With someone like you, a pal good and true
I'd like to leave it all behind and go and find
Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by",Let the Rest of the World Go By

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [1st Recording]

Is wonderful, wonderful

(Ooh)
They did the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango
They did the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Heel and toe?) I don't know

Last night at Papa Joe's my buddy met a lovely dove
She was the kind you never find but keep on dreamin' of
She did a dance we never saw before but sure did love
It was the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Fast or slow?) I don't know (ooh)

Ooh la la la la la la la
(Ooh la la la la la la)

The crowd was tappin' and a-clappin' as the music played
His heart was right in time with every little move she made
Though he was shy she took his hand and said ""Don't be afraid""
""Let's do the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Nice and slow?) I don't know

Ooh la la la la la la la
(Ooh la la la la la la)

He did a spin and shook his shoulder
To get the zing of it, the sway and swing of it
But every time he tried to hold her
She'd shake and shout ""Olé"", (Olé) then go the other way

Now all night long he did it wrong but still it ended right
My buddy walked her home and got a kiss and held her tight
So you can bet he'll be at Papa Joe's tomorrow night

I find myself phonin' her at least ten times a day
It's so unusual for me to carry on this way
I tell you, I can't sleep at night, a wanting to hold her tight
I tried so hard to convince myself that this feelin' just can't be right
And I'm tellin' you
 
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
 
I wouldn't mind it if I knew she really loved me too
But I'd hate to think that I'm in love alone
And nothing that I can do,  oh
 
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now

It's only there trying to fool the public

Well I'm hurt and I want you so bad

Well they're some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby baby, oh yeah baby baby

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
And honey to shield my pride I try
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you
'cause I need to go, oh I need you so
Look I'm hurt and I want you to know
For others I put on a show

Smiling in the crowd I try

The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punk drunk

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Pat Cronley,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Pat Cupp,"Fool, fool, fool that I was to fall for you.
Fool, fool, fool that I was to fall for you
Oh what a fool I was, to think you could love me too.

Well, the first time that I saw you, you looked so doggone sweet
When you walked down the street, I said 'There goes my meat.'
[Needless to say, Kay Starr's version didn't have this line.]

Fool, fool, fool that I was to fall for you
Oh what a fool I was, to think you could love me too.

I can't forget you darlin', though I'm left out in the cold.
I guess I still love you, and will always feel the same. [I know it doesn't

Pat DiNizio,"Can you feel it?
It's a place from down below, it's a face that never shows
It's the kind you won't believe, follow me

Won't you listen to the voice inside your head?
It's a voice that wants you dead
It will eat all that you give, if you live

Don't you want to know where you shouldn't go?
Let's fall in the mud, flowers in the blood

There's a chance you shouldn't take
There's a voice you shouldn't wake
Better listen now to me, don't disagree

You should worry 'bout the voice inside your head
About the things you heard it said
Round and round it plays its game, all the same

Don't you want to know ways you shouldn't go?
Let's fall in the mud, flowers in the blood

Don't you want to know where you shouldn't go?
Let's fall in the mud, flowers in the blood

It's a place from down below, it's a face that never shows
It's the kind you won't believe, just follow me

Won't you listen to the voice inside your head?
It's a voice that wants you dead
It will eat all that you give, if you live

Don't you want to know ways you shouldn't go?
Let's fall in the mud, flowers in the blood

","Running, Jumping, Standing Still"
Pat DiNizio,"Sunday is gloomy my hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you

Angels have no thoughts of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?
Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are said I know
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go

Death is no dream for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart

Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I want to do
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you

Gloomy Sunday

And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Is going to this 1-900 line

She said that I had too much love for you
And for a small five dollar cover she'd be my long distance lover

But the way that I'm feeling, I just might be thinking
Lord, tonight they just might have to do

I've spent a lot of long and lonely nights in honky tonk taverns 
I was two fisted drinking and fighting back against the wall

And I know it's a problem, a no win situation, 
But I can't seem to resist that old whiskey call

I guess is risky business, 
Some folks say that I won't last too long, 
And I can't say I blame them, 
For saying what they're saying, 
'cause right now I'm just holding on.

I'm just an old dancehall dreamer,
Living my life in the past,
I keep holding on to dreams and them slow moving trains,
And I don't know how long I can last.

So I called out to Jesus, 
Said Lord I really need you, 
You've got to carry me for a while, 
I've been running too long, 
Singing these old tired songs, 
As the wheels keep pourin out the miles, 
Like I said I'm just a dreamer, But I've gotta' keep believing, 
Someday things will go my way, I'm just running from the devil, 
I've got one foot on the pedal, 
The other one's  laid up in the grave.

Where I can hold your body close to mine
We can listen to the rhythm

You can stay with me until the mornin' light

Beat up, broke down, no place left to turn
Well, I took you back to Texas
Under a harvest moon

And took my love so far away from me
Yeah, he hauled you off to Boulder
Where the air gets much colder

Than this southern boy would ever like to see

I still recall the smile upon his face. 
He took off for the bright lights of Austin, 
Said Pat don't you know there ain't no money here, 
He made a billion bucks selling computers, 
I still go down to George's and drink my beer.

He's gone, he may be gone, but I'm still here. 
He's gone, he may be gone, but I'm still here.

There was this curly headed girl back in the seventh grade, 
She didn't even know she caught my eye, 
We dated for a while back in high school, 
I thought that one day she'd be my wife.

She took off to find her own way,

 I just know he gonna break her heart one day.

She's gone, she may be gone, but I'm still here, 
She's gone, she may be gone, but I'm still here.

I used to go to my grandpas house every Sunday, we'd watch the Dukes of Hazard on TV, 
Sit around sometimes he'd tell us stories, about how simple life used to be. 
My grandpa died a year ago last Sunday, I thought to myself he was one helluva' man (he was a helluva man), 
And I know when the darkness surrounds me,
He reaches out and he takes my hand.

I'm just an old, hard-headed, son of a bitch

Well, I finally found out that I was mistaken
It's not gonna be something to add the years to my life

A hundred miles from nowhere with all a girl could need
We would run through the hallways and dance in the backyard

And if I had a speed plane we'd fly across the land
Settle in some little border town
We'd drink margaritas and dance to mariachis
Put you on my speed plane, and I would bring you back home

And if I had a steamboat we'd sail across the ocean
Dock in some little port of call
We would have a fine time with Swiss cheese and French wine
Put you on my steamboat, and I would bring you back home

But I ain't got a million, and I ain't got a speed plane

Yeah, and you know the highway, just like a river, keeps rolling on
And you know it's my way.  I was born to sing this song
Have no fear, I ain't going nowhere
Everything is gonna be just fine

So I turn on the TV on a Sunday afternoon
This preacher was saying: ""boy, you're gonna meet your doom
If you do to the honky-tonks and drink that ice cold beer."" 
Well, I've got me some friends, and we're real tight
We stay up drinking and talking in the middle of the night
We talk about Jesus, man; I'll tell you he's one pretty cool dude

Lately I've been toying with the notion
Of setting these wheels in motion
Set me out on the highway to see what I can see
Then you came in crying; you were bitching at me
You said your baby or the highway; now what's it gonna' be?
I said well, maybe you don't get it, it's the nature of the business
And I'm 'bout to be moving on

I dreamed that Texas was burnin' down, burnin' down.
And all the old people I'd grown up to love
Were leaving town.

So I cried ""Oh Moses, bring a flood from the Red Red Sea
Bring back Towns Van Zandt and my heroes back to me.
'Cause I can play their songs but it ain't the way they do,
It ain't the way they do.""

I had a nightmare, a nightmare, it was a nightmare.

Now Buddy Holly was ridin' on the wind.
Stevie Ray well he was too.
And when their star came tumbling to the ground
Wasn't a thing all the king's horses and all the king's men could do.

Me I just got my old barstool.
Man it's burnin' me down, it's burnin' me down.
Just like a brushfire that burns on through the night
One of these days how it's going
One of these days I'm gonna' burn on out.

Under a sky so warm and fair
I tell you friends there's a song in every town.

I said won't you sing me one more song 
About old San Antone, 
Seems like a dream now it was so long ago, 
Jerry Jeff Walker can be like a coat from the cold, 
Hey I'ma going home

Nothing short of the gospel hymns, 
I guess that's why folks keep writing 'um when I die, 
I want to go there too, some day I hope to walk along heavens street, 
I'll still be looking for my taco meat 
And I swear I hear a steel guitar rising in the air.

I said won't you sing me one more song 
About old San Antone, 
Seems like a dream now it was so long ago, 
Ol' Guy Clark can be just like a coat from the cold, 
Hey I'ma going home

When the night is real real still, 
Swear I can hear a whippoorwill
She knows there's music in the dirt down there
It's a hill country rain is a cleansing thing 
And all I have to do is see one,  
Sitting in a shallow creek
I got nothing to do, got nothing to do

I said won't you sing me one more song 
About old San Antone, 
Seems like a dream now it was so long ago, 
Jerry Jeff Walker can be just like a coat from the cold,

Yeah I said won't ya sing me one more song about those dusty plains, 
Them honky tonk angels, and their lonely bee hive pain, 
Wish I stowed away on some fast moving train going home, I'ma going on home.",Songs About Texas
Pat Green,"What the hell am I doing down in Kansas city, 
I know damn well it ain't where I belong, 
Think I'll quit my job come 5 o'clock, 
Find my lonely way back home, 
My baby said just what are you trying to prove here, 
Do you really want to leave me here alone, 
I said I'm staring at this ocean full of Heineken drinking Yankees 
I'd rather be in Texas on my own

[Chorus]
So we were southbound 35, we were headed down the road, 
Hit the border by the morning, let Texas fill my soul, 
Yeah let Texas fill my soul.
Come on let's go! 

The tears start to flow about the time that I was leaving, 
She said I guess you better take me along, 
God might have made her born a little Yankee child, 
But it's time that I made Texas my home, 
So we loaded her stuff into my pickup, 
Said good-bye to all my friends, 
Called my brother down in Austin Texas, 
Said I'm headed home again.

[Chorus]

She had her feet up on the dashboard,
She was holding my hand and wearing only a smile, 
She said it's gonna be hard to start all over, 
But the feeling I have well it makes it all worth while.

So take me out to a dancehall
Tap my foot down to the rhythm
Tell 'em to play them old songs that we all love
And you tell me that you want me and I tell you that I want you too
And I'll kiss your face, whenever you want me to.

Take yourself a big bag for your shoulder, 
Find yourself some good times, 
Bring them on back home,

Pat Green,"Saw you early this morning
Sleepin' all dressed in white
For a moment I thought you were an angel
Come to take me home alive
You woke up and you caught me staring
Smiled and said ""Hey cut it out""
I said that I must be crazy
I said crazy 'bout you and I kissed you on the mouth

[Chorus]
And if I am truly crazy
Don't you know I like my life that way
And if I'm really goin' on out of my mind
Won't you hop on board and make your getaway

Took a walk on down the seashore
Saw a beggar pickin' up some cans
Saw a little boy who had some songs in his eyes
Reachin' out for his mama's hand
Watched a stranger give that man a dollar
Watched the mama wipe the tears from the little boy's eyes
And then I stared up to the heavens
Said ""Oh Lord I'm glad that I'm alive,
Glad that I'm alive""

[Chorus]

Wake up in the morning and turn all the lights on
Turn em out at night so we can hide
Sometimes I sleep with all the lights on
It helps me to appreciate the night

Oh they remember times so sad
Don't you think life would be awfully boring
If the good times were all that we had

Would ride, we would ride, little red cowboy boots, Little red cowboy hat and a

An outlaw riding on the trail knocking over stagecoaches and riding on the 
Rails.

Place where all the outlaws ride

I'm gone to Gallywinter sister would come out and say ""Where you going anyway?"" 
I'm going to Gallywinter and there ain't no girls allowed, I guess things are 
Different now, times have changed. A girl is nice to have with you while you're 
Riding on the range, She can make you breakfast and talk to you at night you 
Can argue about things you never thought you'd argue about in your whole life,

Broken pieces of a broken love affair

I need to learn how to fly
Walk on the clouds with the angels

Spend my nights in wild romances
And hold on to what is holdin' on to me

Doesn't this all seem familiar?
You said I took the words from your mouth
So, maybe, if we sit here and talk for awhile
Mmm, we just might work it all out

And the hardest thing about leaving
Is knowing when a friend is a friend
A couple more drinks and I'll be on my way

Met up with a little cayenne mamma. 
She said she'd like to be my Delta queen, 
She said there's one thing I forgot to tell you, 
Yeah there's one thing you should know. 

She said my mamma was a voodoo princess 
And my heart beats black like coal, 
Well she made up some black magic gumbo and some voodoo etoufe'
She said once you taste my cookin boy 
It's gonna steal your heart away, 
She said there's one more thing I forgot to tell you

Yeah there's one thing that you should know, 
She said once you taste my baby's cookin', 
It's gonna turn your heart black like coal. 
Now she took me on a little walk down the bayou, 
On a lovers rendezvous. 

She said take my hand little Cajun man 
Gonna do the thing lovers do, 
Now there's one thing I forgot to tell you, 
Yeah there's one thing you should know, 
She said oh-oh-oh-oh oh

Now this ain't hardly no story, 
Yeah it's barely even worth the tell, 
But you ramble around in a delta town, 
You're sure to lose yourself, 
And there's one thing I forgot to tell you,

Pat Green,"When the sun hits it right on its way down 
It was the prettiest thing in our little town. 
Every hour I'd sneak a glance over at the plastic frame cracked glass 
That held the picture of Ruby's two sad daughters. 

The last mill closed when I was nine, 
And daddy left, 
And momma cried, again. 
I spent my nights cleaning Ruby's floors. 

Just another cafe 
On a wind swept highway. 
And the farmers bitched, 
We're no good at football anymore. 

In this land that knows no laughter, 
And this land that holds no water, 
We were all in love 
With Ruby's two sad daughters. 

One went way out west, 
One went way wrong. 
One left at seventeen, 
And the other couldn't wait that long. 
Neither went anywhere with me. 
Not to the games or the Dairy Queen. 
They split with the first boy who lied sweet 
And looked vaguely mean. 

In this land that knows no laughter, 
And this land that holds no water, 
We were all in love 
With Ruby's two sad daughters. 
But why so pretty and forlorn? 
Why so permanently blue? 
I guess ours wasn't much 
Of a kingdom to rule 
Now when the sun hits it right on its way down, 
It's still the prettiest thing in our little town. 

Every hour I sneak a glance over at the plastic frame 
And cracked glass that held the picture of Ruby's two sad daughters.

And this year's state inspection I just barely passed
Won't you drive me cross the country, boy? This year could be my last

[Chorus:]
And I'm a tail fin road locomotive
From the days of cheap gasoline
For sale on the side of the road goin' nowhere
A rusty old American dream

I rolled off of the line in Detroit back in 1968
Spent two days on the showroom; that's all I had to wait
I've been good to all who've owned me, so have no fear
Come on, boy, put your money down, get me outta here

[Chorus]

This car needs a young man to own him
One who will polish the chrome
I'll give you the rest of my lifetime
Just don't let me die here alone

Just jump me some juice to my battery
And give that old starter a spin
Here me roar a sputter, back fire to the carburetor
And roar into life once again

Because you packed up your things and headed for the coast, 
I had to fight the urge to follow, 
I guess some time away from me is all you've ever really needed most

Said they would lead us to fall

So I ran out the bank shootin' I was two for two at first
Then I felt a painful sound as a bullet tore my shirt

She's still got a little bitty piece of me

And the moon along the Gunnison don't rise
Shall I cast my dreams upon your love babe
And lie beneath the laughter of your eyes

Little brother thinks the road is straight and fine
Well little darlin' thinks the road is soft and lovely
I'm thankful that old road is a friend of mine

Pat Green,"Marty had a boutique on the corner, 
Stanley was a trucker by his trade, 
And every time that Marty would shake her tail feathers, 
It would go and make old Stanley's day. 
They'd go bowling every Tuesday, 
Down there at the Waco Fair Lanes, 
They'd drink a couple beers, 
Roll a couple spares, 
Then it's off to the trailer, 
Willie Nelson all the way.

[Chorus]
Yeah life here in the trailer park is fine, 
You know that we've been living it everyday, 
I got me a good looking woman I got me some indoor plumbing, 
And I wouldn't have it any other way.
The trailer was a sight to see don't you know, 
Stanley said man double wide is the only way to go, 
We got the hurricane package, 
With the tires up on the roof, 
A satellite dish out back, 
Tin foil in the windows.

[Chorus]

Things got a little tight that summer, 
Marty had to take a second job, 
Seems money was the answer, 
So she became a dancer, 
Down there at the local topless bar.

Pat Green,"When I was a kid I had a rockin' horse named Ranger
Out on the front porch we would ride we would ride
Little red cowboy boots, little red cowboy hat
And a pistol that shoots straight as an eagle flys

Mama would come out and say it's time to come in
I said I ain't going nowhere mama, don't ask me again
I was just an outlaw riding on the trail
Knocking over stage coaches riding on the rails

I'm going to Galleywinter
A place where all the cowboys ride
A place where all the outlaws hide
Away from the men who want to kill them for what they done
I'm going to Galleywinter
I'm going to Galleywinter

My sister'd come out and say
Where are you going anyway?
I'm going to Galleywinter and there ain't no girls allowed
I guess things are different now
Times have changed
A girl is nice to have with you when you're riding on the range
She can make you breakfast, talk to you at night
You can argue about things
you never thought you'd argue about in your whole life

Twenty-five years older
Ranger ain't here no more
Been replaced by a 1958 model T-bird Ford
Baby say where you want to go
I said I don't know maybe Mexico
Anywhere where tequila flows is all right with me

I'm going to Galleywinter
A place where all the outlaws hide
A place where all the cowgirls ride
You know that it's all right with me
I'm going to Galleywinter
I'm going to Galleywinter",Galley Winter

There's a guy we got loading trailers on the dock
Must be out of his mind
He's got a couple of degrees from some university, he's way over qualified
We all wonder what is is about this work the genius finds so pleasin'

There's history and mystery hidden beneath our skin
It's all a part of who we are and the life we live

How in the hell they came up with me
Well, I'm crazy as a loon, I'm howling at the moon
My baby she don't know what to do
She's wondering how in the hell she's going to stay with me

But all the luck you have is just the bills you left unpaid

Seems sure to me there has to be
Such a thing as the good ol' days
Some day somewhere my hair like my memories
Will all just fade out to gray

Sunlight, always shining on my shoulder

I ain't seen you smile in so long
You must of built a house in the misery you found

I'm tired, I'm tired now
Tired of playing the same old game
You got to get yourself together
Say to yourself I ain't going down this way
I ain't going down this way

Sifting through your memories deep in the ground with the dead
Maybe you were high on the top of the cloud with the dragon that lives in your head
Maybe you were dragging your wagon with your thoughts like old wooden toys
Maybe you were looking for something that you lost when you were a boy

You eat when your hungry
You sleep when your sleepy
You drink like there's a hole in your soul
All of your problems are begging to leave

Now, somebody made every natural thing
From the soul, inside out to Saturn's rings
How my baby smiles and how Ray Charles sings

The earth breathes fire, and lava makes land

The friends I have, the woman I hold
I look down and I'm on streets of gold
After all the mud along the way
And sometimes the big old mystery
Just leans right on me
And whispers that I'm home and I am free
And I'll take that any day

I can't explain a blessed thing
Not a falling star, or a feathered wing

That a bad fake ID bought.
Sittin' on the living room couch

For just about everything
It's called College

And headin on out of here.

And my old cavalier
And there's empty pizza boxes
Stacked all around the room

And one in the afternoon

Those were the best days of my life
I found my friends, myself, and my wife.
Learned almost everything that I know
Without ever gaining knowledge
In college, yeah college

I had suck a good time those four years
That I stretched them into six.
And I'd like to thank ole George's Bar
For the the classes that I missed
I was searching for hte meaning of life
When I saw her walk my way.
There was not doubt in my my mind
That it wasn't about a GPA

I found my friends, myself, and my wife.
Learned almost everything that I know
Without ever gaining knowledge

Pat Green,"My father had skin like leather
Hands like steel
From a lifetime spent in the cotton fields
Though he'd come home tired and dirty
Almost every night
He found the strength to smile at me and hold my mama tight
While that old transistor radio would play the op'ry out in the hall
I'd sit and watch their shadows glide across the wall

And they'd dance to a Dixie lullaby
Picture of love beneath the southern sky
Oh my, what a beautiful life
Just like a Dixie lullaby

I left home at eighteen
In a hand me down Chevrolet
Packed my mamas goodness and my old man's stubborn ways
It was college, work, and love
Then the babies came
The youngest one's got his granddaddy's name
And in the early morning hours when my children could not sleep
I'd rock them in my arms to a simple beat

And I'd sing them a Dixie lullaby
Hush, baby, don't you start to cry
Oh my, what a beautiful life
Just like a Dixie lullaby

My father was a mountain of a man
That was the description that I gave
The morning that we laid him in his grave
There with my mama by his side, we said our last goodbye
To a man we thought would never die
As I stood there in the fields of amazing grace
Oh, how the tears ran down my face

And I sang him a Dixie lullaby

And I'm sure it's torn down and gone away
But I'm trying to find it
And there's a feeling that I left behind
I felt it once running down my spine
The fear of God the joy of life
And I'm trying to find it

To find himself and free his soul
A place somewhere between hell and heaven
Where no one hurts and all's forgiven
A door that leads to light and grace
But the keys are in the darkest place
Though it feels like I've been there before
Though I don't know what I'm looking for
And I'm trying to find it

Full of history I need to know about
Of a life I've lived too long without
And I'm trying to find it

And I know you're up there in your room
And I want so bad to heal the wound
But I've hurt you in so many ways
And I don't know why you choose to stay
And I know it's me that let it die
And there's a fire that's gone when I look in your eyes
An innocence that you once had
A piece of you I miss so bad
And I'm trying to find it

Engulfed by the flames of burning street lights

She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella 

Bus stops, bus goes
She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella 

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine 

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew 

Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to avow

Pat Guadagno,"I took a walk in the rain one day 
On the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rail 'til I saw that train 
Just to see how my heart would react
Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
And for them I can not disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me
 
I take my chances
I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances
I take my chances ev'ry chance I get
 
I sat alone in the dark one night
Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat
He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And I lit another cigarette
 
I take my chances
Yes, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances
I take my chances ev'ry chance I get
 
I've crossed lines of words and wire
And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out and I've been on fire
And the tears are mine to weep
But I can cry until I laugh 
Or laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night

Pat La Barbera,"Oh, there's a lull in my life 
It's just a void and empty space 
When you are not in my embrace
Oh, there's a lull In my life 
The moment that you go away 
There is no night, there is no day
The clock stops ticking
The world stops turning
Everything stops but the flame in my heart

I know that you alone can end",There's a Lull in My Life

Never were as blue as his eyes

There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me

He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,

One could not walk,

When you're laughing, When you're laughing,

But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,

Pat Martino,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes

Making my entrance again,

Pat Martino,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Brings all the whole world to judge on your scene
I'm trying to ask you to open up your senses
To all the fine things that tear down the fences
Put up by, and kept by those who don't always listen
To what the father told you they won't be missing
Out and down on this child's intervention
This boy never meant nothing but just to give you

All about the passion
All about the passion
All about the passion

Extra, now extra; won't you read all about it?
Seems you've grown up, turned your life around it
Don't judge him on what the others might say
You'll be asking him for just one thing some other day
He's tryin', he's buyin', he's got himself a time
And it looks like, and it feels like he's doing fine
So won't you stay back off his line?
This boy never meant nothing but just to give you

People, now people, won't you please understand?
This child's not thinking about what others chance
The rain's pouring down on him like harsh blowing sand
Blinding game of darkness; it's no wonder he ran
Back to the old school, right now if they see him though
They know that he's brewing up a fresh batch of home stew
Now they'll sit back and if they only knew
This boy never meant nothing but just to give you",Passion

Wishing my summer away just to see you again

I'm there by your side, lookin' in your eyes
Seeing you with me, what else could there be?
If I could get away, I'd be there today
You'd be wearing that smile

Haven't seen for a while

Wake up everyday, go through the same routine
Go to work, come home
What does it all really mean?
Check the mail just hoping to find
Another note from you would ease my mind
It's five-fifteen
I can picture you driving home from your same old scene
In five you'll hear the phone ringing
Have to settle for talking again

[Chorus]

I can picture you now
You're standing outside your house
The breeze is blowing off your northern shore
I'm loving you more
I long for the days when there's no goodbyes
Wish I could see you
I'd wipe the tears from your eyes
Tell you everything's all right, lay you down
Say to you goodnight

She's been cluelessly wondering just how long she's been had
She knows more than you or me, and she never thinks she's wrong
It seems the tables are turning; she found herself hurting for, oh, so long

Does anybody out there want to help Rebecca find a clue to life?
I guess she feels she was the victim, and we are the knife
There is a price to pay when you put on that face and roll the dice
One day soon you'll realize the world ain't that nice

Didn't anybody ever give a care around your way? 
Will you be alright after we go? 
Won't you tell me someday?

Everybody knows you can't read the writing on the wall 
So don't come in

'Cause we don't have to let you in
Well, you seem to think you know it all

And you're about to land

When will it end
I'll try to pretend, that maybe someday
I'll get to leave it all
I'm gonna give in but
I don't know when

Something's there that i can't see
Save me from mysery

Think about Fifth Avenue
I'll do what I'll have to do

You know that you're never too far away 
Oh you're never too far away

Somebody wait, give me a chance
And I'll open up your eyes

Through your eyes
I wonder would it end this time

We've fallen down before
But you'll never be alone

Pat McGee,"This time it's up to her
She's tired of waiting
She only wants what she deserves
There's no escaping
The fact that she's older and life's turning colder
She's finding it hard to stay warm

After the stars fall down
And there's nothing for wishing on
After the good-bye sound
And love leaves her alone
She picks herself up off the ground
She won't bow down
She's come too far to give up now

Her friends all think it's so sad
She must be lonely
She can't help sometimes but laugh
She knows they're only
Trying to help her
But if they really know her
They'd know she's comin' into her own

After the stars fall down
And there's nothing for wishing on
After the good-bye sound
And love leaves her alone
She picks herself up off the ground
She won't bow down
She's come too far to give up now

She's not sure just where she's going
She's not owning nobody
She just wants the simple life
Where they all leave her alone

And now she's comin' into her own

After the stars fall down

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.

She just likes to use her night light
When she gets paid
True religion gets it all if they fit right

She's a little bit manic, completely organic
Doesn't panic for the most part
She's old enough to know
And young enough not to say no

To any chance that she gets
For home plate tickets to see the Mets
Like everybody, she's in over her head
Dreads Feds, Grateful Dead, and doesn't take meds

She's a Gemini-Capricorn
Thinks all men are addicted to ****
I don't agree with her half the time
But ****, I'm glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She got the kinda strength
That every man wishes he had
She loved Michael Jackson
Up until he made 'Bad'

Tells me that she lived about a hundred lives
Scares me to death when she thinks and drives
Says cowboy hats make her look fat
And I'm so glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She doesn't know the word 'Impossible'
Don't care where I've been
And doesn't care where we're goin' to
She takes me as I am and that ain't easy
She's beautiful, so beautiful

And sometimes I think she's truly crazy
And I love it

That's where blue skies always meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies always meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She's not afraid
She just likes to use her night light",Her Eyes

Where the fuck we at now?

A big ass yellow, and green,
And purple, and faggot ass pink mushroom field

Well fuck it, let's go

Let's eat some of these bitches

Man I never did before, but since we in Oz and all

That's what I'm saying

Well let's at least walk while we eat, come on

Randomly telling what's revealed
Filling my pockets cause they worth a meal
And the kingdom's over them hills

Let me go ahead and eat a few of these things
See if I can't hang
What you thinkin' about?

Cigarettes, menthol only
To grow old with my kids and homies
All the years on that pole so lonely
And all them crows shittin' on me
What you thinkin' about?

Makin' payments on the Batmobile
With the phat sound system and 32 inch wheels
Everybody on the yellow brick jocking
Well I'm just snapping real slow
What you thinkin' about?

Nate The Mack, my homie from way back
Everybody got a homie like that
In fact, I hope he okay
I hope his momma doing good
(You should call him)
Maybe I should
What you thinkin' about?

Caddies
Sittin' on triple gold daytons
Sun shining on 'em and they sparkle up the pavement
People wanna catch a glimpse and show respect
Now I'm the king
Ruler over everything
What you thinkin' about?

A fine bitch and some weed to smoke
I gotta have a little bit of puss to poke
(You ain't no joke)
A fat bag of dro and a hoe
And that's all you really need to know
What you thinking about?

Titties
They come in all shapes and sizes
Each bitch with they own surprises
And if they only had on they back when hitting doggy
You can suck on that
What you thinking about?

Shit, finishing off my Megos set
And making that small dream an accomplishment
So I can find a new hobby like collecting skin
Never removed from the package all mint
What you thinkin' about?

Bitches
That's what I'm thinking about
They clothes so tight
Ass and titties lookin' so right
Stacks of cash and all kinds of tropical hash
And hittin' blunts till my last
Now what you thinkin' about?

Blaze Ya Dead Homie
(Who ya dead who?)
Who ya dead who?
Where I'm from that's cool
Anyway, I'm just wondering when it's Colton shit droppin'?
I'm tryin' to get my gold six hoping
What you thinking about?

Whatchin' my favorite wrestling pay-per-views
On a 100 foot screen
Televison tube
With the fast forward button
I can fly past the jobbers while eating pizza getting fat
What you thinking about?

Wizard, I really hope he's there
And he can help J get the fuck outta here
(I hear what you're saying crow, Tin what you think?)
(Man he better have some drinks)
What you thinkin' about?

What I'm thinkin' about, going home
And it's down this path we roam
Come on

give me a boat that can carry two
and both shall row - my love and I

Now love is gentle, and love is kind
the sweetest flower when first it's new
but love grows old, and waxes cold
and fades away like morning dew

There is a ship, she sails the sea
she's loaded deep as deep can be
but not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim

The water is wide, I can't cross over
and neither I have wings to fly
give me a boat that can carry two
and both shall row - my love and I
and both shall row - my love and I ",The Water Is Wide
Pat Suzuki,"Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side

Pat Suzuki,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream
Pat Suzuki,"I have wished before, I will wish no more

Fly and get lost at sea

No good are you for me

No good am I for you
Wanting you so, I try too much
After you go, I cry too much

Warms an old implacable heart such as mine

Someone's gotta be kissed

From their vast mysterious sky

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,

Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one

And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go

Deux cents gramm's d'or autour d'un diam,
Des p'tits rubis un peu partout...
Seul'ment la bagu' lui v'nait d'Madame !
Ou plutôt, de son ton guindé,
Aux demoisell's qui déambulent,

Fini, l'moindre effort pour lui plaire...

D'un air penaud et ridicule,

Tremblant comme un qu'à la jaunisse
Et cachant ses gros doigts poilus,
Il est allé à la police...
Et là, au commissair' soufflé,

Pour entendre une histoire encor 
Approchez: je vous dirai celle 
De doña Padilla del Flor 
Elle était d'Alanje, où s'entassent 
Les collines et les halliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Il est des filles à Grenade 
Il en est à Séville aussi 
Qui, pour la moindre sérénade 
A l'amour demandent merci 
Il en est que parfois embrassent 
Le soir, de hardis cavaliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Ce n'est pas sur ce ton frivole 
Qu'il faut parler de Padilla 
Car jamais prunelle espagnole 
D'un feu plus chaste ne brilla 
Elle fuyait ceux qui pourchassent 
Les filles sous les peupliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Elle prit le voile à Tolède 
Au grand soupir des gens du lieu 
Comme si, quand on n'est pas laide 
On avait droit d'épouser Dieu 
Peu s'en fallut que ne pleurassent 
Les soudards et les écoliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Or, la belle à peine cloîtrée 
Amour en son cœur s'installa 
Un fier brigand de la contrée 
Vint alors et dit : ""Me voilà!"" 
Quelquefois les brigands surpassent 
En audace les chevaliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Il était laid : les traits austères 
La main plus rude que le gant 
Mais l'amour a bien des mystères 
Et la nonne aima le brigand 
On voit des biches qui remplacent 
Leurs beaux cerfs par des sangliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

La nonne osa, dit la chronique 
Au brigand par l'enfer conduit 
Aux pieds de Sainte Véronique 
Donner un rendez-vous la nuit 
A l'heure où les corbeaux croassent 
Volant dans l'ombre par milliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Or quand, dans la nef descendue 
La nonne appela le bandit 
Au lieu de la voix attendue 
C'est la foudre qui répondit 
Dieu voulu que ses coups frappassent 
Les amants par Satan liés 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Cette histoire de la novice 
Saint Ildefonse, abbé, voulut 
Qu'afin de préserver du vice 
Les vierges qui font leur salut 
Les prieurs la racontassent 
Dans tous les couvents réguliers

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him

If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late

I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

And was playing soft

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

(Holly mother lost her pearl necklace) 
One little drop 
Dropped on my face 
And the second one 
Dropped on my six year old friend's 
All of a sudden 
Some huge hand grabbed us 
I slipped 
But my friend stayed 
And was taken with the crowd 
Voices of panic were heard everywhere around 
And one of them came from my mother's mouth 
As she saw me 
Dancing in the rain 
With my hands up 
Couldn't just figure out it's funny acid taste",1986
Pati Yang,"Air stands still 
And I can't move 
Time has stopped 
At one look through 
Colors fade the walls out loud 

Something inside me says: 
I am still waiting for the hurricane 
And where is the missing piece 

You have taken it 
And a part of me 

Downstairs scares me 
Outside sounds like ghosts are 
Quietly playing vibes 
Days in shape of hide me, please 

Even mirror cries 
With empty tears 

Home has the echo as a friend 
So I leave the bed unmade 
All day",Air Stands Still
Pati Yang,"When the body keeps well 
Only the head counts 
She's the only one that has something to tell 
And that happens,
Just like that 
She doesn't even think of it 
And she's the only one that counts 
she's the only one 
She's the only one that knows 
The secret gate 
To the garden at the bottom",Easy Flow
Pati Yang,"Did you see your angel? 
Did you see 
The one 
Pouring dust over you shoulder 
When you cried, 
The city cried 
The lights went off 
The day before 
All papers called, 
That your tears went missing 
And therefore 
From now on the city was freed from the miracle 
Did you asked questions? 
About how many more days forward 
How many evil intentions 
All the unusual people 
On ordinary missions 
Everyone seems to know but us 
I trust my eyes 
And this is not happening 
I make a list everyday, but it fades 
Must be the see through int in my veins 
Say it now change your mind call my day a sunny night 
Live a dream forever after 
I'll take care of your disaster 
Make it back on the track sugar sweet no defeat 
For no reason there's no water 
Only bites, virtually rotten 
Did you dance your town away 
All the way down to the river? 
Did you marry the moonlight? 
Have you ever forgiven? 
Did you burry your past 
Fought till the last drop blessed your face? 
Since then 
The days 
Went all uneven 
Everyone seems to know but us, 
Is that how it goes? 
I trust my eyes, and this is not happening, 
You tell me: aren't my senses failing? 
Is it the skin that I am in that breaks my heart in two 
And makes my fingers grin on you 
When we dance 

My toes scream to yours 
And the noise brings down our home 
In ruin 
We're fooling with dogs 
That speak human 
And as if that wasn't enough 
I think I am turning into A giant cat woman 
How many more days forward 
How many daylight robberies 
Did you pick up the money and run, honey? 
Be honest",Giant Cat Woman
Pati Yang,"This song was meant to hurt 
Was meant to be 
About the broken world 
In a broken girl 
These words 
I found written on my window 
By the L the lipstick dead 
I thought I've seen her crying 
I thought she ran too fast 
I thought I'd make her stop 
But I just stood there, 
Watched her fight 
If I could live it one more time 
Reverse the day 
Back to where I begun 
Leaving my memories behind 
I'd draw a brand new history 
A brand new me 
I breathe slower 
As the fever comes 
And takes away the stream of useless words 
(No need to explain) 
I dive deeper 
Though I cannot swim 
Air and water seems the same 
Everything makes perfect sense 
Lips against the heart 
Heart against the will 
Toes beyond the sky 
Hand beyond the reach 
If I could live it one more time 
Reverse the day 
Back to where I begun 
Leaving my memories behind 
I say it standing seconds away from the edge 
And the rock seems hard",Reverse the Day
Pati Yang,"I've heard magic through the door 
Half stairs up 
I stopped: too fast 
Maybe the key will turn 
Four white walls and only one echo 
I guess I talk to myself again 
With tens of voices 
Schizoframed 
Soul for me a little 
Before the soul is gone 
Shake a little 
And speak a little more 
Soul for me a little 
Feel a little 
If you can feel at all 
I thought: 
On three 
The miracle would become real 
Isn't that what you said? 

And then left 
Since the door has shut 
The silence screams 
Against the only prayer I've had: 

Soul for me a little 
Before the soul is gone 
Shake a little 
And speak a little more 
Soul for me a little 
Feel a little 
If you can feel at",Soul for Me
Pati Yang,"This morning's been cruel to me again, 
Even my bed is cold 
Naked I seat down and break in tears 
So hysterical 
Tearing off the pillows of past 
I bet all neighbors have heard me before 
Can't beat another sleepless night 
Does it have to go on? 
Carry on finding pieces of me on the streets 
It's only when I loose myself 
And it won't stop raining 
Chasing days on the runaway 
From the deep burning 
It's only when I fade away 
And the fever stays 
Water is gonna have to be 
Once more the substitute for milk 
I close my eyes: 
I think they've seen enough, 
Light hurts: 
Can anyone switch off the sun?",Switch Off the Sun
Pati Yang,"The sun says that this is for my good 
Only till I am back inside 
Licking wounds until I can see through 
This shadeless heart 
And clouds in shape of you 
I am the unquiet 
Minutes are hours 
I cry hard 
To make you tired 
Asleep I might be talking other world 
Take you there when you will understand: 
How on earth 
She's meant to be my drug? 
Without you
She wouldn't be herself.",Unquiet

A ribbon is something rare,
So I'll be special and I'll be rare with a smile and a ribbon in my hair.
To be a girl they notice,

Takes more than a fancy dress,
So I'll be noticed because I'll dress with a smile and a ribbon in my tresses...
The bigger my toothy grin is, the smaller my troubles grow
The louder I say I'm happy, the more I believe it's so

When you came on the scene 10 years ago
I thought I was hip, I could deal with the trips

Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

From the heartical dan Mr. Pato Banton.
Me comin' in c-comin' in c-comin' in strong
With a positive summer time vibration.
Cause in the winter me can't take the cold
Body start shiver when the breeze start blow.
Car can't start cause the engine froze
Can't move me fingers, can't feel me toes.
But in the summer when the sun shine bright
Kick off me boot put on me air nike.
Leave me car and jump pon me bike
It's this kind of weather I like.

Well everyday people are in a rat race
But if I could I would just slow down the pace.
Like a record on a deck, switch the speed
From 45 down to 33.
Whoa! Nice and slow
Sun a shine and breeze a blow.
Lord! Nice and easy
Just a chill with me friends and family.

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't no place I'd rather be instead of groovin'!

Now in the struggle of life to achieve success
Everyone goes through some form of stress.
The rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief
Lawyer and the doctor, even the priest.
Whoa Oh! Some people take a trip to the beach.
Whoa Oh! To get a little stress relief.
Whoa Oh! Take a picnic down to the park.
Whoa Oh! With me children and me sweetheart.
Whoa Oh! Oh yes I have to confess.
Whoa Oh! The summer time vibes are the best.
Whoa Oh! People people if you agree.
Whoa Oh! I'm Pato Banton come follow me.",Groovin

Por muito tempo não consigo esperar
Quase sempre ser feliz
É um alento ou uma falta de are
Capaz de me fazer

De tantas chances perdidas
Sem demora então
É só acreditar

Zanzando atrás do que é bom

Quando essa joça ficar pronta
Quero ver quem que dá conta
De contar como se conta o dinheirão que vai pro saco
Fazer pirâmide, jardim, não é problema
Bota o nome do Ayrton Senna
Põe na entrada do buraco
Vamos errar português
Vamos eleger um bundão
Vamos votar em quem roubou mas fez
Pena de morte para os linchadores, ou não?
Já que a policia não faz nada
O menininho da calçada
De dia dou moedinha
De noite eu dou porrada
Vamos inventar uma nova dancinha
Sucatear o samba e maltratar o carnaval
Vamos dar um jeito de arrumar a vida
Então vamos morrer de uma vez, tá legal?

E vendo ele morrer
Sem saber o que fazer
Segurei sua mão fria

Vi que era pobre
Moço sem instrução
Cheirava a pinga barata
Uma aliança no dedo
Talvez fosse um ladrão

Ajoelhei-me ao seu lado
Me disse o atropelado:
Fiquei com a pior parte
De tudo o que é chamado
Civilização

Devolva este anel
Pra dona daquele bordel
Foi lá que eu roubei
Diga pro dono do bar
Que minha conta encerrei

Gemeu como um cão
E sobre o asfalto quente
Seu sangue escorreu suavemente

Now baby, I got a whole lot to give

But before I give it up, I gotta think, think
Think what the future holds for me
Just go ahead and see

I don't need no heartache
I can't stand no misery

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

I know I'm able

But I won't do nothing that you won't do
Said I won't do nothing that you won't do

You walk and you talk without love in your heart 
So now you wonder, upon Jah people you stare 
About Jah you don't care 
So now you wonder, you big up your chest and you think you are the best 
So you wonder, it is wind you ah sow 
But you will reap thunderstorm 
Yes you will wonder

They stand up to me as if they were somebody 
They want you to believe that your god is false 
And their god is real 
But the seed them caste is what them will reap at last they 
Believe in vanity 
What's the reason for your stupidness 
Your foolishness, you ignorance? 
You never consider any consequence 
Of your actions them, that's madness 
You are going to take this for fun 
Until you feel judgement burn 
Act like you don't understand 
And run from Jah son it's your own possessions you are possessed 
By ooh man, it's so sad to see how you ah flex and 
Ah gwan you act like a fool you are ruled by you tools by 
What was made for their own use human beings now get used 
Hearts and minds are confused 
Instead of seeking love and truth 
They have fear

We keep shining on 
We keep rising on 
We keep riding on 
We keep praising on 

Them all express pure uglyness by their possessions 
Them get possessed 
Them manifest pure emptiness 
What their speech and deeds reflect 
The heart that beats behind your chest 
Beats to the rhythm of your clock 
Guess what the have-nots 
They are fed up too long 
They are bleeding blood 
But your guiltiness is gonna rest on your conscience 
The world regains its consciouness 
As the father resurrects 
Babatunde - the father has come back 
Babatunde - because this place here has to get blessed

Spring time 
I wake up and Close my eyes 
You gave me butterflies 
As our love wason the rise 
Summer 
The season has reached its height 
Love making through the night 
Until the morning light. 
Autumn 
I see colours fading out 
The heat is cooling down 
And leaves are falling to the ground. 
As in winter 
Were out of what we had 
We looking for excuses 
But our love is simply dead 

But it is cold so cold 
And clouds burry us like snow. 
We were so bold to hold 
On to love like gold. 
And it's so beautiful 
When ever nature does her thing; 
Oh it's so beautiful 
Just like a queen and a king. 
And the rain yes the rain 
Couldn't wash away my blame, 
Yes the rain ah the rain 
Couldn't wash away my blame

But life's a circle 
And we are in it 
Some wait for miracles 
We push the limits. 
Through ups and downs, 
Hills and valleys 
I have traveled 
And I'm far from finished. 
I keep it moving , 
Keep it spinning, 
See I wouldn't be me today 
If it wasn't for the shit I've been in. 
Can't be losing ever winning 
Don't get caught up in winter take it back to the beginning

But my strength of today lays in yesterday's pain 
I stole, was sold, was bold, I chilled 
I killed, I fell, I rose, you know 
I've lost a fight before 
But I won't lose the war 

[Chorus ]
This ain't about the bad ones 
It's about the one who no care 
Who's too fat to be bothered 
Too lazy and scared 
To whom changing this world 
Would mean send his world to hell 
And destroy an illusion 
That served him so well 
Good things never come easy 
Start with reflection of self 
To some this might sound cheesy 
But the truth afi tell 
Some caught up in survival 
Think it's them that need help 
You never know that material 
Could never be wealth

Stranded in the town

Why do the good girls love the bad boy them?
And think they can change them into good guys when
They feel that love in them

And temptation,? I went

One who would love you and give you the world.
Then you find, babe, that you've been misused,
Come to me, honey, I'll do what you choose.

Tell Mama, what you want and I'll make everything alright

Can't make no plans, I just see you whenever I can
What happens in between, I sit and dream about you

Winter comes after fall

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I never dreamt it could be

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing.

I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun.

Patricia Barber,"It was the third of June
Another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton
And my brother was balin' hay

At dinner time we stopped
Walked back to the house to eat
Mama hollered out the back door
""Y'all remember to wipe your feet""

Then she said, ""I got some news
This mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe Mac Allister
Jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Papa said to Mama as he passed
Around the black eyed peas
""Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense
Pass the biscuits, please""

""There's five more acres
In the lower forty I've got to plow""
Mama said it was shame
About Billy Joe, anyhow

Seems like nothin' ever comes
To no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe Mac Allister's
Jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

Mama said to me
""Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all mornin'
And you haven't touched a single bite""

""That nice young preacher
Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have a dinner
On Sunday, oh, by the way""

""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot
Like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe were throwing
Somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Well, a year has come 'n' gone
Since we heard the news about Billy Joe
Brother married Becky Thompson
Bought a store in Tupelo

There was a virus going 'round
Papa caught it and he died last Spring
Now Mama doesn't seem
To wanna do much of anything

And me, I spend a lot of time
Pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water
Off the Tallahatchie Bridge

This isn't maybe, this is always.
This is love,
The real beginning of forever,
This isn't just mid summer madness,

You tied a string around my heart,
So how can I forget you.
With every kiss I know that
This is always.",Romanesque

Patricia Barber,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.

Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

And anyone can tell you think, you know me well
Well, you don't know me

No, you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend that's all I've ever been
No, you don't know me

Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too

There's somebody thinking of you
I'm the one who'll never hurt you
Maybe that's because I love you

Call me, don't be afraid
You can call me
Don't wait a minute just call me
Call me and I'll be around

Now don't forget me 'cause if you let me
I will always stand by you
You've got to trust me, that's how it must be
There's so much I can do

And I noticed there wasn't a chair

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

Patricia Kaas,"Vous viviez comme un prince, je chantais pour trois sous
Dan un bal de province et je rêvais de vous
A la fin du polar, quand vous ne mouriez pas
Comme je l'enviais la dame qui souriait dans vos bras

Je vous aurais aimé avant de vous connaître
Mais vous aurais connu avant de disparaître
Je n'en suis pas peu fière, mais je tiens à en rire
Entre toi et le poster j'ai du mal à choisir

Et je te dis vous
M'avez éblouie
Moi qui n'étais rien
Vous qui aviez tout
Vous m'avez dit tu
Es belle, toute en noir
Quand vous êtes venu
M'écouter un soir

C'était au mois de mai, j'm'en souviendrai toujours
J'étais morte d'angoisse, vous sachant là dans l'ombre
Puis sont venus vos fleurs et l'espoir d'un amour
Vous le grand, moi la p'tite, soyez là si je tombe

La gloire est si fragile et bien moins que mon cœur
On dit qu'elle est le deuil éclatant du bonheur
A la fin du polar, si vous deviez mourir
J'essaierais c'est promis de garder le sourire

Et je te dis vous

Sur une guitare, sur une violin
Qu'il soit trop tard, qu'il soit trop long
Sur un boulevard ou sous un pont
Le sans-logis fait sa chanson

Sur une guitare sur un violin
Sur un tam-tam do gabon
Sur une batterie à l'occasion
Le sans-patrie fait sa chanson

Si la vérité sort de la bouche do métro
Si le monde entier dit qu'on a tort d'aimer trop
Quand l'hiver est rude et qu'on cri ""chaud les marrons""
Le sans-abri fait sa chanson

La liberté
See'est pas la porte à côté
La liberté
See'est le bout do monde

Sur une guitare, sur un violin
Sur des gamelles et des bidons
A tout hasard sous les balcons
Le sans-papiers fait sa chanson

Sur une guitare, sur un violin
Sur un air de duke ellington
A bout de souffle, à bout de son
Le sans-le-sou fait sa chanson

Si la vérité sort de la bouche do métro
Si le monde entier dit qu'on a tort d'aimer trop
Quand l'hiver est rude et qu'on crie ""chaud les marrons""
Le sans-culotte fait sa chanson

Patricia Kaas,"Et quand le temps se lasse
De n'être que tué
Plus une seconde passe
Dans les vies d'uniformité
Quand de peine en méfiance
De larmes en plus jamais
Puis de dépit en défiance
On apprend à se résigner
Viennent les heures sombres
Où tout peut enfin s'allumer
Ou quand les vies ne sont plus qu'ombres
Restent nos rêves à inventer

Il me dit que je suis belle
Et qu'il n'attendait que moi
Il me dit que je suis celle
Juste faite pour ses bras
Il parle comme on caresse
De mots qui n'existent pas
De toujours et de tendresse
Et je n'entends que sa voix

Éviter les regards, prendre cet air absent
Celui qu'ont les gens sur les boulevards
Cet air qui les rend transparents
Apprendre à tourner les yeux
Devant les gens qui s'aiment
Éviter tous ceux qui marchent à deux
Ceux qui s'embrassent à perdre haleine
Y a-t-il un soir, un moment
Où l'on se dit c'est plus pour moi
Tous les mots doux, les coups de sang
Mais dans mes rêves, j'y ai droit

Il me dit que je suis belle
Et qu'il n'attendait que moi
Il me dit que je suis celle
Juste faite pour ses bras
Des mensonges et des bêtises
Qu'un enfant ne croirait pas
Mais les nuits sont mes églises
Et dans mes rêves j'y crois

Il me dit que je suis belle
Je le vois courir vers moi
Ses mains me frôlent et m'entraînent
C'est beau comme au cinéma
Plus de trahison, de peines

Il me dit que je suis reine
Et pauvre de moi, j'y crois

Comme les étangs, comme les mares
O¨' les lions là-bas vont boire.

Et si...et si...bessie

Avec sa belle voix do soudan
Et son feeling renversant

Mais si...mais si...bessie
Elle avait pas eu la peau noire
Bessie blessée par un chauffard
Elle s'rait pas morte sur un trottoir
En perdant doucement tout son sang
Devant un hôpital de blancs.

Et si...et si...bessie
Avait vécu parmi des gens
Qui savent qu'on est tout differents
Peut-ítr' qu'un soir, incidemment
Toutes les deux on aurait pu faire
Quelqu' chose comme un duo d'enfer.

Là-bas ou ici
Mais pas madison.
Un club dans la nuit
Un piano qui sonne.

Et si..et si..bessie

Comme l'ébène à côté d'l'ivoire
Ou comme les belles robes de moire

Dans une écharpe de laine 
Jeté les fleurs
Des vases de porcelaine
Il va couler bien des jours
Sous le pont de notre amour
Sans que je puisse t'oublier.

J'ai accroché
Des rideaux gris aux fenêtres
Et j'ai brûlé
Nos photos et tes lettres
L'amour est-il si pressé
De toujours vouloir s'en aller
Dites-moi si vous savez
Où s'en vont les cœurs brisés
Quand ils ont fini d’aimer.

Même si le temps passe
Rien ne te remplace
Mais saurons-nous un jour
Où donc la vie les emporte
Toutes ces amours mortes.

Malgré tout je te regrette

Un dernier blues avant demain
Avant que la mort me donne la main
Avant que l'automne ait mis aux arbres
Des cheveux roux.

Un dernier blues avant minuit
Avant que l'amour m'ait travesti
Avant que les hommes ait pris mon coeur
Pour un igloo.

Un dernier blues en catastrophe
Avant qu'une étoile m'apostrophe
Avant d'avoir écrit mon nom
Sur les néons de l'infini.

Point de suspension et virgule
Un dernier blues un jour de pluie
En mi mineur pour un ami.

D'un amour héroique
Montrez-moi comme vous dites

Vos chansons mal écrites
Mal chantées mal aimées mal jouées

Des fois ça me suffit
Rien que vous dire
Comme ça

Toujours chanter l'amour
Emouvante plaidoirie
De choisir sans détour

Emmenez-moi en bateau
Ver toutes les amériques
Prenez-moi dans vos bras

Mais Marilyn Dubois s´ra jamais Norma Jean
Faut pas croire que l´talent c´est tout c´qu´on s´imagine

Elle a du gospel dans la voix et elle y croit

Y´en a qui s´font bonne sœur, avocat, pharmacienne
Y´en a qui ont tout dit quand elles ont dit je t´aime
Y´en a qui sont vieilles filles du côté d´Angoulême
Y´en a même qui jouent femmes libérées
Petit joint et gardénal qui mélangent vie en rose et image d´Epinal
Qui veulent se faire du bien sans jamais s´faire du mal",Mademoiselle Chante le Blues

Des rayons d'innocence

Avant la prudence
Avant la malchance

why a-t-il un sort, un signe
Est-ce un doigt qui désigne
Celle ou celui qui va
Renoncer pas à pas

Comment, qui sont-ils
Ces gens trop fragiles
Qui ne savent pas

Vivre quand tout lâche
Quand tout casse
Quand tout clash
Quand tous les blues

Ont sali ta raison
Ta maison, tes saisons
Quand tout est sombre
Plus rien n'est doux
J'ai peur de tout

Si ma vie je l'invente
Légère et insouciante
Je les croise au hasard
Dans les rues dans les bars

Fatigues, dociles
Ailleurs immobiles
Je ressens tout ça, tout ce froid

Cette intime fracture
Cette lézarde au mur
Je la sais, elle est là
Toujours au fond de mo

Et parfois je coule
Comme une pierre qui roule
Qui roule si bas

Si bas quand tout lâche
Quand tout casse
Quand toutclash
Quand tous les blues

Ont sali ta raison, ta maison
Tes saisons
Quand tout est sombre
Plus rien n'est doux
Quand j'ai peur de tout

Si j'avais pu m'enfermer dans tes bras
M'enfermer, me protéger
Mais où es-tu dans ces moments la
Qui pourrait m'apaiser? Oh

Vivre quand tout lâche
Quand tout casse
Quand tout clash
Quand tous les blues

Ont sali ta raison
Ta maison, tes saisons
Quand tout est sombre
Plus rien n'est doux
J'ai peur de tout
J'ai peur de tout

Si peur de tout, si peur de

Tous les blues ont sali ta raison
Ta maison, tes saisons
Quand tout est sombre
Plus rien n'est doux

Et parfois quand je coule

J'ai peur de tout
J'ai peur de tout

Patricia Kaas,"Je ne chercherai plus ma route
Ses chemins creusés par le doute
La terre n'en sera pas plus loin
Ni plus à portée de la main

J'en aurai fait de ces détours
Où tant de bonheurs tournent court
Et peu importe la distance
Entre la joie et la souffrance
Ce sera, ce sera, ce sera ...

Ma liberté contre la tienne
Les vérités qui nous retiennent
Nos cœurs ne seront plus si lourds
D'avoir emporté trop d'amour

Ma liberté contre la tienne
La volonté d'où qu'elle me vienne
Partir découvrir avec toi
L'utilité de nos combats

Je serai peut-être moins forte
Touchée par des rêves d'autres sortes
Tout est fait de tant d'illusions
Que même l'ignorance est un don

Je n'aurai pas d'autre langage
Que celui de tous les partages
Jusqu'à trouver sous une pierre
Une petite chance pour l'univers
Ce sera, ce sera, ce sera …

Le monde aura changé de nom
Et que rien ne résistera
Au temps qui passe, de toute façon

On peut s'attendre à retrouver
Un peu de toi dans mes chagrins
On verra bien que j'ai pleuré
Et que j'ai tenu d'autres mains

Je serai là au temps qui passe
Au temps qui a raison de tout
Je serai là comme je suis là
Devant chez nous

Je serai là comme une trace
Sur les vestiges d'un amour fou
Je serai là comme je suis là
Le mot de passe, le mot de passe
Ce sera nous

On peut penser que tu voudras
Me raconter nos retrouvailles
Faudra-t-il alors que j'y crois
Comme j'ai cru à nos batailles

On peut passer si près de toi
Sans te toucher, sans te comprendre
Il y a ces mots qui n'auront pas
Eu la patience de t'attendre

Je serai là au temps qui passe
Au temps qui a raison de tout
Je serai là comme je suis là

Sur les vestiges d'un amour fou

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the trains
To carry the heavy load

Man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark

[Chorus]

Man thinks about the baby girls
And the baby boys
Man makes them happy
'Cause man made the toys

After man made everything
Everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other men

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitteness

Patricia Kaas,"Out of the rain, under the shelter
I've been so long where the sun don't shine
Standing at the cross-roads, could have went either way
But now I've found you and the storm is behind

Out of the rain, out of the rain

Over the wall, I'm out in the open
Back on the right tracks, I'm feeling no pain
You took a sparrow and let it fly with the eagles
I can see a long ways I feel love again

Out of the rain, out of the rain

There was a time I was taking no prisoners
Standing with a cold hear, standing alone
It took your sweet love to pull me out of the canyon
I believe I can make it now, I feel like I belong

Out of the rain, out of the rain
Out of the rain, out of the rain

To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss but more than this
I wish you love

And in July, a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

All kinds of love
I wish you love

I wish you love

",I Wish You Love (Que Reste-T-Il de Nos Amours?)
Patricia Kaas,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in a summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was lo-ong
And the moon stood still for the night birds song
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go-o I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

If you go away as I know you must
There'll be nothin' left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face 
Can I tell you now as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly till your next hello
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I-I love so much
But if you go, I won't cry
For the good's gone from goodbye
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away",If You Go Away (Ne Me Quitte Pas)
Patricia Kaas,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeur (The Windmills of Your Mind)
Patricia Kaas,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man
Patricia Kaas,"The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed she sheds so close
The summer smooth, the restless kind
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubt within your eyes
And so she takes her summer times
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world from her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of it all

The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed she sheds so close
The summer smooth, the restless kind
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

And if you learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

",The Summer Knows (Un Été 42)
Patricia Kaas,"What now my love, now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turning to ashes
And my hopes into bits of clay

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul

What now my love, now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars tumbling around me
There's the sky where the sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on, on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die

",What Now My Love (Et Maintenant)
Patricia Kaas,"Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be;
The sweet love story that is older than the sea,
The simple truth about the love he brings to me?
Where do I start?

With his first hello,
He gave new meaning to this empty world of mine,
There'll never be another love, another time,
He came into my life and made the living fine,
He fills my heart,

He fills my heart with very special things,
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings,
He fills my soul with so much love,
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely;
With him along, who could be lonely?
I reach for his hand, it's always there

How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now but this much I can say:
I know I'll need him till the stars all burn away,
And he'll be there.",Where Do I Begin (Love Story)

Et donnent à leur vie l'espoir d'une autre chance

Où sont les hommes
Où sont les hommes

Où sont les hommes
Où sont les hommes

Où sont les hommes
Qui se livrent sans pudeur
Et décrivent sans peur
Ce qu'ils ont dans le c?ur
Où sont les hommes
Qui plongent
S'allongent
Sur le corps d'une femme
Pour anéantir sa peur

Où sont les hommes
Qui marchent
Et font taire les lâches
Et ne mâchent pas leurs mots jamais
Où sont les hommes
Qui laissent entrevoir ce qu'ils ont de plus vrai
Et livrent leurs secrets

Où sont les hommes
Où sont les hommes

Où sont les hommes
Où sont les hommes

Où sont les hommes
Qui tombent à genoux
Et qui demeurent fous
Pour l'amour d'une femme
Où sont les hommes
Qui continuent de croire
En celui que partout tous les autres condannent

Où sont les hommes
Qui lèvent leurs yeux et leurs mains vers le ciel implorant le pardon
Où sont les hommes
Qui quand ils parlent à Dieu sont prets à écouter un jour ce qu'il répond

Où sont les hommes
Où sont les hommes

Patricia Kaas,"Quand on n'a que l'amour
À s'offrir en partage
Au jour du grand voyage
Qu'est notre grand amour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Mon amour toi et moi
Pour qu'éclatent de joie
Chaque heure et chaque jour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour vivre nos promesses
Sans nulle autre richesse
Que d'y croire toujours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour meubler de merveilles
Et couvrir de soleil
La laideur des faubourgs

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour unique raison
Pour unique chanson
Et unique secours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour habiller matin
Pauvres et malandrins
De manteaux de velours

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir en prière
Pour les maux de la terre
En simple troubadour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
À offrir à ceux-là
Dont l'unique combat
Est de chercher le jour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour parler aux canons
Et rien qu'une chanson
Pour convaincre un tambour

Quand on n'a que l'amour
Pour tracer un chemin
À chaque carrefour

Alors, sans avoir rien
Que la force d'aimer
Nous aurons dans nos mains
Ma mie, le monde entier",Quand On N'a Que L'Amour

'Cause it won't ease the pain
And you might as well try to convince me
The sun will shine after the rain

It won't beat if you're not by my side
So if you're leaving

Your heart is meant for mine
And you'll bring it back to me

I feel those butterflies
I need your smile, all the time
You light my darkest night
When you are by my side
I need your love, all the time

Hope you are always mine
I never would turn back the time
You are my destiny
My heart is in your hands
I pray to God above
Please never stop this perfect love
You are the best of me
Your love can set me free

Vers 2:
Your heart is like my home
You never walk this road alone
I'll never let you down
The best is yet to come
Love changes everything
With you I'm living in a dream
And when you're far away
Your love will make my day

I wouldn't change a thing on you

I believe in faith, in knowledge I can learn
I believe all what you give, you get returned

Patricia O'Callaghan,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Surely tomorrow, you'll feel blue
But then will come a love that's new
For you, Lili Marlene
For you, Lili Marlene

When we are marching in the mud and cold
And when my pack seems more than I can hold
My love for you renews my might
I'm warm again, my pack is light
It's you, Lili Marlene
It's you, Lili Marlene

My love for you renews my might
I'm warm again, my pack is light
It's you, Lili Marlene
It's you, Lili Marlene",Lili Marleen
Patricia Sosa,"Duro es el camino y se que no es fácil 
No se si habrá tiempo para descansar 
En esta aventura de amor y coraje 
Solo hay que cerrar los ojos y echarse a volar 

Y cuando el corazón galope fuerte, déjalo salir 
No existe la razón que venza la pasión, las ganas de reír 

Puedes creer, puedes soñar 
Abre tus alas, aquí esta tu libertad 
Y no pierdas tiempo, escucha al viento 
Canta por lo que vendrá 
No es tan difícil que aprendas a volar 

No pierdas la fe, no pierdas la calma 
Aunque a veces este mundo no pide perdón 
Grita aunque te duela, llora si hace falta 
Limpia las heridas que cura el amor

No esperaba volverte a ver, 
Me quedé sin ilusiones 
Después de la última vez 
Sé que cambiamos un poco, 
No me digas que no es cierto, 
Lo nuestro fue para siempre 
Y duro solo un momento 

Esta noche no me digas nada, 
Solo endulzame los oídos 
Esta noche olvidemos todo, 
Solo háblame de amor

No quiero saber que has hecho, 
Hoy me alegra tenerte aquí, 
Y no me preguntes nada

En tus ojos puedo ver 
Lo que genero el amor ahora esta matándome 
Es el riesgo del que hable 
Un silencio entre el deseo y la fe 

Es un secreto que has de llevar 
Escondido bajo tu corazón 
Imposible de revelar 
Quedara siempre entre tu y yo

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Together we're going a long, long way

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Lose their taste for kissing?

And miss it each night and day

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Sur les joues des enfants

Patrick Bruel,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

À Saint Jean, aux musettes

Car l'on croit toujours aux doux mots d'amour 
Quand ils sont dits avec les yeux

Elle le trouvait le plus beau de Saint Jean 
Elle restait grisée 
Sans volonté sous ses baisers 

Sans plus réfléchir, elle lui donnait 
Le meilleur de son être

Elle était folle de croire au bonheur 
Et de vouloir garder son cœur

Où tu n'aimais que moi et qui s'enfuit déjà

Où dans l'apesanteur, des slows longs de l'été sans sanglot, sans pudeur.

Patrick Bruel,"Tu rentres tôt, plus tôt qu'avant
Tu allumes ton ordi, tu attends
Ils sont tous là, derrière l'écran
Cette fois encore, c'est pas ta fête
Tu lis quand même, tu baisses la tête
Il faudra bien que ça s'arrête
Ces mots jetés, un peu pour voir
Derrière un clavier, va savoir
Quel enfant sage prend le pouvoir
Seul dans sa chambre, un gamin rit
Pour faire rire les autres avec lui
Et ça tombe sur toi aujourd'hui
Sèche tes larmes, regarde-moi
J'ai encore plus mal que toi quand tes yeux me demandent 'Pourquoi?'
On répète ce que l'on entend
On cherche sa place dans le vent
Mais ce ne sont que des maux, d'enfants

Pour une fille, qui leur dit non
Pour un garçon qui aime un garçon
Pour une petite phrase à la con
Parce qu'au milieu, d'une cour d'école
Il n'y a pas que les ballons qui volent
Il n'y a pas que des jeux drôles
Qui est minable, qui est cador
Pour un blouson, ou un portable
C'est si facile de mettre à mort
Lève la tête, regarde-moi
J'ai encore plus mal que toi
(Yeah, Fouiny Babe, yeah)

Et on les croise à la pelle, les voyous virtuels
Les petites ont 13 piges, veulent déjà être sensuelles
Les murs n'ont plus d'oreilles ils ont Bluetooth ADSL
Et on joue au jeu de celui qui sera le plus cruel

Les claviers ça tire, les ordis sont des armes
'Maman je reste dans ma chambre,
Maman j'ai pas trop faim,
Maman j'ai fait souffrir mais c'est court comme un refrain'
Rencontres sur le net, tu sais même plus qui tu vois
Privés sont les messages, plus besoin de se casser la voix
Je t'aime par SMS et tu me manques par e-mail
Tu m'as kiffé sur Twitter et t'as rompu par BBM
Moi quand j'étais petit on avait pas d'ordinateur
On restait jouer au foot et on parlait pendant des heures
Toi t'es seul devant l'écran, et même les jours de fête
Dis-moi avec qui tu surfes, je te dirai qui tu traites

Pourquoi, demande leur
Ils ne savent pas, ils croient jouer comme les grands
A d'autres guerres, à d'autres jeux d'enfants
Lève la tête, parle, je t'entends
Change le sens du vent
La haine se glisse, dans les bagages
A l'âge des livres d'images

Vite, un sac photo, tes objectifs, de quoi écrire
Dans cette rue qui dort, je te sers fort, fais gaffe à toi
Je sais que tu n'as pas peur mais moi, j'ai un peu froid

Ton avion s'envole encore vers quelle guerre, vers quel combat
Une fois de plus les enfants demanderont pourquoi t'y vas
Une fois de plus je répondrai, que sans leur maman, personne ne saura
Et que pendant tout ce temps, seules tes images parleront de toi

Où es-tu, m’entends-tu?

Dix jours que tu es partie et tes messages se font rares
À la radio, ils ont dit que les rebelles prennent le pouvoir
Ce matin, à l'école, les enfants ont entendus l'histoire
Moi, je crève de ne pas sentir ta peau quand viens le soir

Devant la télé, je sais le prix de chaque image
Tellement peur de voir ton nom un jour en première page
Je t'entends courir sous une pluie de feu et d'enfer
Je t’envoie ce que je peux, tous nos sourires dans tes déserts

Où es-tu, m’entends-tu?

Dépêche AFP, en pleine nuit, tu ne rentres pas

Que les fenêtres du monde se ferment sur toi en chuchotant (M’entends-tu)

Ou était-ce une nuit?
Près d'un lac, je m'étais endormi
Quand soudain, semblant crever le ciel 
Et venant de nulle part
Surgit un aigle noir

Lentement, les ailes déployées
Lentement, je le vis tournoyer
Près de moi, dans un bruissement d'ailes
Comme tombé du ciel
L'oiseau vint se poser

Il avait les yeux couleur rubis
Et des plumes couleur de la nuit
À son front, brillant de mille feux
L'oiseau roi couronné 
Portait un diamant bleu

De son bec, il a touché ma joue
Dans ma main, il a glissé son cou
C'est alors que je l'ai reconnu
Surgissant du passé
Il m'était revenu

Dis l'oiseau, O dis, emmène-moi
Retournons au pays d'autrefois
Comme avant, dans mes rêves d'enfant
Pour cueillir en tremblant 
Des étoiles, des étoiles

Comme avant, dans mes rêves d'enfant
Comme avant, sur un nuage blanc
Comme avant, allumer le soleil
Être faiseur de pluie 
Et faire des merveilles

Nous irons voir ensemble les jardins refleuris 
Et déambulerons dans les rues de Paris!

Patrick Bruel,"Dans les paniers d'osier de la salle des ventes 
Une gloire déchue des folles années trente 
Avait mis aux enchères, parmi quelques brocantes 
Un vieux bijou donné par quel amour d'antan 

Elle était là, figée, superbe et déchirante 
Les mains qui se nouaient, se dénouaient tremblantes 
Des mains belles encore, déformées, les doigts nus 
Comme sont nus, parfois, les arbres en Novembre 

Comme chaque les matins, dans la salle des ventes 
Bourdonnait une foule, fiévreuse et impatiente 
Ceux qui, pour quelques sous, rachètent pour les vendre 
Les trésors fabuleux d'un passé qui n'est plus 

Dans ce vieux lit cassé, en bois de palissandre 
Que d'ombres enlacées, ont rêvé à s'attendre 
Les choses ont leurs secrets, les choses ont leurs légendes 
Mais les choses murmurent si nous savons entendre 

Le marteau se leva, dans la salle des ventes 
Une fois, puis deux fois, alors, dans le silence 
Elle cria: ""je prends, je rachète tout ça 
Ce que vous vendez là, c'est mon passé à moi""

C'était trop tard, déjà, dans la salle des ventes
Le marteau retomba sur sa voix suppliante 
Tout se passe si vite, à la salle des ventes
Qu'on ne l'entendit pas

Près des paniers d'osier, dans la salle des ventes 
Une femme pleurait ses folles années trente 
Et revoyait soudain défiler son passé 
Défiler son passé, défiler son passé 

Car venait de surgir, du fond de sa mémoire 
Du fond de sa mémoire, un visage oublié 
Une image chérie, du fond de sa mémoire 
Son seul amour de femme, son seul amour de femme 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Froissant quelques billets, dedans ses main tremblantes 
Froissant quelques billets, du bout de ses doigts nus 
Quelques billets froissés, pour un passé perdu 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Je la vis s'éloigner, courbée et déchirante 
De son amours d'antan, rien ne lui restait plus 
Pas même ce souvenir, aujourd'hui disparu",Drouot
Patrick Bruel,"Du plus loin, que me revienne
L´ombre de mes amours anciennes
Du plus loin, du premier rendez-vous
Du temps des premières peines
Lors, j´avais quinze ans, à peine
Cœur tout blanc, et griffes aux genoux
Que ce furent, j´étais précoce
De tendres amours de gosse
Ou les morsures d´un amour fou
Du plus loin qu´il m´en souvienne
Si depuis, j´ai dit ""je t´aime""
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

C´est vrai, je ne fus pas sage
Et j´ai tourné bien des pages
Sans les lire, blanches, et puis rien dessus
C´est vrai, je ne fus pas sage
Et mes guerrières de passage
A peine vues, déjà disparues
Mais à travers leur visage
C´était déjà votre image
C´était vous déjà et le cœur nu
Je refaisais mes bagages
Et poursuivais mon mirage
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

Sur la longue route
Qui menait vers vous
Sur la longue route j´allais le cœur fou
Le vent de décembre
Me gelait au cou
Qu´importait décembre
Si c´était pour vous?

Elle fut longue la route
Mais je l´ai faite, la route
Celle-là, qui menait jusqu'à vous
Et je ne suis pas parjure
Si ce soir, je vous jure
Que, pour vous, je l´eus faite à genoux
Il en eut fallu bien d´autres
Que quelques mauvais apôtres
Que l´hiver ou la neige à mon cou
Pour que je perde patience
Et j´ai calmé ma violence
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

Mais tant d'hivers et d'automnes 
De nuits, de jours, et personne
Vous n´étiez jamais au rendez-vous
Et de vous, perdant courage
Soudain, me prenait la rage
Mon Dieu, que j´avais besoin de vous
Que le Diable vous emporte
D´autres m´ont ouvert la porte
Heureux, je m´en allais loin de vous
Oui, je vous fus infidèle
Mais vous revenais quand même
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

J´ai pleuré mes larmes
Mais qu´il me fut doux
Oh, qu´il me fut doux ce premier sourire de vous
Et pour une larme
Qui venait de vous
J´ai pleuré d´amour
Vous souvenez-vous? 

Ce fut, un soir, en septembre
Vous étiez venue m´attendre
Ici-même, vous en souvenez-vous? 
À vous regarder sourire
À vous aimer, sans rien dire
C´est là que j´ai compris, tout à coup
J´avais fini mon voyage
Et j´ai posé mes bagages
Vous étiez venue au rendez-vous
Qu´importe ce qu´on peut en dire
Je tenais à vous le dire
Ce soir je vous remercie de vous
Qu´importe ce qu´on peut en dire
Je suis venu pour vous dire
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

Qu´importe ce qu´on peut en dire

Ce qu'était notre amour, Madame

Il en a décidé, lui seul avait le droit
Il faut vous résigner, Madame

C'est trop tard, maintenant, pour que je vous revienne 
Et vous vieillirez seule, Madame 
Et ne m'en veuillez pas si je parais cruel
Mais je l'ai trop aimé, Madame 
Pour qu'à la fin du jour, près d'une cheminée
Nous évoquions ensemble, Madame
Celui que, vous et moi, nous avons adoré 
Et perdu tout ensemble, Madame 

Mais le chagrin m'égare, il faut me pardonner
J'ai mal de votre mal, Madame 
Mais que faire, et quoi dire, puisqu'il s'en est allé? 
Je ne puis rien pour vous, Madame
Pour la seconde fois, il va nous séparer
Non, je ne viendrai pas, Madame

Patrick Bruel,"J'ai eu tort, je suis revenu
Dans cette ville loin perdue 
Ou j'avais passé mon enfance
J'ai eu tort, j'ai voulu revoir 
Le coteau ou glissait le soir 
Bleus et gris, ombres de silence
Et je retrouvais comme avant
Longtemps après
Le coteau, l'arbre se dressant
Comme au passé
J'ai marché, les tempes brûlantes
Croyant étouffer sous mes pas
Les voix du passé qui nous hantent 
Et reviennent sonner le glas
Et je me suis couché sous l'arbre 
Et c’étaient les mêmes odeurs
Et j'ai laissé couler mes pleurs
Mes pleurs
J'ai mis mon dos nu à l’écorce
L'arbre m'a redonné des forces 
Tout comme au temps de mon enfance
Et longtemps j'ai fermé les yeux
Je crois que j'ai prié un peu
Je retrouvais mon innocence
Avant que le soir ne se pose
J'ai voulu voir 
La maison fleurie sous les roses
J'ai voulu voir 
Le jardin où nos cris d'enfants
Jaillissaient comme source claire
Jean-claude, et Régine, et puis Jean
Tout redevenait comme hier
Le parfum lourd des sauges rouges
Les dahlias fauves dans l’allée
Le puit, tout, j'ai tout retrouvé

Hélas 
La guerre nous avait jeté là
D'autres furent moins heureux, je crois
Au temps joli de leur enfance
La guerre nous avait jetés là
Nous vivions comme hors-la-loi
Et j'aimais cela, quand j'y pense 
Ou mes printemps, ou mes soleils
Ou mes folles années perdues
Ou mes quinze ans, ou mes merveilles
Que j'ai mal d’être revenu
Ou les noix fraîches de septembre 
Et l'odeur des mûres écrasées
C'est fou, tout, j'ai tout retrouvé
Hélas 
Il ne faut jamais revenir 
Aux temps cachés des souvenirs 
Du temps béni de son enfance
Car parmi tous les souvenirs 
Ceux de l'enfance sont les pires
Ceux de l'enfance nous déchirent
Oh ma très chérie, oh ma mère
Où êtes-vous donc aujourd'hui? 
Vous dormez au chaud de la terre
Et moi je suis venu ici 
Pour y retrouver votre rire
Vos colères et votre jeunesse
Mais je suis seule avec ma détresse
Hélas 
Pourquoi suis-je donc revenue 
Et seule au détour de ces rues? 
J'ai froid, j'ai peur, le soir se penche
Pourquoi suis-je venu ici
Où mon passé me crucifie? 
Elle dort à jamais, mon enfance",Mon enfance

C'est parce que je t'aime 
Que je préfère m'en aller

C'est parce que j'ai peur de voir s'endeuiller 
Les minutes, les heures, les secondes passées
C'est parce que je sais qu'il faut un presque rien 
Pour défaire une nuit et se perdre au matin

Je ne laisserai pas pencher sur notre lit 
Ni l'ombre d'un regret, ni l'ombre de l'ennui
Je ne laisserai pas mourir au fil des jours

Comme deux loups blessés, que sont-ils maintenant? 

Ca, je ne veux pas

J'aimerais bien que tu comprennes 
Que j'ai choisi l'absence comme dernière chance 
Notre ciel devenait si lourd 
Si je t'écris ce soir de Vienne 
Oh, que c'est beau l'automne à Vienne 
C'est que sans réfléchir, j'ai préféré partir 
Et je suis à Vienne sans toi 
Je marche, je rêve dans Vienne 
Sur trois temps de valse lointaine 
Il semble que les ombres tournent et se confondent 
Qu'ils étaient beaux, les soirs de Vienne 
Ta lettre a dû croiser la mienne 
Non, je ne veux pas que tu viennes 
Je suis seul et puis j'aime

Comme il n'en existe qu'à Vienne 
Me loge et dans ma chambre 
Tombent de pourpre et d'ambre 
De lourdes tentures de soies 
C'est beau à travers les persiennes 
Je vois l'église Saint-Etienne 
Et quand le soir se pose, c'est bleu, c'est gris, c'est mauve 
Et la nuit par-dessus les toits

Cela va faire une semaine 
Déjà que je vis seul à Vienne 
C'est curieux le hasard, j'ai croisé l'autre soir 
Nos amis de Lountatchimo 
Cela va faire une semaine

Ils étaient de passage à Vienne
Ils n'ont rien demandé, mais se sont étonnés
De me voir à Vienne sans toi

Moi, moi 
Je me promène 
Je suis bien 
Je suis bien 

Et puis de semaine en semaine 
Voilà que je vis seule à Vienne 
Tes lettres se font rares, peut-être qu'autre part 
Tu as trouvé l'oubli de moi 
Je lis, j'écris mais quand même 
Qu'il est long l'automne à Vienne 
Dans ce lit à deux places où la nuit je me glace 
Tout à coup j'ai le mal de toi 
Que c'est long Vienne 
Que c'est loin Vienne 

Si je t'écris ce soir de Vienne 
Chérie, c'est qu'il faut que tu viennes 
J'étais parti, pardonne-moi 
Notre ciel devenait si lourd 
Et toi de Paris jusqu'à Vienne 
Au bout d'une invisible chaîne 
Tu me guettais je pense, jouant l'indifférence 
Et tu m'as gardé malgré moi 

Il est minuit ce soir à Vienne 
Mon amour, il faut que tu viennes 
Tu vois je m'abandonne, il est si beau l'automne 
Et j'aimerais le vivre avec toi

Patrick D. O'Briant,"Preach the Gospel to all the world, 
And if necessary, use words. St. Francis of Assisi

We're passengers aboard the train
Silent little lambs amidst the pain
That's no longer good enough
And when it's time to speak our faith
We use a language no one can explain
That's no longer good enough

And God knows it's a shame
As we look to pass the flame
We are not the worthy bearers of his name

[Chorus]
For the world to know the truth
There can be no greater proof
Than to live the life, live the life
There's no love that's quite as pure
There's no pain we can't endure
If we live the life, live the life
Be a light for all to see
For every act of love will set you free

There's something beautiful and bold
The power of a million human souls
Come together as one
And each in turn goes out to lead
Another by his word, his love, his deed
Now the circle is done

It all comes back to One
For it is He and He alone
Who has lived the only perfect life we've known

Patrick Davis,"Downtown dances past my window
As the full moon hits my eye
Past the factory and over the railroad tracks
I'm doing sixty in a forty five

All my coming and going
Hasn't gotten me anywhere
I thought I was moving
But I'm still here

(In this)
Nowhere town, this nowhere town
Where people dream of the stars
But they wake up on the ground

I ain't got no excuses
I ain't got no alibis
You know I sure wish I did
'Cause it'd be so much easier to lie

I was gonna be somebody
I had pockets full of plans
But somebody somewhere must of stole them
'Cause here I am

(In this)
Nowhere town, this nowhere town
Where people dream of the stars
But they wake up on the ground

They talk of leavin' while they hang around
This place is just a nowhere town

Someday things will change
Just as soon as that day comes
I'm gonna set sail out on the highway
And I'm gonna run from this

Nowhere town, this nowhere town
Where people dream of the stars
But they wake up on the ground

They talk of leavin' while they hang around
This place is just a nowhere town

Even through my shattered heart

Patrick Ki,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me

So on and on it will always be

On high with nothing to do

Patrick Ki,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin',
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y,
Give me the simple life.",Give Me the Simple Life
Patrick L. Simpson,"Would you listen, would you listen
There's a baby crying down in Bethlehem
Would you listen, would you listen
To the voice of hope that's ringing through the land
People listen, listen
But still don't understand

Would you listen, would you listen
There's a great man preaching sending out His word
Would you listen, would you listen
To the truth He speaks and still He is not heard
Would you listen, would you listen
To a great man preaching turn your head around
People listen, listen
But still don't understand

[Chorus:]
But don't you know His love will shine down on you
Oh and yes His peace will come in and rescue
Don't you know His blood will cleanse you and save you
If you will open up your ears and open up
Your heart and listen

Would you listen, would you listen
There's a hammer ringing, ringing through the land
Would you listen, would you listen
To a cruel, cruel message
Crucify the man
People listen, listen
'Cause His blood is falling in the sand

When the baby cried we closed our ears to wisdom
When the word was preached we closed our minds to love
And when the hammer rang we closed our hearts to Jesus
Now will you listen, listen, listen

Open up your ears, open your heart
Open up your mind and open up your soul
Open up your heart, yeah, open up your heart and listen",Listen
Patrick Lamb,"Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (""You nasty boy."")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt out to sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go",I Wish

Let me guide you through the clouds tonight,  
Until the end is through,  
I'll be there until the stars can light,  
Watching over you.  
Hey, I'm telling you it's possible,  
No matter what they say, 
We're on our way.

To ride the storm, to carry on,  
Together nothing can go wrong,
A brandnew day, and you know, hey, 
We're on our way

Sorry for the words last night

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park
I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day
They all gather 'round me, huh
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back

Tell me have you seen her
Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio

Patrick Sky,"On one cloudless morning I stood on the mountain,
Just watching the smoke from below,
It was coming from a tall, slim smokestack
Way down on the Southern railroad.

It was 97, the fastest train
Ever ran the Southern line,
All the freight trains and passengers take the side for 97,
For she's bound to be at stations on time.

They gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia,
Saying, ""Stevie, you're way behind time.
This is not 38, but it's Old 97,
You must put her into Spencer on time.""

He looked 'round and said to his black greasy fireman,
""Just shovel in a little more coal,
And when I cross that old White Oak Mountain
You can just watch Old 97 roll.""

It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville,
And the lie was a three-mile grade,
It was on that grade that he lost his air brakes,
And you see what a jump that she made.
He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour,
When his whistle began to scream,
He was found in that wreck with his hand on the throttle,
He was scalded to death by the steam.

Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And at 1:45 he was due,
For hours and hours has the switchman been waiting
For that fast mail that never pulled through.
Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And that poor boy must be dead.
Oh, yonder he lays on the railroad track
With the cart wheels over his head.

97, she was the fastest train
That the South had ever seen,
But she run so fast on that Sunday morning
That the death score was numbered 14.

Now, ladies, you must take warning,
From this time now and on.
Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband.
He may leave you and never return.

There he got his parole.
After four long years on a man killing charge, 
Tom Joad come a-walkin' down the road.

Tom Joad, he met a truck driving man; 
There he caught him a ride.
He said, I just got loose from McAlester Pen
On a charge called homicide, 

That truck rolled away in a cloud of dust; 
Tommy turned his face toward home.
He met Preacher Casey, and they had a little drink, 
But they found that his family they were gone, 
He found that his family they was gone.

He found his mother's old fashion shoe, 
Found his daddy's hat.
And he found little Muley and Muley said, 
They've been tractored out by the cats, 

Tom Joad walked down to the neighbor's farm, 
He found his family.
They took Preacher Casey and loaded in a car, 
And his mother said, We've got to get away.

Oh the twelve other Joads made a very heavy load
But Grandfather Joad did cry
And He picked up a hand full of in his hand
Said I'm staying with the farm till I die

They stood on a mountain and they looked to the west, 
And it looked like the promised land.
That bright green valley with a river running through, 
There was work for every single hand, they thought, 
There was work for every single hand.

The Joads rolled away to the jungle camp, 
There they cooked a stew.
And the hungry little kids of the jungle camp
Said: ""We'd like to have some, too.""
Said: ""We'd like to have some, too.""

Now a deputy sheriff fired loose at a man, 
Shot a woman in the back.
Before he could take his aim again, 

Preacher Casey dropped him in his track, poor boy, 
Preacher Casey dropped him in his track.

They handcuffed Casey and they took him in jail; 
And then he got away.
And he met Tom Joad on the old river bridge, 
And these few words he did say, poor boy, 
These few words he did say.

""I preached for the Lord a mighty long time, 
Preached about the rich and the poor.
Us workin' folkses, all get together, 
'Cause we ain't got a chance anymore.
We ain't got a chance anymore.""

Now, the deputies come, and Tom and Casey run
To the bridge where the water run down.
But the vigilante thugs hit Casey with a club, 
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground, poor Casey, 
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground.

Tom Joad, he grabbed that deputy's club, 
Hit him over the head.
Tom Joad took flight in the dark rainy night, 
And a deputy and a preacher lying dead, two men, 
A deputy and a preacher lying dead.

Tom run back where his mother was asleep; 
He woke her up out of bed.
An' he kissed goodbye to the mother that he loved, 
Said what Preacher Casey said, Tom Joad, 
He said what Preacher Casey said.

""Everybody might be just one big soul, 
Well it looks that a-way to me.
Everywhere that you look, in the day or night, 
That's where I'm a-gonna be, Ma, 
That's where I'm a-gonna be.

Wherever little children are hungry and cry, 
Wherever people ain't free.
Wherever men are fightin' for their rights,

Patrick Street,"His dad was a miner and his granddad was too
There was never much question about what he might do
By the age of thirteen he had laid down his pen
And become a coal-miner and a prince among men.

My goal as a young lad from a bright early age
Was to follow my hero down in that cage
Fairy lights and Pit Ponies were the stuff of my dreams
Never  thinking how hard my dad worked at the seam

chorus:
Only a miner killed under the ground
Only a miner and one more is found
Killed by accident no one can tell
Your mining's all over, poor miner, farewell.

Dad worked like a Trojan his money to save
I'm afraid that he worked himself into his grave
And my schooling was paid at the cost of his lungs
Dad was an old man at the age of forty-one.

I never will forget how his face lit with pride
When I got my diploma, he was there by my side
And I try to remember him as he was then
A rare moment of joy for a prince among men.

A gold watch and chain inscribed James Doyle
Never seemed much reward for a life of such toil
But I keep his lamp burning and his old union card
And his bones rest here in this sunlit graveyard.

My dad was a miner and a prince among men
Well loved by his wife and his family and friends
And his hardship and toil gave me the one chance I had
And generations of slavery died with my dad.

You get up, you get up

Some things let go
At least for now all these tears past the problems
Stop listen to new words from around as you're 'round

I hope it wasn't hope that was hoping
Hoping for the very last time
Hard to be optimistic and realistic at the very same time
Why can't we meet in the middle sometimes?

I know that I heard you screaming
You were screaming in the night
And I know the water is rising past your knees

'Cause all the flashy people putting the candy in their eyes
And all I wanna do
Is lay there next to you
