Al Green,"All around the world there are people crying
Can't find something to believe
They put so much faith in people who are lying
They're so easy to deceive

Tell them love is the message and the message is love

Deep in every heart there, is on answer
What will it take to make it real?
Even a soul behind a wall of confusion
Still can tell you what you feel

Why must it be the sight of something burning in the night
To make us hunger for the day
It ain't no mystery, just love enough to let it be
Everybody knows the way

The message is love
Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above
Tell everybody
Tell everybody what you're dreaming of

And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

Tearing my fear apart,
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

A whimpering, simpering child again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Al Grey,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song
Al Grey,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, When I hear 'em play.

Just wanna get right up and dance, Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, But Royal Garden Blues.

Like sable coats and wedding rings?
By men who wear their spats right?

Moving to and fro among your friends

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon

The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Al Jarreau,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now",Fire and Rain
Al Jarreau,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those, who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you, that keep it turned on

So excuse my forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen",Your Song
Al Jarreau,"Better than sailing at midnight
Better than diving for pearls
Better than skiing in Aspen
Better than feeding the squirrels
Better than finding a horseshoe
Better than losing your head
Better than anything thought of
Better than anything said
Better than singing right out loud
Or being spotted in a crowd
Better than anything except being in love

Do you know, being in love

Better than four sets of Dizzy
Better than Count Basie's band
Better than Rollins and Coltrane
Better than being on the stand
Better than Ella Fitzgerald
Better than Miles' latest news

Better than Bill Evans' ballads
Better than Joe Williams' blues
Better than hearing Lady Day
Or checking in at Monterey
Better than anything except being in love

Do you know, being in love
It's a circus

Elephants dancing
Clowns on parade
Better than peanuts and popcorn
Fresh lemonade
Better than rides on the midway
Better than seals blowing horns
Better than men shot from cannons
Better than fresh ears of corn
Better than balancing a wire
Or watching tigers leap through fire
Better than anything except being in love",Better Than Anything
Al Jarreau,"Could you believe in a dream when I tell you that it's true?
Could you believe precious friend of mine?
And would you believe when it seems you are glad with what you do
Give you courage to carry, give you courage to carry
Courage to carry your spirit up on high
Just to carry your spirit up on high

I saw people in trouble, yes heard the angels cry
Now don't tamper with my children, no, no, made the devil fly
Spent the night with David, he taught me what to say
I was looking for a smooth stone when I heard him pray

Could you believe in a dream when I tell you that it's true?
And could you believe precious friend of mine?
And would you believe when it seems you are glad with what you do
It'll give you the courage to carry, the courage to carry
Courage to carry your freedom up on high
Go 'head and carry your spirit up on high

Oh, I could sing at times and reasons
Reason to lay your burden softly down
Kings and Prophets did for freedom
Precious dreams imprisoned underground
Well, I've got this song that I'll sing
And I'll make the mountains ring
Tell my mama that I am homeward bound

Could you believe in a dream when I tell you that it's true?
And could you believe precious, precious friend of mine?
Would you believe when it seems you are glad with what you do
It will give you courage to carry, give you courage to carry up
Just to carry your spirit up on high, Lord
Just to carry your spirit up on high, up on high

Oh yeah, can carry up on, carry
Oh I make this promise, my Lord, I'm gonna carry
Ooh, and I promise to look for that little light
Little bit of light, gonna look for that light
Gonna look for that light bit of light when my heart is in trouble

Oh and I make this promise to look for that light
Little bit of light when my man is worried
You see the same night that brought the children through, yes it is
And it's the same night that brings the spirit through

He'll believe, gonna believe, I'm gonna believe
Don't you believe, I'm gonna believe, I'm gonna believe
Yes, I do believe, oh yes, I do believe
I'm going to believe, I'm gonna believe y'all
And I gotta believe, I gotta believe, I gotta believe

My better taught me to believe
My mama taught me to believe
And I believe, and I believe, I believe, I believe
Just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe
Just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe
Just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, oh my friend

Try it out one more time, try it out my son
And you'll learn how to believe",Could You Believe
Al Jarreau,"Letter perfect stars of 
Gold in school
You got a right to shout,
You been living the Golden Rule

In your time broken-hearted 
Beggars danced for you, girl
""Doing alright,""I hear you shout, 
""I'm living the Golden Rule""
(But then I hear you say)

Hurry down, sunset, 
Hurry, get dark like wine

Kindness shine through you
You'll be alright then you'll shout,

Al Jarreau,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
'Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow
Al Jarreau,"Won't you stop and take a little
Time out with me, just take five
Stop your busy day and take the
Time out to see if I'm alive

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play

Still, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my way

Wouldn't it be better not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now, it's alright
Just take five, just take five

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play",Take Five
Al Jarreau,"I hardly had a bellyful
Never knew a new bicycle
Hand-me-down books and shoes
They brought the yule tides in July

I rode a bus, a train and sometimes
Strolling for miles to a movie show
Singing a song ""Shoobedoo
""While birds and rich folks flew
Right on by

But we got by
Lord knows we got by

Winter wishes wait till June
We brightened July with
That hot dog fun
Tell your mama you're with Sue
You bring the beans and I'll
Find the wine
Them neon lights were bright
Till 2:00
And sneaking back home with
This girl named Jo
I hurried down to say do""
And stared my first man-child
In the eye

But we got by
Lord knows we got by

And now baby's got his bellyful
And finally here's that new bicycle
Working, praying, June to June
And mama's got LA gleaming
In her eye

And we got by
Lord knows we got by

You see we kept on walking
And talking, hawking
Ooing, cooing, wooing
Loving, tugging, hugging, rubbing
Sugging, fugging, laying, praying, swaying
Letting, fretting, begetting, lying
Flying, trying, sighing, dying.",We Got By
Al Jarreau,"You don't see me when I'm 
Trying to do right
Maybe you can see me now

When I was walking, 
Patting my feet on the pavement
Really, truly trying to find a gig
Did you stand up and speak
Out in my favor?
Cold desperation, 
She's a devil in bed
Scratching till my bones are bare
Pill and needles are all I've left to savor

We were walking and 
I told you of how my shoes 
Of how my shoes were wearing thin
You took your surplus and 
Traded for a favor
Now I'm demented and I'm 
Burned unto a cinder
Forty hours buys a grocery 
Bag for trash
I took my pistol and I made
Myself a sinner
Will this universe be merciful at last?

You don't see me. 
You don't see me
I get so tired of trying to
Attract your attention
It has occurred to me that 
You don't see me

You should go ahead. 
I'm a-gonna-go-ahead
I know you're going to ahead
You're going to do what 
You're going to do
I know, see, I see you, I watch you
You take the money and run

You take groceries and run, too
Don't leave nothing left for me
You're running and hiding 
And ducking and hiding
And running and hiding and
I can't find you nowhere
I'll beat your mama, 
I'll beat your daddy
I'll go to jail, 
It don't make no mothafugging
Difference what happens to me
Going to be there in my 
Own time, in my own way
Cause you don't see me,
You don't see me
I'm, I'm in your mirror",You Don't See Me

I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come 
Watchin' the ships roll in

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay 
Watchin' the time roll away 
Oh 

I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay 
Wastin' time

Headed for the Frisco Bay 
Cause I had nothin' to live for 
And look Like nothin's gonna come my way 
So I'm just goin to sit on the dock of the bay 
Watchin' the time roll away 

Ooh 
I'm sittin' on the dock the dock of the bay wastin' time 
Look pop nothin's goin' to change 
Everything still remains the same 
I can't do what ten people tell me to do 
So I guess I'll remain the same 
Yes 

Sittin' here restin' my bones 
And this loneliness won't leave me alone 
Yes 

2000 miles I roam 
Just to make this dock my home

No one's ever touched me in this way

All of my dreams will be comin' true
In the heat of a tangled kiss

Say you will and I promise you this
All of my love, I will give to you
All that I ask is you love me too
Take a look, I'm never far behind

Turn around and gimme, gimme, gimme a sign

When you came along you made it safe for love to survive
I trusted and dreamed and you came like I knew you would
I've been 'round before but this feels so good

I could not walk by 
I knew that I'd found
What's at the end of the rainbow
There's no place on earth I'd rather be than stayin' right here with you
It's not about luck 
I don't need to knock on wood no, no
Been 'round before but this feels so good

Night after night it's so hard to believe
That I wake up each day next to you
Time after time in the cold mornin' light, it's good to know
It's good to know that it's true

There's no greater sin than missin' your chance
When it's starin' right at 'ya
That look in your eye says everything and tells me I'm home

As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that
She hoped would say more
She goes down
The stairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.

She
(We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving
(Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home

Money could buy; bye bye)

For so many years
She's leaving home; bye bye.

Father snores as his wife
Gets info her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing
Alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
""Daddy, our baby is gone""
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How
Could she do this to me?.
She (we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving

Nine clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.

To conquer all the waves and reasons
Why we never touched the shore

Don't you stray
Let me tell you something
Don't go away

What's on that silver screen
Raquel and Redford are the tops
You've been misled
By all those movies you've seen
Love ain't a robber
Hidin' from the cops

When you toss 'n' turn all morning
And you wake up yawning
And you walk that floor all evening
And you should be leaving
And you find yourself pretending
You've got a happy ending-

Searching near and far

I'm gonna be content in time

And so today, I think I'll take the
Chance of a lifetime
And by the way,
I'm falling for romance girl,
And I don't mind
How much I cry

I'm reaching for the sun

Love has just begun
(who would think)
Two could turn to one
Spirit flying high
Flying high

Never gonna give it up

Al Jarreau,"Yesterday, just a 
Photograph of yesterday
And all its edges folded 
And the corners
Faded sepia brown
And yet it's all I have 
Of our past love
A postscript to its ending

Brighter days
I can see such brighter days
When every song we sang
Is sung again
And now we know
We know this time it's for good
And we're lovers once again
And you're near me

I can remember the 
Rain in December
The leaves are brown 
On the ground

In Spain I did love and adore you
The nights filled with 
Joy were our yesterdays
And tomorrow will bring you near me

[Chorus]
I can recall my desire
Every reverie is on fire
And I get a picture of 
All our yesterdays
Yes, today
I can say, ""I get a kick every time
They play that, 'Spain,"" again""

I can remember the rain in December
The leaves are brown
On the ground

Our love was a Spanish fiesta
The bright lights and songs 
Were our joy each day
And the nights were the 
Heat of yearning

I can recall my desire
Every reverie is on fire
And I get a picture of 
All our yesterdays
Yes, today
I can say, ""I get a kick everytime
I see you gaze at me.""

I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine and
They dance to the melody
And we live again
As if dreaming

The sound of our 
Hearts beat like castanets
And forever we'll know their meaning

[Chorus]

You gaze at me
I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine
And they dance to the melody
And we live again
As if dreaming

[Chorus]",Spain (I Can Recall)
Al Jarreau,"And when I thought
My flame was out
You entered in

I look around
I feel the same as before
I'm on the ground
I'm dreaming away, but you know
I would trade all of
My daydreams for
Some wings
A sparrow sings

The thrill was gone
But like the summer
The spring
Will bring the dawn
And I'll be singing your song
For a wondrous new change is
Taking me up to heaven

[Chorus]
Your sweet love 
Brighter than light 
Streaking like a star ship 
Your sweet love 
Brightens the night 
Gleaming down on our ship
Your sweet love 
Making me realize
That heaven is right
Here in your eyes

I look around
It's not the same as before
I'm on the ground
But now I'm singing your song
For this wondrous new change
Is taking me up to heaven

[Chorus]

And when I thought
My flame was out
You entered in

I thank the stars
But you know as often
I thank the things you are
And all I offer
Just longs for that wondrous
New change
That's taking me up to heaven

Was gleaming nightly

Al Jarreau,"Look what you've done for me
You're makin' more fun for me.
Troubadour me,destined to be
Set in my ways-stuck in my daze.

You were the butterfly, 
Winkin' at me
Makin' my fires fly.
Brought me romance,
Taught me to dance
Makin' me win,makin' me grin.
Schoolin' me.

Breakin' away,your love has
Opened eyes that couldn't see.
Breakin' away,your beacon in

Climbing boots.
Open the door,give me some more.

Al Jarreau,"There are those who fly
From the highest heights
On the wings they carry-
Searching for the high
They can never find-
Thinking love is blind.
Never mind.
They'll never see
The forest for the trees
'Til they turn to love.

Crying through the eyes
Of my own disguise-
Came to know the truth
From the lies.
So,I hope you'll understand how
I'm another kind of man now.
All I want is just to stand
Closer to your love.

Don't wanna climb a mountain.
Don't wanna swim a river.
I wanna feel the fire,power,
And all I can dream of.
Don't wanna climb a mountain.
Don't wanna swim a river.
I wanna move in
Closer to your love.

If you try to fly
From the highest heights
On the wings you carry-
Searching for the high
Of your own design,
You may come to find
You been blind.

So I hope you'll understand how
I'm another kind of man now.
All I want is just to stand
A little closer to your love.",Closer to Your Love
Al Jarreau,"Yesterday,you left Brazil and went
Away to see the world.
Looking for a distant beach,
A different shore-a faster whirl.
Thinking that your hearts desire
Hungered for some Paris or Berlin.
Caught between the snow and the fire
Will sweet Carioca love again?

Your superman gonna do the
Super-best he can
To free the pearl.
Giving you the superness 
That he can do.
Believe me, girl

That everyday your need is higher.
But love is not Chicago or L.A.
Home is where your heart's on fire
And where that restless snowbird melts away.

It's easy,easy
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.
It's easy,
Let your love ring out
Let my loving in today.

It's easy
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.
Ain't it easy?
Let your love ring out.
Let my loving in to stay.

Settle down,there ain't 
No need to run around.
It's really clear
That I'm the man
Who's gonna do the super-best he can
To keep you near.

Everyday your need soars higher.
Love is not Chicago or L.A.
Home is where your heart's on fire.
Can't deny this love is here to stay.

No decisions, child's play
Did they slip away?
Gone forever, gone forever
Lost to yesterday

From the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time

As I walk down, streets full of amber leaves
I see nothing's really changed at all
We're just older now
Still together, still together
After all these years

And from the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time

""Love's in need of love today""
Will there be none tomorrow

Where's the tender hearts
That love romance, they
Seem so few

So, I write these words to say
Take heart have faith
In love's tomorrow
Where our precious dreams
Will all come true

Heaven knows what I've
Been through
Searching for a heart that's true
Is there one in a million?

Though I've often failed the test
Everyone must journey till
That questioning is through

Shine a star for me to see what
Children see on Christmas morning
Every hope and dream
To be renewed

Heaven only knows how I hope
That chance of love is higher
Than one in a million

I'm a dreamer I confess
But my dreams are only of
The best that we can do

So, I'll keep on counting sheep
And will not sleep until the dawning

Help me break the news, eternal

Does anyone want to go
Waltzing in the garden?
Does anyone want to go 
Dance up on the roof?

On the town,
Sequins evening gown.
Climb those stairs
To that ballroom in the air
Get to poppin.'

If you dare,
Dream of yesteryear.
In the air
Do a step with Fred Astaire.
Get your top hat.

You can be
What you want to be
Come waltz with me
Or a hot steppin' boogie.
Funk in the pocket.

In downtown these days.
Country calls
Got us one and all.

Before we end
Let me recommend

When your heart is light or blue.
Get to steppin.'

Well don't think,

Right down to,

Coming through to me
In my mind's eye I can see
Telepathy
Feel it, I know you're there

That I saw you
I knew I'd lose control

Give me the fire

And don't play too long in the blues that come After
Take her along
Conquer your mountains again

A lullaby my little guy the moon is rising
You'll awake to see a sight that's worth the Prizing
That new morning star high on your heart's Horizon

If you're the one that always says bygones be Bygones
And when you look you've lost the ones
That you rely on
Look deep in your heart there's something to
Keep your eyes on

Cold distant stars slowly fade while you're Sleeping
And hollow guitars will be quietly weeping
So paint the skies with your bright shining
Castles in Spain

Among the things you do each day here's one
For trying
Give it all and give again and find reply in
That new morning star
High on your heart's horizon

Look it over,so much to see
Did I say you should look at me
Not just now
When I'm lookin' around
When my guard is down
Pieces on the ground

In a twinklin' and blinkin' eye
You'll be singing a lullaby
Say just how you can turn it around
When a faith is found
Even on the ground

Scattered like the stars in the sky
Are the feelings that I have for you that never got to shine
And it cuts me to the core
But I keep coming back for more
As long as love remains, then it's pleasure over pain

Saying every line I should have said,
Knowing every little move that I should have made instead
Tortured by a mind that won't forget
And my heart is like a butterfly trapped inside your net
And it's breaking me into
But for you it is the least I'd do
As long as love remains, then it's pleasure over pain

Hear the seconds ticking by
Praying that you'll change your mind
Breaking every rule I know
Ready to give up my pride
Waiting for a second chance
Have I waited way too long
If I had you here again 
You would never leave I know
Here I am again tonight

That I really don't know who you are
And did you tell me that you've got to cool your feelings?
So did you say I've fallen overboard
Every danger sign I just ignored
That you never meant to put me out to sea

Ask me where I've been
Heaven knows I've sinned
Waiting in the wings and wasting time
I've been watching you
 
From the secret corners of your mind

[Chorus]
Girl, I know the way to your heart
It's in the stars - you're destined to be my baby
Girl, I'll be so good to your heart
You'll wonder why you question to be my baby

I want to labor looking after you
I want to bless you when you say 'k-choo'

I want to touch your face and watch you while you're sleeping
And could you make a little one or two
And could you please make sure they look like you
And they could share in all the secrets we've been keeping

Have I gone too far?
Reaching for a star?
Heaven here on earth is what I crave
I don't know what to say
I get so carried away
To this dream I'll always be a slave

[Chorus x2]

[Chorus]

So put your fears aside
? open wide
I'm the one who knew your where and when
I'll be so good to you
I hope you'll ask me to
To take you there and take you back again

War and deceit professionals
And it breaks my heart, or am I just.

Hale to caesar and praise to god on high
I'm working hard but I got two weeks vacational
Made me mad when melodic music died.

Rivers that cease to roar
Gone with thy brothers keeping
And it melts my core, or am I just

Set and sure of the way

There is the sun and moon

We'll fly by day

Al Jarreau,"When you give love and never get love,
You'd better let love depart,
I know it's so and still I know,
I can't get you outta my heart.

You made me leave my happy home,
You took my love and now you're gone,
Since I fell for you.

My life has been such misery and pain,
I guess I'll never be the same,
Since I fell for you.

[Chorus]

Well, it's too bad and it's too sad,
That I'm in love with you.
Well, you love me and then you snub me,
But what can I do... I'm still in love with you.

I guess I'll never see the light,
I get these blues most every night,
Since I fell for you.

Well, it's too bad and it's too sad,

I guess I'll never see the light,
I get these blues most every night,
Since I fell for you.

Since you love me... then you snub me,
I prayed you'd put the world above me,
And now I ... black and blue... scoo, doo, doo, doo...

Al Jarreau,"(Take me on home and let me say this!)

There's no greater crime than wastin' your life on a boat goin' nowhere,
When you came along you made it safe for love to survive,
I trusted and dreamed and you came like I knew you would.
I've been 'round before but this feels so good.

I could not walk by I knew that I'd found 
What's at the end of the rainbow,
There's no place on earth I'd rather be than stayin' right here with you,
It's not about luck I don't need to knock on wood no, no 
Been 'round before but this feels so good.

Night after night it's so hard to believe 
That I wake up each day next to you,
Time after time in the cold mornin' light, it's good to know 
It's good to know that it's true.

There's no greater sin than missin' your chance 
When it's starin' right at ya,
That look in your eye says everything and tells me I'm home,
For once in my life I don't feel misunderstood,
Well I've been 'round before but this time it feels so sure.

Been 'round before but this feels so good,
Been 'round before but this feels so good.",So Good

Ain't no game

Coldwaters rush in March
No place for April flowers
Take her name
Say she came
With the flame

That even bitter lips like mine
Will call the moon a friend and kiss again
Some I'm told let their hearts read the signs
While other men are hungerin'
And can't let it in

Be still my foolish heart
Please don't upset the cart
Stay the same
Ain't no game

Walkin' rhythm', talkin' rhyme
The earth will turn and send the sun again

Puddit it in your shoe
Puddit it in your locket
In your kidney stew

Corner of your office
Floor boards of your car
BB King sure keeps 'em
In that blues guitar

No matter where you go
Whatever game you play
Never leave home without some
Put some in everyday

To keep it in your laughter
Twinkle in your eye
Up in all your rafters
Underneath your tie

Puddit in your chapel
Underneath the pew
All your kids in chapter
Skipin' back to school

No matter where you go
Whatever game you play
Don't you leave home without some
Puddit in everyday

When the people start to roar
We, come back for more

Puddit it in your pocket
Puddit it in your shoe
Puddit it in your locket
In your kidney stew

One more last suggestion
Teach 'em every move
When they pop the question
Tell 'em it's the groove

",Puddit [Put It Where You Want It]
Al Jarreau,"I clearly recall the moments
Your face, the rain in Paris, a distant bell
Now, inside my head, I still recall the moment
There was something that you said

And now, only now, if somehow I were younger
Nimble little fingers remember each melody
Melodies and days that I adored
Flower vases, cathedral doors

So long to sailin', safe by my door
Sunny place inside, comforting is all paid for
Too late for some change of mind, ohh, how would I ever find me?
Through rain and crying you were saying

Every heart is safe inside a place
That makes and shapes the changing
Make the change, sail away beyond the wishing star
Dreamers gettin' armor

Froze in the altitudes, toasting the latitudes
Old empty platitudes, tossing, turning, freezing and burning
Comin' around, comin' around, settlin' down
Comin' around, settlin' down

Ice cream and thunder, night beasts and butterflies
Most mornin's I'd settle for a little rain
I'll let it in and let it out, I'll blow it over, coda
Start all over again, makin' the bitter end a friend

Play that restless melody for me again
The one I've been, been so afraid of my sweet friend
Maybe the little refrain will whisper inside the rain again
Play the one with all the changes

Some lullabies for sleeping, a lullaby for weeping
And one to teach my heart to fight and win
Singing a sailin' song
Sun song, sun song

Now inside my head I still recall the moment
There was something that you said
I live inside the moment
Hearing something that you said

How still inside the moment
There was something that you said
Remarkable and wonderful
This something that you said

",Something That You Said

I won't melt away like a fair-weather friend
On me you can depend

And the moon brings light of day

Though fainter hearts may come and go
Here's one thing you'll always know

Through it all, you can depend on me when tears begin to fall
And I will chase the clouds away
Through it all, I will ease your pain when sorrows comes to call
Oh, through it all

When you say you've never been loved quiet this way
I have to smile and take credit for being
The first to truly say

Oh, through it all a spirit that's brighter by far
Then all of the stars that shine through the night
You glow with heaven's light

Oh, it's me for you and you for me that's how it got to be
Though love affairs may come and go
Here's one thing you always know

Through it all, you can depend on me when tears begin to fall
And I will chase the clouds away
Through it all, and I will ease your pain when sorrows comes to call
Through it all, through it all

No empty promises you can be sure
We've both been down this road
And this time it's so much more, so much more

Through it all, through it all
Through it all, I will ease your pain
When sorrows comes to call I will stop the rain

The pain and rain can't hide you

Your tender kiss, I can't resist
Never thought nothin' could feel like this

Maybe you could tell me somethin' that I wanna know
Like how d'you get so far from home
A little bit of paradise
That's what I'm seein' shinin' in your eyes

[Chorus]

I can't control the love I feel
(Bg: I can't control the way I feel
Your love's the highest high)
It's the highest high
(Bg: if I could ever change a thing
Don't think I'd even try)
Oh, don't think I would try
(Bg: cause this is pure, it's love divine
And I know that this is real)
'Cause I can see the change in me
By the way that you make me feel

Feels like heaven to me.
Feels like heaven to me.

[Chorus]

Take my breath away
There's just one word to say, 
What it's like bein' with you
I guess the word heaven, would have to do

Heaven's where I wanna be
In heaven, there is love and peace
And you are all that I need, it's so plain to see
Just touchin' me, feels like heaven to me

Feels like heaven to me.
Feels like heaven to me",Feels Like Heaven
Al Jarreau,"They're sayin' stick the script. 
But there's more to the book, somehow.
Yellin' on the corner just a waste of time,
They can never know the truth in that frame of mind.
Come spark the track with your gift. 
God bless your grits bring it on now. 
Cause you know there's much more to the script. 
Try to lift your spirits to the very tip. 
And…

CHORUS:

Life is, 
Worth much more to me 
Than you could maybe never ever see. 
See Life is, 
Worth much more to me 
Than you could ever…

The other day I was afraid of being hypnotized, 
By so many people whose dreams won't begin to be realized.
But I came to know, 
The lessons they were told wasn't really so. 
But they kept tellin' me, 
Do all the things we do and you'll be good to go. 
See..

CHORUS X 1

You ain't really drivin' as long as you ridin' 
with those who would steal your soul. 
You've been crippled to pieces so dig what they preach 
And don't come with that hit no more. 
I'm down for the cause I mean takin' a pause,
Really live for the time we're given. 
Baby, can't you hear the drum?
Now listen hear it comes, 
It speaks of a life that's worth living.

Al Jarreau,"Dark cloud rollin' outside my window.
Thunder rumblin' in a minor key.
It made me remember my Mama, my Mama's smile
She said mind what you thinkin' and
There are places you should
And places you should not be

Workin' on fifth round down at Shelley's
Now if you shoot six the seventh one's free.
I can't be the last one to leave here again tonight.
I was lookin' at number seven when you
Walked in and brought a light

[Chorus]
I was in the wrong place at the right time
The devil had an arm around me, 
But your sweet heart found me & I must 'a been prayin' right
I was in the wrong place at the right time, child.
You took a three time loser and you turned him around
Lost and found.

I don't mean to overglorify you
Or make you somethin' that you cannot be
But if you could do me just one favor would you child
Tell me what were you doin' in heaven before you dropped in
And rescued me.

[Chorus]

A heart recovered.
What a sight to see.
Would you believe what your love has done for me?
You were good to me.
Tell me what were you doin' in heaven before you dropped in and rescued me?

Make me cry?

Think of it as being a great big rock

How your song's 
Been playing

You floated right between us
With gossamer and feathers
You fanned the flames
In (like) portraits caught
In autumn rain

Are you just out for air
Or maybe somewhere hiding
Playing 'round the corner

Somewhere I read a line
Just praising
A book and a song
And how the world was brighter

What magic song
Of bliss
What vision
Of the night-tide
What mystic light

The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer

And say a little prayer
You'll be
Waiting there for me

And pretend
That he is Parson Brown

We'll say No man

When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

Come knock him down

Keeps the galaxies and each sparrow alive

Where yellow daisies make a pathway to the fields of golden grain.
There a little girl is waiting where I found her years ago; Something
Tells me that I'm welcome where the Black-eyed Susans grow.

Her daddy's just a plain old farmer, mother's just a farmer too;
They surely raised some pretty Daisy when they raised my little Sue.
You may have your pretty Roses, Violets and Pansies too; you can
Keep your snow white Lilies, I will leave them all for you.

I'm going back to a shack where the Black-eyed Susans grow I love
'em so, they're all around on the ground where I found the one I
Know so long ago. The honey bees all know I'm comin', I seem to hear
Them softly hummin', ""You'll be losin' your little Susan, you'd
Better be getting busy buzzin' around."" To stroll again down the lane
To the plain old rustic seat will be a treat, and then I'll bring out the
Ring for the finger of my sweet, She's mighty sweet. And when I'm
Tied to the pride of the country side maybe I'll introduce you to my
Corn fed bride, when I come back from the shack where the Black-eyed

I know that I can be a beggar or I can be king
I can be almost any old thing

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good or I can be bad

Al Jolson,"Are you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry
We drifted apart

Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you
And called you sweetheart

Do the chairs in your parlor
Seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep
And picture me there

Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight

""I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said the the worlds a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act One was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came Act Two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down""

Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again

I'm all alone, so depressed

There is no doubt
And sang a different song
While I was out
Evidently you liked the new song the best
Like a birdie you flew away from the nest.

If it was a blackbird or a jay
If a cuckoo bird took you from me
Huh! You gone cuckoo, I can see
Couldn't be an eagle, `cause that bird
Wouldn't fly so low
I wouldn't be surprised

Of books to read where it's peaceful

And getting shorter with each day that goes by 
And how the time does fly

In everything that's light and gay

Lived the wife of happy Rip Van Winkle
Oh, oh, she sent him away
As the little stars began to twinkle
All that he had he had under his hat

So over the hills he went
Left her without a cent

Who paid the rent for Mrs. Rip Van Winkle
When Rip Van Winkle went away?
And though he slept for twenty years
Who was it kissed away her tears?

She had no friends in the place
No one to embrace
But the landlord always left her with a smile on his face

Was changing by leaps and bounds
It started up in the bigger cities
Than it spread to the smaller towns

The people began to smile at people
That they’d never even seen
And when Jeremiah woke me up
I was ready to live that dream

Well, it’s a brand new day
Brand new way, brand new day
Give it to me, alright

You know the mother called the father on the telephone
She cried, ""My God I’m so upset""
She said the boy left home naked this morning
All he took was the TV set

Than the sister picked up the extension
And she said, “He’s just doing his thing”
Than the father hung up on the mother
And the children began to sing

Well, it’s a brand new day, yes
A brand new way, brand new day

We gotta put our heads together
And see where we go from there
We gotta fight for what we believe in
'Cause there’s something in the air

And it’s a brand new day, that's right
Brand new way, brand new day
I can feel it growing stronger every minute now

Twenty million shadows storming at the gates
Now how can you be surprised?
With the image of the fallen four reflected in their eyes

And though twenty million tongues are shouting now
It's only heard by a precious few
But the years of night will pass forever
When the sun comes shining through

On a brand new day
Brand new way, yes, a brand new day

Hey people, you know that it's a brand new day
Brand new way, brand new way you're walking
Brand new day, yes, a brand new way
Go ahead now

Who wants to buy this diamond ring ?
She took it off her finger now
It doesn’t mean a thing

This diamond ring doesn't shine for me anymore and
This diamond ring doesn't mean what it did before
So if you got someone whose love is true
Let it shine for you

This stone is genuine like love should be
And if your baby’s truer than
My baby was to me

Than this diamond ring can be something beautiful and
This diamond ring can be dreams that are coming true
Than your heart won't have to break like mine did
If there’s love behind it",This Diamond Ring
Al Kooper,"A clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind.
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine.

Jumpin' slick was my ruin,
'Cause I found out all I was doin'
Was makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, aww, yeah.
Just makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, huh-huh.

I took this man's love and put it on a shelf,
And, like a fool, I thought I had him all to myself.
When he needed love, I was out havin' fun,
But I found out that all I had done
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, huh-huh.
Yeah, that's what I did:
I made it easy for the clean up woman
To steal my baby's love, aw, yeah.

The clean up woman will wipe his blues away.
She'll give him plenty lovin', 24 hours a day.
The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet.
She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street.
So take a tip, you better get hip
To the clean up woman, 'cause she's tough.
I mean, she really cleans up.

Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.

And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendour that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada
For soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Habanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday romantic and gay.",Granada

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song

Al Martino,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

That this longing for you follows
Where-ever I go?

In the silence of my lonely room,

Al Martino,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls

While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

Now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb
I've become unreal

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
What now my love
Now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars
Tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

What now my love
Now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on

Al Martino,"In the sunlight of your smile
In the summer of our life
In the magic of love
Storms above scattered away

Lovers dreaming in the night
Reaching for paradise
But as the dark shadows fade
Love slips away

On an empty stretch of beach
In the pattern of the waves
Drawing pictures with my hand
In the sand, I see your face

Skipping pebbles on the sea
Wishing for paradise
Sand castles crumble below
The restless tides ebb and flow
Listening to a shell
Hoping for your voice
Beautiful Maria of my soul

Though we'll always be apart
Locked forever in a dream
If I ever love again
Even then, nothing will change

And the taste of you remains
Clinging to paradise
But as the distance from you grows
All that my heart ever knows
Hunger for your kiss
Longing for your touch
Beautiful Maria of my soul

Filling all my nights
Haunting all my days
Beautiful Maria of my soul",Beautiful Maria of My Soul

Al Martino,"The summer sun went down on
Our love long ago
But in my heart I feel the same
Old afterglow

A love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip away
We were too young to understand
To ever know
That lovers drift apart
And that's the way love goes

A love so beautiful
A love so free
A love so beautiful
A love for you and me
And when I think of you
I fall in love again
A love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip away

And when I think of you
I fall in love again

We let it slip away

Al Martino,"[Chorus]
The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart, 

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start, 

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love, 
My foolish heart!

Now it looks as though they're here to stay

There's a shadow hanging over me. 
Oh, yesterday came suddenly. 
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.

Now I need a place to hide away.

There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us.

Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up in the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds

Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find

Al Morgan,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals

Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Al Raymond,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it

Silently sifting through papers sealed with a crown
Admiral Lord Fisher is writing to Churchill
Calling for more dreadnoughts
The houses in Hackney they are all falling down

And my grandmother sits on the beach in the days before the war
Young girl writing her diary while time seems to pause
Watching the waves as they come one by one to die on the shore
Kissing the feet of England

Oh, the lights of Saint Petersburg come on as usual
Although the air seems charged with a strangeness of late
Yet there's nothing to touch
And the Tzar in his great Winter Palace has called for the foreign news
An archduke was shot down in Bosnia but nothing much

And my grandmother sits by the mirror in the days before the war
Smiling a secret smile as she goes to the door
And the young man rides off in his carriage, homeward once more
And the sun sets gently on England

Ah the day we decided to drive down to worthing, it rained and rained
Giving us only a minute to stand by the sea
And crunching my way through the shingles
It seemed there was nothing changed
Though the jetty was maybe more scarred that I'd known it to be

Aunt Mandi and I stood and stared at the overcast sky
Where ten years ago, we had stood, my grandfather and I
And the waves still rushed in as they had the year that he died
And it seemed that my lifetime was shrunken and lost in the tide
As it rose and fell on the side of England

A priestess, a negress, she knows her position
She's a swallow, a willow, a cello,
A pillow, a bow and also a physician

She takes your eyes and mends your head
She draws the wine and breaks the bread
She has no lies to tell you and no truths to sell you
She's a girl, she's almost a woman

And zero she flies as the morning sighs
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From the mountain he watches her, biding his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

He's a hawthorn, a raven, a scarecrow, a haven
For moon blessed thought and opinion
He will laugh like the fountains, the bones of the mountains
Lie deep in his forest religion

You will call his name when evening falls
And the ground sets hard and the night wind calls
You will feed him and heed him, at times you will need him
Say, you were almost his woman

And zero she flies as the morning sighs
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From the mountain he watches her, biding his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

In the shuddering mad, red blood let sunset
A tired man is leaving his cover
And the soft eyes of zero are cut by the sounds
Of the vanishing feet of her lover

And the door slams shut and the air grows tight
And her throat is gripped by the hands of night
And all that is left is the clock on the shelf
As it ticks one day into another

And zero, she sighs as the morning dies
With the broken wings of a seagull
From the mountain he watches her, sensing his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

At the pall of the day, the man of the mountain
Is nearing the end of his travel and the fence is down
On the west land bounds
And a footfall pounds in the gravel

Comes a knock three times and the air grows still
As he steps inside from the sudden chill
And the moment is caught in the net of the night
For the coming of dawn to unravel

And zero she flies as the morning sighs
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From the mountain he's coming, judging his time
And his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

Ohh, zero she flies as the morning dies
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From her window he watches her, a man in his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

And with love's bud shorn
Now must all dalliance hither crumble and wither

Thou couldst deprive me of my crown 
And my freedom that thou cast upon me as 
Litter bears fruit of bitter strain 

And I would go forsooth to the dragon's tooth
If thus a chance were gained
To resurrect that part of your wanton heart
To whose grave my own is chained

And hold, ere thou dost go
Were not thy moments gilded too
And in honesty didst thou not measure for measure
Countenance pleasure
Cold were't thou so cold
This in thy mind be frozen too

And will not Spring be reborn
But might the sun thaw the frost here
That all be not lost herein

And I would rather, zounds
It were hell's own hounds
Whose foul breath upon my face
Did portent my doom, than to bear the gloom
Of a world stripped of thy grace

And so in truth I know
Yes it will be a long way down
And if go thou must, ere we should meet accidental

I've been too long on the floor, I can't stay here any more
So Jenny, won't you please take me home?

Oh, the statues that I see are made out of blackest ivory
But I pass them by never guessing of their meaning
And a million voices cry as I walk across the sky
Though it's restless here, why it's only in betweening

For the journey that I'm on is incomplete
So to my feet I must rise now and travel on alone
Ah, but if you've got some time to spend in between now and the end
Oh Jenny, won't you please take me home?

Almost every word that I've said that you have heard
Hides another thought left unspoken
And if I may not reach it through the gutter of my speech
Then it best be left unsaid than lie broken

And if you wish to see, then from time to time look in my eyes
Oh, the gold is not far beneath the stone
If that will not say, it doesn't matter anyway

Al Stewart,"On a Christmas cake day one Friday in August
In a bookshop in Charing Cross Road
I first set eyes on a girl and at once I did know
She had eyes like a poet and hair like a rainbow
Reflecting the lights that did glow
And the sadness she kept in her eyes
Struck my senses a blow

And so as by chance at the touch of a glance
We could find ourselves out in the road
With no crush of time to defeat us and no place to go
And I couldn't say how but the coffee bar crowd 
Had appeared through the silence that broke
And she said, Oh my father's a judge in St Albans you know
Oh well, then perhaps I could help you 
You know that St. Albans is miles away
And I've got a room in Swiss Cottage in which you could stay
She laughed, Oh I couldn't do that, for I've got 
To be up in the morning you see
So I rang up to find out the first morning train she could take

And so in the gloom of a candlelit room
With spaghetti, two forks and a plate
She said, Oh I really would like to be free and escape
Oh well if it's like that
You don't have to go back
And you're perfectly welcome to stay
But I've not finished school yet 
She said as she got into bed 

And so as she slept and the pure morning crept 
Through the windows to take her away 
I thought you can't make people be what you want them to be
I could see my self nailed to a dormitory tale 
Of a holiday night's escapade
And just yesterday she had seemed like a woman to me

And so like a child with the sleep in her eyes
Where the sadness of age had once been
She left on the train with a see you again and a smile
And I couldn't say what I had won or I lost
Or even just what I had seen
But when I'm alone I just think of her once in awhile",Swiss Cottage Manoeuvres
Al Stewart,"David Foster lives in Gloucester with his family
Works 'til pay-time, through the day-time, then comes home for tea
Steak and kidney, then with Sydney to his club and feels free
They close the bar, he finds his car and then goes home to sleep
And his wife has been with Rosie, in the parlour where it's cosy
Watching telly, doing dishes, patching pants and making wishes
And he'll say, Bill should have wired
And, Not tonight dear, I'm too tired
And life drifts slowly by in the provinces

Peter Foster goes to Gloucester for his first school day
Bites his teacher, sees a preacher and is taught to pray
Sees some birds and learns some words it's very, very rude to say
Yes, he's rather like his father was in his young day
And his father has discussions, holding forth about the Russians
Will the Red Chinese attack us
Do we need the Yanks to back us
And in bed she feels his shoulder, but he grunts and just turns over
And life drifts slowly by in the provinces

Wedding rings come with strings but love depends on the little things
Oh could that still be really you
Is there anything time can't do

David Foster's been promoted, he's a decent sort
Peter's gone to Dad's old Public School, it's good for sport
They've even got a private parking place down in Huntingdon Court
Maybe soon he'll be a magistrate, the neighbours thought
Yes, and then he'll teach the beatniks
And the hang-around-the-streetnicks
And the good-for-nothing loafers
Who knock girls up on their sofas
And his wife is quite nice, really
Though she seems a little dreamy
Recently

I was born and brought up on the east side of town
And my earliest days they passed quickly
I would play after school with the kids all around
In the sun and the dust of the back streets

Oh, all through my girlhood the war had its day
And my daddy he would always be leaving
So my brother and I we would sit by her side
Telling our tales through the evening

Oh, I grew with the days and the boys came to call
In the back shed I learned about kissing
But I don't think my mother has noticed at all
For we've heard that my daddy is missing

Then my school days they were over and I went off to work
And my mother grew quieter and greyer
So one day I left her and went off to live
With Billy, a saxophone player

In our broken down attic we laughed and made love
And all that we had we were sharing
Oh, we slept through the day and played into the night
God, we did as we pleased without caring

Oh but a year's passed away and he's left me one day
To play in a far away country
And the sun told my eyes, You've got no place to hide
As I waited to be having his baby

Oh I lived in the park and the men passed and stared
Each wondering which one had lost her
And one came to ask could he buy me a meal
And he said he was called David Foster

We were married that month and I swore to myself
Somehow I'd pay back what I owed him
Cooking his supper and cleaning his boots
Yes, and kidding myself I could love him

Oh, but now my baby is grown and he's gone out to school
And he looks very much like his daddy
And David has buried himself in his work
And the time on my hands, it hangs heavy

Oh, the neighbours they smile as we pass in the streets
And they make their remarks on the weather
But the butcher and baker deliver things now
And I've stopped going out altogether

Oh, I live by my mirror and stare in my eyes
Trying to make out who I see there
But I'm looking at a woman that I can't recognize
And I don't think she knows me either

There are lines on her face and her hair is a mess
And the light in her eyes it grows colder
In the morning there's nothing will change, ah but yes
I will be just a little bit older",The Ballad of Mary Foster
Al Stewart,"Oh I come from Pittsburgh to study astrology
She said as she stepped on my instep
I could show you New York with a walk between Fourth Street and Nine
Then out of her coat taking seven harmonicas
She sat down to play on a doorstep
Saying, Come back to my place I will show you the stars and the signs
So I followed her into the black lands
Where the window frames peel and flake
And the old Jewish face behind the lace
Even now trying to get to see what's cooking
Just John the Baptist in the park getting laid thinking there's no-one looking
And its eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn

Her house was a dusty collection of rusty
Confusion with landings and tunnels
And leaning bookcases and spaces and faces and things
Where twenty-five Puerto Ricans, Manhattan Mohicans
And Jewish-Italian Pawnbrokers
Lead their theatrical lives in their rooms in the wings
While outside in the black lands
The violent day runs wild
And the black and white minstrels run through the crazy 
Alleys while the cops go booking
And ruthless toothless agents sneak around and there's no-one looking
And it's eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn

And oh, I'm back in the city again
You can tell by the smell of the hamburger stand in the rain

She spoke of astrology while muttering apologies
For coffee that tasted of hot dogs
I said, That's OK, mine was cold anyway, and just grand
Then she lay on the bed while the radio fed
Us with records and adverts for cat food
And I looked at her, holding my thoughts in the palm of my hand
And outside in the black lands
The evening came and went
And the bums in the street begging money for one last drink
Are hanging round the liquor stores trying to get a foot in
And the girl from Pittsburgh and I made love on a mattress with the new moon looking
And in the cool evening breeze I was down on my knees in Brooklyn",In Brooklyn

Teaches history at High Worthington School
His clothing has remained unnoticeably plain
His common room technique suitably restrained, though maybe too cool
Work done in the summery sun, see the cricket ball fly
Intently, like a strange demented bird towards the sun
Considering its flight, he pauses for a while
Ah, but Mr. Willoughby, we've never seen you smile
Tell me how come
Ah well, sometimes it must get lonely
Ah, but it's life and life only

Maurice, said Renee, Why didn't you say that you'd be so late
The supper that I made is ruined again
Is there anything you'd like 
No, nothing, he replied
Standing by the stairs, not looking in her eyes, so stupidly male
All dark and lying in bed, You've been with her again
She blurts out, then turning on her side begins to cry
At first he doesn't stir but then mumbling his words
He reaches for her hand, she shivers, but doesn't take it away
Ah, for sometimes it does get lonely
Ah, but it's life and life only.

Al Stewart,"can remember the first girl that I did love
It was Stephanie
In kindergarten arithmetic classes she used to
Sit next to me
I'd pass her sticky sweets under the table
Where the teacher couldn't see
Although she wouldn't remember me now
Sometimes I wonder where she can be

I can remember the first girl I kissed
It was Christine when I was ten
I'd been told we were moving away
I thought I'd never see her again

Oh don't forget me
I'll be back when they let me
Before you learn how to lie when you're leaving
Love is so much easier then

And at school would you believe three hundred boys
And no girls at all
But you're a fool if you should leave
Just think of the joys of rugby football

And prep in the morning and Brylcreem and acne
And cross-country running to kill evil thoughts
I'm surprised that I survived
I ran ten thousand miles with my back to the wall

I can remember the first girl that I made love to
It was in a park
In the lower pleasure gardens in Bournemouth
In summer just after dark

My mind was reeling: Oh what a feeling.
I missed the bus and walked twelve miles home
And it really didn't seem far

And all through my seventeenth summer
Running together from crowds and ties
Taking our clothes off and feeling each other
With fingers and senses and mouths and eyes

Incurring the glances of old disapproval
From elderly local inhabitant's eyes
Oh time, time we hardly even knew you
You didn't touch us with your lies

In the halcyon days of my late adolescence
My goal seemed clearly in sight
Playing electric guitar with a beat group
We set the ballrooms alight

Camping it up for the dyed blonde receptionists
Who told us we were al-ri-yi-yight
On an ego trip for a teenage superstar
On thirty shillings a nigh-yight

And so it fell that I came up to London
To look for fortune and fame
Starry eyed in my seaside successes
And much too sure of the game

First girl I met thereI thought I'd get there
But the first girl was nearly the last girl
She left my eyes in the drain
She sat on my floor in the dead of the night
Rolling a joint and looking round for a light
Her clothes were so black and her face was so white
How could I know what was right?

And I sat all huddled upon my bed
Watching her in my innocence
And it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence
Oh Artaud's anthology lay spread on the floor

And the thoughts that she gave me,
I'd not met before
And stranded half hypnotised,
I watched her in awe 
Of everything that she stood for

And I wanted more than anything to be like her with every sense
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence
She came over to me and kissed me in play

Taking my hand between her legs as she lay
And she looked in my eyes but I turned them away
Finding no words fit to say

And I hated myself, but could not move
Shattered in my confidence
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence

Now the stare of the lightbulb tore holes in my brain
As she got up in the silence that hung like a stain
And I wanted to speak, or to call out her name
But how could I begin to explain?

And my prosecuting room still holds
A strand of her hair in evidence
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence

Oh I still think about her when the night fills with rain
And speaks in its voices uneasy and vain
And I think were I maybe to find her again
Oh I'd probably see her more plain

And I should have known she was just like me
It was after all only common-sense
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence

At first I didn't go out much at all
I just stayed at home in my chains
Picking over the threads of my confidence
And searching for the remains

And when I couldn't stand any more of it
Going down to a club
Mixing in with the sounds and the crowds
I let the music cover me up

And only, lonely, the harlequins and painted phonies
Pick their ways, through the haze
Of highs and lows and blues
And all that I could do was to pick my way to you

Though I didn't tell you
You were just a thing to prove
I was hungry when found you, but I'm alright now

They sigh, they lie, the refugees and superheroes
On ice, so nice to see you, what's your name?
And all that I could do was to say the same to you
Take you for the moment, though the moment wasn't true
But I was hungry when I found you and I'm alright now

Though the street lamp cut through the curfew
It shed no light on our mind
It would have been so easy to love you
At any other time

Only, lonely, you came to me the night hung coldly
In your eyes, some other time I might have stayed with you
But all that I could do was to turn around to you
Thanks for what you gave me now it's time to say ""Adieu""
I was hungry when I found you but I'm alright now.

Ba ba ba alright now

And so it came that I stood disillusioned
By everything I'd been told
I just didn't believe love existed
They were all just digging for gold

Widows and bankers and typists and businessmen
Loved each other they said
But all it was though was just a manoeuvre
The quickest way into bed

And so I followed the others' example
And jumped into the melee
In the hunting grounds of Earls Court and Swiss Cottage
I did my best to get laid

Beer cans and parties, deb girls and arties
Bouncing around in the social confusion
Missing and making the grade

The very first time I must confess
I thought you'd be like all of the rest
And we'd be strangers once again
By the time we were dressed

But when you'd smoked your cigarette
And talked of some people that we'd me
I found myself asking was it set,
did you have to go yet

And so you laughed and then kissed me
And stayed for the whole weekend
Although the bed was so narrow
We had to sleep end to end

And so the weeks passed through my brain
In their dadaistic chain
I found myself seeing you again, and again and again
And all you gave you gave it free
Asking for nothing back from me

You gave yourself unselfishly as a part of me
And where I thought that just plucking
The fruits of the bed was enough
It grew to be less like fucking
And more like making love 

Of all the girls I ever knew
some loved and some denied me
And all the words I ever said
have been no use to hide me

And all the songs I ever sung
each one of them untied me
And all the girls I ever loved
have left themselves inside me",Love Chronicles
Al Stewart,"Oh your pictures they don't really do you justice little girl
For you're careful not to let the camera touch your private world
And there's just a hint of sadness in your smile through the dark

And it could have been so different, and at times you feel bad
For you really did have something that the others never had
And the circle turns and turns and turns so mad, little girl

Ah you must have been just fifteen when you made your mind up first
That you'd make it in the movies and you couldn't lose the thirst
And it took you to the attic where the Agent King holds Court
And his courtesans are fully paid up losers of a sort
He looks at you and tells you that you just might get the part
But you don't get things for nothing and he doesn't want your heart

Mmm, you made it to the silver screen and yet you're not a star
And advertising corsets didn't get you too far

So you modelled in a studio in Greek Street for the rent
There you met Antonio, your lover from afar
Who put you on the streets to make the money for his car
And the circle turns and turns and turns so fast, little girl

Ah, your pictures they don't really do you justice any more
For they're crumpled now and faded and were taken long ago
And that faintly coy expression has now left without a trace
Ah there's little of it buried in the ruins of your face
It could have been so different, and at times you feel bad
For you really did have something that the others never had
And the circle turns and turns and turns so mad, little girl

For the circle turns and turns and turns so sad, little girl

A seamstress,
A princess, 
A priestess, 
A negress, 
She knows her position

She's a swallow, 
A willow, 
A cello, 
A pillow, 
A bow 
And also a physician

She takes your eyes 
And mends your head
She draws the wine 
And breaks the bread
She has no lies to tell you 
And no truths to sell you
She's a girl, 
She's almost a woman

And zero she flies as the morning sighs
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From the mountain he watches her, 
Biding his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

He's a hawthorn, 
A raven, 
A scarecrow, 
A haven 
For moon-blessed thought and opinion
He will laugh like the fountains, 
The bones of the mountains 
Lie deep in his forest religion

And the ground sets hard and the night wind calls
You will feed him and heed him, 
At times you will need him

Is the clock on the shelf

With the broken wings of a seagull
From the mountain he watches her, sensing his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

Is nearing the end of his travel

On the westland bounds 
And a footfall pounds in the gravel

Comes a knock three times 
And the air grows still
As he steps inside from the sudden chill
And the moment is caught in the net of the night 
For the coming of dawn to unravel

And zero she flies as the morning sighs
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From the mountain he's coming, 
Judging his time
And his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

The fields of France are a home to me
Ah, but today lying here is a good place to be

And Europe lies sleeping,

In the rolling Bavarian hills
And swept through the cities and danced in the gutters
Grown strong like the joining of wills

In moonlight carved out of steel
Singing ""All the lonely, so long and so long
You don't know how I long, how I long
You can't hold me, I'm strong now I'm strong
Stronger than your law""

I sit here now by the banks of the Rhine
Dipping my feet in the cold stream of time
And I know I'm a dreamer, I know I'm out of line
With the people I see everywhere

The couples pass by me, they're looking so good
Their arms round each other, they head for the woods
They don't care who Ernst Roehm was, no reason they should
Just a shadow that hangs in the air

But I thought I saw him cross over the hill
With a whole ghostly army of men at his heel
And struck in the moment it seemed to be real like before

Al Stewart,"I can well recall the first time I ever put to sea
It was on the old 'Calcutta' in 1853
I was just a lad of fourteen years, a midshipman to be
To make my way in sailing ships of the Royal Navy

By the time that I was twenty-one I'd sailed the world around
Weathered storms in the China seas with the hatches battened down
And made my way by starlight off the coast of Newfoundland
And dined on beer and herrings while the waves blew all around

I live in retirement now
And through my window comes the sound of seagulls
And sets my mind remembering
The evening stars like memories sail far beyond the distant trees
Way out across the open seas
I hear them sing

Oh the wooden ships they turned to iron and the iron ships to steel
And shed their sails like autumn leaves with the turning of the wheel
And I was given captain's rank and soon took under me
The proudest ship that ever sailed for queen and country

Ah, the old queen she passed away with the new born century
And I received my calling up to the admiralty
The sands ran through the hourglass each day more rapidly
As we watched the growing of the fleets of high Germany

So at last the Great War blazed
I waited with the passing days
The call to arms that never came
Writing letters

I may be old now in your eyes
But all my years have made me wise
You don't see where the danger lies
Oh call me back, call me back

But the war it ran its course, they could find no use for me
And I live in the country now, grandchildren on my knee
And sometimes think in all this world the saddest thing to be
Old admirals who feel the wind, and never put to sea

Now just like you I've sailed my dreams like ships across the sea
And some of them they've come on rocks, and some faced mutiny
And when they're sunken one by one I'll join that company

Alone in the White House, watching the sun
Come up on the morning of 1921
I just want someone to talk to
To talk to
To talk to

I've got no shoes upon my feet
I've been all day with nothing to eat
It sure gets hard down here in the street
But I know where I'm going to be

Warren Gameliel Harding
Playing cards in a smoke-filled room
Winning and losing, filling the time
I just want someone to talk to
To talk to
To talk to

Don't go down to the docks tonight
The cops are nosing around for the site
We moved the booze just before daylight
They won't find it now, it'll be alright

In Alaska running out of days
Leaving the ladies, God moves in strange ways

Al Stewart,"First time I saw you, you were Mr. Natural
You seemed so diffident, you hardly spoke at all
Now you come to me and you've got green streaks in your hair
You walk like Greta Garbo, but you talk like Yogi Bear
So tell me now
What's going on? What's going on?
I really don't believe what's going on; what's going on?

Anyone in the farmhouse could have given you the news
You think you're in control but you're only being used
I know your head is in the sky, you're easy to deceive
But how you fell for this I really don't believe
So tell me now
What's going on? What's going on?
I really don't believe what's going on; what's going on?

All those rock 'n' roll star heroes you spend your time around
You may think you're one of them but you're a hundred thousand down
What are you going to do when the company calls its money in?
How'll you feel stuck out in the rain without a friend?

I really don't believe what's going on; what's going on?",What's Going On
Al Stewart,"When we came to the station all the trains were rusty
The doors were open and the windows broken in
There was grass in all the cracks and the air hung musty
The travel posters were flapping in the wind
So we moved through the dust and gloom
Playing waiting games in the waiting-room
Lay our sleeping-bags out on the floor
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a place to go

If I followed the coast road, I'd be home by evening
The harbor lights still cut across the bay
From the slot machine arcade the lights go streaming
To the bikes outside the rock 'n' roll cafe
Ah but you know those small town blues
Are really too much to lose
There's nothing really there to go back for
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a place to go

Any railway station would be just fine, fine, fine
To settle down and wash the cobwebs from your head
Oh, if your situation's running dry, dry, dry
Find a waiting-room beneath the stars to make your bed'

Cause you know London can make your brain stall
The streets get cold and empty on a rainy night
So you duck into the subway station, you can hear the trains call
They want to take you to the Earl's Court Road, but it don't seem right
Cause it's na, na, na noowah
On the juke-box, singing in the burger bar
See the people's faces in the passing cars don't want to know
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a place to go

You have the most appealing surface I have seen
Bring it over here, lay it down by me
Don't mean to make you nervous, I just mean
To make you see, this is the place to be

When we came to the station all the trains were rusty
The air was empty and the platforms overgrown
There were old tin cans and cats and the doors were crusted
With mud and leaves and names carved long ago
And the rails go on for ever in a silver trail to the setting sun
You can follow them anywhere you want to go
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a need to know",Apple Cider Reconstitution
Al Stewart,"Sometimes it seems unimaginable
That you were ever any other way
With your white rose face and your orphan clothes
Embroidered jeans and silver chains
You're a well known face in all the hang-out places
Where the lost souls congregate
You sit all night, but you talk too fast
I don't know what you're trying to say

Oh Carol, I think it's time for running for cover, a-ha
Believe me, you're everyone's and nobody's lover, a-ha
You've got a one-way ticket for all your yesterdays

I know your daddy said he'd talk to you
But he never really found the time
And your TV mother with her cocktail eyes
Could never really reach your mind
So you fixed your star to a passing dream
And took a cocaine holiday
Now the years flow round you in a muddy stream
And you need another place to stay.

Oh Carol, I think it's time for running for cover, a-ha
Believe me, you're everyone's and nobody's lover, a-ha
You've got a one-way ticket for all your yesterdays

Reach down, silvery ship from the stars, I know you're there
I know you'll understand me, you can take me anywhere
I know you must be there
Well, sometimes it seems impossible
That the game could get that rough
But the stage is set, the exit's barred
And the make-up won't come off
So you make your bow to the balcony
You light another cigarette
And the lights grow dim as the music starts
And it's easy to forget

Oh Carol, I think it's time for running for cover, a-ha
Believe me, you're everyone's and nobody's lover, a-ha
You've got a one-way ticket for all your yesterdays

I know you'll understand me, you can take me anywhere
I know you must be there",Carol
Al Stewart,"Hello old friend, what a strange coincidence to find you
It's been fifteen years since we last met, but I still recognised you
So call the barman over here, and let us fill our glasses
And drink a toast to olden times where all our memories lie
Where all our memories lie

Do you remember the time we were young?
Lowly, lowly, low
Outside the window the frosty moonlight hung
On the midnight snow

So we pulled our scarves around our faces in the night
Huddled on the doorsteps where the fairylights shone bright
Singing Christmas carols while our breath hung in the light
It all comes back like yesterday
It almost seems like yesterday

Do you remember the changes as we grew?
Slowly, slowly, slow
Sneaking in the back way into movies after school
For the evening show

Chasing skinny blue jean girls across the building-site
Checking out the dance floor while the band played ""Hold Me Tight""
See the blonde one over there: I bet she'd be alright
It all comes back like yesterday
It almost seems like yesterday

While I talked he sat and he never made a sound
Staring at the glass beside me
Hey old friend, tell me what's on your mind?
Silence grows on you like ivy
Ivy

Do you remember the church across the sands?
Holy, holy, ho
You stood outside and planned to travel the lands
Where the pilgrims go

So you packed your world up inside a canvas sack
Set off down the highway with your rings and Kerouac
Someone said they saw you in Nepal a long time back
Tell me why you look away
Don't you have a word to say?

He said, ""I don't remember ... I Don't want to remember
In fact I've heard too much already
I don't want to think, just leave me here to drink
Wrapped up in the warmth of New York City

Oh, oh, it seems you just don't know
And you just don't understand me
I've got no use for the tricks of modern times
They tangle all my thoughts like ivy
Ivy""

So I left him, and I went out to the street
Lowly, lowly, low
Where the red light girls were coming after me
Forty dollar show

All across the city's heart the lights were coming on
The hotel lift softly hummed a Cole Porter song
If I went to look for him I knew he would be gone
A picture-card of yesterday

A photograph of yesterdayAnd far off in a deserted part of town
The shadows like a silent army
Flooded out the rooms in pools of blue and brown
And stuck to all the walls like ivy

Al Stewart,"He heard the clatter of her heels in the street
The clock said half-past three
He lay there waiting in the dark to hear
The scraping of the front-door key

He wouldn't say to her
""Don't want to know where you were""
She wouldn't find him there
Next time

She missed the train, she felt the rain upon her face
It seemed to clear her head
She watched him drive into the night
A broken tail-light, a speck of red

She still felt his touch
It didn't seem to mean that much
She wouldn't go back there
Next time

When you were just a kid you loved
To go to movies in the afternoon
And so you left the factory
And got a job in the projection-room

Next time",Next Time
Al Stewart,"It's the kind of grey November day that washes away reflections
In the eyes of hotel porters
And the latticed wooden benches by the sea contain no travellers
Or Irish lady authors

And the girl in the raincoat walks the lanes of Brighton
With her collar turned against the wind
And hovers in the doorways of second-hand bookshops
Among the dust and fading print

And you're not the one she's thinking of
And you're not the one she really wants
Just a point along the line she's leaving from

She goes into a cafe, orders tea, looks at the menu
But there's nothing really on it
And the place is as deserted as a plaza in a heat-wave
And the cloth has jam upon it

But the girl in the raincoat doesn't stop to count the tea-leaves
Or turn to see the mists around the sun
For the winter's unfolding around her
And it's time for moving on

And you're not the one she's thinking of
And you're not the one she really wants
Just a station on the line she's leaving from

And so you sit there in the middle of the carpet
With her suitcases around you
And it comes to you she journeyed to the center of your life
But she never really found you

Just another girl in a raincoat
Who shared the passing of the days
And you're glad of the warmth that she gave you
And you hardly need to say

That she's not the one you're thinking of
No she's not the one you really want
Just a point along the line you're leaving from",Not the One
Al Stewart,"I was drawn by the sirens of Titan
Carried along by their call
Seeking for a way to enlighten
Searching for the sense of it all

Like a kiss on the wind I was thrown to the stars
Captured and ordered in the army of Mars
Marching to the sound of the drum in my head
I followed the call

Only to be Malachi Constant
I thought I came to this earth
Living in the heart of the moment
With the riches I gained at my birth

But here in the yellow and blue of my days
I wander the endless Mercurian caves
Watching for the signs the Harmonians make
The words on the walls

I was drawn by the sirens of Titan
And so I came in the end
Under the shadow of Saturn
With statues and birds for my friends

Finding a home at the end of my days
Looking around I've only to say
I was the victim of a series of accidents
As are we allI was drawn by the sirens of Titan (as are we all)

Al Stewart,"You always were a city kid though you were country raised
And back in some forgotten time we shared the cold north days
But the simple life was not your style, and you just had to escape
So it's goodbye to my lady of the islands

On Remembrance Day the bands all played, the bells pealed through the park
And you lay there by the Do Not signs, and shamed them with your spark
Now winter moans in old men's bones as the day falls into dark
So it's goodbye to my lady of the islands

It was just like this behind the kisses you so soon swept away
I always knew that some day yo'd be bound to just get pulled away

The summer sun beats on and on, the shops swim in the heat
And you're standing by the traffic signs with taxis at your feet
I know that in your city skin you're feeling more complete
So it's goodbye to my lady of the islands

No I never got the letters that you said you'd send me

Al Stewart,"On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat

While she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay

Al Stewart,"It's Sunday afternoon and it's raining,
I m falling
Color sections, pastel blue, an empty church, a movie queue
And I'm falling

Watching you moving around
Taking the time
To get a proper look
It seems as though I've never really looked at you

Get up, put the kettle on, make us some tea
I'm falling
If we've got some biscuits left, please bring one for me,
I'm just falling

Spending the whole day in bed
Wasting our time
In such a gentle way
We hardly need to say a word, it's just okay

And already the sun has gone, and it's growing dark outside,
I can see your face reflected in the red electric firelight,
And our shadow is an embryo
That slowly comes to life

And as it moves across the wall
It seems to feel the fire of living
Growing stronger as it climbs
To shiver in a blaze

Across the ceiling
And the soundless crash of the sea
Fills the room with the scent of the breeze
And the waves break over

The beach of our bodies
As you reach your fingers out to me

Why don't we take the whole of next week off work,
We're falling
You can say you don't feel well, you caught a cold or something,
We're just falling

We can get out of town
Taking the time
To let it all work out

And he dried your eyes, and later he lay beside you

Pulled us out of rhyme
In Carvajal

Into a taxi and down to the airport
In only the clothes I was standing in
A scribbled address, a toothbrush, a passport
The money we saved in the biscuit tin
Running afraid to a strange Spanish town
Searching the sands and the shoreline...

And I have heard the news from Spain
Now the Winter winds possess the Southern reaches
And the sea folds like a mantle on the beaches
And the crowds have gone

And put our defeats down to chance or experience
And try once again for the light

Some call on Jehovah
Some cry out to Allah
Some wait for the boats that still row to Valhalla

On a back country lane
I came on the village
Where first I grew
And stopped to climb up
The hill once again
Looking down from the tracks
To the grey slate roofs

I watched the village moving
As the day went slowly by
In the field we lay here
Lovers' footsteps went by
In the fields we lay here
My very first love and I
Under timeless arcadian skies
Under timeless arcadian skies

The old canal lies
Sleeping under the sky
The barges are gone to a lost decade
On overgrown banks here
Lovers' footsteps went by
Long before ever the roads were made
And in our turn we passed here
And carved our names on trees
As the days washed by like
Waves of an endless sea
Under timeless arcadian skies
Under timeless arcadian skies

Time runs through your fingers
You never hold till its gone
Some fragments just linger with you
Like snow in the spring hanging on

To fade like a sail in the darkening seas
The shifts and changes in the patterns of life
Will weather it more that the centuries

Living on the bottom of the sea

Al Stewart,"The fishing boats go out across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border

In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away

Late last night the rain was knocking at my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border

In the islands where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain
An empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air you feel too well

Al Stewart,"They crossed over the border, the hour before dawn
Moving in lines through the day
Most of our planes were destroyed on the ground where they lay
Waiting for orders we held in the wood
Word from the front never came
By evening the sound of the gunfire was miles away
Ah, softly we move through the shadows, slip away through the trees
Crossing their lines in the mists in the fields on our hands and on our knees
And all that I ever
Was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red
Silhouetting the smoke on the breeze

All summer they drove us back through the Ukraine
Smolensk and Viasma soon fell
By autumn we stood with our backs to the town of Orel
Closer and closer to Moscow they come
Riding the wind like a bell
General Guderian stands at the crest of the hill
Winter brought with her the rains, oceans of mud filled the roads
Gluing the tracks of their tanks to the ground while the sky filled with snow
And all that I ever
Was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red
Silhouetting the snow on the breeze

In the footsteps of Napoleon the shadow figures stagger through the winter
Falling back before the gates of Moscow, standing in the wings like an avenger
And far away behind their lines the partisans are stirring in the forest
Coming unexpectedly upon their outposts, growing like a promise
You'll never know, you'll never know which way to turn, which way to look you'll never see us
As we're stealing through the blackness of the night
You'll never know, you'll never hear us
And the evening sings in a voice of amber, the dawn is surely coming
The morning roads lead to Stalingrad, and the sky is softly humming

Two broken Tigers on fire in the night
Flicker their souls to the wind
We wait in the lines for the final approach to begin
It's been almost four years that I've carried a gun
At home it will almost be spring
The flames of the Tigers are lighting the road to Berlin
Ah, quickly we move through the ruins that bow to the ground
The old men and children they send out to face us, they can't slow us down
And all that I ever
Was able to see
The eyes of the city are opening
Now it's the end of the dream

I'm coming home, I'm coming home, now you can taste it in the wind, the war is over
And I listen to the clicking of the train-wheels as we roll across the border
And now they ask me of the time that I was caught behind their lines and taken prisoner
""They only held me for a day, a lucky break,"" I say they turn and listen closer
I'll never know, I'll never know why I was taken from the line and all the others
To board a special train and journey deep into the heart of holy Russia
And it's cold and damp in the transit camp, and the air is still and sullen
And the pale sun of October whispers the snow will soon be coming
And I wonder when I'll be home again and the morning answers ""Never""
And the evening sighs, and the steely Russian skies go on forever",Roads to Moscow
Al Stewart,"I was making my way through the wasteland
The road into town passes through
I was changing the radio stations

I remember the first time I saw you
Alone in the dark with a drink
With a candle flame burning before you
And your thoughts closed in
You were staring out into the distance
Not seeming to hear what I said
Why did you put up such resistance
Like all the lights are red

But sometimes it's there in your face

We circle each other in flight
Till together we roll like the ocean
In its bed at night

She lowered her guard and showed me the scars
She got from trying to fight
Saying oh, you'd better believe it

Well I'm up to my neck in the crumbling wreckage
Of all that I wanted from life
When I looked for respect all I got was neglect
Though I swallowed the line as a sign of the times
But dealing a jack from the back of the pack
They said-You lose again
Oh, I said, who needs it?


Well don't get me wrong now I tried to get on
With the jokers that got in my way
And I put on a smile and I tried all the while to be straight
But they just wanted more all the time and I'm sure
That you know what I mean when I say
That I'm sick of the touch and there's only so much you can take.


Well nothing that's real is ever for free
And you just have to pay for it sometime
She said it before, she said it to me
I suppose she believed there was nothing to see
But the same old four imaginary walls
She built for living inside
I said oh, you just can't mean it


Well there was never a doubt that she had to get out
She was just looking around for a way
In the pit of the night there was nowhere to hide any more
She was out on a limb, she was reaching for things
That she wanted, but just couldn't say
And she had to be sure that she wouldn't get caught like before.


Well nothing that's forced can ever be right
If it doesn't come naturally, leave it
That's what she said as she turned out the light

In a kingdom lost in time.
And in the forests of evening the archer is bending a bow,
And I see you bring him bread and wine.

Down the ligneous years the invaders have taken these lands,
And bent you to their will.
And the murmurous fade of the ancients and all that they had,
But the magic lingers round you still.

Al Stewart,"Before the phone hits the receiver
You're halfway to the door
The voice said 'get out while you can,
There's just 1O minutes, nothing more'

Time only for the essentials
Better gather them and run
The false name inside the passport,
The gold bars and the gun

And once again they've come out of the past
And though your mind is cool your heart is beating fast
You've been through it all before
Each time you wish a little more that you could ask

""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?'

It's a long and twisting journey
From the sweeping northern plains
To the outcrops of the jungle
Bowed beneath the tropic rains

In the customs hall the officer
Takes you to one side
And his eyes reveal no feeling
As you hand over the bribe

And once again you've bought a little time
And once again you're fading out of sight
Still the fox is growing older
As he calls over his shoulder to the night:

""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?""

Here, come over here
Beneath a sympathetic moon
We'll sit and talk over old times without a fear
Another beer, from the cafes of the night

The tumbling rhythms of guitars ring loud and clear
One by one they've nailed the others
But you always got away
What it is that keeps you just that step ahead

No one can say
In one last raid the agents
Of the dawn break down the door
Of a house where you were standing

Maybe just an hour before
And still the thread continues to unwind
You take the hidden roads that only you can find
And should they come upon your tracks

There's just a question hanging back you left behind

What do you need from me?

Their eyes met across the captain's table,
Both trying to resist, but just weren't able.

You knew it had to happen, the music grew intense.
In love affairs on oceans, the feelings seem immense.
Looks like they headed into stormy weather.

And he replied, with a tear in his eye

Nothing was clear
Love was a smile away
Just a defile away
I sought it every way

Nothing was said as he stared at his shoe
Then he replied as he gave you the key

No one came near.

Alone in your room you hide
As the night rolls by
In the street outside
And you feel over the words he said
Till they turn to rain all around your head

You're seeking a hideaway
Where the light of day
Doesn't touch your face
And a door sign keeps the world away
Behind the shades
Of your silent day.

You made your home in the Broadway Hotel
Room service came at the push of a bell
And the man said as he put down the tray
Love was a stealaway
Just a reveal away

You asked the man to stay

Oh, you wrapped me up in a leather coat

When the runway came in sight
The clouds came up to gather us
And the cockpit turned to white
When I looked the sky was empty

Caught up in the slipstream of dare

And lights the maps and diagrams
That Leonardo makes

Al Stewart,"When I took my boat out to the White Sea
I had no care in the world
Not a cloud disturbed the sky
I was dreaming only of how it might be
Then dark fell into the day
And the wind began to rise
Peter on the White Sea
Green mountains of waves
Blew all around
Peter on the White Sea
The howl of the wind, that lonesome sound
Sailors made their peace then with the Almighty
Still I kept hope in my heart
Through the salt and stormy night
Every hour the wind struck ever harder
We held on tight in the dark
As our bow rose and fell
Till we came with daylight into the harbor
Hard by the monastery walls
To the ringing of a bell

Al Stewart,"Born in England's pleasant green
Like a picture postcard scene
To childhood spread with fond maternal care
From the day that he was born
Proud relations came to fawn
And compliment his pretty golden hair

In boyhood sent away
To a boarding school to stay
Its crumbling proud traditions forced to bear
And his friends in this new world
Said he looks more like a girl
With those blue eyes and pretty golden hair

Fades secluded youth
Into manhood's search for truth
His mother's eyes now wet had turned to stare
For he said I must be bound
This day for London town
For I believe my fortune's waiting there

So like an eager cutting knife
He plunged in a new life
Oh never known beforehand anywhere
And the thought that he might trip
In his ignorance and slip
Never struck beneath his pretty golden hair

Ah the days soon grew thin
And boredom fast set in
His job was thrown away without a care
For a man who softly said
You'll earn twice as much instead
With those blue eyes and pretty golden hair

Well London town possessed
Of many a tempter's nest
And thus he fell with scarce another care
As so easily he slipped
Into prostitution's grip
Foundationed by his pretty golden hair

Ah but the years quickly flew
And his mind slowly grew
From early freedom into deep despair
As the money ceased to roll
A tired and lonely soul
Poured curses on his pretty golden hair

Ah the years stole their time
Now the living's hard to find
And early friends have vanished in the air
And the gay parties's ease
Changed to public lavatories
Have turned to grey his pretty golden hair

Oh his life was only used
And his body just abused
By those who never think and never care
But though his file said suicide
No, that wasn't why he died
It was murder by his pretty golden hair",Pretty Golden Hair
Al Stewart,"The Gothenburg streets were like silver sheets
As I kicked my feet through the snowy world
And in that land there I held the hand of my
Scandinavian girl

We stood as part of a bleak facade
Though the city's heart was still beating
And for a while there I shared a smile with my
Scandinavian girl

And I stood there quite surprised 
To see reflected in her eyes
The very thought I left unsaid
As too unwise

And so we passed through a world of glass

Al Stewart,"They said ""God Bless the Prince of Wales
Let let us hope that he prevails.""

Of distant monarchy

Moving through the human tide
With the Princess at his side
Tribesmen cheer and gaze wide-eyed
At such celebrity

The Royal smile from magazines
Waving hands from limousines
The crowd holds pictures of the Queen
The magic entity

These images are beamed to me
Ten thousand miles across the sea
Lately I don't seem to be
Concerned with what they mean

In the dark, in the dark
Oh I never saw the danger or the spark
In the dark, in the dark
I was feeling like a stranger
'Cause I never saw the changes in your heart

Those angry words you soon regret
Are gone but not forgotten yet
She may forgive, she won't forget
Each individual scar

You make it up and say no more
And go on living like before
But every wave erodes the shore
And tarnishes the star

You sow each seed of discontent
Wonder where the loving went
Every night that's heaven sent
The dawn can sweep away

And in the background all the time
Like some ironic church bell chime
You watch the Royal couple climb
Towards their destiny

In the dark, in the dark
Oh I never saw the danger or the spark
In the dark, in the dark
I was feeling like a stranger
I never saw the changes in your heart

So yes, let's bless the Prince of Wales
Cheer for him and if all fails
Wrap him in Valkyries' sails

I am free to choose my part
But still can't find the place to start
To find my way back to your heart
That place of mystery

They bid farewell to the Royal ship
The newly painted fences chip
Life falls into routine

We go on from day to day
Living in the usual way

What happened in between

Oh I never saw the danger or the spark
In the dark, in the dark
I was feeling like a stranger
'Cause I never saw the changes

Al Stewart,"On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat

While she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay

Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border

On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border

In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away

Al Stewart,"They crossed over the border the hour before dawn
Moving in lines through the day
Most of our planes were destroyed on the ground where they lay
Waiting for orders we held in the wood - word from the front never came
By evening the sound of the gunfire was miles away
Ah, softly we move through the shadows, slip away through the trees
Crossing their lines in the mists in the fields on our hands and our knees
And all that I ever was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red silhouetting the smoke on the breeze
All summer they drove us back through the Ukraine
Smolyensk and Viyasma soon fell
By autumn we stood with our backs to the town of Orel
Closer and closer to Moscow they come - riding the wind like a bell
General Guderian stands at the crest of the hill
Winter brought with her the rains, oceans of mud filled the roads
Gluing the tracks of their tanks to the ground while the sky filled with snow
And all that I ever was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red silhouetting the snow on the breeze
In the footsteps of Napoleon the shadow figures stagger through the winter
Falling back before the gates of Moscow, 
Standing in the wings like an avenger
And far away behind their lines the partisans are stirring in the forest
Coming unexpectedly upon their outposts, growing like a promise
You'll never know, you'll never know 
Which way to turn, which way to look, you'll never see us
As we're stealing through the blackness of the night 
You'll never know, you'll never hear us
And the evening sings in a voice of amber, the dawn is surely coming
The morning road leads to Stalingrad, and the sky is softly humming
Two broken Tigers on fire in the night flicker their souls to the wind
We wait in the lines for the final approach to begin
It's been almost four years that I've carried a gun
At home it'll almost be spring
The flames of the Tigers are lighting the road to Berlin
Ah, quickly we move through the ruins that bow to the ground
The old men and children they send out to face us, they can't slow us down
And all that I ever was able to see
The eyes of the city are opening now it's the end of the dream
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Now you can taste it in the wind, the war is over
And I listen to the clicking of the train wheels as we roll across the border
And now they ask me of the time 
That I was caught behind their lines and taken prisoner
""They only held me for a day, a lucky break"", I say; 
They turn and listen closer
I'll never know, I'll never know
Why I was taken from the line and all the others
To board a special train and journey deep into the heart of holy Russia
And it's cold and damp in the transit camp, and the air is still and sullen
And the pale sun of October whispers the snow will soon be coming
And I wonder when I'll be home again and the morning answers

I said oh, you just can't meana it 

Well there was never a doubt that she had to get out 
she was just looking around for a way 
In the pit of the night there was nowhere to hide any more 
She was out on a limb, she was reaching for things 
That she wanted, but just couldn't say 
And she had to be sure that she wouldn't get caught like before. 

Well nothing that's forced can ever be right 
If it doesn't come naturally, leave it

The veil that covered her eyes 
I said oh, you can leave it.

And a million voices cry
As I walk across the sky
Though it's restless here, why it's only in-betweening

For the journey that I'm on
Is incomplete so to my feet
I must rise now and travel on alone
Ah, but if you've got some time to spend
In between now and the end
Oh Jenny won't you please take me home.

Hides another thought left unspoken

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose
Al Vega,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland
Al Vega,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Al Viola,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I could live without love

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near

Makes me stop before I begin

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.

What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Down the path along side the lake

His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew

""Take me in tender woman
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in, tender woman,"" sighed the snake

She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk
And laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk
She hurried home from work  that night and soon as she arrived
She found that pretty snake she'd taken to had been revived
""Take me in, tender woman
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in, tender woman,"" sighed the snake

She clutched him to her bosom, ""You're so beautiful,"" she cried
""But if I hadn't brought you in by now you might have died""
She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight
Instead of saying thanks, the snake gave her a vicious bite
""Take me in, tender woman
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in, tender woman,"" sighed the snake
""I saved you,"" cried the woman
""And you've bitten me, but why?

Gripping on grain, while the 15's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to 71, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the Hardest Pit of the litter
Down South, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone

It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart

Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

[Verse 4]
Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

[Chorus: x2]

[Willean]
DJ Screw player, I'll never forget
Represent S.U.C., forever my set
I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe
It's your boy Willean, and I'm holding it down
Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live
And if S.U.C. get a deal, it's goin' be a hundred mill

[Al-D]
If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

[Chorus: x2]",Never Forget
Al-D,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it (I can do it)
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Al-Gear,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

Warte, halt! Das hier ist kein Song für kleine Kinder
Graue Haare von dem Stress und vom Tabak gelbe Finger
Leute werden hier behindert, machen Selbstmord

Den Fakt ist, dein Leben zieht grad voll an dir vorbei
Doch du checkst es nicht, wieso? Jeder Tag ist für dich gleich
Du vertreibst dir deine Zeit nur mit Karten spielen, weil
Es Spaghetti zu gewinnen gibt oder irgend so ein Scheiß
Nicht mal den Wasserkocher teilst, glaub mir, ich kenne solche Typen
Doch halt es hier nicht länger aus, weil mich die Wände erdrücken
Denn dieser Gangster will flüchten aus einer Welt voller Hass
In meiner Gegend sagen kleine Kinder Geld wäre Macht
Ich häng ständig im Knast und kann die Wände nicht mehr sehen
Bitte Gott, gib mir Kraft, ich will die Wende miterleben

Dass wir hier in Deutschland leben
Keine echte Armut kennen, Eltern einem alles geben
Denn hab' ich Hunger wird gegessen wie bei Asterix
Doch leider gibt's auch Länder wo es nicht mal warmes Wasser gibt
Nein, wo es anders ist, schwer zu erklären
Kleine Kinder ackern gehen um die Familien zu ernähren
Das sind Infos aus erster Hand, scheiß mal auf die Medien
Heimatland Algerien, verbrachte dort als kleiner Mann die Ferien
Und konnte sehen was es heißt Schwersarbeit zu leisten
Für ne' Hand voll ekligem Reiß, ich kämpf gegen die Zeit
Genau wie Ali ausm' Nachbardorf, dessen Traum es war zu Leben
Allerdings an nem' anderen Ort, 17 Jahre jung
Geprägt von Armut und Qual, keine Airmax an den Füßen
Nur durchlöcherte Sandalen, Bruder, das ist die dritte Welt
Hier führst du kein schönes Leben
Doch der Traum von Ali sollte bald in Erfüllung gehen

Er hatte einen Traum, man konnte es ihm ansehen
Verliere nicht deinen glauben, du musst diesen weg entlang gehen
Im Angesichts des Todes, bist du auf dich alleine gestellt
Das Ziel ist in Sicht, solange du an dein Glauben hältst

Zurück zu Ali und dem Jahr 2010, er war ein richtig guter Junge
Und ging Streit aus dem Weg, besuchte 5 mal am Tag zur rechten
Zeit die Moschee, denn nur Familie und Gebet sind das einzige was zählt
Er machte Tijara am liebsten wäre er Amok gelaufen
Mit Benzin Geld verdienen und an die Marokks verkaufen
Kilometer weit laufen bis hin zur Grenze des Königreichs
Gäbe es einen Fluchtplan, wäre es die Möglichkeit
Doch es könnte tödlich sein, merk dir eins, da hilft dir kein Höflichkeit
Entweder du rennst, oder sie sperren dich ein
Der Traum von Europa, Ali brauchte dafür starkes Glück
Viele Brüder schafften es nicht und kamen in einem Sarg zurück
Der Junge wusste was er brauche war Geld, und so sparte er fleißig
Bis 2011, das ist seine kranke Welt, er will nur der Armut entgehen
Ohne Mama tschüss zu sagen machte er sich auf den Weg

Er hatte einen Traum, man konnte es ihm ansehen
Verliere nicht deinen glauben, du musst diesen weg entlang gehen
Im Angesichts des Todes, bist du auf dich alleine gestellt
Das Ziel ist in Sicht, solange du an dein Glauben hältst

Jetzt stand er da und war ganz auf sich alleine gestellt
Sein Traum wurde wahr, allerdings in einer fremden Welt
Wenig Geld, er kannte keine Spanischen Wörter
Denn die Schulbildung wird in so nem' Staat nicht gefördert
Das war sein erstes Problem als er Europa betrat
Nach der Qual voll in Fahrt, fast über einen Tag
Auf einem Schlepper den man besser auf einem Schrottplatz
Deponiert, nicht als Transportmittel nutzt, für einen blinden Passagier
Doch jetzt war es schon passiert, er hat den ersten Schritt gemacht
Und konnte jetzt nicht mehr zurück, hier begann seine Schlacht
Also rief er einen Freund an, der aus dem selben Dorf war
Dieser lebte jetzt in Deutschland, und flüchtete im Feuer
Er sagte komm nach Düsseldorf, hier Lebt es sich gut
Du kriegst ein Zimmer im Asylheim und musst nichts dafür tun
Er gab ihm die Adresse, Ali schrieb alles auf
Er hatte kaum noch Geld, doch nam diese Risiken in kauf

Er hatte einen Traum, man konnte es ihm ansehen
Verliere nicht deinen glauben, du musst diesen weg entlang gehen
Im Angesichts des Todes, bist du auf dich alleine gestellt
Das Ziel ist in Sicht, solange du an dein Glauben hältst

Angekommen in Düsseldorf, Oberbilk, Endstation
Das Gegenteil von San Tropez, wo die meisten Gangster wohnen
Ali lernte schnell, du musst ein ganz harter Typ sein
Tagsüber mit Drogen dealen, pennen im Asylheim
Er hat angefangen zu trinken und hing nur in Discotheken
Ist vom Glauben abgekommen und hat aufgehört zu beten
Dieses Leben ist nicht immer fair, und manchmal auch nicht einfach
Trotzdem schickte er jeden Monat Geld in die Heimat
Irgendwann hatte Ali schon ne' ganze menge Geld gespart
Und kaufte einen Wagen für seinen Bruder, der älter war
In Algerien saß und keine Zeit zum träumen hatte
Er wollte ihm damit einfach nur ne' Freude machen
Er wurde Stadtgespräch, doch was dann geschah
War nicht abzusehen, denn am diesen Tag
Fuhren seine Eltern mit und zwei seiner Schwestern
Sein Bruder der am Lenkrad saß, starb als letzter",Karma

Ey yo Max Herre, ich lass' dich Stahlpatronen fressen
Du piç mit langen Haaren wie die Marioprinzessin

Bitch, das ist Kollegah, mein Leben wird immer rosiger
Ich treff' mich mit niemandem mehr, der nicht ein paar Millionen hat
Check' das Mobiliar meiner Nobelyacht
Auf der du ständig paar Reiche kommen und gehen siehst wie Historiker
Komplette Dominanz, völlige Zerberstung des Rapgames
Ich forder' die totale Unterwerfung deiner Crew
Oder ich steh' bald vor dei'm Haus mit zwei Guns wie Max Payne
Mach du weiter Rap, Kid, ich bleibe beschäftigt in El Salvador mit der Großernte
Wenn ich mich bei Rap mal ins Zeug lege, dann nur ab und zu beim Chillen auf Koksbergen
Besser du senkst den Blick, denn du sprichst mit dem Paten oder verpiss dich du Sklave
Dein Freundeskreis will jetzt auch rappen und sofort steigt die germanische Bitch-MC-Rate
Kein Feature für Spastis, ich lasse Rapper per Box vor's Gesicht sterben
Bitch, nerv mich und du endest beim Doktor wie Schiffswerften

Diese zwei sind nicht normal, also mach keine Welle

Vertick' an deine Bitch weiter Stoff am Block

Rufe meine Clique, geben der Fotze Cock
Und sag' dann, du musst raus, mein Schatz
Jetzt ist die Nutte süchtig, der Stoff war deiner Frau zu stark
Sie sagt zwar, sie wär' clean, doch drückt E wie bei 'ner Aufzugsfahrt
Und Rapper, die von Geld erzählen, verdien' nur kleine Sümmchen
Labern ständig von Koks, doch kaufen Pep wie Bayern München
Elendjunkies vom Bahnhof schmeißen sich schmutzige Pillen
Weil sie nur Kackdealer kenn', wie wenn ich Russisch sprechen will
Mir passt du Nutte nicht ins Bild, ich fick' deine Mutter seperat
Zu deiner Schwester, beide wollen Schwanz, ich hab den Sip parat

Deixo-me ir nos trilhos traçados

Abraças a guitarra e voas para além da lua

Amarro o beijo que se quer soltar
Espero que me sintas para me entregar

É o bater do coração
Fecha-se a porta

Alabama,"There's a blanket of snow coverin' up the old road to the house where I was raised
Through the window I see the lights on the tree and a glow from the old fireplace
Though it all looks the same so much as changed from the way it used to be

Christmas memories of happy years gone by
They come back to me and keep me warm inside
Still those Christmas memories make me cry

Now the stockings are filled; the house is still and the kids are dreamin' away
There's that old easy chair, me and Daddy sat there waitin' for Santa's sleigh
Now Daddy's gone but we carry on 'cause the little ones will need...

Who's the party for
Who's the one responsible for all this peace and joy
Who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy

There were times we didn't think we'd make it through the year

Alabama,"It was July hot 'cross Georgia on my way to myrtle beach
I just got my diploma so I set out in search of me
The honeymoon was over and Alabama was far away
From being little more than just a southern state

I got a gig down at the Bowery
I played for tip and watered drinks
Just a novice in a business
That's seldom what it seems

And where are you goin' tar top
Where's J.C. and the chosen few?
I saw the flash without T.Gentry
And B.V. left for Malibu

I was July, hot and thirty, some years down the line
When the boys touched the nation, unaware at the time
I got to go to Texas, California, New York too
A farm boy who is thankful to be standin' in his shoes

But in the Bowery hangs the memories
Of dreams that still come true
Every time I see the spotlights
I'm one of the chosen few

And where are you going tar top
J.C. and the chosen few
There's no flash without T.Gentry
B.V. where are you?

Is it contemporary glamor?

You work a forty hour week for a livin' just to send it on down the line
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, let me thank you for your time
You work a forty hour week for a livin', a-just to send it on down the line

This is for the one who swings the hammer, driving home the nail
Or the one behind the counter, ringing up the sale
Or the one who fights the fires, the one who brings the mail
For everyone who works behind the scenes

You can see them every morning in the factories and the fields
In the city streets and the quiet country towns
Working together like spokes inside a wheel
They keep this country turning around

You work a forty hour week for a livin',a-just to send it on down the line
Hello West Virginia coal miner, let me thank you for your time
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line

Or the waitress, the mechanic, the policeman on patrol

The lawman and the cowboy pushed their horses on
Racin' toward the Rio running out of time
They had to catch the outlaws before they crossed the borderline.

Well, the lawman wanted justice the cowboy revenge
They tracked the Outlaws' horses up to the river's edge
And there across the Rio a badge ain't worth a dime
The law was in their own hands once they crossed the borderline.

So they ride to the desert wind down a dusty trail, destiny begins
Heroes never turn or look back
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline

In the safety of the badlands the outlaws stopped their run
The campfire rings with laughter of evil things they've done
How they'd taken all they wanted and killed the cowboy's wife
And knew no one would follow them, cross the borderline.

The lawman and the cowboys stepped out of the dark
And it was two against the twenty and every bullet found its mark
And so goes the legend that out there in the night
The two still ride together somewhere beyond the borderline.

So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins
Heroes never turn or look back
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline.

You took the words that were so cold,

We've let our hearts
Fall apart at the dreams

We could throw in the towel
Walk away with our pride
Say it just wasn't worth
All the tears that we cried

We might find the feeling

And the biscuits are better at Granny's house

'Cause we all know the baby will grow up with American pride
Yeah we work and we play and we have our own ways

Alabama,"They married back in '32
They were young and love was new
And every day the feeling grew
Between the two of them
When work grew scarce and times got bad
The hope would chase away the sad
And hope was sometimes all they had
Between the two of them
The 40's came and the 50's went
And the mortgage replaced the rent
They made the most of each day spent
Between the two of them
Their children all turned out just fine
So he retired in '69
And left with oh so little time
Between the two of them
Today I brave the graveyard rain
And placed a rose between their names
Now that's the most that ever came

When you hold your first born tenderly against your chest

And through the innocence you see
The value of a family
And you feel a special bond

To lend a helping hand
A phone call from a friend

At the dark end of the road

And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope

Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

They wear so many faces, show up in the strangest places
To grace us with their mercy, in our time of need

Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

To guide us with the light of love

Alabama,"You're still the lady of my dreams
You're still my high school beauty queen

Still the leading lady in my scenes

To me it's still magic when we touch
And I've still never loved someone so much

Alabama,"Somewhere in the mountains...in northern Alabama
The Carolina lady waits for her man from Tennessee
Somewhere in a motel...out in Oklahoma
There's the Alabama dreamer
That same man from Tennessee

Sometime late at night...the lonely wakes her gently
And knocks at her door...but she won't give in
But like every other woman...she needs to feel wanted
She thinks of making love...and goes to sleep again

Carolina...dreamin' lonely
Carolina...can't you see
You will always be the lady...
That I dream of holding tight...
That I kiss and tell goodnight...
Carolina...mountain dew

Sometime that next day...on a Mississippi freeway
The Alabama dreamer...is homeward bound
His conscious is as clear...as those green eyes of Carolina
And she's waiting with the baby from the love...of the only man to lay her down

Carolina...dreaming lonely
Carolina...can't you see
You will always be the lady
That I dream of holding tight
That I kiss and tell goodnight

Alabama,"My dad was a big man with a will that was tough
He was at his best when the going was rough
He made a living for the family and never had to cheat
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet

We sat down at the table and thanked god in prayer
Cause we had plenty to eat and plenty to wear
We had patches on our britches but momma kept us neat
We had food on the table and shoes on our feet

We picked the cotton and gathered the corn
We were taught to work from the day we were born
Mom and dad and all us children worked in the summer's heat
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet

Stole her heart many years ago
He promised her, he'd come back and take her
Around the world, bring her hills of gold

Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge
Down on Longboat Key
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key

She runs to meet them down at the pier
She sees the fishermen, the nets and the sunset
But she don't see him, her eyes fill with tears

She stands there lookin' at the crystal blue water
And in the coral she imagines pearls
She makes believe, he brought them all the way from China
Then the water swirls, the blue-green water swirls

Two hearts like tumbling dice
We've lost control of the way we feel

Old heartaches driving us crazy
Is it really different this time
We've come too far not to take a chance
And spin the wheel

Play our hearts on the line
Risk it all one more time
Let it all ride on the way we feel

This could be another broken heart
Or is it were true love starts
Only one way to find out if this thing is real
Just spin the wheel

Round and round our dreams are rollin?
Will they land on lover goodbye
My heart?s on you head over heels

All I know is when I told you
Love is worth any chance we take
Baby let's left the chips fall were they make
And spin the wheel

Meant more to him than me
On the day I turned sixteen
He threw me the keys
Said I was young once too, I was young once too

I'm older than that now
I hope I measure up to him
When the circle comes around

Were losing faith and close to giving up

Prayed as they kept vigil day and night

Saddened by the twelve who lives were taken

But also thankful one made it out alive

One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark

It only takes one life to make a miracle

For the Savior they were told would come

Then on that winter night there in a manger

Oh, John Dillon James was my good time country buddy

Well, we hunted, talked and fished his last days away

He was just a hired farm hand, worked old man Walker's land

Retired on his 68th birthday

Yeah, he wore a size sixteen shoe, had skin like alligator

Lord, he could pick up a deer and walk right out of those woods

Old Dillon had a million tales but he sung me one refrain

And I recall that song by John Dillon James


One July Monday morning I met him at the fishing hole

But old Dillon wasn't toting his half pint of tin hide

His roll your own tobacco string was a-hanging from his pocket

His eyes were red as beets, looked like he cried

And I know he sat on knees cause his overalls were muddy

But my ten year old mind didn't understand

He sat down on the bank and wrote this four line refrain

And I recall that song by John Dillon James


Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky

I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly

Paid the price down on my knees

A voice from heaven promised me

I got my ticket for the ride in the sky


Well, it was one year to the day on a July Monday morning

I waited at the fishing hole but old Dillon, he didn't show

Daddy came down about noon, and said

Son, I've got some news

Lord's rested old Dillon's soul

Yeah, and I walked up to his bedside

Looked down at old big Dillon

Lord knows that I saw a pair of wings

That tables set but I felt good, for at last I understood

That refrain sung by John Dillon James


Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky, Lord, y'all

I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly)

Come home, come home, it's suppertime

When Mama used to call out from the back steps
To the old home place, ""Come on home, son, it's suppertime""

Oh, how I'd love to hear those words once more
But you know for me, time is woven in the realization of the truth
That's even more thrilling
And that's when the call comes from the portals of glory
To come on home, it's suppertime

""Come home, come home, it's suppertime
The shadow's lengthen fast
Come home, come home, it's suppertime

There’s a strip mall round the corner, Lease signs in every window
All Americans

There’s a strip mall round the corner, Lease signs in every window
And fear in almost all my neighbors’ eyes
There’s a disconnect between the politicians and the people
We know half the time their gonna lie
Aren’t we all on the same side?

There’s no us and there’s no them were all out there on a limb
There’s no Kings and there’s no Queens just a pot of melted dreams
What makes us so quick to fight no one wants to compromise
Sometimes its all so hard to understand. Aren’t we all Americans?

We can’t agree on nothing even as our country's hanging in the balance by a thread
There’s bonuses for bosses and bankers hiding losses while our leaders
Close their eyes and turn their heads
Aren’t we all on the same side

What if my sons class was closing down, by brothers house the bank sold out, 
My father’s farm we could not save. 
My mother lost her job today
My wife just said tuitions more another year we can’t afford 
So my Daughters dropping out of school if this was me what would I do?

There’s no us and there’s no them were all out there on a limb
There’s no Kings and there’s no Queens just a pot of melted dreams
What makes us so quick to fight 
No one wants to compromise for some time its all so hard to understand

Aren’t we all Americans",All American
Alabama,"I once thought of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be
But long ago I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy free
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time
I never thought that I would get caught
It seemed like a perfect crime

Baby, you left me defenseless
I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty of love in the first degree

I thought it would be so simple
Like a thousand times before
I take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door
Now babe I'm not begging for mercy
Go ahead and throw the book at me
If loving you's a crime
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be

Baby, you left me defenseless
I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty of love in the first degree

Okay then, wha— wha— what'd he say? There only one way you can bring about a revolution for people. 

Only way you can— only way you can bring it on, that by— is by killing. 

Well, what— yes, that's okay, I'm going to let you pass it —but what'd he say? He had a nice little phrase that everybody should know. “Change only comes—”

Oh—

You got it. “Change comes through…”

“—through— by a barrel of gun.”

That's right, senior. And that's good. ‘Cos you by rights would have every reason to forget some things. “Change must come through the barrel of gun,” said Mao Tse Tung. This place would be a paradise tomorrow if every department had a supervisor with a submachine gun. 

Let them hear it in the night! Yes, we'll fight! Let the night roar, because they can hear us, they know we mean it. We'll kill them if they come!

CHORUS",Mao Tse Tung Said
Alabama 3,"[For whatever reason you refuse to feel this space we're in, to know its insanity, really know it; whatever your particular anesthetic is, that you hold onto so desperate (the thing, I mean, that makes you think you know who you are); whatever that thing is you allow to keeps you sane, your ace in the hole, the psyche that keeps you trying to guess what your pimp has in store for you; whatever keeps you from screaming out at this very moment in absolute and sheer horror; whatever you fuck your brain with; whatever that isâ?? whatever that isâ?? it's a lie, it's a lie.]


She spends too much time with herself every night
Fooling around with her fears.
In the morning she mourns the decline of her mind
Drowning in a bottle of beer.
It's too dangerous just to think about what she might have been
If she'd sung for salvation, if she'd danced on her dreams.

But there's gonna be peace in the valley tomorrow
Lord, 'cos tonight she's gonna blow it all away
She feels so twisted, she ain't ever gonna fix it,
She's just waiting for the light to shine on a brand new day.

He don't know if he's a communist, a hedonist or a whore
Spent too much time ridin' on a white line to find the door
If he did and he opened it, he'd find those letters in the hall
He's too blind to read between the lines
'Cos the writing's on the wall.

But there's gonna be peace in the valley tomorrow
Lord, 'cos tonight he's gonna blow it all away
He feels so twisted, he ain't ever gonna fix it,
He's just waiting for the light to shine on a brand new day.

(Let that light shine awhile)

I got Ecstasy, but I need some company
You got that mystery; I need a plan
Lord, all I got is a compromise and a bag full of alibis
as empty as the bottle of whiskey in my shaking hands.

But there's gonna be peace in the valley tomorrow
Lord, 'cos tonight we're gonna blow it all away
We feel so fuckin' twisted, we ain't ever gonna fix it,
We're just waiting for the light to shine on a brand new day.",Peace in the Valley
Alabama 3,"You come home late and you come home early
You come on big when you're feeling small
You come home straight and you come home fucked up
Sometimes you don't come home at all

Chorus:
So what in the world's come over you
And what in heaven's name have you done
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run

Well I got a heart that burns with a fever
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
How can a love that'll last forever
Get left so far behind

Repeat Chorus:

It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
It's crossed the evil line today
Well, how can you ask about tomorrow
We ain't got one word to say

Repeat Chorus:

Ending:
You're out there running just to be on the run
You're out there running just to be on the run
You're out there running just to be on the run

Alabama 3,"Well, you woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun
Your mama always said you'd be the chosen one

She said, you're one in a million, you've got to burn to shine
But you were born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

And you woke up this morning
All that love had gone
Your papa never told you about right and wrong

But you're looking good, baby
I believe you're feeling fine (shame about it)
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

Because you woke up this morning 
Got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes

Well, you woke up this morning
The world turned upside down
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same since Howlin' Wolf walked into your town
But you're one in a million, you've got that shotgun shine
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes
You woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes

When you woke up this morning everything was gone 
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,
Like a voice trying to tell you there's something you should know 
Last night you were flying but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if you'll ever know 
The meaning of things as they appear to the others 
Wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers 
Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you didn't think beyond the next paycheck 
And the next little drink? 
Well, you do, so make up your mind to go on 'cause when you woke up this morning 
Everything you had was gone, everything you had was gone

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning, you want to be, you want to be the chosen one tonight
Yes, you know, because you just get help yourself

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
You got yourself a gun, got yourself a gun, got yourself a gun",Woke up This Morning (Y'all Gotta Come)
