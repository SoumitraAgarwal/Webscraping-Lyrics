Roscoe Dash,"How do you do the impossible
You got me so, deep deep in some type of feeling girl
And in the way I can describe, cause what I'm feeling yeah
But girl I'm feeling it, but girl I'm feeling so oh

It's been since last summer time, since you went away
Still got your pictures on my window pain
Long nights, in a daze
Still remember how we did everyday
Tell me, tell me, have you ever
Did it underwater
And let it air dry on the stairs
The stairs, the stairs, the stairs, the stairs
And someone tell me what’s the use for the bed
When you up in the air, the air, the air
I think she’s far from what I’m used to
I’m lucky, it feels like holy revival
When she suck me
Pretty lips, pretty lips, pretty lips, pretty lips
All over me
We had champagne, champagne
We don’t need a glass, we tired of being sober
She took the whole thang, she took the whole thang
And now I’m asking, is you straight
She said yeah quit talking boy switch up your tempo
She had her right backs, I'm the King Sacramento
And she loves it, she loves it, she loves it
When I stand up in that thang
Yeah got her saying
Now she saying

How do you do the impossible
You got me so, deep deep in some type of feeling girl
And in the way I can describe, cause what I'm feeling yeah
But girl I'm feeling it, but girl I'm feeling so oh X2

Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do oh
Do do do, do do do do do-do do do oh
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do oh
Do do do, do do do, do do do ohhh

How do you do the impossible
You got me so, deep deep in some type of feeling girl
And in the way I can describe, cause what I'm feeling yeah
But girl I'm feeling it, but girl I'm feeling so ohhhh 

How do you do the impossible
You got me so, deep deep in some type of feeling girl
And in the way I can describe, cause what I'm feeling yeah
But girl I'm feeling it, but girl I'm feeling so ohhhh",The Impossible
Roscoe Dash,"She got pictures of her last man, all in her trash can
She focus just hopeless, you too much like her past and
She in a mind state where her grind rate
Sets her apart from all the live bait
She makes her own joke, she extraordinary
And those hips and thighs you dream about she more than carries
Pills and berries can't describe how she measures up
She’s a dime, that describes why she acting up

She acting all sidity its cause she know she’s bad
She makes her own money, spend it like she never had
Shes way too smart for scheming, she got too much class
So when she in the room, she got it on smash
Girl, I want it, girl I want it
You got my attention, you got my attention
You got it flauntin', you got it flauntin'
You got me wishing, you got me wishing
I can have it all, baby just for one night
Need another nigga feeling your type
Know you want it, yeah, yeah
(B.I.G. Sean Don, Do it)
(Iight here we go)
(You Crazy)

I'm in here with my crew yelling fuck these other niggas
I did search around the city, can’t nobody do it bigger
Poppin' bottles errday errday that’s my prescription
Getting paper errday errday, that’s my subscription
Its a fuck everybody in the world kind of day everything gold, cause I’m that kinda paid
That’s the girl you wifen' nigga what you’re trying to say
She cute like I might fuck on wednesday when I'm high kind of way
Damn a nigga made it, me and my niggas made it
Yeah I know you’ve seen me on, and she reppin' Finally Famous
Me and my crew round me paid, like getting rich contagious
That’s why Ms. Sophisticated dancin' 'round like she in cages woah (Do It)
Twisting up my fingers and weed, hands flipping through the paper like my fingers could read
All my, All my music knocking like bitch its police
Snatching bottles out her hand like bitch this shits for me
Like What'chu Doing

She acting all sidity (Yea I Do It) its cause she know she’s bad
She makes her own money, spend it like she never had
Shes way too smart for scheming, (And I might run through It) she got too much class
So when she in the room, (Cause that's a Detroit nigga Do It) she got it on smash
Girl, I want it, girl I want it
You got my attention, you got my attention
You got it flauntin', you got it flauntin'
You got me wishing, you got me wishing

Need another nigga feeling your type
Know you want it, yeah, yeah

I think I know what it is, yeah!
See it, see!
Lehhh go
They can't understand it you bama niggas been actin frantic
You manage to leave them stranded, well mannered and rubber band it
Up Up and when I look up well there you are
You a star with a car, I'm in love, go cigar??
You deserve it, stop in the mall lil' intercourse and movies
Probably end all your nights with champagne, and Jacuzzi
Celebrating the life, you work hard for and I approving
Girl, you’re one of a kind, and your kind is so seducing!
She lead by example, like its her duty, she got him at a standstill
Well how she do it, independent than a muhhh
But that muhh got her stupid
She probably following love, if she ever got to knew me

She acting all sidity its cause she know she’s bad
She makes her own money, spend it like she never had
Girl, I want it, girl I want it
You got my attention, you got my attention

Roscoe Holcomb,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues

Rose Banks,"Darling, baby
Life is so lonely without you
Life is so lonely without you
Since you left these arms of mine

I've been alone, trying
Wondering why you left me behind

Darling, baby
Can't carry on since you've been gone
Why don't you please
Please, come on home

Let's talk it over
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Let's talk it over one more time

Oh, so many nights
I wondered whose holding you tight
Can't help but feel it should be me
Oh, it should be me
Cause I'm forever losing sleep at night

No
Took me a while just to tell you the truth
I've been saving it up

No more time
If my face gives away I'm confused

Carry a sigh on your head and you paint on your frown could I love you instead

I'll give you a chance if you leave one to me

Rose Bonanza,"When mistletoe and tinsel glow
Paint a yuletide valentine
Back home i go to those i know
For a christmas auld lang syne

And as we gather 'round the tree
Our voices all combine
In sweet accord to thank our lord
For a christmas auld lang syne

When sleigh bells ring and choirs sing
And the children's faces shine
With each new toy we share their joy
With a christmas auld lang syne

We sing his praise this day of days
And pray next year this time
We'll all be near to share the cheer
Of a christmas auld lang syne

In sweet accord to thank our lord
For a christmas auld lang syne",Christmas Auld Lang Syne
Rose Bonanza,"Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way, he's filled his sleigh
With things, things for you and for me

It's that time of year when the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas, may your New Year dreams come true
And this song of mine in three quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing too

Rose Bonanza,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

Well, I'm feelin', mighty fine, I got good music on my radio
Well, I feel so fine, I got good music on my radio
Yes, I want to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe

I will always love you baby
Now I'm happy as I can be","Merry Christmas, Baby"

Rose Bonanza,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Rose Bonanza,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine",The Best Is Yet to Come
Rose Bonanza,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Rose Bonanza,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Rose Bonanza,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Rose Bonanza,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, I do love you""

I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart",Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart
Rose Cora Perry,"Left here to contemplate 
what the poets really mean 
When they spout their sonnets 
About love, hate, and everything in between 

My tears cried and cried 
Though they don’t mean a thing 
All that’s left is the music sprung 
from consequence of these dreams 
How I want just to see the end of bad things","Love, Hate, & Everything in Between"
Rose Falcon,"The wind is whispering in my ear
The clock is ticking can you hear
The clouds are rolling by

How could anybody die
Beneath this periwinkle sky
I was too young to know her then
She would have been my friend
My best friend

The sun is shinning on my face
The world is such a pretty place
Bees and Butterflies

How could anybody cry
Wish that I could have said goodbye
If I could see her again
She would be my friend
My best friend

All I have is photographs
Put on her wedding ring
Put in a tape of lullabies
The ones she used to sing to
To me
Don't cry
Baby

How could anybody die
Beneath this periwinkle sky
I was too young to know her then

A finger painting left out in the pouring rain
Sweet words whispered on a subway train
Wasted and lost in the noise
Beautiful
Breakable
Like a butterfly in an angry world

She lies wide awake hearing their screams
When the front door slams she don't know what it means
Though she shuts her eyes the tears still stream
Wasted and lost in all the noise
Beautiful

Rose Falcon,"You answered the phone hello
I said guess who but you didn't know
Doesn't it strike you as strange
It's only been a year but so much has changed
We'd sneak up on your rooftop
cigarettes and secrets
You're the only one I told because I trusted you to keep it

Remember we were innocent
Sunshine in your eyes
Tell me you remember when our bicycles could fly
Innocent

I miss having somebody to call
When there's something to say or nothing at all
Everyone asks if it's true the rumors they heard about you
They say that you got married and you're having a baby
I don't know how to answer shrug my shoulders and say maybe

Remember we were innocent
The world turns time goes by
Everytime I hear our song oh
I can't help but cry

I'll keep you in my prayers I know that you'll be ok

Rose Falcon,"See it on TV
In my magazines
See it everywhere I look
Even in my dreams
I can't sleep for dreaming

See it on a billboard
Pasted in the sky
Inside of my eyelids
When I close my eyes
I can't sleep for screaming

Telling me what I should try
Telling me what I should buy
No matter what I do it's never good enough

And the winner lives
It's a lowdown!

I fight this chip on my shoulder

And my women
Spend my money if I lose my aim

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

She was frail and she was old
She gave a gift to me

A seed, a tiny seed she gave to me
And told me plant it, you will see
It will give all you need

O Spirit Tree, see how it grows high now
O mystery, the gift she gave to me
I eat your fruit, you shelter me now I see
O spirit tree, you are a mystery

So now, it grows there by the open road
A tree with branches knarled and old
And leaves that shine like gold
And there, beneath the ground you cannot see
The twisted roots of that old tree
Reach for eternity

From side to side, is that right?

Then there's the disco craze
That's got the world partying for days

Is a thing called funk

Rose Royce,"A-one more time
Hey, yeah
I got a message for you

What's the sense in runnin'?
You can't get away
Go back to bed, pull the covers over your head
That will make your problems go away

Tell me, why do you try
To hide in a bottle?
Since when has drinkin' helped your thinkin'?
Think about it

You can't run from yourself
It's an impossibility
You can't run from yourself
Face up to reality

Do you not like who you are?
Did I hear you say you wish you were a star?
Well, stars have problems too
The same as me and you

So climb into your smoke
Ha, ha, that's a joke
'Cause when that air clears
Your problems will still be there

You can't run from yourself
It's an impossibility
You can't run from yourself
Face up to reality

Come on with it
A-one more time
I wanna go higher

I'm just tellin' you the truth
Don't get me wrong
I do things too
Now listen

This is your life and time
Why must you be blind?
Stop takin' on losin' prescribed pills
They can't kill your ills

One pill takes you up
The other pill brings you down
Don't you think it's time, my friend
To get off that merry-go-round?
I'm with him

You can't run from yourself
It's an impossibility
You can't run from yourself
Face up to reality

You can't run from yourself
You can't run, you can't hide
You can't run from yourself
'Cause the problem lives inside

So I'm givin' it away
First come, first serve
And if it hurts your pride
Boy, you get what you deserve

Boy, tell the truth, did it ever occur to you
That I have wants, desires and needs too
While you were out there roamin' and homin' the streets
I sat home lonely, night after night, in desperate need, oh

First come, first serve
Hey, you don't want my love
So I'm givin' it away
First come, first serve
And if it hurts your pride
Boy, you get what you deserve, oh

Rose Royce,"I've sailed over the ocean, and I've traveled many lands
Even flown in the big bird in the sky looking down from heaven's den
And as I go from town to town drifting like the wind
Loneliness is my company and hope is my friend

And I wonder where you are tonight

They said you wanted to be a star and see the big city lights
So you jumped in the car with your guitar, promised you're always right
I hear your songs on the radio, your big publicity
And all that we had, boy, is drifting in the wind

And I wonder where you are tonight

Wish I never said goodbye
I just can't stand these lonely, lonely nights
Sometimes I break down and I cry
I'm just drifting in the wind, looking for a friend

Sailed over the ocean and I've traveled many, many lands
No matter how far I try to slip away, my heart just won't let me win
All those memory of you and me just linger in my mind
And I, I just can't forget you, boy, and this feeling we left behind

And I wonder where you are tonight

Baby, baby, I wonder where you are tonight
I wonder where you are tonight
Sometimes I break down and cry
I wish you'd never said goodbye
How I wonder, ooh I wonder

That some new war has begun
And it's so sad thinking that desperate men
Gotta make their way with a gun

Bending mind body and limb
And although it's cruel, we'd all be fools
If we thought we'd have to give in

Well I know there's no use sittin' around
Cryin' over what's been done
Because there's no solution, and givin' up now
The race can still be won

And with a little hard work and determination
You know that you're gonna pull through
So don't ask for nothin', don't look to no one

I only have to close my eyes and you are back to stay.
I just close my eyes,
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone, and this heart of mine sings.

Yes, I love you so,
And that for me is all I need to know.

Till the sun falls from out the sky, for what else can I do?

If we had the chance to do it all again

The self deception - that believes the lie

The faint aroma - of performing seals
The double-crossing - of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

Now I'm all there (now) - but I'd rather be punch-drunk

Rosemary Clooney,"
Summer journeys to Niag'ra
And to other places aggra-
vate all our cares.
We'll save our fares;

I've a cozy little flat in
What is known as old Manhattan,
We'll settle down
Right here in town.

CHORUS 1

We'll have Manhattan,
The Bronx and Staten
Island too.
It's lovely going through the Zoo.

It's very fancy
On old Delancey
Street you know.
The subway charms us so,
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro.

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by.

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 2

We'll go to Greenwich,
Where modern men itch
To be free,
And Bowling Green you'll see with me.

We'll bathe at Brighton,
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in,
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin,

Fin to fin.

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica
Bay with you,
And fair Canarsie's Lakes we'll view.

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 3

We'll go to Yonkers,
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear, in Childs'.

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny
On a roll,
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole,
Soul to soul.

And South Pacific
Is a terrific
Show they say,
We both may see it close some day.

The city's clamour can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 4

We'll have Manhattan,
The Bronx and Staten
Island too,
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue.

As black as onyx
We'll find the Bronix
Park Express,
Our Flatbush flat, I guess,
Will be a great success,
More or less.

A short vacation
On Inspiration
Point we'll spend,
And in the station house we'll end.

But Civic Virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy!

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.

Rosemary Clooney,"Since I took a left and moved out to the coast
From time to time I find myself engrossed
With other erstwhile denizens of the Apple

While we sit around and take L.A. to task
There's a question someone's bound to ask
And with this complex matter we must grapple

Do you miss New York? The anger, the action
Does your laid back lifestyle
Lack a certain satisfaction?

Do you ever burn to pack up and return
To the thick of it, or are you really sick of it?
As you always say

Do you miss the pace? The rat race, a racket
If you had to face it now
Do you still think you could hack it?

When you're back in town for a quick look around
How is it? Does it seem like home
Or just another nice place to visit?

And were those halcyon days
Just a youthful phase you outgrew?
Tell me, do you miss New York?
Do you miss New York?

Do you miss the strain, the traffic, the tension?
Do you view your new terrain
With a touch of condescension on this quiet street?

Is it really as sweet as it seems out here?
Do you dream your dreams out here or is that passé?
Do you miss the scene? The frenzy, the faces

And did you trade the whole parade
For a pair of parking places?
If you had the choice would you still choose to do it all again?

Do you find yourself standing in line to see Annie Hall again?
And do you ever run into that someone who used to be you?
Tell me, do you miss New York? Me too

And they become memories that vaporize
And the vapor becomes the dreams we devise
And while we are dreaming time flies

Night turns to dawn and dreams to sighs
And sighs change to sweet love that never dies
And love becomes laughter and lullabies
And while we are dreaming time flies

While we are dreaming we meet and exchange
Conversations routinely and nothing seems strange
But when we awake there's a sense of unease
That another night's gone just as quick as you please

Night turns to dawn and then to bright skies
And bright skies to picnics on warm Julys
To deep umber autumns and winter goodbyes
And while we are dreaming time flies
While we are dreaming time flies

Gives cause for apprehension
With speed and new invention
And things like fourth dimension
Yet we get a trifle weary
With Mr. Einstein's thory
So we must get down to earth at times
Relax relieve the tension
And no matter what the progress
Or what may yet be proved
The simple facts of life are such
They cannot be removed

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

Well, it's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Oh yes, the world will always welcome lovers

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

We had a way of making Christmas morning

Who now have children of their own
Funny, but comes December
And I remember every Christmas I've known

And treats them accordingly.

So don't wait 'til the night before Christmas

Santa Claus has a big book
That helps him to remember,
He can tell each kid the things they did
From January to December.
Jingle bells never jingle
For the very bad ones.
Every Christmas Day, the good are gay
And the bad ones are the sad ones.

Look out Mister Dove when she draws a bead on you

I sat down on a log, took her on my lap
She said, ""Wait a minute, bub, you got to see my Pap
He's got a sixteen-gauge choked down like a rifle
He don't like a man that's a-gonna trifle"" 
Shotgun Boogie, draws a bead so fine 
Look out big boy, he's loaded all the time

Well, I called on her Pap like a gentleman oughta
He said: ""No brush hunter's gonna get my daughter""
He cocked back the hammer right on the spot
When the gun went off, I outran the shot

Pay no heed what they say
Let your eyes sparkle and shine

If they knew all about you
They'd end up loving you, too

What they'd give just for the right to hold you

From your hair down to your toes

Rosemary Clooney,"I'm all worried I'm upset
I just heard the worst news yet
Some old fogey wants to ration swing
Says your psyche won't survive

If you dance to that jump and jive
I can't help it if I shout and sing
They can take away my breakfast
They can take away my lunch

But there's just one thing
That they can't take
That's the rhythm of the swing band bunch
I like my music

And I like it high
If I try to shake it down
Then I just wanna die
What's this talk about waltzes

Taking the place of swing
I don't like waltzes
If they cancel my soap operas
I'll make it through

They can take away most anything
But if swing goes I go too
Some think rappin' is racy
It makes them lose their minds

Me, I'll stick with Basie
They can take away the polka
That dance I'll never do
They can take away most anything

Anything and everything
But if swing goes I go too","If Swing Goes, I Go Too"

Rosemary Clooney,"Now, once upon a time, in a neat little cottage
There lived three bears
One was a daddy bear and one was a mamma bear
And one was a wee bear
One day when out walking
In the deep woods was stalking
Came a little gal with blonde hair

Now, her name was Goldilocks
And upon their door she knocked
But no one was there
So she walked right in and had herself a time
'Cause she didn't care
Soon she got sleepy, went to bed upstairs, when

Home, home, home came the three bears
Someone's been eating my porridge
Said the daddy bear
Someone's been eating my porridge
Said the mamma bear
Hey-bubba-rebear, said the little wee bear
Who's broken my chair?

Someone's been sleeping in my bed, said the daddy bear
Oh, someone's been sleeping in my bed, said the mamma bear
Bear-bubba-rebear, said the little wee bear
Who's broken my chair?

Just then, Goldilocks woke up
Broke up the party and beat it out there
Bye-bye, bye, bye, said the daddy bear
Goodbye, bye, said the mamma bear
Hey bubba-rebear, said the wee bear
So ends the story of the three bears

Such pride inside me has woken,
I'll try my best not to cry,

And in some far distant region,
Where human hearts are staunch and true,
I shall start my life anew.

I sought a foreign clime,
Where I may find
there are hearts more kind
Than I leave behind.
And so, I go,
To fight a savage foe,

I'll be sometimes missed by the girls I've kissed.
In some Abyssinian French Dominion

Build him cradles while I'm pecking at his cheek

I will cling to the old rugged cross,

Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,

Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

And Lord, how slow the moments go and all I do is pour
Black coffee    since the blues caught my eye;
I'm hangin' out on Monday   my Sunday dreams to dry.

Now man is born to come a-lovin',
And a woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And down her past regrets in coffee and cigarettes.

And in between it's nicotine and not much heart to fight.

And best of them all

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

Dangerous rhythm.
It's something daring, The Continental,
A way of dancing that's really 'entre nous'.
It's very subtle, The Continental,
Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,
An invitation to moonlight and romance.

It's quite the fashion, The Continental,
Because you tell of your love while you dance.
Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.
Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.
You kiss while you're dancing.

Not a bad idea. 

The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental.
You sing while you're dancing.
Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.

A certain rhythm that you can't control,
And you will do

Rosemary Clooney,"Mommy told me something a little girl should know
It's all about the Devil and I've learned to hate him so
She says he causes trouble when you let him in the room
He will never ever leave you if your heart is filled with gloom

So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

When you are unhappy, the Devil wears a grin
But oh, he starts a-running when the light comes pouring in
I know he'll be unhappy 'cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling he'll get tired of hangin' around

So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

If I forget to say my prayers the Devil jumps with glee
But he feels so awful, awful, when he sees me on my knees
So if you're full of trouble and you never seem to win
Just open up your heart and let the sun shine in

Rosemary Clooney,"Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
All the stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hope that Saint Niccholas soon would be there.
Then, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
A miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted “On Dasher” and each reindeer's name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stocking, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
Then giving a nod up the chimney he rose.
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight,
“Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!”

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

Und ich dreh mich ganz sicher nicht um
Ich bleibe stark und ich weiß auch wie
Ich glaube an Energie

E für Ekstase und Exzentrik
N für ein Nein und nicht so schwer
E für egal und eigentümlich
R für Ruhe, raus ans Meer
G für gelassen und gespannt
I für Irrtum, Idiotie
E für Euphorie erleben

Ain't no valley low enough,

No matter how far;
Just call my name; I'll be there in a hurry;

You were ugly then, but now you're so beautiful

In this frame of mind
And I, I wanna be beautiful in somebody's eyes
Like it was when you loved, you loved me
You loved me so never let go off me

And why should I think things any different
It's always the same, how can I blame you?

When I'm in this frame of mind
And I, I wanna feel beautiful, deep inside
Like it was when you loved, you were loving me
You were loving me so never let go off me
[Incomprehensible]

I'm tired, and so lazy
It's been so long on my own
I'm so tired and lackadaisical
I don't like to be alone

I want to be sweet, want to be powerful
Empty and free from all the things that keep me

In this frame of mind
And I, I wanna be beautiful all the time
Then no one can take that, take that from me

I wanna be beautiful all the time
Then no one will take that, take that from me

Oh so beautiful, I know I will be
And no one can take that from me

Rosey,"Cozy is a woman now, but she wants to be a girl again
She don't care for all the people who tell her
She should be the way that they think it is

She don't see them, she got better things to do with her eyes
And no, she don't even need them 'cause it's better
It so much better right here inside
When you stop looking for something, something you'll never find

Lemon is a girl again, she don't care what all the people say
She got ribbons in her hair today, she walks around just like she is it
And she don't see them, she got better things to do
With her blue, blue eyes

And no, she don't even believe them, it's better
It so much better right here inside
When you stop looking for something, something you'll never find
When looking for something, something you'll never find

And no, she ain't got no money to spend
And no fancy threads she shows off in
And ain't got no man, but she's all right
Man she's outta sight

Cozy know she's better 'cause she's built her house
Right where she stands, she got big crops and no locks
See the sun it shines down on everything

She ain't got no money to spend
And no fancy threads to walk around in
And no one to love her, but it's all right
When you got it inside

Stop looking for something, something you'll never find
No, no more looking for something
Something you'll never find, you're just fine, fine, fine
Looking for something, something you'll never find

Rosey,"Looking for home, looking for a corner
Where I can write alone, words for my mother
And how I came through, kicking and screaming
Smack that little ass doctor, make sure baby feels it

Daddy wonders if she'll ever wake from her dream of
Big bright stars, and she wants to be the biggest one
Look at our baby there, up on the stage
Come back baby come, back home to me

If I could I'd tell you when I'm coming back again
I wish I could tell you, I was coming back again
If I could I'd tell you when I'm coming back again
I wish I could tell you I was coming
If I can ever come back again

Dirty child, cover your black eyes
We'll feed you water and fix you up inside
We'll hide you here and get you out of that dirty business
Those damn fools they nearly took our baby from us

Daddy wonders if she'll ever wake from her dreams of
Big bright stars, and she wants to be the biggest one
Look at our baby there, up on the stage
Come back baby come, back home to me

If I could tell you I was coming back again
I wish I could tell you I'm coming back again
If I could I'd tell you when I'm coming back again
I wish I could tell you I'm coming
If I can ever come back again

You can't make it go, you can't make it stop
And you can't put out a fire, if it's burning hot!

Daddy tell me, if I'll ever wake from this dream of
Big bright stars and I wanna to be the biggest
Take a look at your baby, ain't she pretty on the stage
Come back baby, come back home to me

I wish I could come back again

If I could tell you I'm coming back again
I would tell you I'm coming back

Rosicrucian,"Dying to see, but I am blind
I've been forced to watch them chime
Looking at myself, all left behind
Uncontrolled magic seeking crime
I know this now, it's too late to find
Running around and losing time
Down a one way street, against mankind
You'll never know about my prime

Twice in the age of the one
Laying blackout undeer the sun
Forced to be, nowhere to run
It's time for you to make it undone

Parts, parts of me
Deep urge to be free
Who will I be
When I free these parts of me

Blistering image, an impact on my eyes
Put my hand up to block the light
See them say their pray for lice
Human body in the cold of the might

Accused of nail holes in my hands
Watch as the world comes to the turn
Set me on the royal stands
If you don't know why now, you'll never learn

Once in the age of the dun
Laying blackout under the gun
Forced to see, the war is now won
It's time for you to see what's begun

Parts, parts of me
Deep urge to be free
Who will I be
When I free these parts of me

Deny your god in heaven
My only son
Preach and sell
You're the one

The house of the fools
You look around
You've got no eyes
I can't be found

Ticking slow and hard you're in pain

So burning and frozen, it's so clear

The emptiness is blinding me, I can't longer see
A silent war based on the rage within
No one can see it boiling under my sign
Every step is a burden
Every breath is in pain
Life's bitter poison, pumping through my veins
Luck has run out and I can't break the chains

Left out in the cold, who will ever
Know what has been told, it's gone forever

Again kicked back in the great maze
When I think I've made it
Hysterically hallucinating through the endless haze

I wish that this was a dream
The reality is not what it seems
I meet my savior with a scream
Feeling the stench of life

I have no conscious, I can't feel no guilt
I can't care less about the things that were built
I'm sitting alone watching my life go by
When surrounded by leaches there is no use to try
Every second is like a life time
Every effort without no gain
Life's bitter poison, pumping through my veins
Luck has run out and I can't break the chains

Left out in the cold, who will ever

I cannot trust the words that you say
Are they just not the signs of your greed

I believed in your soul and the things that you said
But the memories are all turning grey
I got no feelings left, you think I'm misled
But it's only yourself that you've betrayed

Cutting deep into your back

You are too lost to find the only way
Through the tunnel of lust you run with your burden
You think you're god - but it's me you must obey

Beware my foolish heart

Will come back to me

If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you

And no hero out of books 
Is my man

He isn't good, he isn't true

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Rosie O'Donnell,"Deck the halls with boughs of holly
It's the season to be jolly
And be thankful for all that we have
All the lights and decorations

Put up in the anticipation
Of the joyful celebration
That's on its way
We're counting the days

'Til it's time for Christmas day
Oh and God bless us everyone
The good and the bad
The happy, the sad

Oh and God bless us everyone
Here's to family and friends
It's good to be here again
On the streets there's children laughing

People smile as they are passing
Christmas time is here, our waiting is done
Wishing it could last forever
Not just twelve days in December

Through the year let's try to remember
That special way
That everyone feels
It's the magic of Christmas day

Oh and God bless us everyone
The good and the bad
The happy, the sad
Oh and God bless us everyone

Here's to family and friends
It's good to be here again
So fill your heart with love and joy
And through the eyes of girls and boys

Share their wonder, live through their joy
It's easy to do, just open your heart
The spirit will come to you
Oh and God bless us everyone

The good and the bad
The happy, the sad
Oh and God bless us everyone
Here's to family and friends

It's good to be here again",Magic of Christmas Day (God Bless Us Everyone)
Rosie O'Donnell,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Rosie O'Donnell,"Oh yeah mmmhmmm

I was walking home on Christmas eve
The whole neighborhood was fast asleep
The snow was falling, coming down hard
The place looked like a picture post card

And when my house came into view
I noticed something up on the roof
You can't imagine my surprise
When I looked up and realized

It was Santa on the rooftop
And our house was Santa's first roof stop
The reindeer were quiet as a mouse
Didn't make a sound
Santa got ready to make his way down
He had one foot in the chimney
Destination our brand new Christmas tree
I knew everyone was gonna be shocked
When I told them I saw Santa on the rooftop

I tried to get home right away
But I was just a little too late
The gifts were laid out under the tree
But no sign of Mr. SC

I ran over to the fireplace
But there was nothing but an empty space
Got everybody up out of bed
Their eyes opened wide when I said

It was Santa on the rooftop
And our house was Santa's first roof stop
The reindeer were quiet as a mouse
Didn't make a sound
Santa got ready to make his way down
He had one foot in the chimney
Destination our brand new Christmas tree
I knew everyone was gonna be shocked
When I told them I saw Santa on the rooftop

Some people think the man's a myth
I had my doubts, I admit
They'll laugh and criticize
When somebody says with that look in their eyes

It was Santa on the rooftop
And our house was Santa's first roof stop
The reindeer were quiet as a mouse
Didn't make a sound
Santa got ready to make his way down
One foot in the chimney
Destination our brand new Christmas tree yeah
I knew everyone was gonna be shocked
When I told them I saw Santa on the rooftop

Oh yeah 
When I told them I saw Santa on the rooftop
Whoa
When I said I saw Santa on the rooftop
I saw Santa

Hello Mr. Saint Nick (Santa on the rooftop)
Why don't you come on down and gimme some ho ho ho (I saw Santa)

 In the lane, snow is glistening

 Gone away, is the bluebird
 Here to stay, is a new bird
 He sings a love song, as we go along
 Walking in a winter wonderland

 In the meadow we can build a snowman
 And pretend that he is Parson Brown
 He'll say are you married? We'll say ""No man
 But you can do the job when you're in town""

 Later on, we'll conspire
 As we dream, by the fire
 To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
 Walking in a winter wonderland

 In the meadow we can build a snowman
 And pretend that he's a circus clown
 We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
 Until the other kids come knock him down

 When your nose, gets to chilling

My heart was just half full
I'd never known the fruit which fed the soul
But now I see what may put to rest my longing

[Chorus]
For I have seen, the face of love
The grace of God, the face of love
   
In silence I feared my heart
Would remain words unheard
Inside a separate mess of skin
But now I know that the skin just veils the soul
   
[Chorus]
   
So take my hand and knowing
With it I also give my heart
Wanting to never be separate again
Let eternity begin
   
If you were flame
I'd allow myself to be consumed completely
Were you wind I'd wish you to pass through me
But now I know that the skin just veils the soul

Rosie O'Donnell,"In the middle of a forest 
There's a clearing by a stream 
Where a mother holds her newborn 
And the child begins to dream 

And he dreams of hopes unspoken 
When the tears of man will cease 
And his mother holds him closer 
For he is the Prince of peace 

And the moon is looking downward 
Casting shadows through the trees 
And the stars are shining brighter 
As they whisper what they see 

How the emperor and the pauper 
With the lion and the lamb 
Kneel down before the infant 
For his peace they understand 

Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 
Peace on earth and mercy mild 
God and sinners reconciled 
Glory all ye nations rise 
Join the triumph of the skies 

With the heavenly host proclaim 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 
Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 

Let the bells ring out these tidings 
Let it echo across the land 
That a king is born in Bethlehem 
And his kingdom is at hand 

Let the world rejoice together 
As it looks upon the stars 
Knowing every man's our brother 
And that every child is ours 

As he flew o'er Sarajevo 
There were scars upon the land 
There were scars upon the people 
It was hard to understand 

And the deepest scars of all 
Which to humans are unseen 
But the angel could see clearly 
Were the scars upon the dreams 

Like Belfast and Burundi 
Rwanda, Palestine 
The only decorations here 
Had been awarded for their crimes 

And in gardens where the children played 
Now soldiers only trod 
And stranger still, he heard some say 
That they were killing for their god 

Now the angel heard god speak many times 
And he had always paid attention 
But this killing of ones neighbor 
Was something the Lord had never mentioned 

But as he neared the earth 
Of a recent battleground 
From among the ruins 
He once more heard the sound 

It was a single cello playing 
A forgotten Christmas song 
And even on that battlefield 
The song somehow belonged 

And as he flew away 
The angel did take note 
That where he found this music played 
One always could find hope",The Prince of Peace
Rosie O'Donnell,"

Dressed in holiday style 
In the air 
There's a feeling of Christmas

People passing 
Meeting smile after smile

Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day 

Strings of street lights 
Even stop lights 
Blink a bright red and green 
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures

See the kids bunch 
This is Santa's big day

All the way to New York City
We could get an apartment there
Be closer to our families

We can take my station wagon
And fill it to the brim
And wave goodbye to all our lovely friends
Never to return again

You could write for picture shows
And I could get a job
Waiting tables at a restaurant
Where famous people like to go

We could buy old overcoats
And walk through the snow
All the way around Central Park
Our cheeks as pink as wild roses

We could take the subway home
And stare at our reflections
In the window panes of the train
And see how much New York has changed us

Make me believe that my life is not migro

And to leave a woman from her heart
And if love would indeed all the things I'd believed
Then I guess I'll never feel alone

Oh, will I ever know

And if they said he never sleeps
Thus that mean that no one dreams
And if that's so then I guess I'm going home

So I can go on, I can go on with my life
Every time the wind blows stronger
I will feel my spirit rise

So I may go with you where ever you reside
Anytime the road looks dimmer
I will be your guiding light

All the sidewalks are white as snow
The buildings, all the people that pass me by

I took the train all the way to Brooklyn Heights
I remember when you took it there with me
We sat side by side and held hands for some time
We saluted the Statue of Liberty

I have much farther to go
Everything is new and so unpredictable
I should just kick my heels together and go home
But I'm not sure where that is anymore

Oh, how I wish I could go back in time
To the night when I heard my mother cry
She held me in her arms and we talked for some time
And I sang a song her mother sang to her and it goes

Something about paper dolls and what men prefer
Something about the cross and how her Jesus died for her
Something about love and how the truth fighting for
I wonder does love like that exist anymore?

And I, I have much farther to go
And I, I'm so confused I know
I should just kick my heels together and go home
But I lost my way when I lost you

Sometimes I cry when it's late at night
And you're not there to lay next to me
Morning breaks and the sun warms my face

Di desiderio e di attesa
A farci brillare gli occhi
Di quella luce così vera
E a sussurrare parole
Al fuoco dell'intesa

When madness is normality

Races are here to stay

[Chorus]
Nazis were too weak to see
Richness of colours of skins
Today's ways to purify
Is close to their main themes

Races are here to stay

Purification of genes
Insanity of the rich
They'll pass forward a feeble mind
And a genetic disease

[Chorus]

[4x:]
There's only one colour,
The colour of human skin
Different shades of darkness
Are frightening only the weak",The Weak
Rotten Sound,"Freedom of speech cannot be heard
Freedom of thoughts in our heads
No one can keep our privacy
No one can help us to escape

We all live in this sickness, it stinks, but no complaints
Sucking our nature dry, creating a void and misery
Illusion of democracy chewed and swallowed easily
Twisted society has tricked all of us into this madness

Freedom of kids living on the streets
Freedom of men working on the fields
No one can take that away from them
No one, except for the western cancer

Turning them into arrogant bastards,
Feeding the greed of their invented needs
Disease of violence and ignorance
Killing the innocence",Western Cancer
