Paulinho Lima,"I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feelin' for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then come on, oh come on
Let's get it on, oh baby
Let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on
Sugar, let's get it on

We're all sensitive people
With so much to give
Understand me, sugar
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come
On baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush

Gonna get it on, baby
I wanna get it on
You know what I'm talkin' about
Come on, baby
Let me groove ya
Get it on",Let's Get It On
Paulino Monroy,"¿Qué será? Que esa noche
Ya estaba ilusionada por venir a mi casa
Y de un vino a una balada
Un beso click, toco mi alma
Desde el suelo hasta mi cama
Dibujo el amor

Con alas, sus alas, mis alas

Y ¿que pasó? Al otro día
Llega vida, poseída, por su vida, por su voz, por su risa
Yo que nunca llevo prisa
Me calme mas cada día
Crece el mar y la manía
Por ver en su luz, infinita luz

¿Que será? que la miro y del mundo material
Así me olvido
Conexión espiritual
Tiene conmigo oh oh oh oh oh
Ella, conexión espiritual tiene conmigo

Hoy ya es y ella sabe
Eso explica todo el místico fulgor
Ni duda cabe la confianza mágica
La solución de las señales
Todas estas cosas bellas
Consecuencias son

Con alas, sus alas, mis alas

¿Qué pasará? Nadie lo sabe
Solo se que de decirlo
No sera algo que acabe
Con el místico fulgor de nuestra acción
La vida es clave
Y en un lapso de su historia
Un día nos junto, en infinita luz

¿Que será? Que la miro y del mundo material
Así me olvido
Conexión espiritual
Tiene conmigo oh oh oh oh oh

Ella, conexión espiritual tiene conmigo
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ella, conexión espiritual tiene conmigo

Laralaralalala
Conexión espiritual tiene conmigo, oh oh oh
Ella conexión espiritual tiene conmigo",Conexión Espiritual
Paulino Monroy,"Quiero el haz
En el fil de la manga
Quiero paz
En un surco de mi alma
Quiero tu sonrisa congelada
Y
Quiero el tren de la vida que se escapa
Quiero fe, quiero ser el sueño que te atrapa
Que mi huella no borres del mapa
Y
Hoy, agito con mis manos la guitarra
Recordando que aun estoy vivo
Y saludo a los que se han ido
Ya volverá la soledad
Me ira bien, me ria mal, me ira bien
Me ira muy mal, me ira muy bien
Pero ya no consigo vida
Mas allá de esta medida
Quiere el haz en el filo de tu manga

Quiere paz en un surco de tu alma
Quiere mi sonrisa congelada ahí
Hoy celebra con tus manos en el aire
Por el hecho de que aun estas vivo
Y saluda a los que se han ido ya
Ya volverá la soledad
Te ira bien, te ria mal, te ira bien
Te ira muy mal, te ira muy bien
Pero ya no concibas vida mas allá de esta medida
Vivo, estoy vivo

Volverá la soledad
Me ira bien, me ria mal, me ira bien
Me ira muy mal, me ira muy bien
Pero ya no concibo visa mas allá de esta medida",Vivo
Paulino Monroy,"Decidir entre morir
Y vivir me da igual
Pude sentir al verte partir
Que mi aura fue tras de ti

Y voy directamente al fondo 
Del manicomio de la soledad

Disparaste a matar
Y esa flecha ha partido en dos
Mi corazón se está desangrando amor
Y no puedo parar la hemorragia de tu adiós
Entiéndelo me estoy desangrando amor
Por ti

Sin tu luz, me cuesta mirar
Y sin tu aroma, respirar
Todo, todo se fue
Hundiendo como un barco de papel

Estoy cayendo en lo profundo 
Del mar oscuro de la soledad

Disparaste a matar
Y esa flecha ha partido en dos
Mi corazón se está desangrando amor
Y no puedo parar la hemorragia de tu adiós
Entiéndelo me estoy desangrando amor
Por ti

Disparaste a matar

Paulino Monroy,"Tus pupilas al dilatar
Funden sueños en cálido mar
Dentro del agua toda mi frialdad se acaba
Y son mis manos para tocarte
Es mi boca para mostrarte
Que soy de tu piel un depredador al vuelo
Sentir tu peso es un frenesí
Tus caderas tus piernas sobre mí
Tu cintura sacude el mar
Llego al fondo de tu intimidad

Abro los ojos para entender
Que tu sudor es la sal que beber
La diosa que eres el rostro angelical que tienes
Como luces flotando al aire por galaxias alucinantes
Podemos viajar y luego converger para explotar

Paulino Monroy,"Hoy que llueve el cielo
Copia de mis ojos deja que te toque el alma
Sólo en este instante para que mañana
Escapes otra vez de aquí
Préstame tus labios, lirio de mis sueños
Deja que resbale el frío al suelo
Prófuga del mundo, piérdete en mi brío
Para así saber quién fui
Y aunque la tormenta cesa y se termina
No quiero perder tu aroma
Aunque vengan soles y con ellos calma
No quiero borrar tus huellas
Hoy que ya te has ido

Cuánto dura el día, puede que sea corto
Pero para mí es eterno
Quien sea que te tenga, cuéntale que has ido
Al paraíso ya conmigo
No es cuestión de ego, es para advertirle
Que tu amor no es un juego
Hoy que duele tanto
Hoy que ya te has ido
Hoy que ya no estás conmigo
Quiero que la vida te conceda siempre
Ser feliz en tu mente
Hoy que ya te has ido",Hoy Que Ya Te Has Ido
Paulino Monroy,"Yo lo único que quise fue guardarte un lugar
Junto con todos mis sueños en el centro del corazón

Tú lo único que hiciste fue tratar de escapar
Y con ello arrancar todo lo bello 
De esta historia todo lo especial
Todo lo que no todo suele pasar
Todo lo mágico, tú lo quisite borrar

Y me dijiste una estúpida excusa que me hizo llorar
Una frase trillada que no quiero ni recordar
Escogiste al tiempo de pretexto
Pero recuerda que el tiempo es oro 
No se te vaya a terminar conmigo
Porque tu me conoces bien, sabes que muy muy bien
Sigo siendo el terco que en vez de dormir
Se puso a escribir esta canción
Pensando en ti, y yo te conozco bien
Sabes que muy muy bien
Está bien ser sincera, pero no está bien
No, olvidarse de

Que tú y yo y la música, las tardes que 
Se convertían en noches con solo charlar
Acuérdate cuando no importaba 
Nada más que tú y yo y la eternidad
Las vacas y la casualidad, la luna y la estrella
La necesidad de juntos escapar

Y tú y yo y la causalidad, los mejores 
Conciertos y sin escuchar, los pasteles feos
Los besos largos que parecían cortos en realidad

Tú y yo y las ganas de amar
La funda que hoy cubre mi almohada
Los dulces raros, las fotos y los recados
Las flores que no sé si un día cambien de color

Y tú y yo y la improvisación
La imprudencia y una canción o dos o tres
Perdí la cuenta, tú date cuenta que yo solo quise, quererte",Las vacas
Paulino Monroy,"Hoy se que la vida eres tu 
La muerte mis miedos 
El agua que diluye la flor 
Dulzura de amor que bebo 
Al fin de tus ojos la luz 
Del escape a mis sombras 
Celebran en la fiesta del mar 
Tu boca al besar la gloria 

Sobre esta nube 
Proclamo al cielo 
Lugar de amor 
Contigo me quedo 

Hoy se que la vida eres tu 
La voz de mis sueños 
El aire del aroma ideal 
Un tesoro ancestral que tengo 

Al fin de tu risa mi paz 
Sonriente es el sol cuando estas 
Celebro tu belleza al cantar 
Y te llevo a volar
Conmigo

Sobre esta nube 
Proclamo cielo

Contigo me quedo 

Sin debatirlo 
Por siempre quiero 
Vivir así

He imagino 
Esa magia que marco el camino 
Y te trajo aquí

Paulino Monroy,"Siento que voy un paso adelante 
De toda la gente que va a ninguna parte 
Yo tengo tus ojos para equilibrarme 
Sobre esta cuerda caminando hasta alcanzarte 
Pues quiero llevarme algo de ti el día que muera 
Y en mi biografía relatar la primavera junto a ti 

El tiempo que estoy contigo es mi tesoro 
Tu amor es el sol, mi abrigo contra el frió 
Hoy voy a besarte para comprenderlo todo 
Y luego abrazarte para no olvidar el modo 
Hasta el fin 

Siento que voy un paso adelante de toda 
La historia de este mundo y su memoria 
Yo tengo tus labios para transportarme 
Despego del tiempo, del espacio y de mi cuerpo 
Te llevo en las notas de este canto que hoy escribo 
Y ya no me pierdo en nada si no es contigo 
Por amor

El tiempo que estoy contigo es mi tesoro 
Tu amor es el sol, mi abrigo contra el frió 
Hoy voy a besarte para comprenderlo todo 
Y luego abrazarte para no olvidar el modo 
Hasta el fin

Me pusiste a volar mientras el mundo 
Se destruye allá abajo oh oh oh 
Tu beso ah curar cualquier herida
Cualquier golpe, cualquier daño y es mio

Paulino Monroy,"Tú, que dejaste el pasado atrás
Anunciando que el hoy es más
Con la firme intención de poner, nuevo brío a tus alas
Me, removiste y pusiste a pensar
Que me debo la oportunidad
Porque nunca se sabe dónde, el amor aparece
Tú, sólo viste en mis ojos tristeza
Y le diste con delicadeza
Un descanso a mi soledad que no pude guardar
Hasta hoy, que la puerta he osado abrir
Y me quedo colado en tus ojos
Mientras pienso en aquella frase, del amor que aparece
Tú, sólo viste en mis ojos tristeza
Y le diste con delicadeza
Un descanso a mi soledad que no pude guardar
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Tú, sólo viste en mis ojos tristeza
Y le diste con delicadeza
Un descanso a mi soledad que no pude guardar

Tú, sólo viste en mis ojos
Tú, sólo viste en mis ojos

Paulino Monroy,"Pasa el tiempo y no te dejo ir
De mi mente ni un momento
Es tu risa, tu aroma sin fin
Es tu vida, luz del viento nuevo
Cuando vago en un espacio gris
Son tus besos los que pintan
De colores, motivos de amor
Y esas flores, esas blancas nubes
""Somos tu y yo y ya""

En la inmensidad que esta
Esperando hacerlo bien
En la tierra del amor
""Somos tu y yo y ya""
Hasta hoy has respirado en mí
La caricia de la brisa
Ese anhelo, refleja en tu faz
Ese cielo, y yo emprendo el vuelo
""Somos tu y yo y ya""
En la inmensidad que esta
Esperando hacerlo bien

En la tierra del amor
""Somos tu y yo y ya""

Paulo de Carvalho,"No Castelo ponho um cotovelo
Em Alfama descanso o olhar
E assim desfaço o novelo de azul e mar
Á Ribeira encosto a cabeça
Almofada da cama do Tejo
Com lençóis bordados à pressa na cambraia dum beijo

Lisboa menina e moça menina
Da luz que os meus olhos vêm tão pura
Teus seios são as colinas varina
Pregão que me traz à porta ternura
Cidade a ponto-luz bordada
Toalha á beira-mar estendida
Lisboa menina e moça amada
Cidade mulher da minha vida

No Terreiro eu passo por ti
Mas na Graça eu vejo-te nua
Quando um pombo te olha, sorri, és mulher da rua
E no bairro mais alto do sonho
Ponho um fado que soube inventar
Aguardente de vida e medronho, que me faz cantar

Lisboa no meu amor deitada
Cidade por minhas mãos despida

Cidade mulher da minha vida",Lisboa Menina e Moรงa
Paulo Gonzo,"Foste entrando sem pedires
E marcaste os teus sinais
Tatuaste a minha vida
Ferro e fogo e muito mais
Vasculhaste os meus segredos e eu deixei
Sem reservas nem pudor

Invadiste os meus sentidos
O que não fiz por amor
E deixaste a minha vida bem perdida
Neste beco sem saída

Dei-te quase tudo
E quase tudo foi demais
Dei-te quase tudo
Leva agora os teus sinais
Dei-te quase tudo
E quase tudo foi demais
Dei-te quase tudo
Leva agora os teus sinais

Obrigaste-me a quebrar todas as leis
E deixaste-me ao sabor da loucura
Dei-te os dedos e os anéis
E o que tinha de melhor

Dei-te quase tudo
E quase tudo foi demais
Dei-te quase tudo
Leva agora os teus sinais
Dei-te quase tudo
E quase tudo foi demais
Dei-te quase tudo
Leva agora os teus sinais

Dei-te quase tudo
E quase tudo foi demais
Dei-te quase tudo
Leva agora os teus sinais",Dei-Te Quase Tudo
Paulo Gonzo,"Teimoso subi
Ao cimo de mim
E no alto rasguei
As voltas que dei

Sombra de mil sóis em glória
Cobrem todo o vale ao fundo
Dorme meu pequeno mundo

Como um barco vazio
Pelas margens do rio
Desce o denso véu lilás
Desce em silêncio e paz
Manso e macio

Deixa que te leve
Assim tão leve
Leve e que te beije meu anjo triste
Deixo-te o meu canto canção tão breve
Brando como tu amor pediste

Não fales, calei
E assim fiquei
Sombra de mil sóis cansados
Crescendo como dedos finos
A embalar nossos destinos

Deixa que te leve
Assim tão leve
Leve e que te beije meu anjo triste
Deixo-te o meu canto canção tão breve
Brando como tu amor pediste

Deixa que te leve
Assim tão leve
Leve e que te beije meu anjo triste

Paulo Moura,"Tu és, divina e graciosa estátua majestosa
Do amor, por Deus esculturada
E formada com o ardor
Da alma da mais linda flor, de mais ativo olor
E que na vida é a preferida pelo beija-flor

Se Deus lhe fora tão clemente aqui neste oriente de luz
Formada numa tela deslumbrante e bela
Teu coração, junto ao meu lanceado
Pregado e crucificado sobre a rosa cruz do arfante peito teu

Tu és a forma ideal, estátua magistral
Oh alma perenal, do meu primeiro amor, sublime amor

Tu és de Deus a soberana flor
Tu és de Deus a criação de todo o coração
Cintilas um amor
O riso, a fé, a dor em sândalos olentes cheios de sabor
Em vozes tão dolentes quanto um sonho em flor
És láctea estrela, és mãe da realeza
És tudo enfim que tem de belo
Todo o resplendor da santa natureza
Perdão se ouso confessar-te, eu hei de sempre amar-te
Oh flor! Meu peito não resiste
Ah, meu Deus o quanto é triste
A incerteza de um amor que mais me faz penar
Em esperar em conduzir-te um dia aos pés do altar
Jurar, aos pés do onipotente
Em versos comoventes de luz
E receber a unção da tua gratidão
Depois de remir, teus desejos
Em nuvens de beijos hei de envolver-te
Até o meu padecer, de todo fenecer",Rosa

Se, na sua estrada, não houve flor
Foi só tristeza enfim
E, em cada dia, sem ter amor
Foi tudo tão ruim

Vou confessar então, meu coração, não quer mais existir

Ah, por isso foi que eu decidi
não fico nem mais um minuto aqui

Says, ""logan you're spinning""
Its funny you say that
'cause no one else noticed

I'd never escape her ghost
It seemed not long ago
She was mine to protect
Can't get her off my mind
No matter how hard I try
I'm out of options this time

I'm calling on you to make this happen 
I need to know this'll turn out right
But I can't change her mind
So I'm calling on you
Calling on you

I felt the final straw
I found out that she moved on
I wish I knew before
I gave her my heart
Now when I try to sleep
My body begins to scream
I'll burn as long as I breathe

I'm calling on you to make this happen 
I need to know this'll turn out right
But I can't make her mine
So I'm calling on you

So I'm sorry if you're my experiment. 
But the blonde in your hair is not real,

So although I'll try, 
I'll in the end still come up just shy. 
And I'm afraid to be it. 
So I swear I'll try, 
But you know I just can't help it.

So this is the way I deal. 
The ice is replaced with the sentiment that comfort is achieved in pairs.

Paulson,"Home again and you're remembering when you were young
Thoughts that come to you surrounded by your flesh and blood.
You were blown away cause they made the trade, made it anyway. You're in a rush to grow, when you got engaged, it was a Saturday.

Take your time, let it float away.
Let the current bring you back to me.

Recordings of your voice and notes are buried underground.
Something in the way she spoke that made you turn around.
Now you're open wide, she's got you off the road, but she's gonna get you home.
You gotta let it go, she's got you under the gun, back to square one.",Miami Current

Who says you can't switch sides? It's that simple.
And you can't make mistakes, but as men we are able to folly.

They'll throw that book at us,
And they're aiming for our young but they'll miss by a long shot.
Yeah not by a long shot
Will we join them?

Cause you're old and you're scared,
It's the luxury of youth that allows us to see a different side.

Saw it wash away life I say that we can prevent this.
You say it's a sign. Aren't you lucky?",Not by a Long Shot

When-when they-they arrive dress-dressed in pride,

And in her eyes, won't-won't let-let him compromise.
Dance all night.

Coming just to get along, smiling but the love is gone.
She-she fi-finally gets her balance back,
She-she swear-swears it was an act,
Of all ways it could've gone, cake and white and carry-ons,
She'll put an end to this, this 4-year stand

It's in her kiss, you won't admit it.
I know that after this we'll never dance again,
So dance all night.

We joined the hearts running from the start
A blinking light was on
We built the blocks running from the start

It's an inch, it's a lift, it's just the way it is.
I should've chained the doors to save us from the walk-ins.
Now it's too late to turn the lights off and hide.

Last night you were next to me when the fire alarm went off.
We held each other on the feather bed quiet and calm.
But it was not the same, the names were changed,
And the window frames were in the wrong place
In my dreams where I didn't mess everything up. 

I imagined a son and this not my imagination.
Honey, you're too sweet for my teeth and you're giving me cavities.
If you never run too fast, you'll never get winded.
No relationships are ever finished, just abandoned.

In this light, you're a silhouette and I'm gauged by what I'm told.
All I can see were the seventeen inches of snow.
It was not the same, the names were changed

I love my mister man,
And I can't tell yo' why,
There ain't no reason
Why I should love that man.
It must be something that the angels done plan.

Fish got to swim, birds got to fly,
I got to love one man till I die.
Can't help loving that man of mine.
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,
Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).
Can't help loving that man of mine.
When he goes away
That's a rainy day,
But when he comes back that day is fine,
The sun will shine!
He kin come home as late as kin be,
Home without him ain't no home to me.
Can't help loving that man of mine.

My man is shiftless
An' good for nothing too
(He's my man just the same)

He's never round here
When there is work to do.
He's never round here when there's working to do.

The roof is leaking in,
But he don't seem to care.
He kin be happy

I hope that he turns out to be

Until you snort it up or shoot it down
You're never gonna feel free

The night is just hummin'
And the gum smacks are the pulse
I'll follow if my walkman fades

No one but myself to blame

Is the sedan he bought

He never, he never complains when it's hot
He phoned the fallen daughter 
In the sauna playing contract bridge
They're soaking up the fun or doing blotters

I don't know which...which...which...
Boys are dying on these streets
I know the medical world could knock you out
To sell the coins that you jayed last Thursday

Dine by candle light and hold your savings tight
You never, you never know 
When the bridge falls apart
We spoke of latent causes sterile gauzes

And the bedside morale
We traipse around the table talking sentences
So incomplete... please! please!
Boys are dying on these streets...",Grounded [Live]
Pavement,"There is no castration fear
In a chair
You will be
With me
We'll dance
We'll dance
We'll dance

But no one will dance with us
In this zany town
Chim chim chim sing a song of praise
For your elders
They're in the back

Pick out some Brazilian nuts for your engagement
Check that expiration date man it's later than you think
You can't enjoy yourself, I can't enjoy myself
You can't enjoy yourself, I can't enjoy myself
Move that swing and watch it break straight like an arc
But I won't be there to leave you
Cause I don't have a clue anymore

Pavement,"Harness your hopes
Harness your hopes 
On just one person
Because you know a harness 
Was only made for one

Don't telegraph your passes
You'll end up with molasses
Cauterized in syrup
And syrup and molasses

And I'm checking out the asses
The assets that attract us
To anything that moves
We're deep inside the grooves

And it's time to shake the rations
Cause someone's gonna cash in
The plot it turns again
The reference starts at ten

Well show me
A word that rhymes with Pavement
And I won't kill your parents
And roast them on a spit

And a-don't you try to etch it
Or permanently sketch it
Or your gonna catch a bad bad cold

And the freaks have stormed the white house
I moved into a lighthouse
It's on a scenic quay
It's oh so far away

Far away from the beginning
The shroud is made of linen
The yearling took the purse
The goth kid has a hearse

Heart-breaking
Earth-quaking
Kiwis they are home baking
Minds wide open truly

Leisure
A leisure suit is nothing
It's nothing to be proud of
In this late century

And I'm asking you to hold me
Just like the morning paper
Pinched between your pointer
Your index and your thumb

It's a semi-automatic
Believers are ecstatic
You see the way they cling
The cold metallic sting

And I'm living in a coma
For Donna de Varona
The harness made of hopes
The lovers on the ropes

Nun is to church
As the parrot is to perch
And my Heart's
Wide open Truly
",Harness Your Hopes

And you know I didn't want to feel
The way you made me feel 
 
You brought me to life there was nowhere to hide
How did you know what I was feeling inside
There was never a doubt and you never asked why
Everything is perfect right now 
 
At first I couldn't say nice things to you
Afraid that every word might drive you away
You didn't know that I would die for you
And you know I didn't want to feel
The way you made me feel 
 
I feel so alive and it's easy this time
How did you know what I was feeling inside
There was never a doubt and you never asked why

You're tripping over lies, where did I go so wrong?

But now I'm watching you leaving

Was hanging onto every word you said
But now I'm so without you
Why do you want to make me feel this bad
You've given up on everything we had
But now I'm so without you

You're going to find your living in a different world
I tried to save it, no matter what I gave it
I'm completely intoxicated 
 
I traded what I wanted, just to make it happen
Just so you could walk away again 
 
You left me burned out, and as it turns out
There was nothing left to my heart worth tearing

I know, I know the tradition is
To follow, follow wherever you lead
I let go you should know that I'm disappointed like you
So we both lose 
 
You sheltered me my whole life, made me look through your eyes
I was blind, to the things that you were blind to
I danced with indecision, cleared my blurry vision
I don't blame you, but I wanted to remind you 
 
I believe in something, that you'll never understand

Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it, too

Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky filled up with diamonds

When I make love to you, tonight
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you

And soon this old world will seem brand new

Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers

I see you playing in the leaves

How'd you ever get so big?
I've gotta take your picture
Hold on to the memory
Before the whole thing slips away

I wish I could save these moments
And put 'em in a jar
I wish I could stop the world from turning
Keep things just the way they are

I wish I could shelter you from everything
Not pure and sweet and good
I know I can't, I know I can't
But I wish I could

When you kiss me for no reason
It goes straight to my heart
When I feel your arms around me
I almost fall apart
It's time for bed and you whisper
""Daddy, we forgot to pray, whoa""

I wish I could save these moments
And put 'em in a jar
I wish I could stop the world from turning
Keep things just the way they are

I wish I could shelter you from everything
Not pure and sweet and good
I know I can't, I know I can't

All my worries fade away
A little bit of heaven
Glows on your angelic face

Keep things just the way they are

I don't need this love, I don't need your hand
I know I could turn, blink, and you'd be gone
Then I must be prepared any time to carry on

But minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on

You will stay just to watch me, darlin'
Wilt away on lies from you
Can't stop the habit of livin' on the run
I take it all for granted like you're the only one
Livin' on my own
Somehow that sounds nice
You think I'm your fool
Well, you may just be right

'cause minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on

Call my name and I'll be gone
You'll reach out and I won't be there
Just my luck you'll realize
You should spend your life with someone
You could spend your life with someone

Minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on.",Minute by Minute

Peabo Bryson,"I, I saw her today
We just met by chance and we smiled a lot
Not knowing what to say
Cause you see, she's over me

And I, I looked in her eyes
And I saw enough to make me realize
It's dead and gone, I don't have a prayer
Of getting her back where she used to be
She's over me

We stood a minute or two
And we talk like strangers do, saying nothing at all
No one who saw us would know
That once she loved me so

But I'd never dreamed that she'd ever
Would ever be the one to go, no
She got herself free and now she's over me

She's over me

I, I kissed her goodbye
And that kiss killed every hope that I held inside
It tore me all that we had before
Was nothing more than ancient history
I can truly, truly, truly see she had took her some time
But she's finally over me

But I don't know what went wrong
All I know is I spend my life now
Thinking of how good we were
Guess that she's over me, but I'll never been over her",When You Talk to Me

Peabo Bryson,"Here's another morning without you
Here's another day; will I get through it
Without breaking down?
Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart, I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on?
Baby, I'd be living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

[Chorus:]
Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop
Can you stop the rain?

Ev'rywhere I go, I feel you there
Following my footsteps like a shadow
Of my broken heart
Sometimes, it's a pair of passing eyes
Or it's just the way someone is talking
And there you are

Am I all alone?
Don't you ever wake up
And reach for me
Where I used to be?
Is there any chance?
I just can't believe
You're not lonely, too
Just for me and you

[Chorus:]

If you were here for only one night
Baby, I know you'd remember
'Cause loving you once wasn't time enough
I know we can make it together
Together

Baby, stop the rain
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears of mine from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop
Can you, can you stop the rain?

How can I live without you, baby?
How could I let you go?",Can You Stop the Rain?
Peabo Bryson,"You say that love has caused you pain
And nothing seems to ever change
And you're all burnt out
Because I cannot match you down

And every time you let love in
That's when uncertainty begins
Nothing to break your part
Seems like love don't love alone

That's not the way it's suppose to go
Love is the greatest thing between two people
If you don't open up your heart you'll never know

So baby, if you let me be everything you need
Then I can guarantee that you can always count on me
I will never lie to you, I'll never be untrue
So if you need someone to love you, you can count on me

So tell me what I have to do?
I've opened up my heart to you
And now it's in your hands
You decide where this love stands

And I'm convinced we're meant to be
And it's no mystery to me
So can we add this trial
To find out if this love is right?

I know you're thinking, here we go again
But this time it's gonna be so different
So don't you be afraid to let this someone in

Baby, if you let me be everything you need
Then I can guarantee your heart can always count on me
And I will never lie to you and I won't be untrue
So if you need someone to love you, you can count on me

People searched for all their lives
Looking for someone they never find
Fortunately you and I have found each other

I will always be there for you
Anytime you need me to
Because you can always count on me

Baby, if you let me be everything you need
Then I can guarantee you can always, always
And I will never lie to you and I won't be untrue

Peabo Bryson,"There've been too many sad goodbyes
Too many tears I've cried
Promises made and dreams that died
Have left me hurt inside

I want your love
Like none I've known before
But unless you're sure

Don't you give your heart
Unless you give it all the way
Don't give me just the part
'Cause that would be too cruel a game to play
Be sure or don't you give your heart

It takes so long for me to mend
Each time love comes to an end
Don't think I'll make it through
That's why I must know the truth

Am I the one that you can't live without?
If there's any doubt

Don't you give your heart
(Don't give your heart)
Unless you give it all the way
Don't give me just a part
(Not just a part)
'Cause that would be too cruel a game to play
Be sure or don't you give your heart

If you really truly care
All I ask is you be fair with me
'Cause the longer that you keep making me wait
The harder it's gonna be to take

Don't give your heart
Don't give me just a part
(Not just a part)
'Cause that would be too cruel a game to play
Be sure or don't you give your heart

Don't give your heart unless you give it
(Give it all the way)
All the way, baby, don't give

Get the best of me when I feel weak

To look forward and embrace another day

I just can't live my life without
Your breathe, your kiss

Held your body gently close to me

And you live this forever

We spit blood in the sun, we spit blood in the ocean
We spit blood in the sun, we spit blood in the ocean

As we plunge into the ocean, the waves they pull us down
For a moment I'm open, for blood to be

You have seen some nameless and some faceless
And some hopeless cases
You have touched the heart of darkness
Mister Kurtz is dead and so are you

Where is your truth?
Do you believe all that you see?

Of our time and our lives

Are you scared, you'll be forgotten
As you stare into the water?

In time you will arrive with a clear mind
You'll be sure, you're not afraid of a freefall
Words can't say all the things that you feel
No faith that they'll outlive you anyway

Altruistic or just trying to shine bright

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Pearl Bailey,"Frankie and Johnny was sweethearts
At least that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports car to his Ivy League clothes

He was a man alright, oh but he was doing her wrong
Just to show you what can happen

A friend came running to Frankie
She said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Nellie Blye

He was your man honey, oh and he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
There she saw Johnny with the woman
He had his arms around her waist

Aw, he was a man alright but Frankie could see that he was
Doing her wrong. And oh let me tell you

Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long forty-four
She shot once, twice, three times and
Johnny fell to the hard wood floor

Aw, he was a man alright but Frankie shot him because he was
Doing her wrong

But the last thing he told her was
Frankie, you know I love you
Why? Honey why did you do that?
Frankie, I was telling her about you
Frankie, you know I love you
Frankie, you know that I love you
Yeah, yeah , yeah, yeah

Of a cottage by a stream

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Pearl Django,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Pearl Django,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue

The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

Pearl Django,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura

And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,

I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.

I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.

Pearl Jam,"I seem to recognize your face
Haunting  familiar  yet I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me
All these changes taking place  I wish I'd seen the place
But no one's ever taken me
Hearts and thoughts they fade  fade away

I swear I recognize your breath
Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
Me  you wouldn't recall, for I'm not my former
It's hard when, your stuck upon the shelf
I changed by not changing at all, small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see
I just want to scream, hello
My god its been so long, never dreamed you'd return
But now here you are, and here I am
Hearts and thoughts they fade, away

Hearts and thoughts they fade, away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away

Bare their gums when they moan and squeak
Lick the dirt off a larger one's feet
They don't push  don't crowd
Congregate until they're much too loud
Fuck to procreate till they are dead
Drink the blood of their so called best friend

They don't scurry when something bigger comes their way
Don't pack themselves together and run as one
Don't shit where they're not supposed to
Don't take what's not theirs, they don't compare

They don't scam, don't fight
Don't oppress an equals given rights
Starve the poor so they can be well fed
Line their holes with the dead ones bread

All five horizons revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun

Has taken a turn
Ooh, and all I taught her was everything
Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands
Shade beneath the clouds
Of what was everything?
Oh, the pictures seared all been washed in black,
Tattooed everything...

I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter,
So why do I sear?
And twisted thoughts that spin round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can, drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures seared all been washed in black,
Tattooed everything...

All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be...yeah

Alone, listless, breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl, violins, center of her own attention
Mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud

Painted room, can't deny there's something wrong

Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me

Pearl Jam,"She said to me, over the phone 
She wanted to see other people 
I thought, ""well then, look around, they're everywhere"" 
Said that she was confused

I thought, ""darling, join the club"" 
24 years old, mid-life crisis 
Nowadays hits you when you're young 
I hung up, she called back, I hung up again 

The process had already started 
At least it happened quick 
I swear, I died inside that night 
My friend, he called 

I didn't mention a thing 
The last thing he said was, ""be sound"" 
Sound
I contemplated an awful thing, I hate to admit 

I just thought those would be such appropriate last words 
But I'm still here 
And small 
So small how could this struggle seem so big? 

So big
While the palms in the breeze still blow green 
And the waves in the sea still absolute blue 
But the horror 

Every single thing I see is a reminder of her 
Never thought I'd curse the day I met her 
And since she's gone and wouldn't hear 
Who would care? what good would that do? 

But I'm still here 
So I imagine in a month or 12 
I'll be somewhere having a drink 
Laughing at a stupid joke 

Or just another stupid thing 
And I can see myself stopping short 
Drifting out of the present 
Sucked by the undertow and pulled out deep 

And there I am, standing 
Wet grass and white headstones all in rows 
And in the distance there's one, off on its own 
So I stop, kneel 

My new home
And I picture a sober awakening, a re-entry into this little bar scene 
Sip my drink til the ice hits my lip 
Order another round 

And that's it for now 
Sorry 
Never been too good at happy endings",[Untitled Track]

Every inch between becomes light years now

Crashed and on their way

A snowflake falls in may.

'Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now.

Nature has its own religion; gospel from the land
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
Old men comprehend.

And the sky breaks at dawn; shedding light upon this town
They'll all come â??round
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Good bye for now.

And the road
The old man paved
The broken seems along the way
The rusted signs, left just for me

Suddenly the channel changed
The first time you saw blood

Cut to later, now you're strong
You've bled yourself, the wounds are gone

Survived and you're amongst the fittest

I'm better than this
Don't leave me so cold
I'm buried beneath the stones

I know I'm worth your love

Enough
I don't think
There's such a thing

It's my fault now
Having caught a sickness in my bones
How it pains to leave you here
With the kids on your own
Just don't let me go

Help me see myself
Cause I can no longer tell
Looking out from the inside
Of the bottom of a well

It's hell

But no one hears before I disappear
Whisper in my ear
Give me something to echo
In my unknown future's ear

I let go of a rope, thinking that's what held me back

I can't see what's next, from this lonely overpass
Hang my head and count my steps, as another car goes past

Choosing the shiny ones instead
I turned my back, now there's no turning back

Great and small, but must we follow?

Pearls Before Swine,"All along the cold and gross canal
The gray-walled dwarf leaps high
Dwelling dark victorious
Silent with a cry

Morning, morning

On the ledge the leper walks
Soft-pawed, cold, lean and crisp
Telling jokes the old Jew told
Laughing with a lisp

Morning, morning

At the door, I stand and sense
Each picture in its frame
Seeking out, in each glance
The hunchback with my name

Morning, morning",Morning Song
Pearls Before Swine,"You know that your guardian angel is dead, you have said
You say in the world is not a safe world to be
For all of your trying and all of your crying it seems
It's raining outside umbrellas are harder to find

All of the pain in the world is outside your bed
In the shapes of phantom men tapping your window with rhythms of dread
And all of the silver rosaries hung on the door
Will not drive them always they are going to stay

You say that the sky people don't even ask you your name

If it's you or another, it doesn't matter, to them it's all the same
But we live suspended in each other's mind
A bullet-proof sanctuary cathedral of eyes
That I offer you that I offer you

You're trapped in a world of angels who no longer care
In the space where his hand was, my hand is reaching out for you there
Love is the weapon left after the fall
It may not seem like much but girl that's all there is
Girl I love you",Guardian Angels
Pearls Before Swine,"There was a man came to our town
He wore a suit of red
He memorized with secret eyes
That he hid away in his head

He had a scar upon his head
Where there used to be a crown
But he sold his robes at the five and ten
And lived on the edge of town
That fall he showed us a magic leaf
That he could change to snow
He bought it partly with his grief
And partly with his soul
He scattered seeds in the alley way
He never seemed to rest
And when you went to ask him why
All he ever said was yes
He made a swan from waving grass
Beside a crystal shore
And a sunrise spun from broken glass
And many things wondrous more
But then his hands began to burn
When he heard the news from the war
When we cannot find each other he said
Then we can't run away any more
Next day with tears along his face
He passed us on the hill
No one thought to ask him to stay
And he knows that we never will
There was a man came to our town
He wore a suit of red
He memorized with secret eyes
That he hid away in his head",There Was a Man

There's no one to listen, so you laugh by yourself.

The crowd on the street walks slowly, don't mind the rain
Lovers hold hands to numb the pain
Gripping tightly to something that they'll never own
And those by themselves by choice or by some reward
No mistakes, only now you're bored
This is the time of your life but you just can't tell.

Pearson,"I'm tryin' to tell you somethin' 'bout my life.
Maybe give me insight between black and white.
And the best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously.
It's only life after all.

Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable,
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear.
I wrap my fear around me like a blanket.
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it.
I'm crawling on your shores.

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line.
And the less I seek my source for some definitive,
The closer I am to fine. The closer I am to fine.

I went to see the Doctor of Philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee.
He never did marry  or see a B-Grade movie.
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me.
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind,
Got my paper and I was free.

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line.
And the less I seek my source for some definitive,

I stopped by the bar at three A.M.
To seek solace in a bottle, or possibly a friend.
I woke up with a headache like my head against a board,
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before.
And I went in seeking clarity.

Love has many ways 
Of touching your emotions 
Taking control of you 
And even in thought 
Love can make you change 
There's no way of taking control 
When it's part of you 

Well you could be a married man 
With two kids and a good woman 
And you could give your heart and soul 
I swear it don't mean nothin'
Cause love can pull you deep into a spell 
It will spin your mind around like a carousel 

I'm tellin' you love 
Boy makes things happen 
You never know where it's coming from 
You never know who you're gonna love 
I'm telling you love makes things happen 
You never know what you're gonna do 
When ever true love takes hold of you 

There's never a time 
Cause love will let you know 
Love appears at the worst and even the best of times 
Takes over your mind 
Your heart is not your own 
There's no way of controlling love 
It controls your life 

Well you could be a faithful girl 
With a good heart and good intentions 
And you could never leave your home 
I swear there ain't no preventions 
Cause love can pull you deep into a spell 
It will spin your mind around like a carousel 

I'm tellin' you love 
Boy makes things happen 
You never know where it's coming from 
You never know who you're gonna love 
I'm telling you love makes things happen 
You never know what you're gonna do 
When ever true love takes hold of you 

There's nothin love can't make you do 
When love takes hold of you 
You can have the purest heart 
And the finest attitude 
But I swear that don't mean nothin 
When your heart's under a spell 
It will spin your mind around like a carousel 

I'm tellin' you love 
Love makes things happen 
You never know where it's coming from 
You never know who you're gonna love 
I'm tellin' you love makes things happen 
You never know what you're gonna do

Pebbles & Bamm-Bamm,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Peccatum,"As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow

If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting

Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night

Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice

Not begging you
I'm telling you

You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me
Under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
Blood red skies

Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise

Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night

They're closing in
They'll never win

You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me
Under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under

As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand. I will fight

I won't go down

Peccatum,"For all those who cried aloud
But whose tears were never heard
For questioning one almighty father
Of a heavenly distanced world

Beloved thee who submit
The holy writings assured
The golden cross stained with innocent blood
But stand yet a thousand heavenward

Burning naked but smiling
Not full of fear but pride
Knowing death alone could cleanse them
Of the reasons for which they all die

For all those who died

For all those whose great beauty
Stirred their tortures to rage
And for all those whose great ugliness
Did the same

For all those who cried aloud in vain
For mercy on the rack
But whom of dying naked in scorn
Not ashamed

Burning naked but smiling
Not full of fear but pride
Knowing death alone could cleanse them
Of the reasons for which they all died

For all those who died

Pleas for mercy signs of guilt
Naked bodies broken on the wheel
Tears sign the confession
With crusted blood lips sealed

Pedaz,"Ah!
Ich bau’ ein Haus mit einem Hammer wie ein Mann
Bring’ ein Album raus und nenn’ es einfach „Mama“ wie ein Mann
Wir müssen die Teller und manchmal auch Gläser füllen
Doch ohne drauf kleben zu bleiben wie Tesafilm
Ein waschechter Mann muss zu jeglicher Zeit die Klischees erfüll’n
Ein Haar auf der Brust wie ein Mann
Na klar hab’ ich Lust wie ein Mann
Du rufst mich an, um Geburtstag zu feiern, doch ich hab’ den Tag nicht gewusst wie ein Mann
Das Bad nicht geputzt wie ein Mann
Den Bart nicht gestutzt wie ein Mann
Wochenlang Touren, lebe nur aus meinem Koffer und schlafe im Bus wie ein Mann
Ich plane mit Plus wie ein Mann, hab’ Dope für dieses Land
Wurd’ zum Dealer, dabei war ich nie ein Drogenlieferant
Komm in meine Hood, stell mich auf die Probe wie ein Mann
Auch unter Druck mach’ ich Kohle - Diamant

Ich kämpfe jetzt, glänze später, wie ein Riesendiamant
Hände weg, im Endeffekt ging ich durch Krisen wie ein Mann
Jeder Tag ist wie ein Kampf, den man verwundet übersteht
Nach außen zeigt man kein’ Schmerz, mein Herz mit Wunden übersät
Mit dem Kopf durch die Wand, Killa - Zinédine Zidane
Keine Glock in der Hand, ich hab’ zwei Fäuste wie ein Mann
Halb Mensch, halb Maschine, verfolg’ meine Ziele
Hab’ für diese ganzen Schlampen keine Liebe - wie ein Mann
Lieber lachend und zu Fuß als weinend in ’nem Benz
Ah, Reime so potent, ah, keine Konkurrenz
Die meisten von uns hier sind auf Scheitern programmiert
Weil sie mit Dingen nicht beginnen aus der Angst, was zu verlier’n, ah

Diggah, gib mir mal das Mikro, es gibt bisschen was zu beichten, es war viel los
Doch eigentlich: wem muss ich was beweisen? Ich bin Pilot
Höhenflug, zwei Meter Größenwahn auf hundert Kilo
Und das Geld, das alles möglich macht, wird unser Friedhof
Ich hab’s geseh’n, trag’ die Narben wie ein Mann
War bis nachts auf der Straße, doch ertrag’ es wie ein Mann
Der ausm Stegreif krumme Dinger wieder geradebiegen kann
Ohne in ’ne schiefe Lage zu gelang’ - wie ein Mann
Ich war geduldig und hab’ jahrelang gewartet wie ein Mann
Auch aus ’nem Sandkorn wird irgendwann ein schwarzer Diamant
Die Welt dreht sich und die Jahre zieh’n ins Land
Nur wer gut blufft, zeigt, dass er seine Karten spielen kann - wie ein Mann

Ah!
Sie sind biologisch maskulin, aber nicht mit mir verwandt
Irgendwie logisch - sie sind Fotzen wie kein Mann
Ich fühle mich verlor’n auf Instagram, mach die App auf, wisch’ den Dreck aus
Meiner Netzhaut mit dem Kärcher wie ein Mann, zurück zum Thema
Hol’ DVDs ab - wie ein Mann, geb’ viel zu spät ab - wie ein Mann
Zahl’ die Mahnung wie ein Mann - irgendwann
Ich könnte singen auf dem Beat, doch ich bleib’ simpel
Trag’ oft wochenlang dieselbe gottverdammte Diesel - wie ein Mann
Dein Bodyguard, er war nie ein Mann, der schwarze Rabe, er war nie ein Schwarm
Fahre mit zweihundert, tippe dabei meinen Part mit einer Hand
Adam hat sich einen Garten gebaut, Eva hat sich für ’nen Apfel verkauft
R A war da, als der Beat entstand, „Schwermetall“ Gitter - wie ein Mann

Ich geh’ scheißen mit dem Smartphone in der Hand wie ein Mann
An meine Haare lass’ ich keine Frauen ran wie ein Mann
Finger weg, Sinan-G: vom Haschticker zum Knastkicker
Wie ein Mann kauf’ ich meine Brechstange beim Praktiker
Spastiker! Was für Knast? Sieh zu, dass du dein’ Spaß hast
Ich bin dieser Sinan und nicht der Bruder von Savas
Doch Brüder im Geiste
Ich muss wieder in den Knast und sitze bis zum Hals in der Scheiße
Sag mir, warum biten deutsche Rapper wieder „Frankreich“?
In meiner Welt ist Mustafa arm, aber Frank reich
Wie ein Mann hat sich Sinan in die Szene eingebrannt
16 Jahre jung, sag mir, wer ist in die Bank reingerannt?

Auch wenn ich stundenlang nur depri schieb’
Lös’ ich eines nach dem andern wie ein Mann, ich hab ’n Multitasking-Defizit
Und habe ich Schulden bei der Bank
Spucke ich in die Hand und acker’ dann, bis ich Plus mach’ wie ein Mann
Park’ das Auto immer rückwärts, bau’ das Ott auch immer rückwärts in dein’ Blunt
Mach paar Züge, Augen rot, so wie ein Blatt
Leben im Traum, bleibe am Boden und ich kämpf’, bis ich nicht kann
Gebe nicht auf, Kopf durch die Wand, weil ich denke wie ein Mann
Halt’ das Lenkrad mit ’ner Hand, bin am Handy, pass’ ’nen Blunt
Mache paar Geschäfte klar bei 160 km/h
Ich brauch’ Schubkraft und dreh’ ab, geb’ ein’ Schuss ab wie ein Junk
Und sind die Zeiten einmal schlecht, geh’ ich auch Bus fahren wie ein Mann

Ah!
Yao, gib ihn’!
Ich bin ehrlich, wie ein Mann, wie ein Mann
Macht der Alltag mich fertig, doch ich wehr’ mich, tu’ als wär’ nix, wie ein Mann
Sag’ „Ich merk’ nix!“ wie ein Mann, lass’ den Schmerz nicht an mich ran
Ich könnte jammern wie ein Mädchen, doch beherrsch’ mich wie ein Mann
Wie ein Mann werd’ ich irgendwann beerdigt wie ein Mann
Bevor ich lebe wie ’ne Fotze geh’ und sterb’ ich wie ein Mann
Wie ein Mann, Probleme k-k-klär’ ich wie ein Mann
Und muss es sein, dann fick’ ich Feinde - wie ein Pferd, nicht wie ein Mann
Und wenn ich feier’ wie ein Mann, dann bis ich reiher’ wie ein Mann
Am nächsten Tag dicker Kopf und dicke Eier wie ein Mann
Sag’ meiner Frau, dass ich sie lieb’ und später heirat’ wie ein Mann
Und ich bin treu, doch ich träum’ von dem Dreier wie ein Mann

Ich bin eklig und böse, so wie ein Mann
Ich weiß Probleme zu lösen, so wie ein Mann
Kämpf’ gegen Bären und Löwen, so wie ein Mann
Ich bin nämlich der König in diesem Land!
Dieselben Socken an, wochenlang, wie ein Mann
Ist voll normal, dass ich gut kochen kann, wie ein Mann
Kam noch nicht vor, dass mich das Leben in die Knie zwang
Denn guck, ich leiste Widerstand, wie ein Mann, wie ein Mann
Voll entspannt am Strand wie ein Mann
Scheiß auf dein Handtuch, ich lieg’ auf dem heißen Sand wie ein Mann
Langer Bart und tätowiert auf der Hand wie ein Mann
Und pass ma’ auf: ich kann saufen, bis ich nicht mehr laufen kann wie ein Mann

Yeah, ey
Ich überleg’: Wat zieh’ ich an? Seh’ da keine Jeans im Schrank
Nehm’ die alte, rieche dran - Deo drauf, wie ein Mann
Du bist Luft, das’ der Grund, warum ich dich nicht riechen kann
Hier mein Finger, zieh ma’ dran, kurz gefurzt wie ein Mann
Ich werd’ wie ein Mann nie mehr wat auf Raten zahlen
Denn mein Kontostand kann sich sehen lassen - Rasensamen, yeah
Ich schneid’ die Hecke wie ein Mann
Wärm’ die Füße meiner Frau unter der Decke wie ein Mann, yeah
Und für sie mach’ ich Einmachgläser auf
Mach’ ich ein Kind wie ein Mann, dann kommt ein kleiner Pedaz raus
Doch muckst du auf oder kommst mit irgendeinem Firlefanz
Schwing’ ich die Keule und mach’ passend, wat nicht passt - wie ein Mann
(Wie ein Mann!)",Wie ein Mann [Prachtkerle Remix]
Pedaz,"Wat für Kaffeeklatsch, hatte er 'nen schwatten Tach?

You need some sunshine
You need some daylight

Pedrinho Mattar,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Passo os dias a pensar
Não sei o que fazer
Eu nem quero acreditar
No que me foi acontecer
Só queria estar sozinho
E não pensar mais em amor
Sempre que conheço alguém
Fico de mal a pior
Li no ""Metro"" o teu anuncio
De caráter pessoal
Limitavas-te a dizer

Curioso como sou
Apressei-me a responder
Só para te perguntar
O que é que isso quer dizer
Guardei o jornal no bolso
Para te falar depois
Mas decorei o teu numero
937812
Liguei-te às seis da tarde
Devias estar a acordar
Essa voz rouca e quente
Num suave murmurar
Fiquei quase sem fala
Estive mesmo a desligar
Do outro lado dizias

Socorro!!Estou a apaixonar-me
É impossível resistir a tanto charme

Foste-me buscar de carro
Levaste-me à beira-mar
Nas tuas mãos a 4L
Mais parece um Jaguar!
Sentados na esplanada
A tomar um cimbalino
Foi então que percebi
Essa coisa do destino
Nesse dia aconteceu
Nunca mais vou esquecer
o mar o sol o céu a praia 
Todo um mundo de prazer
Acendes um cigarro
Afagas-me o cabelo
Disseste então assim

Não percebo o que é que queres
Nem o que estas a dizer
Só sei que tu consegues
Mostrar o que é ser mulher
Quando nós nos separamos
Não nos vimos por um mês
Trinta dias a pensar
Em te ter mais uma vez
Depois vi-te na Industria
A dançar ao som do Prince
Senti-me devorado
Pelo teu olhar de lince
Com ar discreto e decidido
Chegaste-te ao pé de mim
Sussurraste-me ao ouvido

Encontrei-te então na baixa
(sem nada que o justifique)
Ali ficamos toda a tarde
Nos sofás do Magestic
Falaste-me do mundo
D'outras terras e lugares
Mostraste-me perfumes
De oceanos e mares
Ali sentado viajei
Ali pra sempre quis ficar

Contigo perto dos olhos
Os lábios quase a beijar
Falaste da cidade
Casas ruas e pessoas
E disseste sem vaidade

Tenho ouvido muita coisa
Mas nunca tao bela assim
Seduzir e encantar
São coisas novas pra mim
O que eu gosto mais contigo
Se queres saber o que eu acho
É que consigo ser homem
Sem dar uma de macho
Já não como ha cinco dias
Não durmo ha mais de um mês
Desde que te conheci
A minha vida é como vês
Passo os dias a pensar
Já não sei o que fazer
Eu nem quero acreditar
No que me foi acontecer",Socorro
Pedro Abrunhosa,"Eu não sei, que mais posso ser
Um dia rei, outro dia sem comer
Por vezes forte, coragem de leão
As vezes fraco assim é o coração
Eu não sei, que mais te posso dar
Um dia joias noutro dia o luar
Gritos de dor, gritos de prazer
Que um homem também chora
Quando assim tem de ser

Foram tantas as noites sem dormir
Tantos quartos de hotel, amar e partir
Promessas perdidas escritas no ar
E logo ali eu sei

(Que) Tudo o que eu te dou
Tu me das a mim
Tudo o que eu sonhei
Tu serás assim
Tudo o que eu te dou
Tu me das a mim
E tudo o que eu te dou

Sentado na poltrona, beijas-me a pele morena
Fazes aqueles truques que aprendeste no cinema
Mais peço-te eu, já me sinto a viajar
Para, recomeça, faz-me acreditar
Não dizes tu, e o teu olhar mentiu
Enrolados pelo chão no abraço que se viu
É madrugada ou é alucinação
Estrelas de mil cores, ecstasy ou paixão
Hum, esse odor, traz tanta saudade
Mata-me de amor ou dá-me liberdade
Deixa-me voar, cantar, adormecer",Tudo O Que Eu Te Dou
Pedro Abrunhosa,"Já vai alta a noite, vejo o negro do céu
Deitado na areia, o teu corpo e o meu.
Viajo com as mãos por entre as montanhas e os rios
E sinto nos meus lábios os teus doces e frios.

E voas sobre o mar com as asas que eu te dou,
E dizes-me a cantar é assim que eu sou
Olhar para ti e ver o que eu vejo
Olhar-te nos olhos com olhares de desejo.
Olhar para ti e ver o que eu vejo
Olhar-te nos olhos com olhares de desejo.
Eu não tenho nada mais p'ra te dar
Esta vida sao dois dias e um é para acordar,
Das histórias de encantar
Das histórias de encantar.

Viagens que se perdem no tempo, viagens sem princí­pio nem fim,
Beijos entregues ao vento e amor em mares de cetim.
Gestos que riscam o are e olhares que trazem solidão,
Pedras e praias e o céu a bailar e os corpos que fogem do chão.

E voas sobre o mar com as asas que eu te dou,
E dizes-me a cantar é assim que eu sou
Olhar para ti e ver o que eu vejo
Olhar-te nos olhos com olhares de desejo.
Olhar para ti e ver o que eu vejo
Olhar-te nos olhos com olhares de desejo.
Eu não tenho nada mais p'ra te dar
Esta vida sao dois dias e um é para acordar,
Das histórias de encantar
Das histórias de encantar.",Viagens
Pedro Abrunhosa,"Hoje acordei e senti-me sozinho
Um barco sem vela um corpo sem linho
Amanheci e vesti-me de preto
Um gesto cansado o olhar do deserto

Quando todos vão dormir
É + fácil desistir
Quando a noite está a chegar
É difícil não chorar

Eu não quero ser
A luz que já não sou
Não quero ser o primeiro
Sou o tempo que acabou

Eu não quero ser
As lágrimas que vês
Não quero ser primeiro
Sou um barco nas marés

Adormeci
Sem te ter a meu lado
Um corpo sem alma
Guitarra sem fado

Um sonho na noite
E olhei-me ao espelho
Umas mãos de criança
Num rosto de velho

Quando todos vão dormir
É + fácil desistir
Quando a noite está a chegar
É difícil não chorar

Eu não quero ser
A luz que já não sou
Não quero ser o primeiro
Sou o tempo que acabou

Eu não quero ser
As lágrimas que vês
Não quero ser primeiro
Sou um barco nas marés

Quando todos vão dormir
É + fácil desistir
Quando a noite está a chegar

Não quero ser primeiro
Sou um barco nas marés

",É Difícil
Pedro Abrunhosa,"Seduz-me, reduz-me a pó, deixa-me só
Quero ficar a olhar o teu corpo de raínha
E saber que vais ser minha
Quando quiser, descobrir se és minha

Fantasma ou perdição
No carro, na cama, no chão
Perceber o teu prazer e dar-to como mo dás
Talvez seja melhor no banco de trás

Não dá, não dá
Levar-te a ver o mundo sem que largues o sofá
Não dá, não dá
Queres fazer amor comigo sem tirar o wonderbra

Prende-me dentro de ti, deixa-me aqui
Sentir o pulsar do teu coração
A tua mão contra o meu corpo
Assim o deixa quase que morto

Vibrando enrolado com todo o pecado
Com toda a paixão
À espera da fera que dorme dentro de mim
Isto não vai ficar assim

Não dá, não dá
Levar-te a ver o mundo sem que largues o sofá
Não dá, não dá
Queres fazer amor comigo sem tirar o wonderbra

Mostra-me o que sabes fazer
Deixa-me ser o teu bailado privado, que só se ama
Quando se dança com quem nos balança
E nos faz viver

Surpreende-me, dá-me o melhor
Tenho medo de te beijar
E se me deito, arfante o peito
Respiro o teu leito, e devolvo o amor

Não dá, não dá
Levar-te a ver o mundo sem que largues o sofá
Não dá, não dá
Queres fazer amor comigo sem tirar o wonderbra

",Não Dá
Pedro Abrunhosa,"Nunca fui um herói e nunca soube voar
E por tras dos meus olhos uns olhos serenos de mar
Que te vem fundo num mundo e em todo o lugar

Sou memória de ti tu es poema e arara
Eu sou a sombra da fera que espera ou a voz do Guevara
Sou o silêncio que te canta e espanta e nunca te agarra

Deixa a minha mão guiar o teu caminho
Não é a solidão que faz um homem sozinho
E paz na dor que sei de cor e o teu sabor
No céu que meu e onde grito

Eu nunca te perdi e nunca te deixei
Eu nunca te esqueci em ti eu repousei
Eu nunca te perdi e nunca te deixei
Eu nunca te esqueci por ti eu despertei
Eu nunca te perdi

Já não sou o mesmo no sou mais o mágico
Que te encantou te levou ao deserto
Tão perto daquilo que sou que te fez forte
E rio e mar que agora secou

Eu já não sou eterno
Sou mais uma página do teu caderno
Rasgada e arrancada força do vento

Tantas vezes escrita no carinho do tempo
E as noites perdidas que dizias que não
Janelas fechadas a esconder a razão

Deixa o meu olhar ser a luz da tua estrada
No ao acordar que o sonho madrugada a paz na dor
Que sei de cor e teu sabor
No céu que meu e onde grito

Eu nunca te perdi e nunca te deixei
Eu nunca te esqueci por ti eu despertei

Eu nunca te perdi e nunca te deixei
Eu nunca te esqueci em ti eu repousei
Eu nunca te perdi eu nunca te deixei
Eu nunca te esqueci por ti eu despertei
Eu nunca te perdi

",Nunca Te Perdi
Pedro Abrunhosa,"Frio
O mar
Por entre o corpo
Fraco de lutar
Quente,
O chão
Onde te estendo
Onde te levo a razão.
Longa a noite
E só o sol
Quebra o silêncio,
Madrugada de cristal.
Leve, lento, nu, fiel
E este vento
Que te navega na pele.
Pede-me a paz
Dou-te o mundo
Louco, livre assim sou eu
(Um pouco +...)
Solta-te a voz lá do fundo,
Grita, mostra-me a cor do céu.

Se eu fosse um dia o teu olhar,
E tu as minhas mãos também,
se eu fosse um dia o respirar
E tu perfume de ninguém. 
Se eu fosse um dia o teu olhar,
E tu as minhas mãos também,
se eu fosse um dia o respirar
E tu perfume de ninguém.

Sangue,
Ardente,
Fermenta e torna aos 
Dedos de papel.
Luz,
Dormente,
Suavemente pinta o teu rosto a
pincel.
Largo a espera,
E sigo o sul,
Perco a quimera
Meu anjo azul.
Fica, forte, sê amada,
Quero que saibas
Que ainda não te disse nada.
Pede-me a paz
Dou-te o mundo
Louco, livre assim sou eu

Refrão",Se Eu Fosse Um Dia O Teu Olhar
Pedro Abrunhosa,"Às vezes pergunto que mais te hei-de eu fazer
Tanto orgulho ferido, tanta paz por vencer
Às vezes detesto o que resta de mim
Sempre longe do mundo, sempre perto do fim

Eu só quero que tu saibas quem sou
Ter a certeza que o meu tempo chegou
Quero que me digas para partir ou ficar

Se eu voltar atrás
Será que dizes que sim outra vez
Tomas conta de mim de vez em quando
Se eu voltar

Já cantei as palavras, e as pedras do chão
Pelas ruas estreitas vendi toda a razão
Já te disse poemas que não quis escrever
Foram gritos apenas que não soube conter

Eu só quero que tu saibas quem sou
Ter a certeza que o meu tempo chegou
Quero que me digas para partir ou ficar

Se eu voltar atrás
Será que dizes que sim outra vez
Tomas conta de mim de vez em quando
Se eu voltar

Eu só quero que tu saibas quem sou

Quero que me digas para partir ou ficar

Se eu voltar atrás
Será que dizes que sim outra vez
Tomas conta de mim de vez em quando
Se eu voltar

",Se Eu Voltar
Pedro Abrunhosa,"Será que ainda me resta tempo contigo
Ou já te levam balas de um qualquer inimigo
Será que soube dar-te tudo o que querias
Ou deixei-me morrer lento no lento morrer dos dias

Será que fiz tudo o que podia fazer
Ou fui mais um cobarde nao quis ver sofrer
Será que lá longe ainda o céu é azul
Ou já o negro cinzento confude o norte com o sul

Será que a tua pele ainda é macia
Ou é a mão que me treme sem ardor nem magia
Será que ainda te posso valer
Ou já a noite descobre a dor que encobre o prazer

Será que é de febre este fogo
Este grito cruel que da lebre faz lobo
Será que amanha ainda existe para ti
Ou ao ver-te nos olhos te beijei e morri

Será que lá fora os carros passam ainda
Ou estrelas cairam e qualquer sorte é bem vinda
Será que a cidade ainda está como dantes
Ou cantam fantasmas e bailam gigantes

Será que o sol se põe do lado do mar
Ou a luz que me agarra é sombra de luar
Será que as casas cantam e as pedras do chão
Ou calou-se a montanha rendeu-se o vulcão

Será que sabes que hoje é domingo
Ou os dias nao passam são anjos caindo
Será que me consegues ouvir
Ou é tempo que pedes quando tentas sorrir

Será que sabes que te trago na voz
Que o teu mundo é o meu mundo e foi feito por nós
Será que te lembras da cor do olhar
Quando juntos a noite não quer acabar

Será que sentes esta mão que te agarra
Que te prende com a força do mar contra a barra
Será que consegues ouvir-me dizer
Que te Amo tanto quanto outro dia qualquer

Eu sei que tu estarás sempre por mim
Não há noite sem dia nem dia sem fim
Eu sei que me queres e me Amas também
Me desejas agora como nunca ninguém

Não partas entao não me deixes sozinho
Vou beijar o teu chão e chorar o caminho

Será
Será
Será
Será

",Será
Pedro Abrunhosa,"Dá-me forte no chão
Não me peças o teu nome
Que uns dias sei mas hoje não

Mostra-me se sabes dançar
Com esse jogo de pernas
Nem dá para duvidar

E quando estou cansado
É quando fico mais louco

Sexo, sexo, sexo
Leva-me até ao fim
Sexo, sexo, sexo
És tu para mim

Sexo, sexo, sexo
Leva-me até ao fim
Sexo, sexo, sexo
Deixa-me assim

Agarra-me nessa parede
Bebe do meu corpo
Tenta matar a sede

Na cama ardente, na areia
Confesso estar perdido
Nos teus braços de sereia

Rapta-me para onde quiseres
Sou meigo quando posso
Ou um lobo se preferes

Sexo, sexo, sexo
Leva-me até ao fim
Sexo, sexo, sexo
És tu para mim

Sexo, sexo, sexo
Leva-me até ao fim

Deixa-me assim

Crava essas unhas na pele
Faz de ti a minha queixa
De mim sombra de papel

Mostra-me o teu covil
Deixa de mentir
Sou mais um entre miles

Por ti posso sofrer
Leva-me ao teu mundo
Faz o que tens a fazer

Sexo, sexo, sexo
Leva-me até ao fim

Sexo, sexo, sexo
Leva-me até ao fim
Sexo, sexo, sexo
Deixa-me assim

Levei o teu sabor
A tua pele, o teu perfume
Deixei na tua cama
Todo o toque que nos une
Fugi como quem teme

E quem ama a solidão
Serei homen quando o leme
Conduzir a minha mão

Quero-te encontrar
Mostrar-te enfim prazer
Não te posso perdoar
Seres hmm, seres
Hmm, e seres mulher

Hoje acordei para te ver dançar
Corpo de tigre, pele de luar
Breve nos olhas, quente a respirar
Hoje acordei para te, mmm

Sexo, sexo, sexo

Pedro Abrunhosa,"Batem relógios no raiar dos dias
Por cada batida novas fantasias
Loucas palavras, luzes cor de mel
Ventos que trazem nuvens de papel

Diz-me o que hei, de eu fazer
Sinto no tempo o meu tempo a morrer
Quanto mais longe mais perto de ti

Vozes ao longe chamam por mim
Cantigas, magia, passos de arlequim
Estrelas cadentes na palma da mão
Milagres, duendes, rasgos de paixão

Diz-me o que hei, de eu fazer
Sinto no tempo o meu tempo a morrer
Quanto mais longe mais perto de ti

Ouço os segredos do fundo do mar
Barcos perdidos, sereias a cantar
Trago o teu nome escrito no peito
Volta para mim, faz teu o meu leito

Vou ficar a escrever,
E talvez vá vencer
O teu longo caminho

Quero que saibas
Que sem ti não há lua,
Nem as árvores crescem,
Ou as mãos amanhecem
Entre as sombras da rua

Leva os meus braços,
Esconde-te em mim,
Que a dor do silêncio 
Contigo eu venço
Num beijo assim

Leva os meus braços,
Esconde-te em mim,
Que a dor do silêncio

Não posso deixar de sentir-te
Na memória das mãos,
Vou ficar a despir-te,
E talvez ouça rir-te
Nas paredes, no chão
Não posso mentir que as lágrimas
São saudades do beijo,
Vou ficar mais despido
Que um corpo vencido,
Perdido em desejo

Quero que saibas
Que sem ti não há lua,
Nem as árvores crescem,
Ou as mãos amanhecem

Pedro Aznar,"Dawn breaks shattering like a statue
Like a statue of wings that scatter throughout the city
And noon sings like a bell made of water
A bell made of golden water that keeps us from loneliness
And the night lifts its tall goblet
Its tall, tall goblet, early moon over the sea

But for Maria there is no dawn
But for Maria there is no midday
But for Maria there is no moon
Lifting its red goblet over the waters

Maria has no time to lift her eyes
Maria to lift her eyes, broken by lack of sleep
Maria broken by lack of sleep from so much suffering
Maria from so much suffering, all she does is work

Maria just works and works
Maria only works
And her work enriches others",Maria Lando
Pedro Aznar,"Tantas veces me mataron, tantas veces me morí
Sin embargo estoy aquí resucitando
Gracias doy a la desgracia y a la mano con puñal
Porque me mató tan mal y seguí cantando
Cantando al sol como la cigarra
Después de un año bajo la tierra

Igual que sobreviviente
Que vuelve de la guerra
Tantas veces me borraron, tantas desaparecí
A mi propio entierro fui solo y llorando
Hice un nudo en el pañuelo pero me olvidé después
Que no era la única vez y seguí cantando

Cantando al sol
Tantas veces te mataron, tantas resucitarás
Cuántas noches pasarás desesperando
Y a la hora del naufragio y la de la oscuridad
Alguien te rescatará para ir cantando
Cantando al sol",Como la Cigarra
Pedro Aznar,"Que lindo que yo me acuerde
De Don Juan Riera cantando
Que así le gustaba al hombre

Panadero Don Juan Riera
Con el lucero amasaba
Y daba esa flor de trigo
Como quien entrega el alma

Como le iban a robar
Ni queriendo a Don Juan Riera
Si a los pobres les dejaba
De noche la puerta abierta

A veces hacia jugando
Un pan de palomas blancas
Harina su corazón,
Al cielo se le volaba
Por su amistad en el vino
Sin voz queriendo cantaba
Y a su canción como al pan
La iban salando sus lágrimas",Zamba de Juan Panadero

Dandole gracias al cielo
Que te quito de mi camino
Dandole gracias a Dios que tu

No fuiste mi destino
Y haberme quedado sola
Creo que fue mejor

Que no me hacen recordarte
Y una voz de tras de mi me dice

Que eh logrado olvidarte
De a verme quedado sola doy
Gracia a Dios

Sola porque ya no te quiero
Sola porque sin ti no muero
Sola porque ya no pude aguantar
Que jugaras con mi corazón

Sola porque me siento herida
Sola quiero seguir mi vida
Y ahora me encuentro mas libre
Y mas fuerte que nunca y es por eso
Que hoy prefiero estar sola

Sola me encuentro sola
Pero de esta experiencia
Hay algo que voy agradecerte

El a verme dado un ser que amo
Y es amor incomparable
Creo que ya no estoy tan sola
Y hoy te digo adiós

Sola porque ya no te quiero
Sola porque sin ti no muero
Sola porque ya no pude aguantar

La brisa de primavera que abanica al corazón 
Y soplas en mi balcón flores nuevas 
Con el alma en luna llena de mi amor en construcción

Me ensañaste a ver el cielo cada día mas azul 
Me haz llenado de colores y alegrías 
Y una princesita mía eres por quien brilla el sol 
Rómpeme el alma juega conmigo 
Y que me importa ser juguete de tu amor 
Si a mi vida le haz dado un sentido 
Mátame a besos vuélveme preso 
En la cárcel de tus labios quiero estar 
Junto a ti frente al altar 
Mi religión

Y en tu espalda yo aprendí a caminar 
Y encontré vereda dulce hasta tu cuello 
Fue tu pelo me enredo y tus labios la estación 
Donde habita el alma mía 
Rómpeme el alma juega conmigo 
Que me importa ser juguete de tu amor 
Si a mi vida le haz dado un sentido 
Mátame a besos vuélveme preso 
Eres tu mi religión y eres el templo de mis ansias 
Dueña de mi corazón mi adoración 
Te rezo te sueño eres regalo del cielo

¿Qué tú no hace' na'? Preciosa
déjate de cosas, tú sabes que estás deliciosa
Ay, de tu prosa
Yo quisiera ser la musa
Tú tiene' algo que engatuza
Será la luna llena
Será cómo me miras
Siento que me hipnotizas
Me enciendo como vela en tus altares

Veo luz de un misterio

Buscando solo una gotita de tu agua bendita

Deja te quito el sueño
Yo tengo skills
Pero no tengo dueño
Estoy no es fácil
Yo soy un reto
Para caminar sobre piedras de fuego
Pues le pongo empeño
Pongo los pies sobre el incendio
Por tanto enchule no hay remedio
Por mi criterio, que te den todititos los premios
Las otras quítense de en medio
El verde de tu mirada
Me enreda, mi amor
Me llama
Y a mí tú me encantas todo
Tienes algo que me enboba

Pedro Capó,"Tanto tiempo perdido, tanta distracción
Atrapado en el rio de mi profesión
Quiero estar donde tú estés, ya me voy de aquí
Cerrar los ojos y un, dos, tres llegar a ti
Llamare tu nombre hasta perder la voz
Lanzare mis besos como piedras al balcón
Te juro que no tardo en regresar
Me pierdo pero te vuelvo a encontrar
Me vendo todo y te voy a buscar
Para compartir la soledad

Me sobra libertad, me sobre el universo si no estas
Me muero por llegar a tu lugar
Para compartir la soledad
Tantas noches sin verte hambriento de ti
Encerando en mi mente desde que partí
Quiero estar donde tú estés, ya me voy de aquí
Cerrar los ojos y un, dos, tres estar en ti
Nadare en tu cuerpo hasta que salga el sol
Buscare mi nombre bajo tu respiración
Te juro que no tardo en regresar
Me pierdo pero te vuelvo a encontrar
Me vendo todo y te voy a buscar

Para compartir la soledad
Me sobra libertad, me sobre el universo si no estas
Me muero por llegar a tu lugar

Pedro Capó,"Bailas, coqueteándole al sol
Alterando la paz fluyendo contra la corriente
Reina, de la espontaneidad
En tu trenza una flor, en tu pecho revolución

Callar tu voz pero eres ave en movimiento
Y el cielo abierto, se hizo pa' volar

Libre como el viento, libre el pensamiento
Libre de sufrimientos sin sentido
Libre mi sonrisa y el botón de tu camisa
Libre de tanta prisa libre en el amor

Fieras en el reino animal, aprendiendo a vivir
Y escribiendo una página sin fin
Profesando al andar sin temor a caer
Saboreándonos el momento
El mundo intenta convencernos
Vendernos cuentos, tomar control
No ven no, no logran comprender
Que el campo abierto se hizo pa' correr

Libre como el viento, libre el pensamiento
Libre de sufrimientos sin sentido
Libre mi sonrisa y el botón de tu camisa
Libre de tanta prisa, libre en el amor

Sin nada que esconder
Ser o no ser
Saltar sin miedo al fondo incierto

Yo dejando las sonrisas en tu habitación que fuimos
Quiero que sueltes hoy mi mano que mires a otro lado
Que no sea mi lugar y si tu quieres podemos olvidarnos
De todo el pasado y amigos como siempre volver a comenzar
Que fácil fue olvidar lo que decíamos ayer que fácil

Fue permitir que otros labios me robaran tus abrazos
Y ya lo vez y no entiendo como se perdió ese roze
De tus manos que me dice adiós que fuimos quiero
Que sueltes hoy mi mano que mires a otro lado que
No sea mi lugar y si tu quieres podemos olvidarnos

Pedro Capó,"Me sonrío en el espejo
Otro día de sol en la ciudad
Me he prohíbido pensarte
Y ya es todo un arte
Aquí todo sigue igual
Yo me propuse olvidarte
Y no mirarte en todas partes
Y que mis labios no te vuelvan a nombrar
Pero en realidad

Todo me recuerda ti
Me he tratado de engañar
No podré sobrevivir
Jugando con la soledad
Y el silencio que dejaste aquí hoy
Sigo preso en tu recuerdo
No ha pasado un día en que no piense en ti
Guardé todas tus fotos
Escondé tus caricias en aquel cajón

Hay tirado en un rincón
Pero no sirve de nada
Cuando extraña el corazón
Yo me propuse olvidarte
Y no mirarte en todas partes
De que mis labios no te vuelvas
A nombrar
Pero en realidad
Todo me recuerda ti

Me he tratado de engañar

Ay, como se cura este mal
Ay, como duele estar sin ti
Ya no quiero estar así
Tan solo aquí

Vivo esperando tras la puerta
La he dejado medio abierta
Por si te animas a venir
Ya que en realidad
Todo me recuerda ti
Me he tratado de engañar
Pa' poder podré sobrevivir

De la mañana hasta la noche

Que pueda separarnos
No hay, que permitirlo

Quiero estar siempre contigo
Déjame besarte toda
Y por siempre ser tu abrigo
Quiero amanecer contigo
Lo que me reste de vida
Despertar con tu sonrisa
Es mi vida y mi alegría
Quiero envejecer contigo

Pedro Fernández,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",El Ganador (The Winner Takes It All)

Un presentimiento en mi pensamiento me dió la verdad.
La humilde casita que fue nuestro nido muy triste quedó
Sólo tu perfume quedó en el recuerdo de aquel gran amor.

Tu procedimiento me hizo padecer
Dejando en mi pecho una herida cruel
Y al verte rendida, por otra ilusión
De celos y angustia mataste mi amor.

Por una mujer que ha pagado mal
Pero yo no pude contener mi llanto
Cerrando los ojos, me puse a llorar.

Pedro Guasti,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere",Here There & Everywhere
Pedro Guasti,"Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin aire
Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin agua
Me encantaría quererte un poco menos
Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin ti
Pero no puedo, siento que muero
Me estoy ahogando sin tu amor

Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin aire
Cómo quisiera calmar mi aflicción
Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin agua
Me encantaría robar tu corazón
¿Cómo pudiera un pez nadar sin agua
¿Cómo pudiera un ave volar sin alas

¿Cómo pudiera la flor crecer sin tierra
Cómo quisiera poder vivir sin ti
Pero no puedo, siento que muero
Me estoy ahogando sin tu amor
Cómo quisiera

Cómo quisiera lanzarte al olvido
Cómo quisiera guardarte en un cajón
Cómo quisiera borrarte de un soplido
Me encantaría matar esta canción",Vivir Sin Aire

Pedro Infante,"Corazón tu dirás lo que hacemos 
Lo que resolvemos 
Nomas quiero que marques el paso 
Que no le hagas caso, si las ves llorar 

Que no te oiga que lates tan fuerte 
No sea que con suerte 
Vaya a creer que le estamos rogando 
Que andamos buscando volver a empezar 
Ay corazón 
Mas vale así 
Nomas no te sobresaltes 
Que si me fallas 
Pues ya perdí 
Corazón mas si acaso no puedes 
Si caes en sus redes 
Te aconsejo que tengas paciencia 
Sera tu sentencia sufrir y callar 
Mas como la paciencia se acaba 
Prepara una daga 
Por si acaso el destino te falla 
Te pinta una raya que no has de brincar 
Ay corazón 
Mas vale así 
Nomas no te sobresaltes 
Que si me fallas 
Pues ya perdí",Pobre Corazon
Pedro Infante,"Te vas por un momento 
Te vas diciendo que vuelves 
Que vuelves pronto a quererme mas
Te vas y yo presiento 
Que aquí se acaba todo 
Que ya a mi vida no volverás

Que triste agonía, tener que olvidarte 
Queriéndote así
Que suerte la mía, después de una pena 
Volver a sufrir
Que triste agonía, después de caído 
Volver a caer
Que suerte la mía, estar tan perdido 
Y volver a perder

Amor, amor sagrado 
Así me lo habías jurado 
Ante una virgen ante un altar
Saliste igual que la otra 
Juraste muchas cosas 
Y al verme herido también te vas

Que triste agonía, tener que olvidarte 
Queriéndote así

Pedro Infante,"Voy a largarme de aquí
Llevare tu cariño primero
Como negra maldición
Tu soñaste dormida en mis brazos
Y a mi vida la hiciste pedazos
Has hecho pedazos a mi corazon

Pero ay amor
Fuiste mal comprendido
Mi corazon
Se quedo malherido
Y por eso ha de ser
Y por eso ha de ser
Tu castigo

Hoy que me alejo de aquí
Llorare por que se que te quiero			  
Mas no por que fuiste infiel
Si tus besos me diste primero
Y después este amor traicionero
Que todos mis sueños mataste con el

Se quedo malherido

Cómo viviré
Si no bajo coca del cerro;

Flores, canistel,
Mandarina, palmo, semilla

Y en mi boca pongo la coca

Mueren al nacer;
Y en el árbol crece la duda:
¿cómo viviré?

Permitido el miedo, la ausencia;
Se prohíbe amar.

Se permite el odio, la tregua
Permitido el día sin fiesta;
Se prohíbe andar.

Vamos a caminar?
Na, na, na, na

Yo trepé una mañana un lindo árbol
Cerca de mi hogar, casi tambaleando cogí las ramas, no pude bajar
Bajo ese árbol mucha gente iba a pasar
Agazapado asomaba los ojos casi sin mirar
Me dormí sobre las hojas oyendo el arrullar
De las aves hablando, el viento soplaba
Que hermoso lugar

Hice un poema que no pude recordar
Casi tiritando pasé la noche sin querer bajar
Estaba en el árbol, la ta ra ta ta
Poema en el árbol, la la ra la la
Estaba en el árbol, la la ra la la

Poema en el árbol
Pensé en mi vida y en los sueños de mi edad
Descubrí el milagro de la sonrisa después de llorar

El viejo árbol me enseñaba con su paz
Que él nunca hizo daño, y yo callado sentí inferioridad
Poema en el árbol, la la ra la la

Llegó el amanecer, no me quiero mover y el sol empieza a brillar
Todo lo puedo ver, jamás lo pude ver, mi voz no lo puede explicar

Poema de amor, la gente pasaba y yo suspiraba
Iba un día más sentado en las ramas, subido en el árbol cerca de mi hogar
No sé hasta cuando, no lo puedo recordar
Ahora ando mirando sin hacer daño, callado y sin pensar

Soy hijo del árbol, la la ra la la
Quiero ser el árbol, la la ra la la

Concho de vino el pelo
Delgada ojos de caramelo

Dicen que el amor es todo un proceso
Yo te juro que es mentira
Mi alma la amo en ese momento

Pedro Suárez-Vértiz,"Me siento mejor, mi situacion es nueva
Ultimamente he recuperado la fascinacion
No he descubierto no, cosas nuevas

Tan solo he regresado a las viejas
Al sueño de amor, y a los placeres
De la inspiracion
Me siento mejor, mi situacion es nueva
He descubierto que sigo siendo un tipo bonachon
Si yo dañe o ame en consecuencia
No golpeo mas mi conciencia
Fue mi corazon, amar a todos trae complicacion
La felicidad, pense que no era eterna
Y es que muy facil uno se enferma con la soledad
De los recuerdos no hago leyenda
La nostalgia ya no me tienta
Yo vivo en el hoy
Ni en el ayer ni en el mañana estoy
Conocí a una mujer, ella me dio su vida

Le regale miles de noticias en un medallon
Ella aguanto el sufrir mi imprudencia
De que me sirve ahora la experiencia
Ya se la leccion y sin embargo
No la olvido hasta hoy
La real situacion por la que va tu vida
Son las palabras que se te quedan en una cancion
Al cielo me ire, pero el demonio espera
Sigue esperando pues yo lo arruino
Con mi represion
No me acostumbro no, a la idea
De que el placer posea fronteras
Pero es lo mejor para este mundo en putrefaccion

Aquellas piernas que toque en la oscuridad

Yo soy un hombre de verdad

Se sentó en mi y no dejo de cabalgar

Subí el volumen mucho mas

Soy un fantasma a presión
Un As de luz que se va, un alguien que nunca entiendo
Sera tu dios mi verdad, yo no lo debo saber
Sera el, Amor mi veneno

La libertad es mi prisión, la sobredosis de paz
Destroza mis pensamientos
Yo soy la mancha en el sol, el remolino en el mar
Las hojas secas del viento,
Abrázame y llévame al final, llévame a las sombras, no me quiero encontrar
Perdóname si es que te hice llorar, tu alma en mi memoria es mi única verdad
Se tuerce el árbol, las maniobras me cansan
Son mis semillas quienes salvaran mi alma

Oh
Oh
Perdóname si es que te hice llorar
Perdona mis palabras, perdona mi verdad
Evocame y pide por mi paz que destroza mi memoria
Yo siempre la veo mal

Oh oh
Rescatame y vuélveme a enseñar, las luces que me ignoran, la luz que de la paz
Abrázame y llévame al final, llévame a las sombras, no me quiero encontrar

Otra noche en blanco y sin mentira

Nada en el espejo

Y si en la televisión ves un beso de amor pensarás en mí
Pensarás en mí

Serán dueños de tí, de tu ropa y tu voz no de tu corazón
Llegarás hasta el fin y vas a redescubrir que ese no soy yo
Si quizás la emoción te distrajo muy bien
Sabes que en tu pasión y momentos de fé, pensarás en mí
Pensarás en mí

Sé que suena insolente, pero no te hace mal
El secreto en tu mente, tiene que respirar

Nunca pienses que estoy con ausencia de amor me conoces bien
Con amor o sin él, te recuerdo muy bien siempre te amaré
Cuando escapo y lo real se convierte en ficción
Cuando salgo de mí, cuando llego hasta el fin siempre pienso en tí

Sé que suena insolente, pero no te hace mal

Sé que vas por ahí con amor en el pecho pensando en mi
Sé que te hace feliz caminar y reir pensando en mí

El amor de verdad no conoce obstrucción

On the edge, she took one last look around
Then closed her eyes and pushed away

Speeding toward the ground
Through the air without a sound
So gracefully

Twelve flights down, nearly naked on the ground
Skin and tragedy always attract a crowd
So it was when the policeman came around
He took more than fifty eyewitness accounts
Each one in awe, for they'd never seen a girl so sad and beautiful

Speeding toward the ground
Through the air without a sound
Speeding toward the ground
Through the air without a sound
So gracefully","June 18, 1976"
Pedro the Lion,"It's weird to think of all the things
That have not been keeping up with the times
It's ten o'clock the sun has just now
Begun to set the western hills on fire

And I hear that you don't change
How to you expect to keep up with the trends?
You won't survive the information age
Unless you plan to change the truth
To accommodate the brilliance of men, the brilliance of men

Some folks think we're better now
Social evolution's new synthetic will
Will keep us on a straighter path
As better men use brand new math
With no wrong answers

I'm just a little bit worried
Do you have some sort of plan?
Have you been finally defeated
By the cunning of these fully evolved men?

And I hear that you don't change
How do you expect to keep up with the trends?
You won't survive the information age
Unless you plan to change the truth
To accommodate the brilliance of men, the brilliance of men",Letter from a Concerned Follower [Radio Session]
Pedro the Lion,"Such an awful, tragic night
Though I've only done what's right
Even with my conscience clear
I can't help this flood of tears
I've got my eye on the finish line

Though I've been striving for their good
I will be misunderstood
Even my own darling dear
Misconstrued what was so clear

Give the time I think she would have understood
That it was for the greater good
Soon I will meet her at our mansion in the sky
Leaving this wicked world behind

It's strange that it should end this way
But martyrs never have a say",Eye on the Finish Line
Pedro the Lion,"Dear, unlock the door
You're acting like a child
When you've said it to yourself
We are at war
How dare you turn on me now
Right when I need you most
I wish I could have seen their faces 
When they heard the news
Now that's the sort of smack 
That leaves a bruise

The victory is ours at last
I beat them at their own dirty game
They pervert the words of godly men
For their own selfish gain
I took their wrong and I took their lies
And I made them right, 
I made them right

Oh, look who it is
It's my supportive wife
And she thinks she's going to squeal
Hey where do you think you're going?
Don't you walk away from me
You put down that telephone
You're not calling anyone",A Mind of Her Own
Pedro the Lion,"Blood stains on the carpet
Blood stains on my hands
Drag her toward the kitchen
Hide the evidence
Oh the toil a lie can bring
That quitters never know
But lies can be the perfect things
If they never show

The crisis posed a question
Just beneath the skin
The virtue in my veins reply
That quitters never win
She almost ruined everything",Never Leave a Job Half Done
Pedro the Lion,"The volunteers were tired
Heads were hanging low
The news had spoiled their appetite
For stuffing envelopes
Twelve points was an awful lot 
To be down in the polls
With only two weeks to go
Shouldering the phone
Loosening his tie
His running mate on pricks and pins
Hovering beside
The candidate wrote furiously 
As if to save his life
Then hung up the phone 
And spoke with great conviction
When you're nothing but a boyfriend
Dangling by a thread
Keep in mind the bottom line
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Inches from the goal
One thing on his mind
To get behind her desk and make
Some big decisions
Power can be such a tease
You're always wanting more
It's good to know that just like sex 
It can be paid for",Simple Economics
Pedro the Lion,"All the way to grandma's house
I stayed on the narrow path
But my brother wandered off
Deep into the woods
Bitten twice by rattle snakes
Tangled up in poison oak
He fell down and broke his legs
Into a great ravine
When I arrived at grandma's house
She made us tea and cake
She asked me where my brother was
I said I don't know and ate
When I get to heaven I'll be greeted warmly
Surrounded by angels
As Jesus takes my hand
I'll receive a mansion
On the river Jordan
And a crown of diamonds
For a race well run
I won't ever lock my doors
I will trust my neighbors
Confident that they deserve
To be there in heaven, too",Slow and Steady Wins the Race
Pedro the Lion,"Officer
Please don't haul me in
Though I'm drunk again
I can explain
I swear to you
For a week I have
Been completely dry
Until tonight
He's been such a good example
Everything he's done for me
I couldn't bear to let him down

Monday night
Brother sat me down
Very graciously
And explained
If I'm going to help you
I must make it very clear
Brother that I love you
But certainly I hate your sin
So you see you can't arrest me
I swore I'd be careful not to
Further shame the family name",To Protect the Family Name
