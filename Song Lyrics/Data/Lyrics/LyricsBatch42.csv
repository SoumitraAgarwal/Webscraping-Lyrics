Daryle Singletary,"Cheap perfume and painted faces
Fallen angles fill the places
Where I go when my troubles pull me down
And all the lies I know they'll tell me
And the time that they will sell me
For a while I'll be the biggest man in town

Back at home in bed she's crying
For her love for me is dying
But she'll pray I'll make it safely through the night
When the morning sun starts showing
To her bedside I'll be going
And she'll hold me while I face the morning light

And I'll make promises, promises to change
I'll make her promises and swear I'll rearrange
And I'll start giving all the love she needs
If only she will stay

Once again she'll reassure me
And I believe her love will cure me
And I'll fall asleep with tears on my face
Lord, I know she's just a woman
And her love can't last forever
And someday soon I know
She'll leave without a trace

For broken promises will tear her dreams apart
Just token promises will someday break her heart
And for the last time she'll hold me when I cry
And while I'm sleeping she'll quietly say goodbye",Proomises
Daryle Singletary,"Coffee black, cigarettes
Start this day like all the rest
First thing in the morning that I do
Is start missing you

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die

Rendezvous in the night
A willing woman to hold me tight
But in the middle of love's embrace
I see your face

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die

Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die
My love for you will never die",Some Broken Hearts Never Mend
Daryle Singletary,"I woke up this morning aching with pain
Don't think I can work, but I'll try
The car's in the shop so I thumbed all the way
Oh, these days I barely get by

I walked home from work and it rained all the way
My wife left and didn't say why
She laid all her bills on the desk in the hall
Oh, these days I barely get by

Put my only two dollars on my favorite horse
He lost by a nose and I cried
Oh, my boss says come winter we'll all be laid off
Oh, these days I barely get by

These days I barely get by
I want to give up, lay down and die
Worst of all was when she told me goodbye
Oh, these days I barely get by
Oh, these days, one barely gets by",These Days I Barely Get By
Daryle Singletary,"[Chorus]
We're gonna hold on
We're gonna hold on
We're gonna hold on to each other

Life can be rough, sometimes it's kind
A real good life is hard to find
But the best love is the one we've known
And the faith we have between us makes it grow

Some love lives and some love don't
We've got the kind of love we want
It brings us happiness all through the day
And nothin' can ever make it go away

[Chorus]

Time will tell if you're right or wrong
We know we're right by holdin' on
And the future is set for you and me
Filled with love, the way we both want it to be

[Chorus]

We're gonna hold on",We're Gonna Hold On
Daryll Dobson,"I come up hard baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playin' by the rules
I come up hard baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar, movin' down the line
I come up hard baby, but that's okay
'Cause trouble man, don't get in my way
I come up hard baby, I've been for real
Gonna keep movin', gonna go to town
I come up hard baby, I'm gettin' down

Taxes, death and trouble

This I know, baby
This I know, sugar
Girl, I ain't gon' let it sweat me, baby
Got me singin'
Yeah , yeah, whoa
I come up hard, 
I've had to fight
Take care of my business, 
With all my might
I come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over, and win again
I come up hard, but that's okay
'Cause trouble man
Don't get in my way
I know some places and I've seen some faces
I've got good connections they dig in my directions
What people say that's okay
They don't bother me 

Ready to make it, don't fool with no women
Don't care 'bout no trouble got myself together
I feel a kind of protection is all around me
This I know baby
Girl, I ain't gonna let it sweat me, baby

Daryll-Ann,"Some thoughts are weak, I easily forget 
But every now and then, they're messing up my head 

Talking like a child that wants to have its way 
I'm learning every day 
To speak up and to say 

I'm allright - take a chance on myself today 
Uptight - and it's never enough 

I'm allright - take a chance on myself today

Daryll-Ann,"She'll only be a minute 
Just going through her hair 
There's gonna be a wedding 
Wish I could be there 
But then again: why should I be alone?

Her first man was a sadist 
Who drank her tears like wine 
Until she mixed his coffee 
With something alkaline 
She left him at the table 
And slammed the door 

My ancestors have let me down 
I asked for fame in every town 
All along they wear me out 
Our ancestors 

Only be a minute 
Going through her hair 
I watched another wedding 
I watched until I cried 
Over all the loved ones, men and wives 

My ancestors have let me down 
I asked for fame in every town 
All along they wear me out 
Our ancestors have let me down 
I asked for fame in every town 
All along they wear me out

Daryll-Ann,"I cannot I believe you 
If you say that you're not afraid 
For something blows your mind 
The face I've never seen 

Never roam about anymore 
I reckon every move you make 
But somehow you won't be around no more, no more 

I only know the little boy you were 
You're growing older and I'm scared to lose you 

Will you ever believe when I say 
There's something strange about you 
Its just that I won't take the blame anymore anymore, no more

Daryll-Ann,"I still can recall the time 
I'll never be the same again 
You, sore and withered eyes 
Those were the years we left behind 

Hard to get you off my mind 
You always get your way, my friend 
Eyes wide open all the time 
Those were the years we left behind 

I was foolin' around but hardly reachin' out 
It never crossed my mind but now I'm sorry 
But I know that I tried to find a reason for your smile 
Now it's all but memory, gone

Efficiently, chemically 
As many pills as life's virtual emotions

Daryll-Ann,"Days are over, lights are loud 
There's nothing left to talk about 
Free from every strain 
Another year, another weary love 

You're brighter than the light I'm in 
Sometimes you ache, you burn my skin 
And be your friend 
The more I see the more I think I don't 

Though I feel so much near the fountain 
There's a lot to be left behind 
Still I wonder about the flavour in life 

Days are over, lights are loud 
And nothing left to talk about 
Free from every strain 
Another year, another dream apart 

Though I feel so much near the fountain 
There's a lot to be left behind 
Still I wonder about the flavour.. 
I feel so much near the fountain

Daryll-Ann,"Hide away your love in anger
Low esteem without a warning
Kill the weak for worse for better
Till the morning comes around

She built the wall till no one's there
When everywhere there's anger
There's no one really there
Always on the losing end
Everyone's enacted from the start

Ride a wave one to remember
Rock the reef for such a long time
Catch the ride until September
Guard your gracious life


She built a wall what else is new
Where everyone's an actor
And everybody's cool
She's always on the losing end
Everyone's enacted from the start

And your smile so gently
Yet so silently
School flows in front of my eyes
Coloured shapes captured
In a twisted mind

Empty words
Honeybee, slowly go
Where I'm free
Sorrow sight for lonely eyes
Hummin' all the way

True love come over me
You might have changed so easy
Yet so finally

Only 13 fell in love
Just one word, just another photograph

Empty words, phrases
Honeybee, slowly go
To where I long to be
Sorrow sight for lonely eyes
Hummin' all the way

Empty words

Where I'm free

Daryll-Ann,"There's a car by the door
Can I stay or shall I go
It'll surely be, my resort
Leave me be, leave me love
I will go

And I know where I will be tonight
Pickin' shells on the riverside

Keep the land, I once knew
In my own hands, in my own hands
Share with us, last resort
Keep the dream alive, and trust
On your own

And I know where I will be tonight
Pickin' shells at the riverside
Unto the other side, unto the other side

Come again, so close
I didn't hear you right
You're so uptight
Through the hallway, onto the doorway
Keep the dream alive
And trust, in yourself

And I know where I will be tonight
Pickin' shells on the riverside
I know where I will be tonight
Pickin' shells on the riverside
I know where I will be tonight
Shouldn't keep her waiting
Keep your head held high",Riverside

I took the wrong train
Ended up in the centre of your mind

I sing to neighbours in a funny way
Hoping they will wonder why I smile
It's supertuesday on a Friday-night

Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law
Got me thinking 'bout the law

I trade my handshake
For a night in the arms of the law
I meet the day-break
Telling God 'bout the miracles I saw

I walk for hours in a blurry state
Might as well be care-less for a while
It's love-transmission on a superday

I got no heart-beat
Since I last saw you waving goodbye
I took the fast train
And it felt like the law was on my side

Hooray to every ball
All that he wants
Is to be part of the winners

In bending for hours on the river

Inside the heart of the maniac
And rivers frozen over
Ice is growing
For at least this merry winter
In the hearts
Of those related to the brace
For every river bears his autograph
He rides them all
At least this merry winter
Keeps him going
Tranquilizes on a journey back

Daryll-Ann,"Only a world war could even up the scores
Beyond debate, negotiate
Now it's too late

We stay up for peace talks, we're busy drawing lines
Don't be kind, we all stand trial
Now equally sympathy fills the room

Could we end this like we started
Spend a little time
Just reading lips and reading minds

Now equally sympathy fills the room
Fills their minds

You give life then turn it grey

Where has it gone
From where I stand
You're moving on
These times were made
For a solitary gaze upon

Broken dreams and glamorous stars

She finds her thrills in all her manic frame

Take care of my mirror
Don't let go
Be aware of the new dimension

And deserted bars

Verse One: Dray

Aiyo peep it, can you keep it down while I rock 
tick tock about this chick around the block?
She was high host, to the most hostess, no boastin
Back in '85, she was live, yo no jokin
A real go-getter, didn't try and sweat her
Fifteen years old and she was pushin a jetter
She had loot, moms and pops dukes had the bankin
She walked around school and the stunt would act stankin
Bitch, young Miss, only dated older fellas
My slang couldn't hang, no thang, I wasn't jealous of her

Chorus

Verse Two: Dray

Oh yeah, where was I? Bustin, now I'm ready
Now it's '87 and Miss Thing is goin steady
She was schoolin, chillin 'cause her man was makin papers
Tellin all her friends that these niggas caught the vapors
He found her, phoned her, then yo we boned her
Soon came a smack then he act like he owned her
He used her, 'bused her, fractured her wrist
then the Tommy got slapped behind her back gettin dissed
I was buggin, nuff on the stuff that I was seein
But that's how it goes for the hoes when they're bein......

Chorus

Verse Three: Skoob

Aiyo mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror on my dresser
Remember that chick Loretta, back in the days I used ta sweat her
I wanted to smoke the boots, troop, it didn't matter
She was kickin it to my man Stan who's livin phatter
than me, hops, chillin in my hoodie and my Reebok's
Now she's in a jam 'cause, Stan was slangin rocks, but
look at me now, honey, 'cause this the morning after
I'm yapper, a nappy-headed undaground rappa
Word to mom dukes, she was suits so I took her to my show
Just to show my niggas that the hooker was.....

Chorus

Verse Four: Skoob

Ah the show was phat, now it's back to the room, G
Yo mirror, this is where Loretta tried to do me
My neck was on her tongue, *?Ep's?* was gettin swung
Krayz was gettin biz with the friend that she brung
Then she took it upon herself to let me know she's in the mood-a
Then she licked her boot-a, oh shoot-a, I screwed her
I showed her, I rolled her, from here to North Dakota
I gangbanged the boots like a Brooklyn troop oughta
I stuck it in her [BACKWARDS], bust a nut, she was starvin
So I pushed in the bush til those lips started partin, but she was.......

Ya better get ya plate because I'm servin' raps for dinner
See I freak it from the sewer plus I'm quick to do ya posse
I'm swoopin' on the note just like I was a kamikaze
See they thought I lost my spot so they went and got real comfy
So now I gotta hit me hard and Bogart like Humphrey
Ya hypocrite, I'm rippin' it because I'm flyer
Ya phony, full of bologna like Oscar Meyer
See I attack a pack of rappers just for practice
I bust my tactics, I'm sharper than a fucking axis

(Set it off!) One two (Set it off!)
Yeah it's the Books in reverse, the next cap sendin' a big-up to my borough
I'm thorough, wetter than a ghetto from Medini-Bop
Takin' lessons, swayin' niggas on graffiti
Rockin' other slang ranger, bring a banger occasion
My nerves is achin', see I'm sick of niggas perpetratin'
But can't see this, I'm screamin' on they records like Beavis
Or Butthead, I bust heads like Amy
Fisher isser, blisser, hit you like an accident
And if I'm in your town you might meet me at the Radisson

A bigger nigga with my left and then I flick em with my right
I'm outta sight, look how I do it, ya blew it if you missed a
Nigga on the microphone 'cause I can roll a sister
Word is bond, I'm on some nuke shit, new shit like this
Grab a piece of steel and shoot the Giff like Chris
Kringle, lost my jingle, don't it make ya shiver
Give a nigga what he needs so he can bleed when I deliver
Aah microphone check, what the heck?
I do that then because I used to catch a wreck
Wit it, that's the time I hot talk, spit it
For Christ's sake I'm in to hit the brakes and you're skiddin'
You nigga in, messiah did it, but y'all can keep that
'Cause now I'm on some other type of flow and best believe that

And all that, small cat, my format, deranged
Honey I'm back to run things 'cause some things is never changed, punk!
So if you're drunk, I freak the funk until you're sober
But still be gettin' chills when niggas know that winter's over
Kickin' the flam yo it's the man, tick tock, I jam like gridlock
My style is fender bendin' sendin' rappers to the pit stop
Good lord o' mercy, hit reverse if you missed it
And busboy give the speech 'cause like a preacher, baby I'm twisted
Kid I swing a dome-buster light, bone crush a smith
Bust up your lips then puff up a spliff
So yo, who be dat? Dat want to do me like this to get

Takin' out these quick 'cause my nigga Books is next on it

I know you're not set, check it, you're wonderin' where the heck I've been
Chillin' stupid, 'cause there ain't no dooper who got wrecker than
The Boogie Banger, it could be danger so back, tootz
'Cause we're guys but niggas want to revise they rap books
What up kid? I can sell you rugged with the hip-hoppin
Throw it, like to see me from my nuts until my dick top
What a bummer, it seem to be no MC can get dumber than
Me one other, two niggas from the
Sewer, my shit is new without the magnesia
'Cause G, I be's the man from here to Indonesia
Aah yeah, you heard me, see I'm just another dirty dick
Drastically, casually I puff the erb to get zone like the Senate, so

Here I come so nigga don't be hatchin' it, I'm snatchin' it, niggas o'dose
When I catch this
Niggas in the dark, I spark at them like I was matches
I set up quicker, kick a verse with no distortion
I suggest emcees proceed with some caution
I hip, tip, grippin' tit because there ain't no
Way I'm gonna lift when I erupt like a volcano
I'm acid, my crew is massive, you're soft like jello
I'm gettin' props, a habit like Abbott and Costello
When I flaunt this, niggas want this, they'll be usin'
A squeegee when I'm bitchin' 'cause bitch I'm comin' to get your ass

Comin' to get'cha it's the D-Bats so nigga think back to the way I bring this
Or brung that, I swung that, now look at the way I'm swingin' this
Just like my name was Joe DiMaggio
And hell Dray! My twelve gauge spit shells like pizaggio
We can get it on and my word is bond and fuck who you be G
Your crew is easy just like Sunday mornin' when I'm yawnin' so
It's no sense in you losin' what you got kid
'Cause G I be doin' the mic like Mr. T be doin' the chopsticks
Ya gets done like no matter where ya from, jack
For fun, I'm nailin' rappers like a thumb tack

Now's the time to make my move 'cause I'm out to do tha
kid that tried to slip for some buda, sleep (word up)
I peeped every spot his boys be, I got crew
But what am I do is get somebody new to do it for me
I'm catchin wreck to prove a point, time is loot
and I ain't spinnin it in the joint but better yet
These days I'm all professional, some new [shit] I got
I check this nigga that I used to snatch jewels wit
back in the day but nevertheless the kid's ass' slingin gas
to pay bills to 'ford some pills that kill stress (I hear ya kid)
Now as for me G let's just say I learnt the rules
I paid my dues and now I cruise in my Lexus
No better time than the present to make him an offer
He can't refuse but might regret it, so I'ma set it

Verse 2: Dray

Well, umm, take this job and shove it

Catch a fit money grip 'cause pumpin gas is a bitch way
Niggas be ridin by my job and frontin like they bitchin
I want to bust wit disgust 'cause I'm sour (aha)
Takin all the [shit] and only gettin four dollars a hour
There go some bitches swearin that they better
givin a cold shoulder as they roll by in the [fuckin] jetter
I gets no pay though 'cause they know that you know

I'm bustin my ass but my cash just ain't stockin
Now who's this creepin up the [fuckin] block-in?
Clockin, lookin like he really want to test this
Just another dick, I oughta stick him for that Lexus
The [shit] is killin me, why this kid grillin me?

Well comin to school ya it's the hooligan, I'm in the mood again so watch

I'm out to do these rappers just like Popeye did Brutus
The super dooper trooper, oops I'm no beginner
So watch me get loose and run [shit] like Bill Skinner
I formulate my raps, perhaps you want to kick it
There's niggas down my slack, yes I'm the baddest when I wreck it
See I'm nicer than the rest, I guess I gots ta prove it
Ya cruisin for a bruisin if ya bite it when I use it
See I'm quick to shoot the giff, and if ya tryin ta stop it
I got mad skills like loose change in my pocket
I drop it from the East, at least I'm gettin mine in
Some niggas gettin jealous 'cause of the way that I be rhymin

Ooh, hello there, how the hell are ya? Sorry to keep you waitin
It's like nuttin when I'm throwin somethin rougher than menstruation
Crabs, I'm followed by a camp like John Cougar
Mellen, tell them punks I put a swellin, for the lords split'cha
I kick tails that tips scales on the ricter
I dip-dip-dob wit more drive than the Harlem River
Oh what the hell, I smoked a half a el then ????
Pick up my grip then spark the clip and get puffin see
It's back to basics if you're wacked then niggas hate we
got the knack to freak a track like I was printin in some nations
Boy, I'm slipper than soap-on-a-rope
I'm madder than the Mad Hatter and Yabber Dabber Dope and you can quote...

I'm not the typical lyrical guy that be a miracle
Drop the type of [shit] that make ya flip and get'cha swivacle
I'm nasty with the verbs, kid, I serve ya, rip the faucet
My raps they never collapse 'cause on the tracks, see I be bustin like
fireworks, I fire jerks scullin then I step
I'm back from hibernation and I'm ween to keep a rep

Give it a rest fool, straight balls of fire, boy I'm flyer than a cockpit
Hah I rocks [shit] and knock niggas out the blocks wit
Uncontrollable lyrical motions from my larynx
I'm slick, watch your tip 'cause my clique might slam ya next
like BOOYAA, no ya not true, don't mean illusion
Kickin a styles til '96, taking backs to the future
Plus I'm cool to fuck the brain, I drain a 40 for the belly
I'm aimin for the charts just like this was a game of scelli
Plus I'm sinkin ships, doin whatever makes the blow rock

From robbin' to stealin' to dealin', yo, and even muggin'
Sellin' cocaine in the high school halls
Playin' it slick I kept the balms up in some tennis balls
I used to run across the bridge with my peeps
I packed a tray-8, in dem days I was playin' for keeps
I used to roll around my hat and all day
Lookin' for a prey that we could rob on Broadway
Stickin niggas for their jewels if they're worthy
Made a couple of hits and then we jetted back to Jersey
'86 and '87 was the year
Had the Gucci hat, rock the rac-coon fur coat yeah
Keep em in disguise and nigga don't ya blink
See yeah Saturday, we robbed another nigga at the rink
The beats was always showin' up at my rest
Askin' ""Does a certain Drayzie live at this address? Yes?""
The spot was hotter than the sun, without a doubt
I had the choice to go to school and get the fuck out!
I hit the South just like a bandit 'cause I was stranded
Virginia State in '88, you know that's where I landed
I couldn't stand it, shit was feelin' strange
I made it outta range but yo, my shit was just about the dough

Twenty-something years ago as I proceed to recollect
A newborn shorty had to 'ford checks off Bushwick
Bless the days, Pops shot to get forth the vock and fifth
Damn, fam got to shift
From the tenth flo' down four flights to the sixth
This was around the time smokin' reefer was the shit
But now the crib a little bigger
I was the first man in the fam so it's plans for a nigga
Had my clan from my building and my man from 8-11
Wit me when we hit the jams behind 2-57
Mom's babysittin', Pop's on the hustle
54 block was on lock, bust a knuckle
Game rip, some niggas slipped and got greedy
Believe me, another ""rest in peace"" in graffitti
But I couldn't resist a few fights and petty heists
'Cause now I'm 'cross town in the Heights
My nights are a little quieter but still amongst the schemes for the fun
Where sons run guns and blow slums with the dums
And motherfuckers don't care
I love the street game so I stashed the green leaf by the air
You couldn't tell me shit, evil was more eager than a beaver
Kept it fresh, double-parked in the Caesar
But I got deceased with this behaviour-type flavor
And do Moms a favor, go to school and get this fuckin' paper
So what's the caper 'cause now I'm all in
At Virginia State, now let the bullshit begin

Gettin' toe-up from the flow-up, we're drinkin' til we throw up
We're thinkin' we can blow up so to class we wouldn't show up

Well nigga so what? You fucked the holdup and went whatevers
Then bucked the leathers, son I got to get my shit together
Gettin' drunk, gettin' flunked in class is what's the function
Smokin' blunts-in, son we need to stop frontin'

We're goin' huntin', Virginia didn't have shit for us
That's why we broke out with Dice and blitzed into blue chorus
Gettin' busy, flippin' rhymes on the weekend
The deal we was seekin' from styles we was freakin'

But yo, now it's '91 and me and son we got to scram
(Aiyo it was a rap contest, nuttin' we couldn't handle)
And yo, something got ta happen or I'ma get tha pappin'
We got tha blueprints to this new style of rappin'

Packin' skills from the sewer, I knew we had a shot

Want the fortune and the fame kid, you know the name kid, style reign
Puttin MC's through style change
And if you want me then you got to come get me
I'm strictly fuckin niggas up like 1-50-

Two gun shots but it's sheisty, they want to ice

Verse 1: Dray

Yo, yo
I said it first with the verse to make these niggas want to act up
Smackin up the wack and Solid Scheme they hook the track up
So back up or swing or you'll get stung by my stinger
Heard that I was rich and now your bitch is on my dinger
Then I swing the jungle shit so fuck the humble shit
Kid I crumble shit, motherfuckers know I never fumble shit
So bring your weapon or keep it steppin or hit the deck-in
'cause in a second I'ma pull a fuckin Tek-in
Start rejectin em, affect em when I kick
y'all niggas think you're slick but y'all can suck my fuckin dick
y'all see me gettin busy wit my man and my DJ
Strictly kickin facts and then we max like TJ
'cause we play for keeps, my peeps they don't be flakin
and if you want to test well yes your bones is gettin breakin

Verse 2: Skoob, Dray

Now to my style there is no equal, boy I'm lethal like some tumours

I got that from my pops and from some niggas on the corner
So you never catch me rappin about no shit like the Government
but I be snappin on MC's like your bitch snap on double mega of a shotty
and a burner and I keeps the 2 ready
to hit you in your chest like Steve Young do Jerry
Rice, be nice and stock slice by umbilical
Knew that I would be the ill-form freaker of the syllables
And son is rugged, you're gonna love it in an instant
See I smoke blunts but yo my pops smokes Winstons

Well it's the D-A-S, I can't forget the E-a
F-a to the X so when I flex why'know I bein
a fatter wrecker nigga on the mic with my strategy
Kids is mad at me 'cause they ain't as fuck as bad as me
I takes the best of them so fuck the rest of them
I couldn't care less for them, I'm too fresh for them
I just be wreckin shop and gettin busy, nigga check it
Never actin broke 'cause yo I sold a fuckin record
I'm too slick for dat, suck my big dick for that
Don't try to trap my rap 'cause yo I'm too quick for that

Yo it's the rootin-tootin-nig'-shoot-to-give nigga with the superdest

and when I come through I'm hittin you up with the 1-2
Teks, flex raps like Bruce Lee flex the kung-fu
Look at my tongue, do it what it feel like, get ill-like

I gut ya clean and make ya fuckin spleen rupture
Nice with the ways is the dazed axe nigga
I know a lotta rap figures and pushin-crack niggas
Perhaps wacked niggas need to play the back step
I got styles with days but styles ain't even hatch-ed
I'm super fly hatin but never violatin
We use to smoke a pound a week but now we're gettin higher lately
Rhyme-sayers need prayers 'cause sniper's gettin hot
When you make the sign of the cross, X marks the spot

Claimin' to represent the bastards, missin' classes, doin' time
But when I come through they be like ""ooh look, the man!""
Shakin' niggas down like the earth shook Japan

Well all I need is my 40, some Buda and my Timbs
My biggity black benz with them ninteen-inch rims
I gotta maintain and at the same time I watch my ass
The cash, 'cause any fuckin' day could be your last
I took a breather, now we snipin' off the roof
We back up in the booth and gettin' busy off the 100-proof
Of Vodka, I rock a rhyme just for the thrill of it
'Cause when I'm spillin' it I'm fillin' it, check how I'm killin' it

Got ta hold it down
Hold it down, nigga keep it on lock

But a'time I write a rhyme I takes some time to make it rougher
So suffer, y'know it's me the nicotine puffer
I miggity made this for the snitches, 'cause for the riches
We never changing faces like them two singin' bitches
So hold it down for '95 or you's a goner
Big up to all my peoples on corner puffin' marijuana

I briggity break the dame, we roll the game
In '92 wit' my crew, ain't a thing changed
But the styles, the miles on the Jeep, the Beamer

So Boogie Banger, son I know you got my back
React, 'cause on the track you never come wack

Yo the Boogie Banger bringin danger to the rap game (no doubt)

'cause niggaz wants ta be me and bitches want to fuck me

Chorus (x2)

Verse 2: Skoob

Sufferin suckertash, another smash is in the makers, niggaz hatin

Hot 'n' tated, I ain't afraid of you
MC's who want to test me, so let's see what you made've
Put ya batter up and you'll get your batter shot
No matter what season, I'm comin through, ha
Chop-fullin nut-swingin the funk worker
I quick to flip a mic just like a wave can flip a surfer
I'm first to rope a dragon, and the oki-choki style be a forgotta
For nutta, when I heat up the flow I spit lava
Packin 'istol that cream your army like some ??? crystal
Wipin out MC's like I had the fuckin swiffle
It's too tragic, fat like blue magic, you faggot
I bring your whole fuckin crew saggy

Chorus (x4)

Verse 3: Dray

Yah, uh, yo
Well um, here I come so do me if you can

Das EFX,"I iggity am what I am
I comes to get biz so bust the jam
I might not be the man but y'all I still proceed to slam, I cram
to understand why these rappers try to faze me
They must be crazy messin with the Books and Drayzie
Big-up to Jersey and my people's out in el-a
Well-a hell-a can never cut the swell-a
Cos you can tell I gets biz like Markie
No matter what the weather son you never wanna spark me
I'm kickin rhymes and gettin mines on the regular
See me in the black Benz just blowin up the cellular
We high as shit, the sky is it
You know the sewer style yo is fly as shit
So grip (what?), you're cheap and buried 
cos you're never comin near it
So fear it when you hear it, cheer it but don't compare it
I still be schoolin, foolin em when I'm speakin
Kids be heapin, they love the way that we be freakin
My sewer style it cause disaster so when I ask
you better answer who's the microphone master

Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker

Well yo, here's the humdinger, 
I'm briggity bringin a new style of thing
It's a rap singer with a fat flow, so low and behold
I higgity hold his mic piece for ransom
It's all about expanses, stocks of skunks, 
props and my pops get a mansion
By the age of 16, had dreams of big screens
Mad rubbers to keep my dick clean
Chrome tools in rent
and I only go downtown to buy jewels and tints
Jaboll, Guess, ol' Gold and sess
I check the mic 2-1 and chew gum to ease the breath
My style is wild like the Cats of Villanova
The heat on the street'll keep my 40's spillin over
So the skunk and thai keep me high when I'm smokin
And I don't sleep, just take naps with one eye open
See I believe the beaded weed in me is feedin me
the inspi-ration to riggity rock the nation
from white folk to Haitian, Jamaican
Burn MC's like degrees of Mason because you're fakin
I'm on point, exclamation with the caper
The flavor misbehaver from the super dooper rhyme maker

Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker

I got to give a siggity shout to my mans, my fans at the shows
friends, foes, stiggity stunts and hoes
Drats! I'm friggin to ride the fat, ooh shit!
My crew is shake, rattle and roll thick
Thicker than your blunt cos yo I be's the Brooklyn trooper
and I got more spunk than that punk from Punky Brewster
Bust the lingo Ringo stiggity Starr bingo
I run shit like Kunta, breaks bones like Mandingo
I'm starstruck like starbuck, the bad bro is mad though
I'm all that small cat like Tomko or Hasbo
I have no figgity fear yeah, it's me and mines
Masters of the microphone, makers of the super rhymes

Yo, well yo the shit sound clever, 
I'm down for whatever like nuttin nice
Big-up to DJ Dice wreckin shop when he cut 'n' slice
These 20 MC's, please! I never heard of some
We need to murder some like Colin Ferguson
But now ya heard us from the under so feel the thunder
Ya best ta come clean like J-Rule and Felix Unger
I'm buggin like gristle, see I suggest you
dismiss you, my style's official and that's the issue
I show the flow I go until it's time to leave
Believe I'm packin more rhymes up my sleeve

And ain't no diggedy, I flow until infinity, you must be kiddin me

Big up to PMD, forever gettin blunted
Flooded in the triple black Benz 500

Me and my man came to kick styles out the can
Fridge you with the flow, yo it's the big chill
Ship all pounds plus stack my grants in a hill

Remember you was schoolin me when you was only a seed 
Now it's time to school you 'cause see I'm a nigga that's true

A few couldn't understand 'cause you was raised in the street

None see the shining sea, you been the star on TV 
See I only knew you by face til I met my nigga P 
Piggity put me on to you, tiggity told me to shine 
So when you had the time, iggity I had the rhyme 
Started runnin with them kids and keepin up with them trends 
I never took it as a diss 'cause me and you was just friends 
But now your man's got you on some other garbage 
C. Deloris Tucker got you thinkin murder charges 
Plus them same cats flipped on you, dissin you 
'cause you're sample says ""You ain't original"", I wanted to get rid of

But who would figure you would try to play both sides? 
You honey rides, you look at your reflection through my eyes, no lies

Yo (yo), yo (yo), yo (yo)
Piggity-presto, who these cats on your stereo? (Das EFX)
My records spin round and round like a merry-go
Here we go, riggity-raw as I ever was
Diggy Das blow the spot, sharp as ever, 'cause
Same pro (what?), never rock with the same flow
My chain glow like lines up in the rainbow
Aiyo, Boogie Bang what the deal, son? (Yo)
For real, son, break it down, how you feel, dun?

Yo, when my record company fail, I'm gonna need bail (why?)
Flippin on coats like Latrell Sprewell
My cat's gone broke off blowin weed sales
Can't see mine, dickhead, you're gonna need braille
Like females, cats is fake, I snap and break
your biggity-back and neck and crack the safe
Snatch the cake, get in the truck, divi' it up
Not givin the one just give me ya cup
We're livin it up, my crew get buck in berry singers
Shows get wild like Jerry Springer, ice on all fingers
Frost bear, me and my girls fare
New York share politican, so

Hook:

So yo set it off, get it off, let it off
Set it off, get it off, let it off
Set it off, get it off, let it off
(Like that) I want to break fool, cock me back, c'mon
Set it off, get it off, let it off
Set it off, get it off, let it off
Set it off, get it off, let it off
(Like that) I want to break fool, cock me back

Verse Two: Dray, Skoob

'cause I'm too nice, rockin blue ice
Jet black Ferrari runnin through lights
My crew tight, riggity-roll with the ruggedness
Enough of this, yo it's time to put a thug in this
Look at this, straight Gz, you can tell it's dope
In your face, kid, you don't need a telescope
Smellin smoke, break the mic, make sure it's broke
????, you can quote every word I wrote
My antidote, stiggity-straight from the subway
The thug way, miggity-Monday to Sunday

Lyrical dumb-dums, watch the stray shots
stay hot like them chicks from Baywatch
BK, to the UK, all the way to Guatalupe
Das got chicks shakin their booty
Cats actin unrul-ey, who they?
Do they, should they, give a fuck, nah too late
Save em, ya gotcha els, roll em up, kid
Blaze em, roll a whole dime but save some
Throw your hands up, raise em, hip-hop nation
Nuff respects to my EFX Generation

Verse Three: Dray, Skoob

Aiyo dun son, hit me, brought the whole gang wit me
Sixty, peace to low down shifty
Strictly, send the world in a frenzy
My mens be, laid up in the penzy
Correctly, when it's my turn to rhyme again
Devils stall, play the ball, went to Heineken
Find a friend, hit her off with the fly talk
The sly talk, riggity-right off the sidewalk
My talk, slidin with the sickedness
You're lickin this like a lollipop, sick of this

Miggity-makin moves on a regular, wack MC's I'm testin ya
Smack you with a chair like a wrestler
Boogie Bang, sewer rat buckwildin
Run the streets of Brooklyn, properties on an island
A pen and a pad, you know my steez when I'm weeded
Bring rhymes together like cleavage
So love it or leave it, I got to eat, kid, plus got mouths to feed
hip-hop crowds to please, bullshit trials to plea
Trees are blastin out my team, blast back
Matter fact, my game is tight and that's that

Verse One: Dray

Well iggity-ashes to ashes and dust to dust

No fuss, fully blown, Benz fully chrome
Flips celly phone, Diggy Das, once again it's on
It's Dray Boogie, no rookie, a tough cookie
Biggity-blow the spot everytime they book me
The big boys we're makin big noise
Biggity-bubblin and pushin big toys
>From the corner to the stage, front page
Riggity-rockin the age, dropped the dime, please
So give a toast to the host, East Coast
West Coast, this here's just a small dose
Jump in the square this year, we take the whole pie
No lie, the platinum and the gold eye
Keep it jumpin, got the beat thumpin, pumpin
Yiggity-yes y'all, I know one thing

Verse Two: Skoob

Yo, yo

I wiggity-won't let the game break me even though the game's shaky
and the player's flaky, they niggity-need someone to boss em
Set up my office now e'rybody flossin
If niggas is hot, I'm ultraviolet
If niggas is fly then I'm the pilot, friggity-frequent flier mileage
Cash flowin, over throwin, motor rollin
Play the low and keepin niggas not knowin, yo
It's like the wind beneath my wing, everything that I sing

Knock the bastard, smiggity-smack it out the park, right
Sewer rats, tiggity-tales from the darkside archive

Verse Three: Dray, Skoob

Yo
You buy the stocks off some sideblocks and buy Glocks to fight cops
Buy spots, niggity-never ever ride jocks

Fat ends, fat rings, biggity-best scams
We got a fool-proof hustle, lotta muscle
So miggity-make sure to put the money in the duffle

Yo
What's miggity-mines is yours and yours is mines
If iggity-I shine then you shine, the crew shine
You rock the Benz, son, I rock the Range

forget the pain and the struggle, and all the trouble
Up in the jungle wit my man now we're seein double

Das EFX,"[Chorus]
Somebody told me that this rap shit was fun 
You get to smoke weed and hold big guns 
Stand on stage rockin' your Timbs wit your sons 
That's bullshit  yo I'm out to get these funds 

Yo, yo somebody told me that threw a hotter joint dies 
Could he see it? EPMD Aguilar recognize 
Niggas was stuck on Diggy before Biggie and Nas 
Test guy reported in The Source, even thought about ""Best Buys"" 
My twelve-bar Count Dracula wit lyrics spectacular 
Sippin' out of Coke and he's drinkin' terror daiquiris and chrome 
backwards 
Challenge any woman, balls nothing, rock the hardest 
Racoons rap with your soloists if artist 
Puttin' it down on the day nine thousand, that's a cell with stories to tell 
Off those cells we're livin' well 
In the nine-eight-off, country club plink off 
While you're way off, check all systems, it's time we take off 

[Chorus: x2]

Guns with banana clips, two Rolexes to master whips 
A point four-five under my armpit 
Another one in the glove compartment 
Money startin' shit, brand new shoes on spank shit 
Tek nines, after parties with mad dimes 
Bitches twist the vine, I'm high and the moon's mine 
We're out to get mines, on a regular 
On the south, probably took the dreaded predator's pirate treasure 
In the crib I bought the leather, plus a movie screen 
So my team can play Sega plus the gods in Vegas 
An ounce of weed in every type of flavor 
Bank accounts wit fat paper, a major player 'cause

[Chorus] 

Higgity-hardcore, sewer rats keep it raw

War die Zeit spiel und spiel nur undankbar
Wenn wir uns in reinem Zorn gestritten haben

Weil der Weg in unsren Augen neblig war
Ist die Welt zu groß fur uns im Geiste klar

Till every word I say is on waver.

Für kranke Beats und dope Flows
Schon vor der EP Taschen voll mit Dough
Scheiß' auf die Hater die meinen, dass sich diese Platte zu holen
Echt nicht lohnt
Denn das ist Future-Shit
Muskelmarley produced die Hits
Leute wollen sein wie die Clique, denn
Alles-alles, was wir tun ist sick

Yeah, vielleicht nicht so hart wie der Rest
Doch dafür doppelt so tight
Alles, was ich trag ist fresh
Bitch wir sind swagged und deine Hoe findet's nice
Covered in black, wir stechen raus aus der Masse des Rap
Leute wollen Texte mit Inhalt
Doch ich denk' mir fuck it, Hauptsache die Kacke klingt fett

Yeah, guck wir setzen die heutigen Trends
Während ihr immer noch irgendwo in den Neunzigern hängt
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Und ab heut’ bist du Fan
Denn du kommst nicht darauf klar, wie sehr der neue Shit bangt

Und wenn du merkst, der Bass drückt im Bauch
Und die ganze Crowd rastet mit aus, weißt du es ist
Dat FUCKIN' ADAM, DAT-DAT FUCKIN' ADAM

Und der letzte Kopf nickt jetzt auch
Und es hagelt Props für die Sounds, es ist

DFA, komm und bounce mit der Gang
Die die dopsten Flows kickt und den Soundcheck verpennt
Geh mir weg mit back to the roots, man
Marty McFly-Style es geht Back to the Future

Beginn jeden Tag mit dem besseren Fuß
Die Gegenwart ist für mich längst nicht genug
Keiner so fly wie die Member der Crew
So fly, sie nennen mich Käpt'n Balu
Was willst du mit einem schnelleren Zug
Wenn du nur auf den Gleisen bleibst?
Sie sagen, wir passen nicht ins Game
Aber von uns will auch keiner rein

Ich seh' nur einen Haufen Missets
Bitte-bitte-'nen-Splash-Auftritt-Missets
Haben sie früh schon gerappt
Und Züge getaggt sind's am Ende verstaubte Missets
Hip-Hop-im-Blut-Missets
Lasst-mich-bitte-bitte-rein-in-die-Juice-Missets

Lass mich nicht bremsen, nein!
Ich bleib nicht stehen, es muss weiter gehen
Immer weiter
Tage vergehen, ihnen tut’s weh mich dem Ziel schon so nahe zu sehen
Muss echt traurig sein, immer nur am Rande zu stehen
Doch ich schau' erst gar nicht hin
Hinter mir lasse ich immer mehr Zeit

Теперь я это понял, осознал
Я делал все что правильным считал,
По крайней мере я считал так
Я делал все что было верным - быть должно,
Но что правильно, никто и никогда не объяснил мне

Doch wenn man mal nachdenkt, dann kann es nur stimmen
I just tatted that line on my skin
I even tatted that line on my skin
All you really really need is love und alles andere macht einfach kein’ Sinn, yeah
Erster Schritt um negative Vibes zu vermeiden, ist, keine negativen Vibes zu verbreiten
Zum Upsteppen braucht man keine Konkurrenz
Sag mir nicht, dass du Teamwork noch nicht kennst
Spread what you wanna get, spread what you wanna get
All we need is love and we’re spreading a lotta that
Spreading a lotta that
Und suchen nach dem Gläsern, denn jeder willkommen jetzt

Scheiß mal auf Besitz und auf Status
Alles Illusion und weiter nichts
Scheiß mal auf die Missgunst, den Hass und
Scheiß auf das, was keinen weiterbringt, denn

Love is all we need, love is all we need!
Love is all we need, love is all we need!
Love is all we need, love is all we need!
Love is all we need, love is all we need!

Love is all we need, all we need, all we need, all we need, all we need
Why sind alle noch so voller Greed voller Greed, voller Greed, voller Greed
Voller Greed, Greed, Greed, Greed, Greed?
Wenn du’s hast, dann share’s mit dem Peeps
Push das Ego weg und in deinem Head herrscht wieder Peace
Unsere Trust issues slowen uns doch nur down wie Promethazin
Wie Promethazin, yeah

„All you need is love, all you need is love, all you need is love“
Ich schrei’s raus in die Welt, so wie John Lennon
Kein Bedarf für Hass, kein Bedarf für Hass, sag mir, wie oft sollen wir uns noch batteln?
Glaub mir, so komm’ wir nicht weit, wann fangen wir endlich an, zu erkennen
Dass egal, wie sehr wir es auch abstreiten, alle am Ende des Tages eine Fam sind?
Yeah, wir sind alle eine Fam
Wir sind alle, alle Teil der Welt, wir wollen alle ein und dasselbe
Yeah, jeder will nur ein good Life voller good Vibes
Worken wir zusammen, gibt’s für alle immer nur noch good Times, good Times, yeah!

Scheiß mal auf Besitz und auf Status
Alles Illusion und weiter nichts
Scheiß mal auf die Missgunst, den Hass und
Scheiß auf das, was keinen weiterbringt, denn

Geh mal weg, denn wenn wir sprayen, dann mit Vehemenz
Permanent sind die DFA-Boys in ihrem Element

Und bleiben wie sie sind, einfach nur gechilled
Uns zu haten hat leider keinen Sinn
Drei verspielte Kids zeigen ihre Skills, 
Droppen Hits und besteigen den Olymp
Schweben über Beats, leben die Musik
Jede Selbstkritik wäre Blasphemie
Lad ne Gun mit den Versen und den Skeems, 
Ziel auf euch und entleer das Magazin

Wir spitten Fire wie ein Charizard
Immer große Klappe wie ein Karnimani, bruh
Wir durchschauen all ihre Moves, Homie, Sharingan
Der Sound ballert, wie ein fucking Kamehameha

Wir flexen so ab wie 'ne Kreissäge
Echt lächerlich, dass ihr euch einredet
Dass das, was ihr macht, die Future ist
Ich lach über euch und die Scheißszene
Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha

Yo brother
Mhm
You know, German rappers are really creative
Oh really?
Yea, they are creative when it comes to inventing new sell-out moves
You know, they want you to buy their album years before they even put out some music
They put stupid shit no one needs in ugly boxes and call them deluxe, 
Just to push their revenue, which leads to better chart rankings in Germany
That’s hella whack!

Yeah - genau das sind die Moves, mein Homie
Jaja - warum sind sie solche Tools, mein Homie
Oh damn - Wir sind cold wie ein fuckin' Snowman
Und wie ein Virus für ihr fuckin' Program
Sie sind trapped im Jetzt und wir schon im Morgen jajaja

Ja, wir sind die motherfuckin Babas
Zerfetzen in Sekunden wie Piranhas
Eure Promo ist nicht mehr als Propaganda
Bin zwar kein Japaner, aber euch nenne ich Baka
Haha haha - Ihr seid alle lachhaft
Mein Magen tut weh, weil ich so lach, es ist unfassbar
Hahahahahaha - Wir bändigen Flames wie der Avatar

Tell me, wenn sie der New Shit sind
Warum bringen sie dann nichts Neues?
Manchmal gönne ich mir, was in diesem Land als Cool Shit gilt
Und bin disappointed - Fucking disappointed!
Einfach nur annoying, urgh
Und wir sollen also die sein, die hier Toys sind?
Was vor Jahren schon von uns kam bringen Blitzmerker erst heute
Wir changen das Game, lowkey und die Missets wollen es leugnen

Ye ye ye yeee, ihr wollt die Hydra ignoriern, aber seid heimlich interessiert
Sogar nach drei fucking Bonghits rap ich noch tighter ein als ihr
Ihr könnt' den Style nicht imitieren - Da braucht echt keiner diskutieren
Ey, wir sind dope und ihr seid whack - Geht das rein in euer Hirn?",xD

Out of the hum of the street lights and into a forest

Blow out all the candles
Blow out all the candles

Wide-eyed, like we're in a crime scene

Well, I have brittle bones it seems
I bite my tongue and I torch my dreams
Have a little voice to speak with
And a mind of thoughts and secrecy

Things cannot be reversed
We learn from the times that we are cursed
Things cannot be reversed
Learn from the ones we fear the worst
And learn from the ones we hate the most how to

Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
Wipe away your tear stains

Biting words like a wolf howling
Hate is spitting out each others mouths
But we're still sleeping like we're lovers

Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating

Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating

Still with feet touching
Still with eyes meeting
Still our hands match
Still with hearts beating

I'll wrap up my bones
And leave them
Out of this home
Out on the road

Two feet standing on a principle
Two hands longing for each others warmth
Cold smoke seeping out of colder throats
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to go",Still
Daughter,"By tomorrow we'll be swimming with the fishes
Leave our troubles in the sand
And when the sun comes up
We'll be nothing but dust
Just the outlines of our hands

By tomorrow we'll be lost amongst the leaves
In a wind that chills the skeletons of trees
And when the moon, it shines, I will leave two lines
Just find my love, then find me

But don't bring tomorrow
'Cause I already know
I'll lose you
Don't bring tomorrow
'Cause I already know
I'll lose you
I'll lose you

By tomorrow I'll be left in the darkness
Amongst your cold sheets
And your shoes will be gone
And your body warmth no longer beside me

Give me touch

Strangers
Kissing me in the night

Frozen hearts growing colder with time
There's no heat from our mouths
Please take me back to my rich youth

And we were in flames, I needed I needed you
To run through my veins, like disease
And now we are strange, strangers

It's different now
Gray faced
Eyes burnt out
Flames are gone
Gloves are on
I have a feeling
Love's gone back
Went to the cinema, losing our minds
With comic fever, shutting confined spaces
Lost in the dark, my heart taken
Resting on your heart

Then I'll lose my children
Then I'll lose my love
Then I'll sit in silence
Let the pictures soak
Out of televisions
Float across the room
Whisper into one ear
And out the other one

Then I'll take my clothes off
And I'll walk around
Because it's so nice outside
And I like the way the sun feels
And when it's dark
I'll call out in the night for my mother
But she isn't coming back for me
'Cause she's already gone
But you will not tell me that
'Cause you know it hurts me every time you say it

Feeling is not a system
Nervous and cold in your home

You are the likely cause
Of what will be mine

Just inconvenient
To play no part in

Seem to be sounding out
It's premature

It's just face painting

It's just easing, awaiting

Built out of seams

They call love

You will drain all you need to drain out of me
All the colors have washed away, no more rosy sheen
Not just a pale isolated shallow water place
Oh what a place I call myself

Oh love all you need to love before it goes

You will never remember who I was to you

Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever-changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you

Daughtry,"Feeling like this could only mean
I'm sinking
Feeling like this could only mean
I'm sinking
Well, I'm sinking
Pull me out

Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floor
I say, I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone
Every time I see the light not burning on the porch
I say, I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone
But you are
You are

Feeling overwhelmed, I take a dive
To a once overfilled but now empty place to hide
The day you turned on me is the day I died
And I've forgotten what it's like
And how it feels to be alive

Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floor
I say, I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone
Every time I see the light not burning on the porch
I say, I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone

Reach up to the sky
When nothing seems to go right
When nothing seems to go right for me

Every time I see your clothes scattered out on the floor
I say, I thought you would be home
You said you never would be gone
Every time I see the light not burning on the porch

With your imagination and emotions running wild
Fueling my frustrations like a fire burning, clock keeps turning
And I, I know it's getting underneath your skin
I've tried to tell you now

Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seeing in your dreams
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason

Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me
Whoa
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me

Daughtry,"Tonight the sunset means so much
The one thing that you know you'll never touch
Like the feeling, the real thing
I reach out for the sweet dream
But somehow the darkness wakes me up

And I've felt this emptiness before (I've felt this emptiness before)
But all the times that I've been broken
I still run right back for more

You'd think that I'd learn my lesson by now
You'd think that I'd somehow figure out
That if you strike the match
You're bound to feel the flame

You think that I'd learn the cost of love
Paid that price long enough
But still I drive myself right through the pain
Yeah, well it turns out I haven't learned a thing

Sometimes I think I'm better off
To turn out the lights and close up shop
And give up the longing, believing in belonging
Just hold down my head and take the loss

You'd think that I'd learn my lesson by now
You'd think that I'd somehow figure out
That if you strike the match
You're bound to feel the flame

And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out

Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

It came out like a river once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever, just pushing it down
Felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to say

Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise

If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this
It's easier to see the reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today (stayed till today)
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

Both wright and wrong, our memories
The whispering before we sleep,
Just one more thing that you can't keep

Daughtry,"A single rose left to remember
As a single tear falls from her eye
Another cold day in December
A year from the day she said goodbye

Seems it's only been a moment
Since the angels took him from her arms
And she was left there holding on to their tomorrow
But as they laid him in the ground
Her heart would sing without a sound

For the first time you can open your eyes
And see the world without your sorrow
Where no one knows the pain you left behind

And all the peace you could never find
Is waiting there to hold and keep you
Welcome to the first day of your life
Just open up your eyes, eyes

A single lifetime lays behind her
As she draws her final breath
Just beyond the door he'll find her
Taking her hand he softly says

For the first time you can open your eyes
And see the world without your sorrow
Where no one knows the pain you left behind

And all the peace you could never find
Is waiting there to hold and keep you
Welcome to the first day of your life

Just open up your eyes as I lay you down tonight
Safe on the other side, no more tears to cry

For the first time you can open your eyes
And see the world without your sorrow
Where no one knows the pain you left behind

And all the peace you could never find
Is waiting there to hold and keep you
Welcome to the first day of your life
Just open up your eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes",Open Up Your Eyes
Daughtry,"How the time passed away, all the trouble that we gave
And all those days we spent out by the lake
Has it all gone to waste? All the promises we made
One by one they vanish just the same

Of all the things I still remember
Summer's never looked the same
The years go by and time just seems to fly
But the memories remain

In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain
Nothing to lose but everything to gain
Reflecting now on how things could've been
It was worth it in the end

Now it all seems so clear, there's nothing left to fear
So we made our way by finding what was real
Now the days are so long that summer's moving on
We reach for something that's already gone, yeah

Much colder than I thought even in the month of June
No communication makes you feel so alone
Well, all we need is patience of which I've never really known

But now it's too late, it's taking over me, it feels so supernatural
And I'm pulled the other way, it's more than I can take
And I'm losing hold of everything
And no matter how I try you know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural

Every step I've taken has led me here to where you are
But all that I believe in is keeping me from seeing too far
Throwing out the questions, waiting for the right reply
Looking for the answers, tell me will it be tonight?

But now it's too late, it's taking over me, it feels so supernatural
And I'm pulled the other way, it's more than I can take

Haunting me now reminders of how I used to be
And on down the road my troubles are sure to follow
Looking out the window, the hell if I know where I will go
So I'll just keep on driving

I've sworn off my past, first to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight, Tennessee line just changed my mind
Well, it's my heart I'll follow this time

Who would've known that pride is so hard to swallow?
As I rest on the shoulder of a road growing colder
With the trouble I own, should I just keep on driving?

I always find a way to pass the time with you
Dark and smoky rooms, I can hardly stand the fumes

Telling me that you mean no harm
You stand me up like a crutch, another arm
But only when I'm gone have I been away too long

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

Any given time or place I never will forget the disgrace on your face
So full of love, will it ever be enough?
Ten feet tall and bullet proof I never thought that I had a thing to lose
Well, it looks like after all, I'm gonna have to choose

No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me

We may lose and we may win
But like the sun, we will rise again
But until then

Rescue me in the middle of the ocean
Crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
Some say, it's hard to make the changes
Rescue me and I'll never be the same

Rescue me in the middle of my darkest hour
Time will tell I never really had the power
Some say, it's easier to give up on it
I say, it's time to rescue me

Rescue me in the middle of the ocean",Rescue Me
Daughtry,"Hood of my car
Radio's just loud enough
So I can hear ""Levon""
Where you are is anybody's guess for now
Just a song I grew up on
Constellations seem so out of line
Wish that we could make it this time

Somebody's out there
Show me that you care
Give me a sign that comes out of nowhere
Like a shooting star or maybe life on Mars
Something inside tells me we can't be too far
'Cause I can see me on a spaceship leaving
Here when you find that we're not the only ones
We're not the only ones.

Call me a fool
Daydreaming in the dark and throwing ??? moon
Why you're gone is ""Nobody's Fault But Mine""
Another song that we grew up on
Anybody tell me where I can find
The hurt I can't get outta my mind

Somebody's out there
Show me that you care
Give me a sign that comes out of nowhere
Like a shooting star or maybe life on Mars
Something inside tells me we can't be too far
'Cause I can see me on a spaceship leaving
Here when you find that we're not the only ones

I'm looking for love,
I'm looking for something more
When its not enough
Try to stay above the clouds
'Cause with our feet both on the ground
We'll never learn

('Cause I can see me on a spaceship leaving
Here when you find that we're not the only ones)
Somebody's out there
Show me that you care
Give me a sign that comes out of nowhere
Like a shooting star or maybe life on Mars

Together we will find that we're not the only ones

And your whole wide world, in a moment, comes undone
You're just walking around then suddenly
Everything that you thought that you knew about love is gone
You find out it's all been wrong

You look beautiful in blue jeans, holes on the knees
You were smoking like a cigarette, I couldn't breathe
Used to rock around the ballroom, dance on the bar
Baby nobody could tame you and your wild heart

Take me back
To those barefoot summer nights
Take me back
Running down those highway lights
Remember when
We said don't let go to it
Darling take me back
To that fire in your eyes
'Cause I know it ain't gone too far
Take me back to you and to your wild heart
Yeah
To your wild heart
Yeah

You used to be the girl that set the world on fire
And they drenched your soul in water but the flames reached higher
You'll always be the one that keep me crazy inside
And if you got a wild heart don't you let it die

Take me back (take me back)
To those barefoot summer nights
Take me back (take me back)
Running down those highway lights
Remember when (remember when)

Even that won't last forever
Just look around and see you're not alone
You're not alone

Daughtry,"Another year goes by
Spinning as I drive
I felt like I would leave this life I knew forever
I didn't see it change
But I know it's not the same
I'd bring it back, if I could
But I know, I'm not that clever

Life's so short
And it goes by fast
And we can't get it back

The world we knew
It was so simple then
Me and you
Though it would never end
Oh, what I wouldn't do

And we're changing like the tides
Yeah, but I want you, I need you,
And I guarantee you we'll make it out alive

'Cause I don't wanna fight no more,
Even when the waves get rough
And I don't wanna see the day we say we've had enough

And I don't wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships.

Woah, show, show me you care

I thought we had someone for that
But by the looks of things you fired the maid again

Yeah I confess, I know the floor won't clean itself
And you're worried half to death
About the things that just won't matter in the end

Take off those shoes
Looks like you could really use a glass slipper
Yeah I know it's been a pisser
So one strong zipper might suffice

Come on girl, I'm begging please
Get off your knees, I got the keys
And I'll pick you up at midnight
In my suit up pumpkin ride

'Cause you're my Cinderella
We're two birds of a feather
I'll even sing to you acapella
You're so hella good looking tonight
My Cinderella
Whenever you need some shelter
We can stand under my umbrella
Together
Need no fortune teller to see it's forever with you
Oh no, it's forever with you

Don't watch the clock,
I paid some dude to make it stop
But we won't worry 'bout tomorrow
There's no sorrow in this fairytale I wrote

I gotta say
You still take my breath away
That look reminds me of that day
You scratched your number on that yellow poster note

And now you're my Cinderella
We're two birds of a feather
I'll even sing to you acapella
You're so hella good looking tonight

Check out those stars
I picked 'em up one day on Mars
And you thought I was at the bar
Well okay maybe there's a little truth to that

As I would say
And if you squint a certain way
You'll see they kinda spelled your name
Just a little
But okay maybe that's a stretch

But you're my Cinderella
We're two birds of a feather
I'll even sing to you acapella

Bleeding, choking but not broken

I hit every curb, every red light
Trying to keep both hands on the wheel
But through it all I'm

Still undefeated
With my back against the ropes
Still undefeated
You can knock me down with mighty blows
But you cannot break my hope

Weak knees, can't stand
Raise up your hands
Don't walk away
Been sucker punched but I'm not down
My feet have never left the ground
It's a fight that I can't fix
Like a cut that needs a stitch
And somehow through it all I stay

On oublie 
Hier est si loin d’aujourd’hui 
Mais il m’arrive souvent
De rêver encore à l’adolescent
Que je ne suis plus
On sourit
En revoyant sur les photos jaunies
L’air un peu trop sûr de soi 
Que l’on prend à seize ans 
Et que l’on fait de son mieux
Pour paraître plus vieux


J’irai bien refaire un tour du côté de chez Swann
Revoir mon premier amour qui me donnait rendez-vous
Sous le chêne
Et se laissait embrasser sur la joue
Je ne voudrais pas refaire le chemin à l’envers
Et pourtant je paierais cher pour revivre un seul instant
Le temps du bonheur
A l’ombre d’une fille en fleur.


On oublie 
Et puis un jour il suffit d’un parfum 
Pour qu’on retrouve soudain 
La magie d’un matin 
Et l’on oublie l’avenir
Pour quelques souvenirs.


Et je m’en vais faire un tour du côté de chez Swann
Revoir mon premier amour qui me donnait rendez-vous
Sous le chêne
Et se laissait embrasser sur la joue
Je ne voudrais pas refaire le chemin à l’envers
Et pourtant je paierais cher pour revivre un seul instant
Le temps du bonheur

Drinking their spoils down
Cheap imitations

Run when it hits the ground
I'm good at escaping,
But better at flaking out

Stuck on the inside now
It's fear I'm embracing

I'll have mandem on your road
Mandem in a batch or on their own
With a bat or with a pole
I've got mandem that will slap a man with both
Nike jacket on my back, I'm looking cold

Look, I came in late
Two bottles in my hand, I think it's looking like I'm waved
I'm searching for a brown skin girl with a body
Or a lightskin chick with a smile, good style and a pretty little face
I used to spend a grand a week, stuntin' on some hoes
But Prada boy retired, I don't rock designer clothes
I put £40 on my H&M jeans, and the rest came free
I told my mom I'll give her everything I own
The hell you mean you haven't heard of us?
F a guest list, 20 man is how I'm turning up
Swear I saw that girl last year, she tried to curve me
Her boyfriend's in cunch 'cause he's broke
That's a joke, tell your man to come and work for us
Trapping's still alive, my brother I know you've heard of us
Said you gonna ride my brother but you ain't burst at us
Guys have got 5 times 5 times 5, that will send you to the sky
My brother, no you ain't hurting us
My lifestyle's exciting, imagine being the reason that two girls are fighting
Both hands swinging nonstop like a Breitling
So sorry to my brown ting from Loughton, and sorry to my white ting from Brighton
(Can I get away with saying that?)

And a whiskey bottle was lifted up to his mouth

As a truck of migrants pulled through town
And the jukebox was busted at the bus de-pot

He closed his eyes and hit the stage in 1955
As the screams of the children filled the hall

Well, it might have been a bluebird, I don't know

The salmon boats and 45 below

and his cellmate there was a Little Willy John
and Willie, he was once a great blues singer
so Wing & Willie wrote him up a song

up above the clouds, where the rain don't fall
on a poor man's dreams
They paroled blue wing in August of 1963
He moved north, picking apples in the town of Wenatchee
And then winter finally caught him in a rundown trailer park
on the south side of Seattle where the days grow grey and dark
And he drank and he dreamt a vision of when the seven still ran free
and his father's fathers crossed that wide old Bering sea
and the land belonged to everyone, and there were old songs yet to sing
now, it's broken down to a cheap hotel and a tattooed prison wing
Now, it's dark in here... (repeat chorus)
Well, he drank his way to L.A., and that's where he died
and no one knew his Christian name, and there was no one there to cry

I traveled the Indian country
Whispering your name under lonesome skies
Remembering my only company

But my darling dear, please have no fear
For I think that it's fair to warn you

And I worked my stake on a riverbank?

Mountains east of El Cajon
North of the Tecate line.

Will burn right through your soul

And watch the others slip away

And I even know some by name
I guess they think that we're all
Movie stars and millionaires
I guess that they still believe
That dreams come true up here.

But I guess the weather's warmer down in Mexico
And no one ever tells them 'bout the California snow.

Last winter I found a man and wife
Just about daybreak
Layin' in a frozen ditch
South of the interstate
I wrapped 'em both in blankets
But she'd already died
The next day we sent him back alone
Across the borderline.

I don't know where they came from
Or where they planned to go
But we carried her all night long
Through the California snow.

Sometimes when I'm alone out here
I get to thinkin' about my life
Maybe I should go to Riverside
And try to fix things with my wife
Or maybe just get in my truck
And drive as far as I can go
Away from all the ghosts that haunt
The California snow.

'Cause ever since the old man passed on
It just got harder to leave.

Though you swore that you never would
I guess you finally got your own kids now
You ever tell 'em 'bout the old neighborhood?
Like the time we stole your dad's car
Drove all night down Imperial Highway
You kept sayin' ""Maybe we should turn around,""
And I said ""It don't take much to get away.""

Dave Alvin,"I scored some speed in San Berdino
So me and baby could get a little bump
And now she's in that motel room
Puttin? on a show for some chump

Yeah, well, baby?s gotta make a livin?
And I don't mind waitin? out in the car
?Cause I got some nine millimeter muscle
In case things go too far

You know I try to take it easy, man
And just go with the flow
But sometimes things can get a little bit
Out of control

Well, my old man worked his whole life
In the Kaiser steel slag pit
And I worked there for a while back when I was a kid
But I got tired of all their shit

But that was years ago, man
Before they tore that Fontana plant down
And my old man smoked himself
Into a six-foot hole in the ground

And I got the same bad habit
And it'll probably take its toll
But sometimes it?s the only thing that keeps me
From goin? out of control

Well, my ex-wife?s workin? evenings
At a Sizzler makin? minimum wage
And she's cleanin? up other people?s houses
Every day just like some slave

And she's livin? with the kids in a mobile home
Just off the 60 freeway
Some nights I go to see her
And sometimes she lets me stay

Since she found Jesus
She's always tryin? to save my soul
Yeah, but every now and then she still likes to get
A little out of control

I used to work a little construction
But I never got along with my boss
So I do a little import export
Makin? enough just to cover my costs

And I'm losin? my hair and I'm losin? my teeth
But I'm tryin? to keep my grip
And live to see one more day
Without makin? any stupid slips

You know I could have played the game man
And just done what I was told
But I guess I was born just a little bit
Out of control

Baby gets done in there, I'm gonna
Take her for a little ride
Cruise up into the mountains
Park the car and get a little high

?Cause baby likes to look at the shootin? stars
And make wishes as they fly by
And I like lookin? down at the city
From way up there in the sky

Then I pull baby close to me
When it starts gettin? cold
Close my eyes for a little while and let the world
Spin out of control

Dave Alvin,"I guess she put her blue dress on
And walked out late last night
Left one silk stocking 
Dangling from the bedside light
I sobered up and called her name 
Just before the dawn
I saw her footprints in the sand 
And knew that she had gone
Down the Rio Grande.

I pulled out of Albuquerque 
Prayin' I wasn't late
I got a couple cups of coffee
At some joint off the interstate
Passin' through Las Cruces
I swear I saw her car
She always said she'd go someday
But never said how far
Down the Rio Grande.

Maybe she's in Brownsville
She's got some family there
She was always talkin' ‘bout
The salty Gulf Coast air
Where the river ends
Down the Rio Grande.

I saw an old grey heron
Flyin' south against the wind
Storm clouds over Juarez
Rollin' east to the Big Bend
I drove down Highway Ninety
Through a dusty desert wind
I didn't know where it would lead me
Or if I'd find her again
Down the Rio Grande.

I lit my last cigarette
As the sky began to clear
Black mountains up ahead
A red sundown in my mirror
Lost all the border 
‘Tween the future and the past
One fading slowly
And the other comin' fast
Down the Rio Grande.

Maybe she's in Brownsville
She's got some family there
She was always talkin' ‘bout
The salty gulf coast air
Where the river ends
Down the Rio Grande.

I bought a bottle in Del Rio
And I parked on the side of the road
I stayed up all night 
Starin' at the lights of Mexico
And I walked down to border bridge
At the break of day
And I threw that empty bottle off
And I watched it float away
Down the Rio Grande.

Maybe she's in Brownsville
She's got some family there

SHe said child take your time
Don't fall in love too quickly
Before you know the one
She held me round the shoulders
In a voice so soft and kind
She said love can make you happy
And love can rob you blind
Here in California fruit hangs heavy on the vines
There's no gold I thought I'd warn you
And the hills turn brown in the summertime
Now I will learn to love you
But I can't say when
This morning we were strangers
And tonight we're only friends
I'll take the time to know you
I'll take the time to see
There's nothing I won't show you

An old familiar rhyme
To everything there is a season
To every purpose there's a time
A time to love and come together
A time when love longs for air ??
A time for questions we can't answer
Though we ask them just the same

Dave Alvin,"Me and the boy's we cinched up our saddles and rode to sonora last night 
Gun's hanging proud, daring out loud for any one looking to fight 
Card cheats and rustlers would run for their holes when the boys from the old broken O 
Rode up and reined on the street that they named Sonora's death row 

Mescal is free at Amanda's saloon for the boy's from the old broken O 
Saturday nights in the town of Sonora are the best in all Mexico 
They've got guitars and trumpets and sweet senoritas who won't want to let you go 
You'd never believe such a gay happy time on the street called Sonora's death row 

Inside Amanda's we was a dancin' with all of Amanda's gals 
I won some silver at seven card stud so I was out doin' my pals 
But the whiskey and mescal, peso cigars drove me outside for some air 
Somebody whispered ""Your life or your money"", I reached but my gun wasn't there 

I woke up face down in Amanda's back alley aware of the fool I had been 
Rushed to my pony, grabbed my Winchester and entered Amanda's again 
Where I saw my partners twirling my pistols and throwing my money around 
Blinded by anger, I jacked the lever and one of them fell to the ground 
Amanda's got silent like night in the desert, my friends stared in pure disbelief 

Amanda was kneeling beside the dead cowboy plainly expressing her grief 
And as I bowed my head a trembled shot through me my six-gun was still at my side 
I felt my pockets, there was my money, I fell to my knees and I cried 
A nightmare of mescal is all that it was for no one had robbed me at all 
I wish I was dreaming the sound of the gallows they're testing just outside 
The wall 

The mescal's still free at Amanda's saloon for the boy's from the old Broken O 
I'd give a ransom to drink there today and be free of Sonora's death row

Dave Alvin,"1. I choose not to see the things that be, 
Or the miles and years that are gone.
I pay no heed to tomorrow's need,
I'm blinded by the snow and the sun,
'til all I could see is my darlin' and me,
Like young flowers bloomin' in spring.
Like flowers that grew, and no other I knew,
But the Rose of the San Joaquin.

2. The gypsies would dance, while stealing a glance
As leaves might blow in the wind.
And the fields are worked in a sweat stained shirt,
Then the workers all move on again.
And the tramps and hawkers, with stories wild, 
Beguiled a young boy's dreams,
Enticing me to leave my home, 
And the Rose of the San Joaquin. 

3. I've watched the rise of light in the sky
When the sun climbs out of the sea.
Seen giants fall in mountains tall,
Where the lumbermen cut down the trees.
I've played in the sand with the gulf coast wind,
Fell asleep in the grass tall and green.
But nowhere I've been would I go back again,
Compared to the San Joaquin.

4. Well the road back home is hard and it's long,
And the miles, they turn into years.
And the tramps and hawkers in every town,
By God, but it brings me to tears.
When I got home, I found just a flower on the mound
Where it shamed the green grasses of spring.
It grew from the grave of my darlin' little girl,
The Rose of the San Joaquin.

5. Oh see us today out on the highway,
Or asleep in the doors of the train.
See the gypsies dance with their damned old glances,
Hear the peddlers cry out their refrain.
And who's gonna care, and who's gonna share
All the joys, the sorrows we've seen?
Like ghosts, we roam, without friends or home,
These tramps, and hawkers and me.
Like ghosts, we roam, without friends or home,
These tramps, and hawkers and me.

Only she’s still livin’ across the Harlan County Line

Now when we met we were both livin’ far from home
Tryin’ to get by and tired of being alone,
For a moment I thought she was mine
Cause she had a voice I just wanted to believe
She said her mother was full blood Cherokee and her
Daddy was a union man down in the mines…

People can be Noble, and People can be Cruel 
They’ll make you President or they’ll make you a Fool but, 
She always treated me nice and kind
Until that day she left me on my own said there 
Was trouble she had to handle back home
Then she gave me a number and said call any time

Now the years disappear out on the highway 
And I lost her number somewhere along the way

Dave Askren,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Dave Askren,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Dave Askren,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Dave Askren,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear",Spring Is Here
Dave Askren,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You

Dave Attell,"If you see me, don't pass me by 
 I need somebody or else I'm gonna die 
 Oh, love, if you need me, just call and I'll be there 
 There is no sorrow that both of us can't share 
 That both of us can't share

Dave Bailey,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Dave Ballou,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
