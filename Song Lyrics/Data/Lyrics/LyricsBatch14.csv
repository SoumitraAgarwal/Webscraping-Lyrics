Chicosci,"A cross, a heart no longer beating
So we?re dealing with the devil tonight
But still we?re speaking softly
I hear you singing to the other side
She?s sleeping with the enemy
While murdering a friend
A kiss to betray, the silent flight
And the knives

And the knives
She?s gone, let's sing her to sleep
This knife in my hand, grasping
The lies! The song is growing louder
Were you wishing I would die tonight?
My back, the color crimson
Honey, please, the crime wasn?t mine
Won?t you keep it all inside?
Don?t cut the feeding hand
A kiss to betray, the endless fuck
And the knives

And the knives
She?s gone, let's sing her to sleep
This knife in my hand, grasping
You?re gone; we?ll sing you to sleep
Nothing in your hand, fading

She?s gone, let's sing her to sleep
This knife in my hand, grasping
You?re gone; we?ll sing you to sleep
Nothing in your hand, fading

She?s gone.. sing her to sleep
This knife in my hand, grasping
Liars never learn at all
You?ve been given the chance to fly
So long, my dear
A thousand times goodbye
Liars never learn at all
You?ve been given the chance to fly
So long, my dear
A thousand times

Chicosci,"Chicosci Last Look Lyrics 

Can I be a little selfish?
And swear I?ll come back home to you
Our heads turn, the last kiss
Make me yours and kill me with your stare

Leaves shaking, let?s follow
I?m staying with you angel
Till the fear dies, I won?t let go
(I won?t let go)

So far away, one last look
It?s the same thing as before
Am I too late? one last look

How could you just take me?
A silent frame, my heart had fell into
Let?s pray for the violence, 3:47
It?s just another requiem

Leave shaking, let?s follow
I?m staying with you angel
Till the fear dies, I won?t let go 
(I won?t let go)

So far away, one last look
It?s the same thing as before
Am I too late? one last look
Till we sleep forever

So far away, one last look
It?s the same thing as before
Am I too late? one last look
Till we sleep forever (sleep forever)

A love in wait
I?ll watch you go
We lie in state
I?ll watch you go

A love in wait
I?ll watch you go
I?ll watch you go
I?ll watch you go

Can I be a little selfish?
And swear I?ll come back home to you
Let?s pray for the violence, 3:47
It?s just another requiem

Chicosci,"Chicosci Manila Teenage Death Squad Lyrics
The sun is down again
The killing flags are up
We?re beautiful in black
The things nightmares are made of with painted eyes
A million hearts will stop the voices cry
Tonight! Tonight! Tonight!
We?ve nothing to hide
We confess to the murders of a million souls
Another dance in the dark
Where we are never alone
We confess to the murders of a million souls
Another dance in the dark
And we are home
With painted eyes
A million hearts will stop the voices cry
Tonight! Tonight! Tonight!
We?ve nothing to hide
For now, the streets of Manila run red
A million hearts will stop the voices cry
Tonight! Tonight! Tonight!
We?ve nothing to hide
A million hearts will stop the voices cry
Tonight! Tonight! Tonight!
We?ve nothing to hide

Chicosci,"Everyone?s dressed
All in their Sunday best
The shadows bathed in pink and black
Moonlight sets in, the conductor takes center stage
And the people start to sway (start to sway)
And the band plays on
We?re gonna dance the sun away
Tonight, we?re gonna dance the sun away
They?re spinning around and around again
They turn and hold hands
With their hands they send
The music plays, the ghosts fly over the stage
And they awake and dance with everyone
A masquerade in full swing, into the night
The right they all sing
Save us
And now the light is gone
So close our eyes
And let?s begin
We?re gonna dance the sun away
Tonight, we?re gonna dance the sun away
They?re spinning around and around again
They turn and hold hands
With their hands they send
They?ll all dance in this holiday
In a moonlight ballroom
Let the symphony fly
An invitation to sing one more time
We?re gonna dance the sun away
Tonight, we?re gonna dance the sun away
They?re spinning around and around again
They turn and hold hands
With their hands they send
",Matinee
Chicosci,"Not casting stones, I?m casting votes
What 45 in playing in your head?
(She wouldn?t just come clean)
You take a drag, they come to hunt you
Your menthol pixie stick is tired
You?re out of Vogue
You were a harlequin lover (brand)
Don?t you turn it around (turn it around)
You were our harlequin lover (brand)
Don?t deny what we found
The game is done, over, you?re gone
No one?s laughing, your picture frame is falling
(You hide it in the velvet)
Just so they know
You can tell your lover, your star is out of vogue
You were a harlequin lover (brand)
Don?t you turn it around (turn it around)
You were our harlequin lover (brand)
Don?t deny what we found
You were a harlequin lover (brand)
You passed your secrets around
Here she comes
Walking like the world falls at her feet
(Our eyes meet)
Smiling just like God was her lover
Here she comes
Walking like the world falls at her feet
(Our eyes meet)
Smiling just like God was her lover
Here she comes
Walking like the world falls at her feet

Chicosci,"Bless this night
I?m entering the fold with everything to lose
Let me be ready for the end
With both guns blazing

Nothing can stop this war tonight
Can you be my shelter?
Your suicide kisses will be mine

Sweet Maria
Guide these bullets in the air

Beautiful clash
I?m a blinded fool again
Now I?ll be cut and bruised
A lovely blade run through my neck
My landmine valentine

These silver bullets will open your eyes
And I?ll be here breathing
Your suicide kisses will be mine

Sweet Maria
Guide these bullets in the air
Three more in the chamber and I said
Sweet Maria
Grace this moment, hear my prayer

I feel you beside me
Touch me, I tremble
My final dance, this means everything
Everything to me

These silver bullets will open your eyes
And I?ll be here breathing
Your suicide kisses will be mine

Sweet Maria
Guide these bullets in the air
Three more in the chamber and I said
Sweet Maria
Grace this moment, hear my prayer
",Sweet Maria
Chicosci,"Will I forever see you
Only in dreams
Should I close my eyes just to see
You're beautiful
And I can't wait to sleep

We're strangers and I've never lived
So deep inside my mind
I'll be a fool for you
I'll be such a fool for you

With every breath, I wish for you
For you to wake that's all I hold onto
Maybe someday
So I close my eyes and pray

I dream of her
Full of life
I guess the meds have been doing her right
She's so beautiful
And I can't wait to sleep

But maybe I have something
That something
To finally make it go away
But who am I to say?
Who am I to stay?

With every breath, I wish for you
For you to wake that's all I hold onto
Maybe someday
So I close my eyes and pray

With every breath, I wish for you

Chiddy Bang,"You came to take us (yeah)
All things go, all things go (uh)
To recreate us
All things go, all things go
We had our minds set (yeah)
All things go, all things go (uh)
You had to find it (uh)
All things go, all things go

It started off with a rhyme and a dream
Made it the greatest and the latest
Now we fresh on the scene
Got the sample for the kids
Won't you ever grow up?
Went to Drexel and had classes, but I never showed up
I was writin' all day 'til my hands would hurt
Professors didn't appreciate it, called me a jerk
New boy needed to learn, but I never would
Pay attention in school is something that I never could, uh
And know with a beat, gotta be steaming
And we could work wonders over logic and reason
We on the hype now, they call it a buzz
And how we get the party popping, Baltimore club, uh
MySpace they could replay next
And you gotta have Xaph for the D.J. set
No matter how they ever play us, they can never replace us
And any way you slice it now, homie, they came to take us

You came to take us (yeah)
All things go, all things go (uh)
To recreate us (hey yo Xaphoon, we back son!)
All things go, all things go (we did it!)
We had our minds set (yeah)
All things go, all things go (uh)
You had to find it (uh)
All things go, all things go

Say hello to the game
The people know my name
And do they really love us, or is this just a fling?
And we be Peter Parker in love with the Mary Jane
So many people gone, so many people came, eh
This that brand new spontaneous
Dope flow, intraveneous
Miscellaneous grinding
Better late than never, I'm calling it perfect timing
But we goin' have a little bit of fun
'Cause when it's all done
You throw your sneaks up and call it a good run
I admit, that I would never rather them burn me
I don't know where I'm headed, but I know it's a journey
And my bags is packed, so can you hand me my itinerary?
I get attention like a soldier in the military
This is what you gotta notice today
We promise to make sure they never throw us away

You came to take us (yeah)
All things go, all things go (uh)
To recreate us (uh)
All things go, all things go
We had our minds set (yeah)
All things go, all things go (uh)

Chiddy Bang,"Darwin Deez, Theodore Grams, yeah

Everday oughta be a bad day for you

That's right, uh

We used to be so strong
Back then we was right, now we so wrong
She was Beyonce, I could've got my Hov on
And when she hang up on me, I tell her hold on
Quit that shit, I don't use force
Today is a bad day, we've been divorced
When I think about stress, I don't really need it
But this is plagiarism, cause my shorty just cheated
And shorty conceited
(She out of her mind, I wish she had Louis and a card in decline)
She had school with no aid, no H.I.V.
Hope you don't get in the club with that fake I.D.
Why would you hurt somebody that you called your man for?
And I hope you get evicted by your landlord
But, she be messin' with me
And I'm hoping she lose my number indefinitely
So

Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

I guess you can't remember all the times that I was there
Your emotions on a roller coaster, no fun fair
You had me on the phone, but hate me when I come there
Xaphoon, let's cut it down to a drum snare
Yeah, yeah, just like that
I hope I hope you go deaf so you can't hear shit
Yeah, I hope I hope you go blind
Cause you look me in the face and you laugh when I cry

Maybe you should wonder why your apartment is always so empty
(Maybe you should wonder that)
Well I hope you get locked out of that apartment and have to call Jenny
(Oh, I hope you get locked out)

Cause everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

She's way too complex
When we argue, she takin' shit out of context
And, I know I could have did more
But I'm never home, I was always on tour
I could be anywhere in the world, had one wish
To be with you until you gave that dude a tongue kiss
And this is hard for me to say like a tongue twist
My heart don't beat for you so let the drum hit
And, you know I just got promoted
Now I be the boss and I hope you get demoted
Happiness is a warm gun, live it fully loaded
And shit got worse when I exploded
Boom, I wrote it soon, I hope you brought a cab pay
And I hope you get detention on a half day
I wish I could use your blouse for an ashtray
Cause for you, everyday should be a bad day

Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you

Xaphoon you crazy
But so am I

Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you
Everday oughta be a bad day for you",Bad Day

In an artificial world where nothing is real
We searching for wild for something that's greater
And hopefully I'll make it there sooner or later
Remember I was younger and I didn't have a thing
And then I had a dream they call Martin Luther King
I'm swelly on top for the world it seems
Cash rules everything around me get cream
Good morning, to my haters all I say is good night

And P got the bass turned up the low end
And this is that soul for the big ""O"" ten
I never thought that I would be a man in the game
I brush off my shirt where there used to be a stain
I came a long way where I wasn't so fly
Made music like Kweli just to get by
I never had a job, but that couldn't stop him
Cause now I get paid and I never clock in
And I will never stumble, fall, or take a pay cut
I'm in that elevator and I'm on my way up

Them other rap dudes ain't near me though
This that shit for your stereo
Hit Louis Vuitton, yeah we go
Back at'cha, spectacular
Flip shit round here, no spatula
The way they bite my shit like Dracula
And if the shortie fine, then I get back to her
And I love this game like Mario
But my flow is just like cardio
Intensive, offensive
And they ask why your belt expensive
They can't see me even if they had lenses
Top lonely, give a fuck about friendses
Cause I'm a lonely stoner, pop Corona
College dropout, no diploma

Here we go
If you feel the heat in the kitchen
Or just washing dishes
Or dancin' for tuition
With the big dreams and wishes
Don't stop to listen
Just keep tryin' to get it

And I pass class
Told them I was done with it
Opposite of adults, let's have fun with it
I'm a genius, and so is Xaphoon
Stay up, nocturnal shit, raccoon
Rap soon, holla at you later
They say we bound to blow up, Al-Qaeda
And this trap was just a favor
That turned into a classic, hater
I run rap like a master dater
You take forever to make a procrastinator
Blind niggas can't see shit
And he a story of Victoria Secret
That's only if she keep it
Never mistake kindness for weakness

Here we go

Or just washing dishes
Or dancin' for tuition

Look what we have here, hero

And everything ain't what it seems
And this is for the people that's chasing they dreams

So could you get your money hustlin' love
But don't let them take it, rules we breakin'
Tryin' to get it cause we overachieve
Mama I made it, now they hate it
But you could trust they got nothing on we
They got nothing on we

And everybody needs a hero
Just another number, they rather you be a zero
But you could make it out, be patient with no surgery
Somebody call 9-1-1, it's an emergency
The kids need a hero, let us get bread
They follow everything, they seein' and embed in they head
Custodian clean, get Banks, bring Cody in
And I bet that you probably into that Nickelodeon
They gon' watch it on the T.V. screen
And when you sleep remember it and retrieve these dreams
We livin' the good life we don't need these fiends
And when we focus it's easier than the free throw seems
Cousins without clothes, tell them keep those jeans
Buzzin' they top rows, now we beat those teams
Victorious, and can we bring this to the chor-e-us
And sure he is, a boy meetin' world like Cory is

And everything ain't what it seems

And if you dream that you could grab it
When obstacles arrive you drive past it
I learned there's more to life when we had a smash hit
And the only thing guaranteed in life is a casket
That's why I live it up
They try to rob me of my dreams, they told me give it up
Uh, I said I refuse, this journey I pursue
And what I do to haters, I made them my own muse
Kinda funny, I'm amused
They say your mind is the most powerful thing to use
But I hope it's just powerful as the Pope is
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, like Ford I got Focus
Yeah see you could do it if you follow it
Look into the stars, they shootin' with no hollow tips
And it isn't what it seems
So just like Yeezy, we steady gettin' out our dreams
That's good

And everything ain't what it seems
And this is for the people that's chasing they dreams

And how the saying go, things change
Skinny dude, but the flow is the size of Ving Rhames
Pennies from my thoughts add up, I hope you bring change
I know these haters ain't want me to see my wings raise
Flowin' shoes polishin', rappers I demolish it
I done lost my mind, they needed a psychologist
They could care less back when I was still in colleges
And now the boy be in London, Theophilus
It's tough tryin' to end up on the paid route
The flow is medium rare, now bring a steak out
This is my medium, here, see how it plays out
They all buggin' me, I gotta pull a Raid out
Using it sparingly, forever will they cherish me
Before I black out, introduce my moment of clarity

I'm not the same, style change
But I can leave the game
Now I'm right back to my old ways
I take life so slow, every minute gotta go

But I can leave the game

Let's take them back to days when we had no radio plays
And we had to change up our ways, cause success brings
Difference, tryin' to keep it clean
While they litterin', snakes in the grass, they try to slither in
The rose that grew from concrete, not witherin'
And it's life so fast, the lights keep flickerin'
What goes around comes back, and that's the karma truth
I log onto my closet, that shit is Karmaloop
So I get a little fresh
My teachers used to hate me, but now I could pass the test
Got confidence, subconsciousness
Makes me overlook all of my many accomplishments
But, see I get it like nobody else did
I found a deeper meaning, know what sense of self is
And I'm a die of old age
And stay true I reverted back to my old ways

I'm not the same, style change
But I can leave the game
Now I'm right back to my old ways

Yo, what better things can you hear them sing?
Ain't this like a celebration?
Swiss gears to the top we steer,
Notice my acceleration.
I do it for the have not's,
For the boy playing ball on the block.
Xaphoon told me that this was the shot,
So I stopped skipping math
And I came with a plot, plot.
I've prolly moved onto my next axis.
And if she calling, I don't care about what my ex asks.
Why, cause I'm in a lab like Bill Nye the Science Guy.

I could jump over top of the Empire State building,  just glide.

Harder to fail.
You see a train, don't be the fool that jumps on the rail.
High on the scale, if a nail girl said it.
I am well endowed like Harvard and Yale.

I'm getting shows booked, I be the noblest.
Superman, metropolis.

I'm prosperous, say we loud and too rockerish.
Pro, how long are you lockin' this?
I say until apocalypse, I got this shh'

My love is Super Size, ain’t no Happy Meal
But if I’m gonna stay (Got to wear a glove if we’re gonna make love)
I don’t wanna play
Baby roulette
Baby roulette

Yeah uh, we used to get it into college
I ain’t learn shit, forgot a lot of knowledge
The snow bunnies had the odds, boots would love swoops
You fall in love with them business majors that love suits
But shorties great right? This how we play live
Sent her a message like insomnia in on the late night
I know there’s sharks in the water, but fuck a great white
My girl won’t know you said you go Penn State right?
We playing baby roulette
So I delete all the messages I ain’t save in the text
Next, they can’t wait to hear a player confess
But shortie, you bullshit and remove that layer of dress
Yes, and this is that crazy shit
I think that it is that ""I’m gonna have a baby"" shit
But you're someone I cannot have a baby with
Just pass the blunt cause baby I ain’t gonna babysit

I hope you know that I’m for real
My love is Super Size, ain’t no Happy Meal
But if I’m gonna stay (Got to wear a glove if we’re gonna make love)
I don’t wanna play
Baby roulette (yeah it’s like)
Baby roulette

Yeah uh, and maybe it’s the way I’m loving her lady lips
Part time waitress chick saving tips
And I’m still a part of some Pretty Much Amazing shit
So roll a window up, baby we finna take this hit
We on the top floor, that’s what the game bring
My love is Super Sized, and I’mma let Train sing
And could we chill what we do is what you assume
Late night I just hit, but her roommate was in the room
Like damn, could we do this every weekend?
The baddest chicks on campus, I need them
And I don’t hate the women, so I’m prepared for love
But if we make it then of course I’m gonna wear a glove
I’m your savior, I’mma text you when I can
She falling for me, so I’m gonna catch her when I can
And when I call you we back on, loving you with the strap on
A bald head in the winter, I keeps my hat on

She hit me three hours late
Found out I left the city, bet she had the sour face
Told her I would kick it with her whenever I return

Searching for serious, life
Then I was fast
Had me speeding on this racetrack, furious
The kinda chick, the flyest nigga in the school he had her
But eff that, I'm trying to focus on what truly matters
I like em usually bad, always on punishment
Having a conversation, wishing I could punish it
And why the fantasy so far from the truth, huh?
Running in circles playing Duck, Duck, Goose, huh?
We take the shit any slower, then we gonna hold up traffic
Only hit the blunt once, then she fuckin' pass it

I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

I'm not trying to come hard, I'm trying to come me

What's the point of rap if you can't be yourself, huh?
That's why I come first like my cell phone
I'm a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it's dumb, that's the fucking reason I'm doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
'Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend's baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
(See, that's not even right)
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she's sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That's not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one

Who wears short-shorts and makes jokes sometimes?

Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here

She don't look at me like I'm the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don't want them missing a son like Bone's last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I'm grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no I.D. and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be

I hate that fucking faggot man he think that we feel that""
Or ""I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about""
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it

They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin' to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
Super Bass, super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap

Scholarship apology
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
Girls like, ""we love you, we go to LSU
You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you""
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called ""Oreo"" and ""Faggot""
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
Oh you got a mixtape? That's fantastic
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right, the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be
I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he campy
I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante

The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Nigga you act too soft
Fuck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
Yeah so, whatcha gonna do man?
You won't speak to the hood, man
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And yous'a fake fuck like a flesh light
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', ""You could tear this up""
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be

No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have, isn't half bad
The text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck, till we come, to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing
I'm ghost and you know this

I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she gonna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light

I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You coulda' wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I'm the best when I'm a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related, racist
I give you money, then you burn it, like you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this

Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?

It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
My momma said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down
Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now
But them niggas saw through me
Are you serious? What is this?
Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis
Listening to ""Sky is the Limit"" on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can
Dope boy swag
I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter
Who was a radio head and okay at them computers
At the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead
Ambition drove the hearse
But niggas got my feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?
The black experience is blackened serious
Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us

The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see you how they wanna see you
'Til you make them see you in some other way
I'm trippin' off the other day
Cause God knows what these white kids sayin'
Dude you're not not racist cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism
It's hard to pin it cause you'd only understand
If you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father, you should stick around if you could
Cause even if you're bad at it, you get Tiger Woods
Or MJ
We warriors, we all need senseis
Change everything that we've done so far
I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R
I mean just the way that we see each other
I won't stop until they say, ""James Franco is the white Donald Glover""
Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness
Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice

And she's doing coke in front of me, but act like I don't notice
""There any breakage in that Trojan?""
She see what she wanna see
So I make her take plan B in front of me

Putting on a stone face
He's saving up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me
They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood they think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit

They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my Grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He's supposed to pay ‘em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow
Like that would do somethin'
But she's got six kids, she's gotta do somethin'
She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain't around
He lookin' at me now, like
""Why you so fuckin' lucky?
I had a father too
But he ain't around so I'mma take it out on you""
We used to say ""I love you""
Now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over
I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are because you're young and black
Don't believe ‘em
You're still that kid that kept the older boys from teasin'

Murder versus the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom

I've seen the future, and the future go

This is on a bus back from camp. I'm thirteen and so are you. Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble. It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That's you. And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us. We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles. I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you, but I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me. You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer, content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on. A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh, is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh, but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be. A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her, whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet

Back in the real world we don't go to the same school, and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood, we won't go to the same high school. So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something. And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something. The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep. We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know. And then I'm like, “Can I tell you something?” And all of a sudden I'm telling you. And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway. And there's no expression on it. And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said “yes” or “no” yet. And regrettably I end up using the word “destiny.” I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter. Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay.” I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to spoil the moment, but there's nowhere to go because we're are on a bus. So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am.

I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore. The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on. I turn and you're not there. Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore. We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church. The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now, your bags and things piled high in the trunk. The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus, just as one of them reaches my row. It used to be our row, on our way off. It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head. Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise. She stops and looks down at me. And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face, but I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny.” Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus. I didn't know you were friends with them.

I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over. So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts. This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad, this is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not, I'm just saying it's what I learned. I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them. But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you. Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose. I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus. I still haven't.",That Power

Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try

Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a Watchtower
Any anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait until I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and I finish it

We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha-
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The sauce was so malo then she said ""you need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song""
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's the Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone, now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden this burden, hurtin', they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying ""go hard""
Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out, ""it's the best,"" no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, keeling myself
No one's ever been this lost
I just get the information retweeted or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who are you? Don't do it. Who are you?)
I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make 'em dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces are shit with breakfast
Funny the day you born that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
And plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talking to eat, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas taking props like a musical live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her ""I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help""
She text me ""how you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?""
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass, ""you see what these labels do to me""
Texts said ""I'm Wet"", I said ""hold up, wait up a minute""
H2O plus my D, that's the hood I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up

You're here now. You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you. You have to help me

I mean, our cars came and the lights were on them 
so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night you were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was, yours
It was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me on this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends

Hate keeps a man alive, its gives him strength

While cutting their shadows, kill them into the dark trough

Only way could be hard in their small and human nation
I kill the first man, getting by death, we are God, through death

Go, get up, victims that died
Waiting for death, I should cry

Take the farther off to cut your means,
Listening up for afraid by means,
They showed laughing me for my heart
So they wake up these scythes, following me,
Cold wind blow out, now to go,
Let it go again with the scythes

(Something wild!)

It`s got the light, blow it out within you
Never let the best shot come from fucking Avalon, that`s the one
Time to feel my spirit, I gathered my souls
Beat my night to kill them into my sin (doom, get up!)

I can`t get up, shadows, down (can't get up!)
Set them along, time is right, far too along
They wake me up (wake me up!)",The Nail
Children of Bodom,"I cannot get up by the howling cry 
Just justify my longing to die, 
Bury me down at last, 
I think about it in the shadows and cry! 

Can scissors heal a man torn of tears, 
A fading I fear inside. 
The reaper in sheet will stand by me 
I'm dreaming, I'm wearing a black dress that night! 

I'm just a being tonight, 
And still I'm dressed so black, oh yeah! 
Maybe I'm just blind, 
But maybe I should try

Can't you see why the vision is calling you? 

I got the one, the dream of horror! 
Dreams of blood, dreams of war! 
Rudest eyes have seen the fright 
Welcome to the eternal night! 

You won't be a butcher 
No, you won't be at last 
Somebody's the trigger 
Take it off! 
What, you are the priest's son? So fuck 
So fuck yourself and die

Sill I stand against the death! 
Am I just a shade? 
Always I'm awake and in black! 
Sill I dare to praise the Lord, 
No I won't pass to the lord 
Goodbye, no

So the keeper waits upon, 
He waits upon a border 
Let me own your punishment, 
It's time to break the border! 

The Candlelight fades away 
There's nothing at all but me

(So it's right...) 
(I can leave the shadows!) 
(The last one has to survive!) 
Yaww! 
Wow, right! 

With my light shining bright 
I got my way, to regret ? (just my hearts)? 
With my last dying rhyme I got my world 
To betray for what I did by my motherfucking heart!

sky and up a cloudy draw

And their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shining
And their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him
As they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry

Their faces gaunt their eyes
Were blurred and shirts all soaked with sweat

But he ain't caught them yet

On horses snorting fire

Plunder and pillage yet
Complain whine and cry like a baby
Ain't so tough after all
You claim that u don't believe in nothing
Goddamn that must be exhausting
I know, you know this is getting
Boring. A lil dull. Don't you think

And not to mention hatred. Loath and revulsion
You just throw around. Like it's not
Even there

Embracing dissolution
Is that who
I have become
Over the years?

Aversion to entity and
Life in this world
Broke you up in tears

So what's got to do with you?

Close yet far - I've gone now
Safe and sound - I don't know how
Knuckled under - never giving up
And it all goes to show exactly what?

So much fun when you can tell me I'm dun
Such a sweet unchaining sound

Whisper me softly that I'm gonna die young
Before you do take a look into the ground
It's not my funeral

If you rip my life apart in no time
I'll put it back together in 2.5
How's that for punctuality?

And I know you do
Better be aware I'm gonna fuck you too
But you should by now be schooled in that very piece of my minds's obscurity",Not My Funeral
Children of Bodom,"Hey there, I think I know you.
What was it, you're contending to do?
That's rite, manipulate everyone
Around to deem you're over due

With a dry, blunt block of wood
Upgrade it to a grater and still won't do no good

C'mon Miss Suicide, let me hand my blade
To you. And since we're here
You might as well cut me too.

Back to me

No regret. I'm content to be bad

Relentless. no way I'm giving up.
I dare you make me stop
Reckless - shattered dreams and broken ribs
Annihilated into bits
Forever, I'll stay on the run

Is this my fate, was that my life I just saw flash before my eyes

Saw a lot of smiles, felt tears of joy
Oh the hope, all the life for me to destroy,
Going up going down in a hole so small
A rise followed by a free motherfuckin' fall

I'm living with things all twisted
Breathing in life I resisted
This was my fate this is the world where I belong

Don't know how long I've been gone
Nor do I recall things I've done

It just feels so wrong.
It seems too good that I was always just misunderstood

I'm living with now gone, dismissed.

But now she’s gone

Refuse to let this cut me deep
Now to make her pay
Left to feel so numb
Yes, you may cut me again
But I mark these words with a blade
That I’ll find you once again, Morrigan!

In every way, seen her alluring disguise
A six-foot tall bloody, jet-black scythe
Is all that’s with me with the things I’ve done

He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim

The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame

That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet

The truth will set you free, let you see the light
You don't need to watch TV tonight
And stop talkin while I'm speakin or start walkin
Coke you're smokin got you gaggin and coughin
It's a beacon of light that I present
Illuminatin the mic with common sense
I profile the style of the Chill one
Now close your eyes, son, cause I'm the rising sun
Back up, don't sweat me, let me earn my pay
People fiendin for funky tracks we lay
Need I say I built my rep on
The fact when others turned back I kept on
Rhymin, climbin, the timin, the fist fighter
All you crumb snatchers, I'm here to diss biters
I don't trust you any further than I can throw you
You have any doubts? Look, let me show you

[ VERSE 2 ]
What type of thing are you into? These rhymes I'm bringin you
Are sort of like slingin you, I'll tell you a thing or two
I see what's in front of me, the G is no want to-be
I hope you know this ain't as hype as it's gonna be
I know I'm original, the G is no criminal
Never switchin position cause the condition is terminal
I do what I gotta do like a brother's supposed to
I'm livin my life right like I took an oath to
I'm pushin my way through, I won't let you slow me down
Chill is a prefix, Rob is a proper noun
G is for greatness, I don't want to debate this
The way that I'm risin I appear to be weightless
I may sound crazy, this might look easy
Suckers don't faze me, crabs don't skeeze me
You want to know the time, then bust a rhyme
Here's my favorite line - let me show you

[ VERSE 3 ]
I hear a lot of rappers who seem to lackluster
Execute your rhyme with all the force that you can muster
Just a hint, as I sprint toward my own goal
Rob is chill, got skill and get stone-cold
But I'm a free thinker, I'll tinker with your brain game
More when I put you on board my thought train
All aboard, you can all applaud, and Lord
Have pity on a fake or flake or fraud
Think you're cool? What a fool we take you for
Wastin time on rhymes that make you snore
Puttin yourself to sleep is ridiculous
To shake you up, wake you up, we kick you this
Seems like you get up and go, got up and left
Now just watchin me you're all out of breath
Sit down, relax yourself, don't tax yourself
Here's a pretty good question to ask yourself
Am I lackin, how am I livin, am I givin all I got?
If not, let me show you
",Let Me Show You
Chill Rob G.,"My rhymes as I kick them ( ? ) em to the beat
I'm advancin, people dancin in the street
To my drum, more wise words from the Chill one
You felt the effect in the past and you're still numb
Leavin you bugs in the dust is a must for me
Silly you clowns got around and discuss the G
Wonderin which move I might make next
I'm stackin my rhymes so I climb to the apex
Why should I wait for a date with destiny?
I'll pick the time, the place that's best for me
Don't bother tryin to block or hold me back
Advancement is my mind's only track
I'm an aristocrat, a ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with a gift for rap
So I'm shootin my mouth off cause suckers are shootable
Flauntin my flesh cause I'm black and it's beautiful
Many have fallen from bein too careless
It pays to raise your cultural awareness
Know who you are, where you're goin and where you came from
Breakin your neck for respect, man, that's plain dumb
Respect is somethin you gain by bein yourself
Otherwise we're respectin somebody else
The person you want to be, not who you really are
Yo, can you follow me, or did I just go too far?
I don't want to confuse y'all, so just get on board
And walk this way, cause I'm movin forward
Advancin, swift is how I move
Before I grip the mic I calm my mood
Let me activate, I'm an activist
You want to rap? Develop an knack for this
Learn to use your head, got to be more careful
Be doin nothin stupid cause somebody dared you
I'm an ear full, an eye full and a rival
Givin you back what you lack for survival
Into rappin, it just so happens that I'm a blackman
Rob is chill, got skill and I pack jams
Rhymes I wrote I devote to promote pride
People can quote what I spoke cause I don't lie
My records do not slip, skip and they won't slide
This jam was made by the King and I
Mark's remarkable, bass shakes the floor board
The whole place vibrates while I'm movin forward
Out of my way, you seen my comin
Drop from the sky and I hit the ground runnin
No confusion or complication
The name is still Chill Rob and this groove is Motivation

A little misunderstanding
I can't get her on the telephone
Hanging out down on Main Street
Living in a different world
Standing around with the gang on the corner
Talking about my girl

My girl, she was the world to me
She's gone, away across the street
My girl, is just a memory
She's been so long away

She didn't have to leave me
She didn't have to run
She didn't have to go without a word to anyone
I hope she's doing alright
I got no way to know
Unless she gets to hear this song
Hear it on the radio

My girl, she was the world to me
She's gone, and that's a tragedy
My girl, is just a memory
She's been so long away

I hope she gets the message
Got to get back, you know
Gonna track her down, I'll find that girl
Gonna tell her that I love her so
Put the word on the grapevine
Spread it all around the world
Sooner or later I know I'm gonna get her
I'm talking about my girl
My girl

Chilliwack,"Well I woke up in the morning one terrible day?All of my dreams had dried up and blown away?No more easy money the wrong kind of fame?And too many questions when the telephone rang 
Now the telephone leaves a lot to be desired?For communication - I'd much rather be by your side?But when you owe a lot of money and they're calling to collect?It's a long long distance to get their hands around your neck?When the whole game lands on you how you ever gonna see it through 
How you ever gonna satisfy all the people on the telephone?You got one last saving grace they're not talking to you face to face?There ain't a damned thing they can do - theyr'e just talking to a telephone 
Tell it to the telephone - tell it to the telephone 
I don't mind this working overtime?But I gotta get away from the ringing all day?Going round and round - round and round?Round and round 
Well who ran away with all of my cash - never say the tables turning?It's all happening in a flash?One day I was a hero next in debt?All the people on the telephone trying to make me sweat 
TOO MANY ENEMIES(Henderson)?(chorus)?Enemy lies cut you down to size?You're hypnotized who's the bad guy now 
I got too many enimies and not enough friends?I may call on your help before we reach the end?Can't look out my window can't walk outta my door?I don't think I like this anymore

I got too many enimies and not enough friends?Seems like everybody's touchy everything offends?Boarded up my windows double lock upon my door?They really can't complain about me anymore",Tell It to the Telephone

You make your move you take it how it goes?
And when the end as anybody knows is near?
You hope that you win 

Just the same you really like the game?
So you walk on, walk on?
Money they say can buy an easy way - but you walk on, walk on

You cannot fuck with me 
Like you have in the past 
This time I will stop you 
Dead in your fucking tracks 
Your eyes close away 
As I feel salvation 
Now you pray 
Light, the final vision 
Your eyes are blank 

I want to commit murder 
Feel the rush as I kill

Collecting your last thoughts

et que l'amour ce barre sans aucune importance

For a lead role in a cage?

Has happened many times

I've never seen you taking any prisoners, 
But I've seen you weep
Yeah, I've seen you apologizing, 
But that's not gonna work with me.

I've heard you're telling everybody 
What you've done to him
But that doesn't add up to a sorry 
And it's not gonna work with me

China Drum,"I had a dream last night, I remember I had a daughter
But I was scared to leave you alone all day with her
I know what you're thinking, it's a bit too harsh to come from me
How could anyone have that problem with someone like you
I'm sorry did you think I liked you?

How are you feeling?
Does it make your spine curl up with shame
To think that we thought of you as a person not to blame
But now it's plain to see all those fists you gave behind closed doors
We're no longer private secrets, when you boasted of your thoughts
Was she thankful for that day?

He was being cruel to be unkind
Now the stains have washed away, he's got nothing bad left to say
That doesn't mean that I would like him now
He'd be stupid to think he'd get away with what had scarred someone so deep inside

So nobody's caring
So when was the last time that affected him
He hasn't got a constructive thought inside his head
But still he keeps on digging, but the only way he's digging is down
So now are you happy in your new foxhole?
Are you thankful for this day?

He was being cruel to be unkind
Now the stains have washed away, he's got nothing bad left to say
That doesn't mean that I would like him now
He'd be stupid to think he'd get away with what had scarred someone so deep inside

Did you think you were safe dug in your new foxhole?
I'll be thankful for that day
We never imagined he could be that way
Our first impressions had no trace

He was being cruel to be unkind
He never thought that he would look behind
Now the stains are here to stay
They're never gonna be washed away
'Cause he was being cruel to be unkind

Did you think you were safe dug in your new foxhole?
I'll be thankful for that day
We never imagined he could be that way
Our first impressions had no trace

This is just a feeling, correct me if I'm wrong
But did he have to walk away from the crimes that stained him?
Now he'll have to wait, like on an empty station
Maybe change his name or find a new vocation
So nobody's caring, when was the last time that affected him?
He hasn't got a constructive thought inside his head
But still he keeps on digging, he says he's sorry, it'll never happen again

 On the rip of this straightest of the life that I live 
 But uh I see em comin before they approach 
 Just like a stafty slot until you circle with hope 
 I maintaining on your legendary dreams and stack 
 Making million dollar moves with many platinum plaques 
 Negotiate your freedom, you catchin CRP 
 From the court from blue, come many nights no sleep 
 What's the scenerio of life when you trapped in crime 
 My lil homie still incarcerated for packing a nine 
 Now history repeat itself, there's black on black 
 Check my backround, there's evidence just hide it's back 
 Eliminate all my foes, we run violent thrusts 
 Excuse me for my crime but in God I trust 
 Bossalinie uneffected by the eyes of even 
 Cause I'm military minded and demand my freedom

 Verse 2 
 Record labels try to sign for many years infact 
 Want a life time commitment, get you hooked like crack 
 independent, black owned, you can keep your deal 
 I remain with No Limit cause the tank be real 
 I lose my cousin eight years for the time he spent 
 The penetentary is full of black violent, meant 
 Try to make a change, they can't 
 Cause they cuffs to tight 
 Momma please help us cause my mind ain't right 
 It ain't easy being me with my skin so toned 
 The mother land ain't been the same since they took me from home 
 My mobile phone in the benz, gettin high with my friends 
 Rainy days got us fighting each other, digging our graves 
 A cell block full of pictures, can't wait for parole 
 I need a second change of life cause I'm getting to old 
 And it's cold I can't see, can't sleep at night 
 Like a rebel for my freedom, I'll be prepared to fight

And now you don't pay any attention to any word I say
And all the colours around me are fading into grey
Maybe I was too sure, but it's still hard to understand
It seems so obscure

Sometimes I feel like a satellite alone on my way
Sometimes I feel like a satellite in outer space with an aching heart
Sometimes I feel like a satellite I've got nothing more to say
Sometimes I feel like a satellite somewhere out in the dark

You wrote me letters in which you've tried to explain
But I'm sorry the feeling that remains is still only the pain
You want me to be your friend, but I don't know if I'm able to
For the moment it seems too hard, because I still feel too much for you

I don't know, maybe there will come a time, But for now

Is there anybody out there who leads me through the darkest night
Is there anybody out there who deserves to heal my broken heart
Is there anybody out there I can put my trust in right from the start",Satellite

I made another couple million, hopin that will solve'em
Promise, lookin to reject your favorite rap star

They lookin at me like where the fuck they found them
Whoever the fuck signed them, I bet that they gon fire'em
But it's official, big chile slash asylum
You know the three digits, bitch you better dial'em.

Two rides outside with that OG ride
I'm high but it's all gravy
Snake skins, no Timbaland boots, get loot
I'll shoot if you try to play me
Get clout when I'm out, money what I'm all about
In a world that's so shady
Peep this streetness, never had a weakness
Peep this, I do this daily
Follow my whole set, bottles of moet
Bet until they lay me
Six feet in the dirt, I'm the one with the work
Got hits but they try to spray me
If I lack, keep straps, it's a wrap, gimme daps
You can roll with me, yeah maybe
Hey the streets is mine like mixtapes
When an MC grind don't play crazy

E'rybody talkin since they see I'm on a roll
Touch what's mine, you gon' end up gettin' mowed
Ladies they love me like they just found a pot of gold
Jackpot, I'm scoring big around the globe
You can be hot, I'm what you not and that's cold
Cold with the flow, dro when it goes
Sick, baby said she never drove a stick
Until she was ontop of me, backseat of the six
It's goin down round these parts
Nobody liked me till I got the deal so don't start
Is it different? Is it dope? I dunno what you yappin about
Its way too funky for you to smell what I'm rappin about

Don't it look like a hundred moons in my wrist?
I'm sorry I'm the glitter that your girls seen glists (??)
Swim with the big fish, I hit I don't miss
Sorta like Starks shootin' free's for the Knicks
Don't get me pissed, you'll take a big diss
It'll feel like you fell off a tall cliff
I'm a bully like Cliff (??) I sank yo ship
Six o'clock from the clip if you pop off a lip

They tell me what you tell me, you ain't gotta be in a rush
Errything I do is top secret, that's on the hush (shhhh)
Cat handlin hard in the city, makin women blush
From 314 to 617, gotta give it up
Treat my women like a structure, workers work the streets
Twerk ya meat, go get it till it hurts ya feet
Hurt in ya sleep, get wit me and we could ching all night
Hearr the slots ring all night
But if you try to get at the drama, I'll bring all night
We keep Atlanta throwin bows
And New Orleans, we got the thugs showin golds
Take it to New York, and party at Madison Squarre
We'll hit Cali and smash a model chick wit long hairr
No hatin on my part, let the ceremony start
Crowd around us sumthin new, sittin on top of the Arch
STL, where I dwell, Northside of the streets
They keep a quarter piece freak for the sheets, now speak uh

So I showed them, it ain't that hard
Can't play me, 'cause I ain't got a whole card

(I'm the calm one, but my crew is sorta sick)
Yeah, big l is the first to represent.

Yo, on the mic is big l, that brother who kicks flavs, god.
Known for sendin' garbage mcs to the graveyard.
I pack a gat, not a slingshot;
Step to this and get an ass-whoopin' like rodney king got.
Or get beat to your death like cochise,
My laws is no peace, fuck the police.
M-C's get braggin' about cash they collect,
But them chumps is like ray Charles,
Cause they ain't seen no money yet.
Trash rappers I tax and spark,
I be wettin' niggas up like water rides at action park.
A nigga stuck me, and that ain't funny son,
So I got money gun, they wet him and his honey bun.
Cause phony faggots I froze, it's a fact,
I flip fast on foes with fabulous fantastic flows.
L is the rebel type, I'm rough as a metal pipe,
Fuck a benz, cause I could pull skins on a pedal-bike.
Props, I got the most, no mc comes close,coast-to-coast,
Shows I host, foes I roast, adios, I'm ghost

[Chorus]

Yo, street ? in new york is a place this nigga stands
With a machete I'm a crazy Eddie scissor hands.
Born with such a thirst to kill,
I can tap 200 quarters from a $50 bill.
Cuttin' bitch-niggas down with a hundred pound axe
Like I was raised by psycho-crazed lumberjacks.
So in a battle I be stabbin',choppin' M-C'ss like trees,
Piece-by-piece buildin' cabins.
I'm a maniac magician, Abra cadabra,
Makin' pain appear cause I'm-a grab arusty chain to make a noose
To choke your ass so hard, you're spittin' fuckin' adam's apple juice.
So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.
Baseball battin' 'em, splattin' 'em,
So many homicide records, my cases went platinum.
D'shawn is nice,
Known for givin' out head cracks without touchin' dice.
Just pain and punishment from the boogie down bronxter,
D'shawn the maniac street mobster.

[Chorus]

It's the f-I-n-e-double-s-e,
Don't play or stress me
Cause that shit don't impress me
I make papes off the shit I create, and then dictate
So get your motherfuckin' shit straight
I got skills and I'm hard to kill,
So y'all bitch-ass rappes better chill and just guard your grill
You grab a mic and always get hype
Talkin' bout fuckin' niggas up
When you can bearly beat your dick right
So stop ridin' my dilznick
Cause I can still kick the ill shit on the motherfuckin' real tip
Hit like foreman when I'm brawlin'
Those who think I'm fallin, I'll play your monkey-ass like a organ
I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine
Crab-ass rappers, don't even front cause y'all know the time
So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left

[Chorus]

Check-check-check it a to the g is gonna wreck it.
On stage, on my record, so nigga don't forget it.
I'm the man. the one-man-band is on my right hand.
(his name is show nitwit, so get wit the program)
I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.
Styles will vary, they won't carry over.
Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.
Tryin' real hard to get it,
You can forget it, because you don't got it.
And my skills are excellent, diggin' in the crates
And it's time to represent!

Back slap that ass
Clap that ass
Dropping body bags

Four blocks you fast
Talk your trash (Drop you fast)
Never jock a cat

Shot is stacked
Rock your hair
Watch my mirror
Stocking caps so I watch my style
Cock and grab
Open up shop and draft
Quarter bags all of that
Water lasts shorter halves
Have ya comin back cause I'm fourth of stash
Extort the hash
Extort the wrath
Cope the past
Brought my mags
Sort my cash on the docks
Flock a hop
Keep it in a proper spot
Adopt a cop
Rob a spot
A lot of ice a cop or not
Drop a pot
Slide a lot
Jackpot a lot
Already got a lot of wine, but not in my ride, I'll stop

We..are..dangerous
He'll mangle us
Who playing with us?
And saying this stuff?
And fuck with gangs and stuff?
I aim to bust
You straight up tough
No thanks to us
We're famous, duh
A game I love
To train my sluts
To give brains and cuss
Learn pain and plus
Get tricks to claim the bust
Think they nuts
Slurp them up
Hook or work them up
Wake them up, break them up
Taking crust shake them up
Make it stuck in your twat
Hit the streets, bend the blocks
Sin or not, hit the daily spot
Gin or scotch, top notch
On my roster
Mobster eating pasta
Chop her in the closer, crack her like a lobster
Have my ho to rob you
Then dodge you
Any ho need work?  I got a job for you
Go see the supplier
Make like you a buyer
Then buy slut, trick these fake playas
Often what they say, you'll buy em up messiah
Wait and bring it bacj to my empire
Chingy keep these heffers on the strip and on fire
Try her

One thing leading to another; let the party begin

Peeps call me up, said it's a hotel party
Just bring the liquor; there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way (way); let me stop by the store
Get a twelve pack of Corona plus a ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 2-7, need a natural graze road
I'm already blowed; hit third, I'm a be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet lookin' like he in the game and must be winning
To room four-nine-O I'm headed; on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like ""wassup""
I told 'em: ""follow me"" 
They knew I had it cracking, B	
One said, ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Yeah, that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit' much ding-a-ling.""
Knock on the door; I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then; feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in here; I heard 'em whispering
Talking 'bout ""that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr'; he glistening.""
I ain't come to talk (talk), I ain't come to sit (sit)
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon' hit; aww, shit

Ma showed up like, ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom, seeing what's poppin'
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, actin' silly
The girl said, ""can I be in yo' video?"" 
I'm like ""yeah!"" Oh really?
Now she naked, strip teasing; me, I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G bring the camera
Then I thought about no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still whiling
Sharing the next room wit' some girls lookin' like they from an island

Stop, drop, kaboom! Baby, rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little; make ya mammary glands giggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender vittles
Doctor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D,"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit' no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle down the beat wit' a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky; I'm wit' Chingy at the Holiday Inn

Girls talk, dudes do it, I ain't herre to impress a chick

It was weird how we met, huh?
She was with her mom at Bank of America
I'm with my son cashing a check, so I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world or fly, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, momma looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about his girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever starts
So I zoomed off thinkin' bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (what did she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you Then I say

(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away

The next day I'm with the fellas at the case playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin' off, tryin' to dunk, tryin' to dribble
Break fast threw the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess with it please don't
Told her I'm goin home she asked can she go too
I'm like yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-threw thong on looked at her and I said

(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin' with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
'Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place like a child
Don't worry be happy and smile

Sparkin pound while my homies in the street, slapped right

The club be packed, Hey, send me a bottle of that
It's hella ass, some with glitter and exotic tats
You know my stats, superfly, MAC
I'm in the back getting worked by this girl named Cognac, matta fact
I want to take her home, the reefer got me in the zone
Intentions to bone, we all alone, by ourself
This ain't a strip club, but she act like it
Ever seen her, bowling pins dawg, she stacked like it
Now I'm at the bar, chicks treating me like a star
In my face, asking questions, and can they ride in my car
I'm law, so authorities can't pin me for shit
Hey baby, see me and you, we can pack it up and split
Let's go, forget Motel 6, we can go to the Mariot
I see it in her eyes, man a girl getting very hot
I'm packing like a 357, so I keep magnums
Keep it real, cause you will never find out if you don't ask em, Is we tagging?

[Chorus]

If your ass is fat and you know it, clap your hands
Wearing those pants, I'll be damned if I'm iss my chance to advance
I'm in a tan, what's the name, I own some whatchamacallits
They keep spinning and spinning, hey man, What do you call it?
Got a 1-5 jersey, on the go with them wheels
Look at it wiggle wiggle, she say it's all in the heels
You a damn lie girl, I think it's all in the skills
And for real, I think you practicing on what pay the bills
You be confused man, I look picky as hell
Never trust a big butt, that smile like Ricky Bell
What the hell?, Murphy rather pay to get out of jail
Cause if she tell me to pay, somebody better pay my bail
Matta fact, I'ma pay myself, my own money
Mr. long money, even after I loan money
I own honey's mentals man, I'm in they mouth so much
God damn, I pay for dental plans, man

[Chorus]

Get it, get it girl, it's your world, I'm a squirrel, (squirrel)
Searching for a nut, so more than scissors I cut, (cut)
You can be a slut (slut), hoochie lady, or housewife, (wife)
A real man gon' want to hit it, it's hanging out, right? (right)
Ladies don't get offended, when he tell you that you're thick, (you are)
And he wouldn't mind coming over about six
If you like the smooth, let him, you don't dig em? Don't sweat 'em
You want 'em? Play like your panties and t-shirt and let 'em wet 'em

Hey yo, my ladies come in  Dueces like  Staley  and  McAllister
Came up with the 'Tics, they help me not fall like banisters
Sammy Sosa's got traded for Ken Griffey's
And when we roll, the L's stay lit, like Missy
Plus I stay busy, like kids, I call  it biz
And if it is what it is, I'm on your head like wigs
I'm a rapping Taye Diggs, I give the women they groove back
When it comes to the wood, I'm the best man to use that

Watch ya step, or I'll ruin ya rep
Now let's ""get it"" like Puff and G-Dep

Stocking caps so I watch my style

Quarter bags all of that
Water lasts shorter halves
Have ya comin back cause I'm fourth of stash
Extort the hash
Extort the wrath
Cope the past
Brought my mags
Sort my cash on the docks
Flock a hop
Keep it in a proper spot
Adopt a cop

To train my sluts
To give brains and cuss
Learn pain and plus
Get tricks to claim the bust
Think they nuts
Slurp them up
Hook or work them up
Wake them up, break them up
Taking crust shake them up
Make it stuck in your twat
Hit the streets, bend the blocks
Sin or not, hit the daily spot
Gin or scotch, top notch
On my roster
Mobster eating pasta
Chop her in the closer, crack her like a lobster
Have my ho to rob you
Then dodge you
Any ho need work? I got a job for you
Go see the supplier
Make like you a buyer
Then buy slut, trick these fake playas
Often what they say, you'll buy em up messiah
Wait and bring it bacj to my empire

You want to mob wit' me (Yes I do derrty)
It's all you what you see (I know what)
Ain't no playin' in these streets

I'ma slide in and slide out her
Big work is what I hide in my house
For the hate ammunition make 'em hide out
Leave ya head like a highway wide out
Flat out once the cat out, gats out
Bring forearms and bats out, chainsaws to ax out
The blackout it's too white but need a black house
Got a rat spouse, who act out, overcracked out
Gotta access with the back out, on a back route
To send shots at that house
Rats snitch so I trap mouse
Need a hit big boss man Chingy who they ask bout
Up and on ya can is blast out
Smashed out
Eyes red once the hash out
Every check gotta get cashed out
Trips for my people on the first in
Bustin' in I'm the last out

[Chorus:]

The usual suspect but never seen
Like my paper foreever green wit a together team
Whatever seems leads to better cream
Better bring them Beredda things
Like it rain in the dark I wet a team
My level's mean instead of lean (lean)
Or here the face of this earth bout to let a stream
Last night I seen Jesus face the earth and shed a turr (tear)
Will I make it or be dead this yurr (year)
Nah I be glossin on them shiny feet like a pedicurr (cure)
Posted up in a tactic like metal gear
The rose petal's here (uh)
You from the concrete cracks never met a fear (urr)
Just a metaphor to better your head'll blurr
Instead of blurr let it clurr, how stress is and let it cure (urr)
Haters hate it, hurr slap you like hunters at a duur (eer)
This present year not for you peasants here (urr)
My message here is a must now that I address you queer (urr)

[Chorus:]

Once I weighed the beats
Behave the streets
Pave the week
With heat seven days a week
Plays in sheet
Grenade ya peeps invade ya cheats
Bitches want to blood bath so I bathe the freaks
Save ya grief, yo make up, I made ya meat
You made the beef, I ate the beef
Knock out ya fronts ta where they have to tape ya teeth
Replace ya teeth
You too soft ain't no way that you can face the street
I lace the beat
Track runner feds can't trace my feet
Or replace my bars in a place wit' bars
Speedy racer won't cha race these cars
Make me large take charge and say we stars
Don't play we are make me war
Go crazy and blow up some shit
Rep yo hood 'cause you goin see me throw up some shit
Pull it out and slug up some shit
Tore up and spit clips to them peoples come in and show up wit shit

[Chorus:]

Uh huh that's just to let you know when you mob wit me
Don't ask no questions if you goin' roll, then roll
If you not goin' roll, then I'm goin' roll right over
Mobb wit me who
The west side goin' mob wit' me

Make money with my partners as I murder my foes

In all black clothes like the Grim Reaper
It's G.I.B. and I'm my brother's keeper
Richie Rich will chop his fingers with the axe
These trick-ass cowards should be wearin' tampax

What ya think this is, huh, a lifetime story
Man, I'm knockin' cowards off of my riders before me

Respect mine, I'll have Guerrillas kickin' in your door time

We're deep with the artillery, impose on your spot
Plenty G's, plus, a silly G, I'll get your ass knocked
Ridin' in a minivan, contraband in my hand
Find these buzzards, split their wig that is my master plan

Stressing bout to take 4 blunts to the head
Making a revolution listening to dead prez
He say, She say i don't curr what they said
Number 1 hustler said equip with the bread
IRS tripping so fuck the FEDS
Taking shit to these devils cut off my legs
Lord don't let em put me in my death bed
For my son,nieces and nephews life I plead
Sit drinking yak till my eyes get red
Pass me a clip I'm a magnum to the lead
I hope society will let my love spread
Cause my lil' cousin steadily thuggin' before they go I'm dead.

Fake player, afraid I'll take your lady.
Where the shotcallers at?

I got the pots up in the kitchen,
I'm just a baller pitching-in my division.
Yes, me coming, some people be like dissing
My 26 rims like full moons, they be glistening.
So yes I got my eye for these chicks when I'm dishing.
The critics be talking, I walk past and start hissing.
Looking at my wrists, and shooting them balls in Detroit like I play for the pistons.
Baby if you listening, I'm a' tour so much,
Folks say I'm missing, gettin'.
This baller s-k-in', I be running around with it, spitting it.
The hood in here, a lotta ballers drop down in here,
I wish you would in here, We smoke good in here.
Moving through your hood shining,
Keep yellow, I'm gonna wear blue diamonds,
Look mellow, always be grinding, rhyming-

[Chorus]

It ain't nothing to a boss,
That's why I spent three hundred on a cross!
Pink and yellow, that's the combination.
I know a skinny rapper out here player hating.
Cause I got thirty blocks on my resume,
I got my own liquor, why he drinking Alize?
Me and Chingy got the pop charts on lock,
But I still get respect on my own block.
Niggas try to take my money, but I bounce back,
Three cribs, one viper, and a Maybach.
I'm like, baby, you can call me the birdman.
But I'm the boss, I don't hustle on the curb, man.
Now everybody in my crib got a clover chain,
So even when I'm not around, they promote the name.
I'm Lil' Flip, rapping H-town 'till I'm gone.
I took a trip to Amsterdam smoking out a bomb,
A baller, baby!

[Chorus]

That's me, that's right, I've got a Bentley for sure,
A hundred million in the bank, plus I'm getting some more.
I'm the type of dude, moving more product than stores.
I'm a cook it in the kitchen for the price of the room.
I've got black diamonds, quarter million biller on shore.
On a white sandy beach with kickers and whores.
Said I'm on another level that you can't afford:
Princess cuts, round diamonds, and getting more.
That's why I shoot my dice four thousand or more,
Cause my price at work sure be on soar.
That's why we need a hundred grand for at stores,
Cause I won't settle for nothing less than more.

I'm a bad block crook out hurr runnin' wild
Bout to run up on your ass Tommy gun style
Call me One-eyed Willy since I sleep with my clothes
Make money with my partners as I murder my foes
In all black clothes like the Grim Reaper
Its G.I.B. and I'm my brother's keeper

These trick-ass cowards should be wearin' Tampax
What ya think this is, huh, a Lifetime story
Man I'm knockin' cowards off of my riders before me
Lay it down motherfucker and quit bumpin' your gums,
Ain't no peace in the slums just bums and crumbs

Police say G.I.B. is a game
But we hooded up doin' our family thing
Straight up hang and swing in the city of ?
Increasin' my change to an impeccable range
That you can't reach, if you listen I'll teach
Of course I'm a beast on them tracks I release
Whether East or West, I envision a check
That my show pay, I'm a predator, hey
So where's my prey 'cause it's possible for me to be poppin today

Money's my mission but the way I live ain't no guarantees
Just visions of casualties, sworn to municipalities
Got 'em after me 'cause a coward chose to speak on how I eat
But I don't play when it comes to my meat
Like the ? brothers, leave 'em layin' between the sheets
See we Get It Boyz, so we roll with the heat
If money got a problem, tell him he goin' get beat

[Chorus]

I'll put you lames in the place where you're eternally restin'
And for that player-hatin' testin', you gon' meet the Smith and Wesson
Cause these bad block niggas take no prisoners at war times
Respect mine, I'll have Guerrillas kickin' in your door time
We're deep with the artillery, impose on your spot
Plenty G's plus a silly G to get your ass-knot
Ridin' in a minivan, contraband in my hand
Find these buzzards, split their wig, that is my master plan
I don't start it but I finish it a true gun blazer

Huggin' me holdin' me fixed dinner so polite,

And I know I make yall ni**as sick
I move crumbs to bricks
Too fly rides
Wood frame playa leather inside
That's dat high definition tv live
Check the chain, check the wrist, check the buckle

Aye neon, the flyest the freshest the coldest
The smoothest to ever to walk this earth and I knows this
High dats probably from purple puffin and drumsticks
I got enough game to spit this rap through a whole chick
It ain't me actin' 'cause see dis homie I'm choosen
Wrist all bliss because my watch is all slowed and
My life photo shoots see daily I be posin'
I hit the club and git it poppin til its closin
I take you back in the days bugs bunny j's
Low cut fade and them Cartier shades
Pimpin' until I'm dead and gone somewhere in the
Remember what special ed said I got it made
Play games wit me boy you gon need first aid

A honey grant for a feature fresh lets get paid

Sippin' champagne with some ducks makin' big bucks

That's how it is when you release eight million sold
That's cool if I go gold

Got the Benz that new range bout to git that bump
Plus got some new shit that you ain't never seen

I know you've all had a lot on your mind, man.
Had a lot of struggles you went through in your life.
Keep your head up dirty.

I've been through the dirt, been slammed from right to left.
I've been hit, been low, been high, I guess
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)
I'm like a Cadillac door (say what)

See the star was born.
Don't think nobody notice.
Goin' through these trials and tribulations kept me on focus.
Tried to do a 9-5, but where's the money?
Coming to work damn near bumming, 
people thinkin' it's funny (ha ha).
I'm fed up.
Plus my homies sellin' crack doin' good.
Now I'm thinking fuck doing it legal bring it back to the hood.
Man it's hell, you see, wasn't no woman there for me.
I ain't got shit but a dream, that's why they chose to ignore me.

Hey
Now I'm on the block pumping rocks toting glocks.
Grand-mama on my head, I'm ducking and dodging the cops.
All cause I'm trying to make a living (living).
Consequences of that,
End up dead or in prison, ain't shit given.
I done struggled too long not to floss and get on.
I'ma get it with the double, if not the microphone.
I'm headstrong plus I'm out for those dead presidents.
And the government ain't doing shit for my residence.

It's been a long time coming (yeah we struggled)
It's been a bumpy ride (but we gonna make it)
So these wheels will keep on turning (say what)
Till the day I die (ride with me for a minute y'all).
It's been a long time coming (yeah we struggled)
It's been a bumpy ride (but we gonna make it)
So these wheels will keep on turning 
Till the day I die 

Now my homies busted and getting shot at it's getting serious.
Plus I'm praying but they breaking down in tears.
See now that I'm on, people think money make you proud.
But I've been struggling trying to come up since I was a child.
Who are you to judge me for my sins and what I did wrong.
I'm trying to live don't my mama singing a sad song.
They say look out for your family and so I try to sure.
Look Tommy I miss you but I'll see you when I get thurr.

[Chorus]

Hey, I'm dedicating this song to everybody that lost a loved one, 
To the people in 9-11, hurricane Katrina, 
All the folks that lost folks that they care about, 
And if you down yourself, you got somebody that's down,

Thick as a brick
Nice stomach with some wide hips
Approached her like what's good baby?
You seem hood baby
Maybe we could hook up oh yea we should baby
She asked my name
I laugh and flashed my chain
I can't stop staring
Damn she got ass and things
We can forget about the club and go to my crib
The finer things in life, that's how I live
I told her think about it, take a second, then tell me
She said ain't nothing to think about (ha ha)
Ya smell me
She got close and sniffed the fur-enheit
And almost overdosed
I stays fly ya know ya know

Know what I'm thinking about
Pop some Jodecy in
That'll get her wet, no doubt
Look like you been needing a friend
To please, ya heard me
With that gangsta love, girl come ride with a G
Rolled up some of that sticky
Since she like to smoke
Did a 100 to the pad, had to stash the toast
Pulled into the driveway
Hopped out and opened the door
Y'all might think that's weak
But all the real players know
Got inside, said she's cold
So I turned the heat on
Persian rug on the floor
To wipe ya feet on
And in 15 minutes, head boss gonna get beat on
She ain't got no man,
Ain't got no woman,
Who there to cheat on?

Hell yea, there go the soap, lotion and baby powder

Glad I ain't buying
This something you'd want to see
Instantly, I snuck in
Then she told me, get in
I grabbed to glasses and a bottle of that Seagrams Gin
So we got in the Jacuzzi
Cause its more relaxing
Call me Mr. Miyagi
Cause that ass I'm gonna be waxing
She got a little tipsy
Then started feeling on me

While I'm sittin' in an eight o drop, these suckaz tell me keep it gangsta
But they don't know, when they ain't lookin' I be doin' population control
Then I'm lookin' for a breezy with a whole lotta soul so I can have a malfunction in my wardrobe
To not the jada with the ??, its the Jada with the fo' fifth, clutchin' on the fifth

Baby, I'm a superstar, and that come wit' it
Gotta good nigga on the side, you better run wit' it
Even though I'm on the road doin' shows
I make time for me and her, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her
Might conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her

She talkin' 'bout this phone number she found
Hey, give me time to put my bags down
She's straight up, clowned
Before we end up fightin', let me leave
I'm exhausted and this her, I don't need
Now I'm wit' the fellas, ridin' and drinkin'
She's blowin' my two way up, but I need some time for thinkin'
(Yeah) I wanna go back, but something sayin' naw
Give her some space and the next day I might call
What should I do?
Look, let me ask y'all
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall?
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed
But it happens some time
It's either love it or give it up

Chingy,"Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,
There's some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl (look so fly like),
& you partied in some clubs
& some girls show you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Now I'd done been around the world thought I'd seen it all
Er color, er shape, what I need and all,
Switch like seasons, when the summers, spring, & fall,
& back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet & all.
On the hunt for these girls were like my day to day,
I get em alone I jump em and then fade away,
I give it good so some of them won't stay away,
They try to lock me up, but I break away.
& to the day I lay my eyes on the princess,
& yu can tell she was a dime from a distance,
It took a minute to come to my senses,
She's the perfect match and God is my witness,
Now for the first time I've opened my eyes,
Put the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky,
Feels like I'm in heaven, & I'm hopin' to fly,
Baby girl come along for the ride, yu know why cuz I....

Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),

& some girls show you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Now I ain't neva had a girl that was so fly,
Other guys come around, you actin' so shy,
You got em shakin' in their boots, and I know why,
Cuz they can't handle the truth and that's no lie,


As for me, I'm the one that you been dreamin' on,
& wen yu saw me I'm the one that yu were steamin' on,
& when yu need it I'm the shoulder that yu would be leanin' on,
Take off that Gucci and keep them vickie secrets on,
Let's take a flight because the world is our playground,
And buy houses from the lou, to the A-Town,
It's silk sheets so it's soft when yu lay down,
Ching-a-ling yea, I get down, and stay down,
There's no one better baby girl you'sz a blessin',
You got me headin' in a positive direction,
You got my vote, when yu re-up for election,
Cuz all I wanna do is give you love and affection.

Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,
There's some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl (look so fly like),
& you partied in some clubs

But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Why yu wastin' your time, & boy, runnin' the streets,
When you can just come to me? [huh]
You know I got what you need,
I got what you want,
Boy, won't you come and see?
What if you never, [seen] a girl like me ever, [like me before]?
Won't you come inside, let me keep it dry,
Cuz, I'm, so, flyyyyy.

Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,

Either they don't know, don't show, or don't care about whats going on in the hood


Uh Uh, yeah, uh yeah yeah 
This your boy chingaling man, 
Need to talk to the world real quick, 
Talk to em man, 
You know we got a lot of problems going on in the inner city, 
In the ghetto, in the hood, they ain't hearin' you, 
Ain't nobody touchin' on, 
Democrats, republicans, all those folks, 
You know they don't care 
Whats going on in the ghetto anyway


[Verse 1:]
Errday I wake up 
With a regular mentality, 
But I'm a target on the street and thats just reality, 
Cats in the ghetto ain't never had a high salary, 
Except makin' deals and selling blow in the alley, 
See the system was made for us to fail, look at the jails, 
Overpopulated with Mexicans and young black males, 
I ain't tellin' the tale, so we choose heaven or hell, 
Don't care about letters from school, 
We'd rather get street mail, 
I been a witness to some murders snitchin I do without it, 
But then I wonder why the damn police dont do nothing about it, 
Go to the unemployment office, hell yeah its crowded, 
Our hoods takin' wrong turns now its time to reroute it, 
I know a lil' dude 13, 
Carry a burner dropped out of school, 
Teacher said he wasn't a fast learner, 
Sometimes I wonder in 20 years I wonder where we gon' be, 
When I say we, I mean my black community, ya digg

[Chorus:]
They dont know, 
How it feels to hurt so long, 
Cause they never walked in these shoes, 
And they never had to cry these blues, 
How many men, turn their back on us so long, 
Always say what they gon do, 
But they never seem to come through

[Verse 2:]
Pardon my french but I dont think we ready for a lady president, 
Its evident that its a mans world so thats irrelevant, 
The system think we all niggas and we not intellegent, 
But martin luther and malcolm taught me before im heavensent, 
The girls havin kids and they still some kids, 
Poppin' them out one after another like thats what it is, 
Its innocent cats doin bizz, 
They just tryin to life, 
And the police dont even know if the crime they did, 
Its got my brain in a twist, so im twistin a leaf, 
On my balcony smokin and drinkin trying to see some relief, 
If I can change our neighborhoods I would, put that on me, 
This world messed up, and that Stevie Wonder can see, 
So to my dogs locked down set ya mind free, 
Cause you and I dont even believe you can get your degree, 
Sometimes I wonder in 20 years where we gon be, 
And when I say we I mean my black community, lets go

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I twist the cap off the bottle, 
Take a sip and see tomorrow, like pac, 
Wash away the sorrow while police hit the block, I be up all night, 
Askin' god for the truth, 
He told me thinking translated in my own words in the booth, 
Try to reach the youth, 
Cause thats what matters today, 
I'm ain't too religious but I get on my knees and pray, 
Sometimes I wonder in 20 years where we gon be, 
I ain't gotta wonder no more, 
My people rollin' with me, yeah

You a material girl, in a material world.
A celebrity chick, that wants diamonds and pearls.
Naw, I don't mind doing for you in public, you let me touch it and rub it,
But I don't love you (Aw no)
I let her drive the whip,
Stay over, call her girlfriends to my house and let ‘em lay. (Oh Yeah)
Take her where she want, when she want, but don't get it twisted, the girl no her do's and don'ts.
My mama likes her, pops dig her.
Damn near took eight months just to hit her (No nigga)
When we go out, we take pictures
She bad, lil' dirty, around my homies, I kiss her
And ya'll know that ain't me, fo' sho' that ain't me
Oh, it's ‘bout dough, and that's me (Money, Money)
My ride or die girl going hard, I spend it on her since the cash flow flowing hard.

Get it, heel game, that girl be killing me
I love her attitude, feisty and silly, B
Sex never bad, she the drug that be healing me
Sometimes though, the broad get the illest E
Notice that another chick, feeling me
Hey now, said she want a ‘lac truck
She don't like riding low, ‘cause she like to sit up
Put the 26's on it, what the fuck
Gave it to her, told her, tear the streets up
Pretty girl, but she keep the heat tucked
She tough, see bruh but she a freak, she enough, ya dig

Figures, girls look so good. But their brains are not ready, I don't know
I'd rather get with a baller chick, doing it real heavy, and getting dough
I'm a fly guy, baby, you got be up to part.
Hair, nails done, feet, looking like a star
Everywhere we go, they need to know who we are
And It's a must that we hop out the nicest cars

Chino & Nacho,"Si tú te vas 
Se muere el amor 
El que tú me das 
Y llega el dolor 
Seré un vagabundo 
Solo en este mundo sin rumbo 

Me delata la mirada 
Hacerme el tonto ¿para qué? 
Si a mí no me importa nada 
Prefiero vivir y perder 
Que no haber vivido nada 
Si te vas 
Quedare en un dolor 
Que jamás conocí 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(No sé cómo explicarte) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(En mi mundo y que cada segundo) 
Me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé (love you girl, girl, girl) 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(Cada segundo, cada minuto) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Y así me pasan las horas) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé 

(Señorita el doblete) 

Suave, suave 
Como usted sabe 
Sacúdelo, muévelo 
Que nunca se acabe 
Duro, la reina de la clave 
Te lo juro, que lo que siento en el pecho no me cabe 
Te imagino diciendo que me ilumino 
Si no te tuviera, te digo que me arruino 
Culpa del destino que te puso en mi camino 
Que nadie se meta con este amor clandestino 

Andas en mi cabeza 
Bella princesa 
Olvida los problemas y las tristezas 
Me ves y el corazón me lo atraviesas 
Belleza date un trago y ponte traviesa 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(No se cómo explicarte) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Porque tú eres mi mundo y que cada segundo) 
Me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé (love you girl, girl, girl) 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(Cada segundo, cada minuto) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Y así me pasan las horas) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé 

Imagínate que tú conoces lo que desconoces 
Yo me convierto en lobo después de las doce 
Si no tuviera a mi loba pa’ que la despose 
Me voy con la manada hasta que me destroce 
Porque en la calle hay mucha compe 
Siempre lo bueno se corrompe 

Pero no quiero otra mujer aprovechándose 
Cuando tú eres la que me encanta chica 
Nunca yo me atreveré a dejarte sola 
Chiqui, chiqui, chiqui, chica nunca sola 
Por ti yo guardé mi pistola 
Las gaticas no me controlan 
Capturando yo lo sé 
Pero me quiere a la vez 
Solo pide que te de 
My love que te, my love que te  

A través de mi carta quiero confesarte 
que han sido enteras las noches sin poder besarte 
notaras que lleva mi perfume y no encuentro estampa
que sigo olvidadizo y que caigo en mi propia trampa 

quizás te pasa igual y sientes que no es normal 
que no duermes en la noche y entiendes que no es real 
con la distancia llama los recuerdos de la cama 
tu eres reina de mi cabeza, yo el rey que tu amas (Don) 

Donde vas, regresa pronto, vuelve a mi
sin ti ya no puedo pensar ya no puedo dormir 
no me acostumbro a vivir lejos de ti 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(D, d, DY, Gaby Music) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Chino & nacho baby) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (jumbo)
Contigo me case (el que produce solo) 
Y por siempre te amé (love you girl, girl, girl) 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(Cada segundo, cada minuto) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Y así me pasan las horas) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé",Andas En Mi Cabeza [Remix]

Chino & Nacho,"Como hipnotizados por esta costumbre 
Hemos decidido vivir la rutina 
De seguir durmiendo 
En la misma cama 
Pero la verdad es que tenemos miedo 
Y sin darnos cuenta estamos compitiendo 
Para ver quien dice 
La ultima palabra 

Y no queremos ser sinceros,
Y aceptar que ya no queda nada 
Que ya no existe la ilusión de despertar 
Juntos cada mañana 
Y que los días se nos van 
En no mirarnos a la cara 
Para poder disimular 
Como si nada nos pasara 
Pero no es verdad!

Que se apago la llama!
El fuego que quemaba 
Ya se acabo la magia que nos envolvía 
Nuestro amor se termino 
Así como si nada 
Y tanto que te amaba 
Ya se apago la llama 
Ya no hay ni cenizas 
Nuestro fuego se extinguió 
Y todo se acabo!

Te quiero decir 
Que no quiero vivir 
De esta mentira 
Y que yo merezco 
Un amor de verdad

Baby deja a un lado la agonía
Y el incomodo silencio cada día 
Si esto no es culpa tuya 
Ni tampoco mía 
De que serviría intentarlo 
No funcionaria!!
Si aunque estemos juntos 
Tu y yo no nos hacemos compañía 
Dime desde cuando no nos damos navidad?
Enamorada, ilusionada, apasionada 
Si hasta por la noche 
Cada quien duerme en su lado de la cama

Pensando que eres transparente y sincera,
Y sin saber si a su novio guayarte quisieras.

Es ternura y pasión
Tú me has hecho sentir
Que hay en mi corazón
Tanto amor
Tanto amor

Yo nací para ti
Y tú también para mí
Y ahora sé que morir es tratar de vivir
Sin tu amor
Sin tu amor

Mi niña bonita mi dulce princesa
Me siento en las nubes cuando tú me besas
Y siento que vuelo más alto que el cielo
Si tengo de cerca el olor de tú pelo

Mi niña bonita brillante lucero
Te queda pequeña la frase te quiero
Por eso mis labios te dicen te amo
Cuando estamos juntos más nos enamoramos

Aquí hay amor
Aquí hay amor
Aquí hay amor amor
Aquí hay amor amor
Aquí hay hay hay hay hay hay amor

Este amor que como espuma sube
Que cuando te tomo de la mano por el parque
Camino en las nubes
Parece mentira que ya no recuerdo nada
Cuando solo estuve
Nada se podrá comparar
Con algo tan especial

Nada se compara con lo nuestro mi vida

Le agradezco al tiempo
Que me ha demostrado que las cosas buenas llegan
En cualquier momento
Yo no imaginaba que conocería
Algún día este sentimiento
Un amor puro y natural
Digno de admirar
(digno de admirar princesa)

Un amor de fantasía, lleno de romance y alegría
De bello detalle cada día
Nena quién lo diría
Que algún día yo me enamoraría
Y que sin tu amor no viviría
Como sabia que esto pasaría
Que ibas a ser mía
Y que yo querría
Amarte por siempre mi niña bonita

Mi niña bonita mi dulce princesa
Me siento en las nubes cuando tú me besas
Y siento que vuelo más alto que el cielo
Si tengo de cerca el olor de tú pelo

Te queda pequeña la frase te quiero
Por eso mis labios te dicen te amo
Cuando estamos juntos más nos enamoramos

Para que bebas tiernamente a estar conmigo
Debes saber que lo único que importa
Es el amor que en el detalle va escondido
Pudiera darte mas que eso vida mía

Y regalarte un mundo lleno de ilusiones
Lleno de magia, canciones y melodías
Todo eso y mucho mas yo te daría
Si solamente tu me dieras la oportunidad

Si solamente tu me dieras la oportunidad
De demostrarte todo lo que yo te puedo dar
Navegarías por los mares de mi corazon
En un crucero conociendo el verdadero amor
Si solamente tu me dieras la oportunidad
De escabullirme por tu vida y poder entrar
Hasta atrapar la mayoría de tus sentimientos 
Con esta trampa de pasiones que ahora llevo dentro
Solamente estoy pidiendo una oportunidad

Que otro motivo necesitas, para darte cuenta
Que te amo demasiado entonces! porque no lo intentas?
No pienses tanto que la mente no tiene razón
Cuando el problema tiene que ver con el corazon
Solo imagino mi futuro estando a tu lado
Pues locamente de ti estoy enamorado
Te juro que lo que yo siento es una realidad
Que para amarte se hace corta hasta una eternidad

Ven dime si es que a caso estas con otra persona
Pa ver si este tonto por fin te olvida y reacciona
Ven dime por que ahorita la mente no me funciona

Miro al cielo esperando un cometa
Para pedirle un deseo y es que te traiga hasta aquí

Por ti me he vuelto un poeta
Ya yo tengo mil hojas repletas
Un armario de páginas completas
Que escribo cuando te veo y eso me hace feliz, muy feliz
Feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz
Muy feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz, feliz

Me hace feliz tenerte
Y es que me imagino al lado tuyo hasta la muerte
Siempre que me asomo a mi venta es para verte
Quiero que la siguiente mañana traiga suerte
Para convertirme en el dueño de tu corazón
Parar ser realidad lo que paso como ilusión
Una sensación, la falta de  razón
La combinación de amor con atracción
Tu me gustas, como negarlo
No me asusta, solo hay que demostrarlo
Estoy buscando una oportunidad para expresarlo

Vuelve,y se quiere marchar de nuevo aun

Sigo en busca de unos besos

Donde están los labios
Que tienen la cura??

Porque bien se oculta

Sera que yo tengo la culpa?

Nunca se si durara
Yo se lo dejo al destino

Confieso que me da miedo
Aun no entiendo lo que debo hacer

Pero así debo vivir tal vez
Y un nuevo amor morir después

Revivan este corazón que ya esta muerto

con los ojos para verte

conocí un angelito por ahí
Que me lanzo una
flecha pa' que me enamorara de ti

bajado del cielo contigo

Yo quiero un beso, que se convierta en historia
Que no se me borre de la memoria
Un beso con ternura y pasión
La muestra de una gran atracción
Un Momento mágico,
Que me ponga frenético
Reacción que traen los nervios, cada segundo previo
Quiero revelar el misterio, que tienen esos labios magnéticos
Es como una adicción que siento yo
Y tú me puedes dar el remedio.
Sutil carnal, instinto animal
Mi chica especial.

De tanto ejercicio me dará un desmayo
Todo lo que digo llévalo al ensayo.

Quiere que me vaya o quieres que me quede
Lo que estas logrando es que me desespere
Tu sabes que yo sé lo que quieres

Devuélveme el color azul del cielo que te di

From the game she was spittin' my ear you'd think that she knew me. 
So we decided to chill 

Conversation got heavy, 
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
(watch out oh, watch out) 
She saying come get me, come get me, 
So I got up and followed her to the floor, 
She said baby lets go, 
When I told her I said 

Yeah (yeah) shawty got down said come and get me 
Yeah (yeah) I got so caught up I forgot she told me yeah yeah
Yeah (yeah) Her and my girl were the best of homies 
Yeah (yeah) next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming

Shes all up in my head now, 
Got me thinking that it might good idea to take her with me, 
Cause she's ready to leave. 
Now I gotta keep it real now, 
Cause on a one-to-ten she's a certified twenty, 
And that just ain't me. 

Cause I do know if I take that chance just where is it gonna lead, 
But what I do know is the way she dance makes shawty alright with me. 
The way she getting low! 
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me. 
She asked for one more dance and I'm 
Like yeah, how the hell am I supposed to leave? 
And I said

I won't stop till I get em in they birthday suits.

When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand,

Now who want to diss to get they reps a little _bigger_
How many bitches want to fuck this _yellow nigga_
You get your whole crew cut like a scissor
Watch this world shake from the album I deliver

[Verse One]
I threw a Brownstone at Brandy now she's Changing Faces
Standing in my Aaron Hall I'm Blackstreet packin suitcases
Goin back to Indiana, on the Subway
Soul For Real, missjones is my usher in church on Sundays
Clear the runways, cause I'ma make you rappers my examples
Avoiding battling me like I'm Eazy-E's blood samples
It's me and Carey, nah never wrote no rhyme that's ordinary
Won't throw my life away on coke like Darryl Strawberry
Removing you skeletal system playing your ribs like xylophones
I'm nastier, leave you scraped and ashier than Larry Holmes
But ladies I ain't always violent
You could pump pump until the dawn, like Adina Howard
Can't You See, I'm Notorious as Total get
Uptown Girls in bed, like Billy Joel do
Laverne and Shirle, give us any room we'll break it
Remember you was wack remember Ice Cube had a jheri curl
BAMMMMM!!!! Dead on your car horn chump
My beat get messy as abortion on the ninth month
Now who be that, slap, did iiii do that?
Now Whoopi Goldberg goes Steve Urkel
but I'll leave your grill The Color Purple
Give you a Dogg Pound, could even Dru Down
Provoke me album is weak your whole shit sound like karaoke
Conversation, loss of limbs amputation
Head meaning decapitation rough like Craig Mack derm abrasion
Evil tendency, strong like Miles Davis heroin dependency
Fuckin up lives like teenage pregnancy

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Them clowns like Will Smith got fast cars and fancy homes
But I'm headstrong, I could even break Puffy Combs
Some kids still doubtin and they girlfriend stalkin keep it real
We'll cross that bridge when we come to that Anita Hill
Now Ever_last_, will never _last_, with no ghetto _pass_
Leave you breathin hard like bitches at lamaze _class_
Niggaz are slippin when they sippin gin and tonic
smokin chronic Jersey niggaz packin more handguns than Harry Connick
My style is welfare, half of you bitches is on it!!
Was born with a halo, when broke, I had to pawn it
I stir up controversy and sell I'm like Sister Souljah
So bring out bum-ass Russell Simmons 'cause comedy's over
The Lucci I'm worth is enough to deficit a nation
With media coverage like a hostage situation
(yeah and if you lovin them hoes you betta bounce back)
Tryin to make that bitch your wife she fucked
the whole New Jersey Drive (soundtrack)
High like Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jams on tour
Rrrraahahrra rrrarhraarah I rips it like a chainsaw
Dig deep as truth go ahead and shoot your Karl Kani suit
in shock absorbing tired and I'm wide like a police informant
Pray with one eye open, shootin more Led than Zeppelin
Dysfunctional like the Jackson's, death is my obsession
You comin through with thirty cowards think you causin fear
Rush lookin bust in your boosted Donna Karan gear
Now fuck the po-po, beats down the five-oh
Been there, done that, do it again tomorrow nigga
Sometimes I vibe inside a spot where nobody else knows me
Until I come hot steppin like Ini Kamoze

You know, taking these metaphors and just butchering
icons in the urban community.  I don't know, it's
like you sucking em dry, what are you some kind of a vampire
or something?  Yeah yeah that's what you are, what ahh what
a ghetto vampire, that's it.
So where'd all this come from?  Think back
Try to remember think back try to remember

I used to sit at the right hand of God in light and splendor
Lavishly spreading love that's all I remember
As time passes I catches miracles he taught me
Everything except for some old man and breathe the breath of life
I tried, to just accept he's my savior
But jealousy forced me into sacrilegious behavior
Enraged like I was no threat I hated God's laughter
Waiting for the day the apprentice becomes the master
I'm cursed and damned now to be a creature of the night
Unliving yet living off blood, fearer of the light
But I don't give a fuck right, because I live forever
I see you all come and go and die and burn
And watch the world still turn
Evil entity, time is resenting me
Thousands of years later I must conceal my identity
A vampire 

Arrraahhaaa-hahahahahaha!!!

New heights, where it's so dark you need candlelights
To expose the black plague my left hand writes
Nights enveloping and developing pictures in your brain
Like a darkroom, in every monastery where I spark boom
A cartoon style smile smirk, how's my emotionless killer clown
Synapse behaps relax the bastard black balloon
Nocturnal, high off the herbal, crowding back streets and projects
Illest nigga, coolest slang dialects (dialects)
Bite marks are what you feel if you're my victim
Poisons golden seal couldn't heal from your system (from your system)
Nuts bust down the throats of mad crack heads
Fetal four-eye pleas, fuck it cops kill black kids
Sometimes I wish I could stop the death the pain and the sin
But I'm fucked up create the libations that humans contain within (nasty)
After lightning strikes the steeple of your family church
I beg forgiveness from God, but it never works
I know my soul ain't going to heaven when I expire
Recognize the immortal ghetto vampire
I slit your throat and watch you shake if I desire
Recognize the immortal ghetto vampire
Bear witness to the sins of wicked messiah
Recognize the immortal ghetto vampire
Who can I speak to God is dead and the whole earth's on fire
Recognize the immortal ghetto vampire

Running from the sun by day it's become quite obvious
To the people surrounding me I'm the wildest
Untamable blood-luster plus the high school yearbook photos
That I took in eighty-nine, show no sign of a face of mine
Intertwined my mind is a jungle full of cobwebs and tangled vines
And a glass mace even my closest friends are becoming afraid
Of how I, predicting what's happening and events
Prom dates found they're punctured, blood left pleading then lynched
That's just how I fucking express myself
When I consume your blood and leave you dead
Sorry it's just to keep my health
Dark forces, police get nauseous from my trail of corpses
No stake through my heart, no holy water, and no priest with crosses
A woman's mind gets clouded by my handsome mannerisms
Listen obsessions bigger than Jackie Gleason's aneurysms
You caught up when my piercing eyes stare right through you
Stronger than the straightest greatest ancient Haitian voodoo
My unholy presence disturbs animals and children
Built a sacrificial altar behind an abandoned building
My sense of smell is heightened my sight is razor sharp

And then the blood starts, flowing
Now I got your soul without you even knowing
Lying in a staircase covered in piss, body decomposing
I turn on sirens and I perpetuate gang violence
I'm the devil that got Malcolm X sleeping in silence
Factual I poison anything that's natural
I kill love and I'm hope frozen up just like it's a statue
Vampires walk among us sucking life from our city
Keeping us in constant states of insecurity
The police watch em they know me ghetto vampire
The government check em they know me ghetto vampire
Churches and ministries they know me ghetto vampire

Chino XL,"Intro:
Yeah, crazy ups and downs you know what I'm sayin'? Crazy how the world
runs, word up. Check it out. Bring it on.

Hook:
Lord I try to keep positive, but this life is full of strife
And I'm tired of trying to conquer it
Lord always thinking negative what will go wrong will go wrong
Until the beast in me vanishes

Verse 1:
First of all I was born under a bad sign, confinded to torcher
Never saw what life had to offer
Time slips away like pop singles on the radio
Chino never had the doe, I was determined though
Sabotaged at birth, cursed by an evil angel to strangle
My aspirations from every angle
From a street corner to a demo deal from Warner
Hardcore performer, crowd warmer, thought it was on but it wasn't
I never got no budget, stuck like a glue trap
It goes to prove that
Being the greatest lyricist can't paint the full picture
It's a full mixture, I can't get no, no satisfaction
Like being blind watching a movie with no closed caption
I need some time to ease my mind, I'm bested
Fuck Mr. Wendal my Development is Arrested
All I wanted to do was rock with my fast ass
And blast past the mass, collect quick cash
Did what I did best create, but began to hate
All these flake music people makin' artists wait
But I'm a be up there one day
And soon to slam wax innovate rhymes that my fans consume
I view this world through my notepad
Thus expanding my vocab to win, till then, it's all bad

Hook (x2)

Verse 2:
When I was merely a sophomore, went to Atlanta on a false tour
This ain't what I prayed so hard for
Dreams broken into individual particles like porcelain 
Figurings attached to me like barnacles
Now I'm suppose to be happy like Bobby McFerrin
Keep faith, the only thing holy is the drawers I'm wearin'
89' I aimed to graduate, no exaggerate
Evaporating positive energy from inside of me
To the point where my love for God no more provides for me
Of course lost pride, obviously the force rides 
To paradise nobody invites but puts the Bill Of Rights
1430 SAT proving ya, I'm a spick that'll die respective like Rahoul Julia
So cease with, all that street shit 
Expect MC from Chi kid, you gets the wicked priest shit
Until I see fit, to open my life strife like the pearly gates of heaven
For ? entertainment this is my expression
Prepare wealth and I'll share self, maybe I can help
But I'm lost but I be large anywhere else
The ill eagle, twisted, war novelist
The problem swallowed us, it takes an activated mind to follow this
And true to realm to be ourselves, not to follow a fad or give in to trends
Till then, it's all bad

Hook (x2)

Verse 3:
Unanswereed prayers plays the background, I pull my baseball caps down
I hide the tracks of my tears from rapping peers
I finally got on and soon he wasn't a moment to
I lose my mind, I lose my friends, my daughter and a coma too
I'm going through a strange tug of war inside my mental wall
Record just went platinum, I'm slapping 'em, I'll show you all
Cover of Rolling Stones, Vibe even TV Guide
Was filming my first movie in L.A. when I heard my baby died
Shook it off without a thought that she was beautiful
Soul Train Awards I go to not my daughters funeral
I stay drunk and high like I'm imperial
Surrounded by more white groupies than a Rakim video
Now life's a tour to me, except the way I was rejected formally
Disrespected neighborhoods I know supported me
It's eating me, suicide attemps repeatedly
What I worked so hard for, ultimately is defeating me
I'm paranoid my own mom can't avoid being a tabloid
So she wasn't shocked when my baby flopped 
Caught in the industry, spending money feverishly
Now I'mve been robbed, I can't believe my laywers did this to me
Next album was filled up with tragedy and despair
Fans with smiling faces with no real purpose for being here
I call the dear Lord when in Billboard
I plummet from 3 to 10 I guess failure is my new trend
Thought I was all that, now I just fall flat, splat
Vails of crack, my old friends won't let me call back
So where in mind can I find myself a misty storm invisible to God
I'm falling off like TJ Swan

Hook (x2)",It's All Bad

But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser

What the hell made you think the sun rose and set in your ass?
Fast I remove you from my itinerary
I tense you worry and exaggerate
becoming jealous at the drop of a dime, wanting to kill all womankind
You are a perfect ten with the perfect tan goddess
Who could sell Evian to a drowning man, honest
Trying to stay sane walking that tight rope
I'm throwing you off the deep end you better pray shit floats
You gave me chills to your mind when Beverly Hills
make cleverly deals, and now you think you Brooke Shields
Hated my foes, now you one of they one a day hoes
Used to search my ass straight for weed I smoked some days before
I'm crazy yo forever goin farther than just screwin em
Making me feel like Joseph and Mary's hoein in Jerusalem
Abusin em is how they want to be treated they nosy too
Should I just slap em like Scherazade told me to
You just a tease and you play like I'm not in your league
Capturing my mind claiming I'm your biggest fantasy
I'm unattachin, what think you can spies me
If I couldn't hear your words and only judge you by your actions
Your love is sorcery, drowning in emotion poisoning me
unfortunately your memory is haunting me
I'm feeling pains, that I can't even describe
But if I have to bitch you fuckin buried me alive
Your love counterattacks, unrealistic terroristic acts
Like the Oklahoma Federal Building I collapse
I want her back, but I know that I can't force her
Thinkin bout takin my own life like Marlon Brando's daughter

I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
I wish I was special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep

I'm back in town, stoppin it, makin prerogative home
She too far gone, provactive as Sharon Stone
I'm feeling crucified by the very nails I
Made and drove into myself, passed to the next guy
Phones ringin in the middle of the night (Who's that?  Nobody?)
Your whole game is getting mad sloppy
Meanwhile in my hotel lobby my hobby is removing groupies off my body
It's getting cloudy, smoggy, visibility low, foggy
Four and a half years, I screwed up once
But this ain't your first time, don't be a dummy
You got champagne tastes with fuckin beer money
Fearing bummy we had ups and downs but managed
Now the going gets rough, look how you vanished
It proves that life is a comedian like Martin Short
You standin next to me I want to file a missing child report
To find the girl we'd always planned we'd run away together
Pray together had a child swore we'd stay together
You had your chance shoulda been nice
your game is deader than Vincent Price
Giving up your ass like you Heidi Floess
Fuck your pink cop crossing guard obsession
You're half-dresses looking like a Soul Train scrambable contestant (bitch)
In my arena, should I fight or just leave her
Catch amenesia it's enough to make me catch a seizure
Catch a breather, Chino do you even need her
Should I take the three-eighty assassinate her like Selena?

I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep

Yesterday I seen someone who looked just like you
She walked like you do, so I thought it was you
But then she turned around confusing me
Babyface couldn't bring no cool in me
No Love Connection channel five no Chuck Woolery
Us growing old together is what I envision
You dealing with him, but let's not make no haste decision
The mechanism is getting rusty, you won't trust me
You claim when I blow up I'll leave you for some mono toiling busty
I can't believe you placed this cock above me wrong
I know you like a book but I just cannot find what page you're on
Now you put you in the middle, your voice is just a riddle
Say you want me back then change your personality like Cybill
How hard I try, I just cry more
With no reason to live, many to die for
Now as I sit in a smoky bar the night about to end
I'm passing time with strangers but this bottle is my only friend
Across the room I see a couple with no cares at all
Hugged up kissing reminding me of us before our fall
High so full of hope and passion looking at her man
The way you used to look at me when I just held your hand
You gave me vast pain, to live in the fast lane
I caught the last plane, to give you my last name
I'm caught up, my family come first, that's how I'm brought up
This tragedy's worse, than one I coulda thought up
The couple stood up, I'm feeling drugged like I took Mescaline
The couple I've been watching all the time it was her and him...

I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
I wish I was special, you're so very special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep...

Chino XL,"I take your mind and I smash it into plasma
Breathe like asthma, til your just a cadaver
How fast this is, your faggot crew's a bunch of actresses
My skills go back to flippin on pissy matresses
Not Subroc, I catch you out like Matlock
Now your name's in the Way Outdated Section next to Chubb Rock
It's kind of funny, some of you cracker DJ's shun me
cause I make your favorite rappers come up short like Bud Bundy
I'm All in the Family, sick like Archie Bunker, fuckin eat it
Your styles are cheesy like a uncircumcised penis
Better jet out, brother out, your R&B I first ignore ya
Fuck Heavy D, cause ""I Got Nothin But HATE For Ya""!!
I'm Chino XL, now who the fuck are you?  I'm laughing
smashing you like a bottle of Zima
Oh now all of a sudden you got emphesema?
BURRNT, save that shit for rich verbatim days behind me
I'm yellow as hell, but I rip more BlackSTREET's than Teddy Riley
I'm not environmentally conscious so fuck an Earth Day on my worst day
I could kill more slanted eyes than a Japanese earthquake
and in the first place, Farrah couldn't Fawcett when I lost it
Give me that mic, you monkey motherfucker, you look exhausted!
When I'm tipsy, cut you like Bush cut Social Security
You couldn't make this crowd bounce like they one big silicone tittie
It ricochets, hear my name in projects hallways
Chino will amaze in so many different ways, what?

Fuck that when I bust that, watch this
I'm knockin niggaz out like they homosexual boxers
Now you feel like a building when the wrecking ball hits
I'M the type of nigga bitches like Brandy want to Be Down with
Not Howard Stern but get your temper burning, make you vomit
blood in slow motion like Tyra Banks go in Higher Learning
Enema, comma, coma, drama, dilemma, die like Dahmer
You can't see me like the Muppet Babies grand - mama
I'm a barbed wire condom once fuckin with that you'll - holler
My flows wet shit up like Barry White's shirt - collar
And I'm smoke Bones with mad Thugs we be in Harmony
But da-na-da-da-dahh-dah, just doesn't fuckin appeal to me
Disgustin me like Greg Lougainis AIDS my style is full blown
I'm wild like a latch key kid when his alcoholic daddy ain't home
Skip the silly facts is what you really lacks, your city give me daps
When Chino XL cuts you bleedin to death like hemophiliacs
Testin me is heresy I'm ill as leprosy I could make
Farrakhan grow dreads (BO BO!) and do the pepper seed
Spilling blood, similar to Exxon Valdez strike like a boa constrictor
Pain I inflict ya made ya scream like Little Richard
Battle me, no more props, no more fan mail admiration
You DIE, no time readin that for dramatization
You got your contract now you dissin me -- when you
barely own yourself like the Adams Family electricity
Bow your head in praise, the crowd sways when I hit the stage
Chino flips a phrase in so many different ways, uhh

Projecting my East coast semen all over ya (they be cloning ya)
I'm leaving em starving like they from Cambodia (nice knowing ya)
I'm telling ya fuck your cellular fuck your SkyPager
None of that can save ya when I SLASH ya with my rusty razor
In need of dry towels, my eye scowls, White Owls I split ya
Reposing like an Arthur Ashe before and after picture
My crew stay high like astronauts, this yellow bastard rocks
Still representin Jersey to the fullest -- Down at Fraggle Rock!
So now I rips again; leavin rappers whimperin
Makin my impression left in ears like discarded syringe
Cinematogrophy showin slides of your autopsy, no fair
I'm turning your whole projects into Tiannamen Square
Not number five like caps bust inside of Tupac's side
Rap side, not Pharcyde, burn your eyes like hydrogen peroxide
You better dodge this God that's lookin like DeBarge
Disgusting like an old white woman's medicinal discharge, swingin
my fist hard, causin viral spinal menengitis, when the slightest
vinyl coincides you risk dying to my violent twist
The Tin Ma -- if I only had a heart!  I wouldn't make
all y'all niggaz sit in the backseat like fuckin Rosa Parks
I represent them niggaz that make you one healthier
while you represent bad niggaz like Denzel in Philadelphia
I ruin more brothers with skills careers than Don King, yo
yo be	 stop the track here the phone is ringing I hear the phone ringing

Yo?			
""Yo Chino you look so good!
I just know you gotta a big dick
I want to fuck you so bad!""

Oh seven no one seventy the zip code I don't give a fuck
Throw an uppercut, was getting XL all fired up
worth getting your jaw all wired up?
Be a man like Me'shell N'degeocello, receive your ass-beating
I perform in front of more sellout crowds than a NAACP meeting
I'm making MC's look Dumber and Dumber like Jim Carrey
Go dig for David Cole I'm back in office like Marion Barry
My crew parleys while your girl braiding my braids
MC's are afraid in so Many Different Ways!

""Chino was fly but too fly for me!"" 
""Chino was fly but too fly for me!"" 
""Chino was fly but too fly for me!"" 
""Chino was fly but too fly for me!""",Many Different Ways
Chino XL,"Yeah, sometimes they come back

High pitched shrieks, my body lie dead in the streets
Yeahhh, my body lie dead in the streets
(repeat 4X)

The darkened clouds reflect my inner confusion
Frustrating feelings of dying too soon and I'm
sitting in plain view of Master and all of his glory
in purgatory, I'm not your everyday sinner
It's often viewed as stepping into a great light
with shadows of time, some people are forgotten in life
Move in past situations, stolen moments frozen proving
you ain't had a thing but evil in your human heart
It's startling, but I keep on following
The pain is mind-boggling, I hear angry souls hollering
High pitched shrieks, my body lie dead in the streets
Crackheads searching through my pockets too I see this all from side view
Now as I stand in the judgment of my forefathers
They agree I was murdered without my goal accomplished
Inside my heart is where the curse lay scared in the worst way
like a savior on the third day, I rise

Chorus:

""feel my aura, just around death's corner""
	(Rise!) Rise!
(repeat 4X)

The actual transition between death and life
reveals darks passageways, painted like stained glass
Soaking wet from the rain and my brain tired
and I'm barefooted freezing cold as I walk through fires
A child born with no soul signifies my return
from pure thought to put my killer's ashes in a urn
Outside the realm of light, demons dance in preparation
Weightless, only to be seen during incantation
Feel my aura, just around death's corner
Hands of liquid candlelit by a mourner (water)
Surrounding me it startles me, cry to me
Visions pushing me towards revenge and anger nothing's stopping me
What about this Crow it follows wherever I go
From a rooftop I see one of my killers in the window
Tears dwell up in my eyes, turn to highs, blood's
raining from the skies, as one of my murderers dies... rise

Chorus:

""The flesh is weak...""
	(Rise!) Rise!
(repeat 4X)

I believe... I believe
Yeah...

Yeah, I inhale the cold mist feeling lost
Like I'm in a dark forest that's illuminated by my soul
Like a Phoenix from the Earth watch me take flight
The world's in color when I walk it's all in black and white
I try to scream but no sound escapes, migraines
I shapeshift, I exist, she doesn't remain
Her name's etched in the walls of my nightmares
And levitates and elevates like flights of stairs
Second thoughts about karma but I can't cease
Without revenge, I think I'll never rest in peace
Blemishing, shaken like I'm off of heroin
I'm burrowing deep to reverse death, remembering
Now I rise like a zombie from the dirt I kill again
Feeling no better than what I am here to avenge
As we stand face to face you see death in my eyes
I won't destroy another man, the flesh is weak... rise

Chorus: (variations)

Sometimes death ain't even strong enough to stop living spirit
With our mind we call life into existence
Worlds are thoughts that are burning in me
Sometimes we come back

Chorus: (variations and outro)",Rise

[Kool Keith]
Yes! As we interrupt
For sisters out there ovulating
Brothers out there... doing private things
Let's get busy!
[Chino XL]
I be the receiver, of strange mind patterns
No type of compassion, endless my though process
hits like a dark cavern, I was bred of toxic parents
embryonic stages underdeveloped fetal pages that I burnt like phasers
Releasing human excrements on you like Tawana Brawley
Thinking to myself like Pee Wee Herman caught jerking off
I wish nobody saw me, wishing I could hide vibe cool Keith we spark
this
We step on stage MC's disappear like the rain forest
So when I rocks again get oxygen get cameras on
No telling diverse curse selling I'm reversed like Hammer son
Mental capacity, hindered like I'm Forrest Gump
Bu-dump, for your trunk
Get you hooked like crack hooked Humpty Hump
I catch the *real* with more sick humor than Benny *Hill*
I slap you up and make you *feel* what DeVon *feel*
You cry like Dice Clay, like Kunta Kinte I gets loose
You blowin up's a fucking dream like the gang truce

Super flexin, yo Chino XL, let's inhale
Funky sex man naked, foresmith is bound to shoot the gift
Riff riff raff, rappers make me giggle giggle laugh
From the East coast to Texas, I kick a rhyme like Pele
Strolling knee deep, you take a peep, while my beeper beep
Catchin wreck one two one two achoo achoo achoo
Sneezing and pleasing, on your ear, verbal easing
Chocolate flows then drips down through your nose
Between your legs, I bend your head with beer kegs
True, I'm blue, the smith can't stick to doo-doo
Yo Chino we needle we brown with the King Crown
Rockin underground bound, and pullin girls panties down
Yo check it, yo step with, you puppet muppet nitwit
Energizing like forty volts, I'm shocking to your anal
With my goggles paisano, Spiderman against the Rhino
Leaping on your building, downtown Los Angeles
Skandalous man, shooting sperm in your perm
Leaving ways to dry, my urine dropping in your eye
Burning afro puffs, with that greasy sticky stuff
I get rough, and plant my seed into your rectum
Masterbating at warp speed, I pull up in your spectrum

Making Lurch reactivate Morticia's only child was style

Sleeping on me like a narcolypetic as I grow
But you'll be here today and gone tomorrow like The Afros
Like a child alone with Luther, your ass in danger
MC's collect my styles like small kids do Power Rangers
[Kool Keith]
You holding back on the feeble, small weasel
No handicap love, elephants on the fence
Ever since dinosaurs, people stood on Crenshaw
And palace fade shopping lades, you never saw before
Bouncing down with more bounce, with music by the ounce
With my finger between the mean California labia
Dark girl maybe-ia, I think her name is Evia
Avon computer flex, killin mice and insects

hot thermometers into your anal channel

Chino XL,"Yo I don't even know what the vibe is kid
All these different things seperatin us
It got me walkin this fence man
and I don't even know what side I'ma fall on be	
Can't see it

Well I'm a zebra y'all
(""Half Puerto Rican, half black, but you don't speak Spanish"")
Don't call me zebra y'all
(""Half Puerto Rican, half black..."")

	Now how old are you?

About six, on my BMX, doin tricks
Back to Middlesex with a couple of poor white trashy brats
Everything was coochie crunch till it was time for lunch
They said to wait in the back, they said that Pops ain't like black
See where I was the population's mostly white
	Ain't it?
They want to see you jiggaboo with your
	face painted
Be brought home by one of their daughters and their fathers
	fainted
They want to see you a failure so I never
	became it
Light-skinned, showed them lead, curly-headed
Called me names, I was different, I was gifted, they made me ashamed
Found out that I'm a different shade when I'm in the second grade
Abe Lincoln's play, they want me to portray a slave
My momma's face went pale she looked like she wanted to puke
Now that I know the truth I'd rather play John Wilkes Booth
Although my family came and bitched and in the play my role was switched
My grandma told me I was fixed my problems wasn't fixed
My family seen my views of the world distort
Moms last resort, she decided we would move to Newark
I took a deep breath leaving everything I knew behind
The country air the green grass and my piece of mind
Harassed by white cops on our way we're pulled out our car
Mistook my mom for Joanne Chessimar (?) now I'm really scarred

	>

What am I, I'm confused, can't ",What Am I?
Chino XL,"(Yeah yo, follow this, follow this, yeah)
She just appeared out of nowhere
At this club it's kind of freaky so I usually don't go there
She will dance with no care
And I was kinda sleepy so to revive I step into the cold air
Who came behind me it was her, wind blowing in hair
She said ""Let's take a ride we could slide to anywhere""
I said ""Look but don't stare""
She said ""It's hard not to a nigga like you in here? It's kinda rare""
Seven-forty I-L, I look cushion in chair
Kinda feeling alright, I was supt in her ear
What do you want from me? I don't have much to share
She said ""Her husband was rich but he was never there
And know she want a affair and this is where I come in
Said she was prepared to help me with my career
So she said I heard I could rhyme and she had lot's of friends
Before we began I told her one thing

[Chorus]
I didn't have to be here
You didn't have to look for me
When I was just a nothing-child, and I know our times are wild
But before this ride is through, and you know I love fucking you
But I didn't ask to be here
You wanted me to be here
I really shouldn't be here
I didn't have to be here

Yo, we started to get really close
She started spoiling me right away ?doing? credit card's and clothes
She bought a weed from East Coast
I had been in LA for three month's now, but I'm from East Coast
She kept me in a Navigator Rental
Introduced me to her famous producer and payed for my demo
Set it album we was done
Champagne hosts for my future my life had finally begun
Tossed and turned all night, said she just couldn't rest she was feeling
Distressed about a hubby distressed
Too many sleeping pills I think she tried to overdose (Uh-huh)
Her man and me sometimes I wonder who she love the most? (Uh-huh)
Crazy of life of mine yo it's hard to believe
People feeling my tape, ended up getting signed!
Money for the first time for my rhyme
She started acting up like she didn't want me to shine

[Chorus]

And now, I'm unavailable too take your phone call, you know what to do

(Yo, why I'm bugging you? You know what I'm saying?)

Yo, yo, everything started happening kinda fast
I was well know getting cash over last
I can't remember when I spoke to my baby last
Younger man with a older woman were part of my past
Everyday different show's and sometimes different hoe's (Uh-huh)
When I am on video's I wonder if she knows?
How I miss her in my life and how we used to hang
'Cause just then the phone rang
I picked up she said ""What up?""
I'm like ""I miss you honey""
She said ""You wouldn't have been nothing if it wasn't for me""
That kinda hurt me  that she was so admitted wasn't being there
I thought we both got something outta this?
You made this happen for me and everybody know that
But you refuse to stay in-touch, you choose that!
They want to be happy and you see sad through it (nah) and I ain't know your
Love had a price-tag to it
Besides, you were married women I was just on the side (uh-huh) and now I'm
Pushing a six and getting hard to hide (uh-huh)
About her husband she shot him to death
They find him dead next to him was a note that said:

[Chorus: x2]",Be Here

Caught a taxi to my crib, roughft up my six
Full throttle to you crib, crying and shit
Should of listen, cause we was like, night and day
Should of seen it, you break my heart, anyway
But I lost my mind you hit my spot when you made love to me
Was you loving me or fucking me when you was inside me?

?????????
Insecure, get it from a girl that's yours when the streets beat you up and
You can't take no more
And that life style you living, lead's you to back to my door

And you didn't even love me, you just like fucking my rib's
Take the key's off the dresser let you stuck at the crib

Now your ass fill you's with my ???? on your ????

(Uh) We split up and the judge let you keep the house

Sorry

My Jersey blocks is locked tighter than prisoners hold soap
And listeners where we vote out ya CD and vinyl, the final result
Yell, fuck tricks and smoke, till our vocals combine with a Colt
They playin' this in every club, whip, party and bar you in
Give you more blood clots than two Jamaicans arguin'
Sweat till ya fake silver platinum chains is tarnishin'
Women shakin' they ovaries, look what we accomplishin', what...

[Chorus: ]
We got better lyrics than you got ""What You Got?""
We got better bitches than you got ""What You Got?""
We run with more killas than you got ""What You Got?""
We got better whips than you got ""What You Got?""
We got better cribs than you got ""What You Got?""
We got better bitches than you got ""What You Got?""
We run with more killas than you got ""What You Got?""
We got better lyrics than you got ""What You Got?""

Coming to kill me, I can't hear that
Fear is a stimulus I haven't been programmed to feel yet
Snatch you outta your Roots like I'm from Illadelph
What I do to push your hairline back, Rogaine won't help
My Quest for the Wealth, like Stone Cold Austin's quest for the belt
I mention myself as a celestial cell, an extension of hell
At a lynching I smile, cut myself down, murder your guest list
My style murders an drags like they do black men in Texas
Next rapper to mention this, I'ma show them the real threat
Cause I'ma ride till my daughter's like ""Daddy are we there yet?""
Ain't no priest in the streets, only drugs before miracles
Seen more keys than the lots seen Hammers repossessed vehicles
Told you I was coming, you ain't believe I'm assumin'
If we all super heroes, these bitch niggaz must be Wonder Women
Fist to fist, skin to skin, I make you fall flat
Brat little niggaz, the tat on my shoulder cover they whole back
Can't hold back, splatter they whole rap to match my ((?))
Shittin' on MC's, wipin' my ass on they notebooks
How the broke crooks in videos leave me stressed
I'll turn on channel 2 if I want to CBS, bitch

[Chorus: ]

Least but not last, I'll blast an informant
Until he has the cash to put end to his torment
Now shine up the brass for his coffin
I've mastered the ((?)), through passion and torment
I've mastered the forces, I rap to the chorus,
My cast is enormous, I'm fast and I'm cautious
Twenty inch arms stronger than forklifts
Smoke hash in front of reporters till I choke and they nauseous
And smash through the glass of your Porsche's
Show you how north is hard as divorces
Lay you out dead in the grass on the forest
My rap is flawless, have ya flesh wrapped in a blackened sausage
Blood Splashed across it for rhymin' like a fag in a cordless
Murder all witnesses, nosy, standing on porches,
Like torches, super human, Chino's skin never scorches
Drape your family reunion in black funeral mourners
Have cats that sell ya drugs for you, avoid usual corners
I never lost, there's mad lust to be Rap carasses
Breakin' companies, Jersey got women strapped inside they office
I got.. DJ supporters and women makin' sex offers
I got.. a crib like a fortress, tuition for all my daughters
I got.. rhymes hot like sauna's, and thousands from Time Warner
I got.. killas on every corner, surrounded by Jewish lawyers
What what what...

Chinx,"If I die
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga
If I die
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga

If I die, just look to the sky
I ain’t even gon’ lie, tell my niggas don’t cry 'bout nothing
If there’s something on my mind, I was busy tryna find
I was drunk, getting high with my guys, didn't care 'bout nothing

Ever since they first hit me up, wasn't supposed to live
Still on the block getting money where I’m supposed to live
They want to see my casket shine, hope mama front row
Tears in her eyes, heart bleeding, the boy have to go
I can see Puff telling Ross, Yela was a legend
I can see my baby-mama mad, it ain't fresh
And I be mad
Turning up for my nigga 'till they put me in the casket

If I die
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga
If I die
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga

If I die, just look to the sky
I ain’t even gon’ lie, tell my niggas don’t cry 'bout nothing
If there’s something on my mind, I was busy tryna find
I was drunk, getting high with my guys, didn't care 'bout nothing

Sucks hanging, we just some young niggas
Out the bottom, got it from crumbs nigga
Now it’s 250 in the slum nigga
Pocket full and this shit for fun nigga
Say never know
All this shit a nigga seen, I’ll never fold
May never know
Niggas claiming like a lawyer, probably telling though
Young niggas out here, let the blammer go
Mixing mud with the smoke, I’m paranoid
Got a couple kittens that’s down to go
And when they come, I’ll be there mining coal
Suckas living a lie
Out here blessing all my niggas and I’m living the life
Got a couple foreign bitches and they put up a fight
If I told you what I know, I’m probably doing a life
Fuck these fuck-niggas, we don’t run with 'em
Hating bitches man, I’m done with 'em
Live fast and die young nigga
Know the consequences come with it

If I die
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga
If I die
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga

Look, rose up out that dirt wearing holy clothes
Most niggas love to hate you, man, you don’t need those niggas
How we gon’ cleanse our body of these sins?
When our only concern was re-ing up and riding rims
Sold white that wasn’t good for cooking
Teacher used to say that I’d amount to nothing
Kept the work up in that kitchen cupboard
Whipped it like I baked it in that easy oven
Everybody pick their poison, Islamic or Christian
Buddhas to Jewish, every religion is Judas
Nigga due to all my circumstances
Had no choice but roll the dice, had to take the chances
'Till my homies leave the can, they just tuna fish
No money orders from the fam, just get through the shit
Youngins dying nowadays, dressed-up in the ghetto
The struggle all by the system, these crackers turn you Gepetto
I’m loading up in that hoopty to catch a 187
I flipped and got me a Rolex, preacher got the same Bezel
What the fuck, some nights I couldn’t sleep 'cause Satan woke me up
Been through shit that make you cry, have you choking up
Find yourself in the darkest places loading them nines
Tryna grip your mind, searching, you search what you find
Came up with jack-shit up out that wishing well
Left with this black skin and a digital scale
I pray I be okay when I grow up a little bigger
If I don’t, tell my babies daddy was a real nigga

If I die
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga
If I die
Probably die as a young nigga
Probably die as a young nigga",Die Young

Only one I ever fear is God so I talk to him, on my knees
Get 'em up work, have blood on my hands

Kicks with the shoelace missing
And that nigga wears nothing less than a bando on my feet
Pull the Ks out where y’all sleep
In a red Corvette with a red side grip
Nowadays nigga life cost cheap
Racks on racks on deck, drove off that lot, with no signing

White Ross, panorama seats killer
Stacks on deck, finna bust up in the back
Rose bottle, 'bout to bust open the cap
Don’t mind me, I done came to fuck the club up
With a couple young niggas from the A
Top downs ridden by the wayside
Whip for the baseside, dribbling the baseline kicker
Before I hit the club, I’ma slide up in your bitch, that yay
Come and then she wing bone dinner
Remember back then we was all tryna get out to fit in
Now they want in, 'cause we stick out
Fuck niggas ain’t even made enough for the paint
Send 'em back home with the kick out
Racks on racks on racks, drove off that lot, know I did

Oh look at me, what more could you need?
I knew that I could win a room because I've always had it,
But love is a scary thing.
It's what they never taught
And I don't know how its gotten me this far

All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me!

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless,
But I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3 AM.

I wish I would of loved you instead of being selfish
And being so obsessed with my dreams
Oh look at me I'm surrounded by the lonely
I thought I could win you back
Because I've always had it but love is a tricky thing
It's what they never taught,
That you when lose what you love,
You lose a piece of your heart

All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me!

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless,
But I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3 AM.

Everyday I still learn from the mistakes that I've made
Who knew that things would be this way
I'm here because I wouldn't change
I've fallen on my face, but watch me get up again!

It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
Now everything else is meaningless
So I'm laying in bed sick with regret at 3 AM.",3 a.m.

Chip Richter,"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon

You never know what you've got 'til it's gone like 

Damn, I wish I would've seen it coming 
Cause I blink for a second and you caught me slipping, Oh, Oh, Oh 
Now we're done before we even started 
Didn't know how much I missed you 
(Didn't know how much I would miss you 
I messed up the perfect picture) 
Until You Were Gone, gone, gone 
Until You Were Gone, gone, gone 
Until You Were Gone, gone, gone 
I didn't know how much I missed you 
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh-oh (Whooa) 

Let me go, Yeah 

I'm too stressed and I'm trying not to flip 
I close my eyes and you're beside my lips 
So I try not to blink for one split sec 
Cus she bought in, and got my piece wrecked 
Since you left, nothing ain't right 
Two different ways, we have to part sides 
It's a long sighting, y'know, It ain't the same when you went missing 
Didn't know how much I missed you until you were gone, gone, gone 

Until you were gone, gone, gone 
Until you were gone, gone, gone 
Until you were gone, gone, gone 

I didn't know how much I missed you 
(Didn't know how much I would miss you 
I messed up the perfect picture)

I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you lad it's business

I do this for Panaray, Diana Blake
And daddy's goin' doolally if someone tries to violate me
niggas that are in house are tryin' to snake me
It's a minor, nothin' is this world can break me
I have risen, I have fell, oh yes I'm still here
Tryna run up in my drum they're lucky that I wasn't there
Trust me I'm the one to put your money on
Last thing I do I'm gonna make it a spare
See I'm just tryna to blow and they're just tryin' to do the same
Started at the same place, they still haven't got a name
I clocked every snake, but remains social shut my mind
Because I'm supposed to, not because I'm told to
I don't know what they told you, my team I stick with it
I'm a loyal monk, I don't switch ships every minute
Unlike some their time won't come, 
I'll be in this limelight until my life is done

I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you lad it's business
I'm just mindin' my business

Handlin' business, there's no love for you lad it's business

And now man I'm movin' up
One of my teams and try and move it up
If she's done she'll probably give it up but
I don't give a fuck
Over chicks I'll never scuff, I learnt that on the streets because
One man's wifey is another man's B dud
Trust me, I learned that the hard way
Fear no evil, trust no gal I'm focusin' on my pay
doin' things my way they can't always manage it
Not all decisions made are made by management
You're not a goon you're a talker boy
Mr. Monk I'm a boss not a water boy
You're not that sorta boy, my fam no I'm down G
There's just a couple man that man don't need around me
You see I can't take these sneaky heads
True love you got for man then you won't take offense

I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you lad it's business

I'm just mindin' my business
Handlin' business, there's no love for you lad it's business

You know I handle my business, leave no witness
Prove it but they know who did this
The Feds got his pictures, another eye with the street boy features
I'm not Chip Diddy Chip, but I'll flip diddy flip
Right hook will open up your lip diddy lips
And don't slip diddy slip, 'cause you know what will happen
I'm a real G the man there just rappin' (fakes), I swear I just slap 'em
I laugh 'cause while they fake it tryna make it
I'm in the manor in the banger listenin' to ?
You know me I'd rather take it
Young Spray, gun speed catch me on the pavement
Look, Chippy stay focus, especially make 'em disappear like hocus pocus
Them man are some jokers, 
they don't handle their business they're broke 'cause

And your arguments are why I'm here with this pen.
For real, you've raised your kids and you've raised them fine,
Even though you never ever really spent no time.
But when you argue all the neighbors can hear that,
And ma lickle sister don't need to hear that.
Dear mum I know your having problems with dad.
But all good things come to an end,
So I can see why your packing your bags.
And I know you say that I'm too rude,
And all I care about is money and tunes.
But the reason I do music and grime is so one day I can provide for you.

Daddy tells me to come church but I ain't listening,
'Cos to me that's a room full of hypocrites.
God forgive, God that's a hell of a line
But my father always told me I should speak my mind.
And I thank the Lord for my life yes I'm truly blessed.
I thank my Mum for giving birth to my massive head.
I thank my father true he showed me them ropes,
Let me end it on a positive note.

Dear Dad, dear Mum, dear God, together look what you've made,
Look I know I ain't no perfect kid, but I'm slowly tryna change my ways.
P.S Grandma I'm on the street quite a lot,
Can you pray the lord keeps me safe?
To ma aunties, and uncles brothers and sis,
I swear I love you's all the same.

You see me grow from a boy to a man
So this must really be the end of the road

and girl its like round and round we go, hearts would prefer if you left me alone
'cause I can't take the pain
And my heartbeat feels like an AOA

I'm a walking disaster
Don't wana hurt you that's why you got to go
Destruction like fire on the ground
That's why you got to go

oopsy daisy I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out baby ill understand
'cause all ill do is hurt you again",Oopsy Daisy
Chipmunk,"So you tell me who the kids are looking up to 
Chi, superman chip, listen, 
See they say that I'm a role model, 
But I didn't ask to be, 
You don't know what it's like, 
Going college everyday in my hood, 
When I know men are after me, 
They wanna see me fall 'cause I'm on TV, 
And all the little kids wanna be like me, 
So I guess I'm a role model, 
So I guess I'm a role model, listen, 

Balls in the satin in the morn ain't me, 
Human nature I grab what I see, 
In fear of your life you'll grab what's insight 
And swing from the left to the right, a light, 
Listen, me, I'm just like you, 
My shit does stink, I'm human too, 
So why should I make a man violate me, 
If you don't ever make a man violate you. 

See it's more then a catch twenty-two, 
Yeah I'm in the limelight, but what can I do, 
If they choose to shut me out they will, 
And so solid crew be the damn living proof, 
She they need to promote, they promoted violence, 
But did not provoke cry or broken silence, 
But that's just the life of an artist, 
The spotlight makes you a target.

So I guess I'm a role model, check it, listen, 

I'm living proof you ain't gotta be a nerd to get A's, 
Proof you ain't gotta be a shark to get paid, 
Coming up I had some doors closed in my face, 
But the road to success made me a lane, 
Gave me a way just me and my team, 
Kept seeing red but I move like it's green, 
I couldn't find money but id find home, 
Chasing the dream with a blind fold, 
Tryna find money with my eyes closed, 
Well I might as well have been, 
Tryna get to heaven but it feels like hell I'm in, 
And Gucci's got me blowin' my dough, 
'Cause I just spend money whenever I feel low, 
I feel like my mind's in a mosh pit, 
But that's just the life of an artist, 
See the spotlight made me a target,

So I guess I'm a role model, 
So I guess I'm a role model, cee's up, listen, 

Growing up with you where there's more hate then love, 
I was lookin' up to men that made money off of drugs, 
Being surrounded by chicks in a club, 
Like who the hell said money can't but love, 
And school is where the attitude starts, 
More city learners are relevant outta class, 
Teach the kids to get A's and shit, 
But don't tell a man to get mortgages, 
Society's designed to contain us in, 
But I know just what id be here for, 
'Cause I give them everything, 
But they still want more, 
And 2pac crew when they die they care more, 
But I ain't tryna die to sell, 
But I ain't tryna ask for help, 
That's just the life of an artist, 
Spotlight made me a target, 

See they say that I'm a role model,

You don't know what it's like,

So I guess I'm a role model, 

See what people fail to understand, 
Is that when your an artist, 
Even when you're in the right, you're in the wrong, 
You can't win, 
Lemme get some A's they won't put that in the paper, 
But let me go mad, 
And do a total madness, 
Probably even get the front page, 
Aging to see me fall, it won't happen,

Thy kingdom's come

This is sick to you, this a verse to you
And everybody’s gettin’ deals now
'Cause every frickin’ label wants one of me
Yeah, you can’t replicate my style
I’m on my high horse, no Ralph
And you’re looking at the Holy grail and this is what I wanna make

This is straight up, you can’t F with me music
Never chose it, it’s destiny music
This ain't other music, this is confidence crusher music
There ain't too many that I’m cool with
I’m just tryna take it, but no-one has took it
Yes I am a novelty, hence all the bookings
Never touched the drop, but they smell what I’m cooking
I did it without looking whilst you can’t get a look in!

Chipmunk,"Every time you feel like you cannot go on
You feel so lost and
That you're so alone

You feel you can't repent

Chipmunk,"Yeah, from hills high in heaven
To Psalms twenty-seven
This is our gospel
Take my word for it
Uh, check, listen

You see the music business like the devil's games
If you play then you might adopt the devil's ways
It's an eye for an eye, a tooth the same
I'm tired of everybody taking shots up my name

I'm just shooting for my targets
Look if you've been shooting yourself in the foot, don't hold me hostage
Making what doesn't sell
Then you complaining when it doesn't sell

Now with that off my chest I'ma hope for the best
I'm never going back to the press though they wanna see me stress
Counting money and staying relevant
Made me know the difference between family and relatives

I beg the Lord show me a path
Snakes are in my blood line, not in my grass
Not talking to my match, cut my family in half
If you reap what you sow, let me pray my own heart
Come on

(Pray for me)
Yeah, please take me to a level, the heaven is above
(Pray for me)
Yeah, try sitting in my past so Heaven is a must

(Pray for me, yeah)
With the world on my shoulders, I bench-press the cane
(Pray for me, yeah)
You know the Lord is my Shepherd so I can't be afraid

The prayers I need them, the good in me is leaking
I'd only want this pen now so they can see Jesus
To show 'em I believe in, s***'s getting stranger
Little change of maze got them questioning my faith

My visions strange when they negatively name me
I see Lord, does that make me crazy?
Suicidal tweets, can you blame me?
Yeah, look what success did to Amy

They couldn't work out my letters so they hung me
I've been fired alive, how could you burn me?
As I stay afloat, it's titanic for rum
My confidence is made of titanium

I told everybody I'm the savior
Special like I'm born in a manger, manger
Born to succeed, who's as humble as me
As long as I got a number, I wear a heart on my sleeve
Come on

(Pray for me)
Yeah, please take me to a level, the heaven is above
(Pray for me)
Yeah, try sitting in my past so Heaven is a must

(Pray for me, yeah)
With the world on my shoulders, I bench-press the cane
(Pray for me, yeah)
You know the Lord is my Shepherd so I can't be afraid

Looking back like, look what the deal did?
Still with the same circle and I'm still with Chip
That's why who I share the last pound with
Is the same people that I share a mill with

Six zero's in my last mill with
Bread and wine, last supper was some real s***
The prayer's been sent, now we're ready
Old Judas has been removed already
Let's go

(Pray for me)
Yeah, please take me to a level, the heaven is above
(Pray for me)
Yeah, try sitting in my past so Heaven is a must

Tell my chick, don't leave me now, tell my feet, don't fail me now
It's too late I'm in front of this crowd
When you see me bow
I'll drown in my own sweat before they take me out

Take the jewels, take the fame
Take the buzz, take the name but the talent still remains
And tell the hater change of plan
I tell the label, drop me still on weeks we all run

Piss off, this ain't a big trap
This is seat for a gift wrap, I reply to every diss track
Back from the future, you plums
Fighting in advance for the apologies to come

I'm sick trust me
Eat a plate of fame of vomit, still repping for the hungry
Heads shots with success bullets
More Mobo's, Brits and Grammy's before I pull it

Believe me, the floor's tight but the jeans ain't
You can't compromise these days
I open doors into the blame frame
'Bout time I do me and get paid for it

So f*** a market and plan
I'm light skinned and I can smile, come on, market me, man
Pray for me and play your position
I evidently made a transition",Pray for Me
Chipmunk,"[Chorus]
Never thought id see the day when you wasn't by my side.
Listen I was down for you girl put you first in my world
And I thought you were down too right
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, take off.
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off.
But now I'm leaving.

I keep my life in a lime light, pap lights, award shows, red floors, booji bars
Yes its what I'm meant for
And we ain't quite the same as we used to be
My life's in the public eye, I know you don't want yours to be
Truthfully, 2years in its still new to me
I wouldn't say your comfortable, I would say your used to me
Hense separating doesn't seem real
They tell me chip keep the girl that you had before the deal- Chyeaah.
You can call this my reff flow, could this decision might determine how the game goes
Every time you get use me being here, I go. On that note that's my que to go.

[Chorus]

If it ain't a push forward its a slow down
It's kind of ironic that I slow down,
It's best that I go now rather than later
Before you claim I'm too busy chasing that paper -it's true talk
And to say its over there ain't no good words,
I don't think anybody breaks up on good terms
So I'ma hit the club (yep)
Get my mingle on (yep) get my single on and throw it in a single song- Chyeaah.
And you could call this my reff flow, could this decision might determine how to game goes
Every time you get used to me being here, I go. On that note that's my que to go.

[Chorus]

They always ask me if I'm single in interviews
I was too scared to say I'm into you. moving like a single dude
Didn't ever lie but I skipped the truth
Its past breaks now, fuck it- interlude.
On my own feeling like I've got a point to prove
Hungry but I don't wanna have my cake and eat it too
And it's not that I ain't feelin you
I'm leaving us, I ain't leaving you
And you call this my reff flow , could this decision might determine how the game goes
Every time you get used to me being here, I go. On that note that's my que to go.",Take Off
Chipmunk,"Yeah,
Yeah,
Whats he gonna say?

You wanna be like me son get a change of plan,
I don't hardly see my dawgs, get a hand, pick ma fam
Confused, feelin' used, tryin' to rearrange plans,
'Cause I've got a Rolex but no time on my hands, 
Made a transition from a boy into a man,
Step one never mix ya business and fam,
Haters say I changed,
But I can't disagree,
'Cause the figures damn Skippy ain't the same in the bank, and I just wanna say thanks,
To those tryin' to pull me down,
I was born to be fly I don't like the ground, so don't tell me stay grounded,
I'm good in my town,
And when I was blue you just went around.
I shouldn't know stress at my age,
Money came around me then everybody changed,
Fools say they know me from ya dawgs, 
Stop tryin' to call me by my government name

'Cause it's all chipmunk now,
You can blow after,
It's Chipmunk now,
It's Chipmunk's time,
Chipmunk's in his prime,
And only Chipmunk can take Chipmunk's shine!

I made a transition,
I made a transition.
You can say I made a transition.

I'm feelin' like I found myself but lost my mind,
They wanna take my life I take my time,
I'm hair and flesh but lost my life my privacy went up in the sky,
When I signed I,
Grinned to six figures then I grin teeth airing all the tag alongs like bring me,
I never breaded no one when I was working,
So hate me if you want but don't say I don't deserve it,
Understand the position I played then,
Understand the transition I made then, go and picture me back in the days then,
Look at me now and get mad,
They just wanna get fly although now I'm jet lagged,
Now everybody step back,
I'm on the next ting,
It's not a bless ting,
They're number two,
I'm on some next shit,
First place that's the first base, suicide that's the worst case,
That's when you're whole life time is tryin' to get your dough up,
And then you blow up and blow up,
No escalators, stairs, and I'm still tryin' to step up,
But I think it's tryin' to handle the pressure,
I can't let the game slip away,
When the UK roots for my name,
Shame 

It's all Mr. Monk now,
You can blow after,
It's Mr. Monk now,
It's Mr. Monks Time,
Mr. Monks in his prime,
And only Mr. Monk can take Mr. Monk's shine! 

'Cause it's all chipmunk now,
You can blow after,
It's Chipmunk now,
It's Chipmunk's time,
Chipmunk's in his prime,
And only Chipmunk can take Chipmunk's shine!

I made a transition,
I made a transition,
You can say I made a transition. 

Being successful, that's a gift and a curse,
Being paid or being broke I know what's worse,
And people at the bottom say that,
You forgot your roots but,
That's always the case when you rise from the dirt,
And preparation is the key to elevation,
But them man are too busy hating debating,
If I sound better on some grime shit,
Half of them don't even know what grime is,
It's all timing, even though I blew quicker than your average,
I came through slicker than your average,
'Cause yeah I'm not you're average spitter,
Any tempo or instrumental,
Flows mentors straight jacket worthy, conspiracy they put in to merk me,
If I'm not fire how could you burn me,
Insultin' how could you out me,
I'm so truth how could you doubt me,
Allow me. 

'Cause it's all me now,
You can blow after,
It's all me now,
It's all me time,
It's all me in my prime,
And only I can take my shine!

Check, would you believe me if I told you some people do anything to please me 
From burning my all CDs as a free be 
To shop and taking pictures with my fans in Sainsburys 
Like I wonder if this company still got my C-V
Deep in, into my pocket no wonder I'm feeling jeans 
But this pocket full of dreams, ain't buying me what I need

Plus as long as I'm alive, guess I'm running out of time 
Got my rolly hands in sweeping hand, tired of clockwise 
Some get left behind who don't move with the time

Now you're looking at your legs trying to work out where you stand 
See my dream came to life and okays came to death 
Caught up to your imagination running faster than your legs 
Now I feel I need to live before I end up lifeless 
I'm trying to buy the time even though it's priceless 
Dealing with the precious in the game 
Like I know that it's my decade and it'll have to be my game, let's flight 

If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride 
And they would all come to lie 
If we all have dreams we'd be story eyes

In their rendition of 'The Cell Block Tango'

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh Uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

You know how people have these little habits
That get you down like Ernie
Ernie like to chew gum, no, not chew, Pop

Like, I come home this one day and there's Ernie
Layin' on the couch chewin', no, not chewin', poppin'
So, I said to him, I said
""Ernie, you pop that gum one more time"" and he did

So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots into his head

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake city about two years ago
And he told me he was single and we hit it off right away
So, we started living together

He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
Then I found out, single, my ass
Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up the chicken for dinner
And in storms my husband Wilbrin in a jealous rage
""You been screwin' the milkman""

He says and he kept sayin'
""You been screwin the milkman""
Then he ran into my knife
He ran into my knife ten times

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Mit kersek, en itt? Azt mondjok, hogy a hires
Lakem lefogta a ferjemet en meg lecsaptam a fejet
De nem igaz, en artatlan vagyok
Nem tudom mert mondja Uncle Sam hogy en tettem
Probaltam a rendorsegen megmayarazni de nem ertettek meg

But did you do it?
Uh uh, not guilty

My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie traveled around with us
With the last number in our act
We did 20 acrobatic tricks in our world

One two three four five, splits, spread eagles
Flip flops, back flips, one right after the other
Well, this one night we were in Cicero

The three of us, we were in this hotel room
Boozin' and havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice
So I went out to get some

I come back, open the door
There's Veronica and Charlie
Doing number seventeen, the spread eagle

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out
I can't remember a thing, it wasn't until later
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming, they had it coming
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it, in spite if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

I loved Alvin Lipschitz, he was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter
But he was always trying to find himself
He go out every night looking for himself
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it comin', they had it comin'
They had it comin' all along
'Cause if they used us and they abused us
How could they tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

But a fact is still a fact

Then we'd wow the crowd again
When she'd go
I'd go
We'd go

And then those ding-dong daddies started to roar
Whistled, stomped and stamped on the floor
Yelling, sreaming, begging for more.

And we'd say, ""o.k. fellas, keep your socks up.
You ain't seen nothin' yet!""

But I simply cannot do it alone!

Well? what did ya' think? come on, you can say.

O.k., o.k. the first part can always be rewritten.
But the second part was really nifty. watch this.

Then she'd (See, get it, right?)
Then I'd (Then I'd kick really high)
Then we'd,
But I can't do it alone!
She'd say, ""what state's chicago in?""
I'd say, ""ill!""
Did ya' get that?
She'd say, ""turn your motor off""
I can hear 'em cheerin' still
When she'd go,
I'd go,
We'd go (Sideways!)
And then those two-bit johnnies did it up brown
To cheer the best attraction in town
They nearly tore the balcony down

And we'd say. ""o.k. fellas, o.k.,
We're goin' home, but here's a few more partin' shots!""
And this, this we did in perfect unison.

Now, you've seen me goin' through it
It may seem there's nothin' to it
But I simply cannot do it
Alone!

All alone and shaking with fright
With her brand new hubby nowhere in sight

Chitãozinho & Xororó,"Deixe tudo como está
Faz de conta que não vai embora
De nós dois quem vai chorar
Ninguém vai poder dizer agora
Amanhã é outro dia
E quem tem essa mania de amar igual a mim
Por maior que seja a queda
No amor jamais se entrega quando chega ao fim

Não vou dizer
Que a tua ausência não vai machucar
Que não vou morrer um pouco ao te perder
Que esse teu adeus não vai me derrubar
Prefiro assim do que ter você aqui nos braços meus
Sonhando com alguém que não sou eu
Amando o que não sou
Querendo outro em meu lugar

Deixe tudo como está
Não precisa arrumar a casa
Vai sem pressa de voltar
Tem espaço pra soltar as suas asas
Novamente a nossa vida
Se não foi tão colorida como a gente imaginou
Foi tão linda no começo
Mas depois virou do avesso e tudo terminou",Vida pelo Avesso

Pois eu a amo mais que tudo nesse mundo
É um amor tão profundo, topo o que der e vier
Ela, que me inspira tanto amor
Se eu sou um sonhador, confesso que é por ela

Is there a chance that we could remake history?

It's not me 'cause we have torn apart
Let me go 'cause I need to breath,
I won't be screwed in your paper heart, paper heart

I won't do what I'm told, you won't say what you mean
You were so hurt and cold and lost me in-between
You love with your hate and your petty games

I'm giving it up, I don't wanna see
Another fake apology
I'm letting it out now darlin'

It's not me that you think you need
It's not me 'cause we have torn apart
Let me go cause I need release
I won't be screwed in your paper heart
Paper heart
Paper, paper, (heart) paper
Paper heart.

And all of the dirt, and the stormy weather
Says we don't fit together
I'm drawing the line now darlin'

It's not me that you think you need
It's not me 'cause we have torn apart
Let me go cause I need to breath,
I won't be screwed in your paper heart

A darme la última llamada, cual, la de tu adiós
Me sorprendí al ver tus maletas en la puerta
Y las frases que me decías, para irte de vuelta

A otra casa, cambiando el rumbo nuestro destino
Sabiendo que tu y yo seguíamos el mismo camino
En otra ocasión, otro corazón, en otra relación
Buscando una excusa para enmendar mi error

Creo que ya perdí el camino

Seria un asunto fácil

Disfrutaría ambas partes por igual

Pero nadie quiere pagar pasaje

Anda solo dame un pedacito
Un poquitico de alegría, siempre hay una razón

Aun funciona el avión, aun funciona el avión
Que se acabe la gasolina
Aun funciona el avión, aun funciona el avión

Pero no quieren pagar por hacerlo

Tuti, caricias loca pasión

Que la turbulencia no valla asustarte
Voy a apretar, al intentar
Como en la pista tu puedes bailar

Nisiquiera en cajas especiales
No hay tiendas de felicidad

Shit's going down and meet him at his home, he packs a 4-pound (4-pound)
He waits around, with the sweat dripping from his brow
Where the law be now, nervousness has his head swinging side-to-side
Checks the door, he's see his man up in the ride
He's rolling outside, first looking all around
The sniper fire from the roof, it makes him drop and hit the ground
He makes a mad dash to the car door
Tells his man to move, he slams the pedal on the car floor
Now bullet-proof windows, they be reflecting it
Now he's thinking back up to the party, he's regretting it
But he's deep in it, and there's nothing he can do, but to call his boo
Who be at home, taking care of his one year old 
He says, situation's thick, there's niggas after me
It ain't no stopping them, until they capping me (naw)
Hold the fort down, I.ll be aight, I.ll give you a call in the morn
She says there's two up on my floor, with one kicking down my door
He calls his man Nick, to check the situation (situation)
When he arrives all he sees is an assassination (assassination)
And when they one step ahead, so now an ambush is in the waiting
Understand, you need to understand, my man
(You need to recognize and realize, boy!)

[Chorus: x2]

Now there's vengeance on the mind, time for him to take back what's stolen
He tells Jermaine to meet him at the docks
At 5 o.clock, keep the glocks cocked
I got the blueprints, to run up on these niggas (Word up dog!)
So when the time comes for them to meet
He sees the car, but finds Jermaine slumped in the driver seat (what to do)
People cut themselves off of him, cause if they down they be shot too
His mother's in the rage, face on the front page
Now the man's after him, the clan's after him, mob's after him
He's still at damage son, last thought's killing (uh)
The only thought in his head, now to do is run
Buys his ticket at the International pier son
Not, knowing that there's man
Standing behind .em with, 9-millimeters in hand (He turns around to his surprise)
Feels the burning on the inside, cold on the outside
And the people did the shooting, got away up with his life-time (Ah-yo)

[Chorus: x3]

(You fucking with your life boy)
Yeah, (uh-uh) wild niggas (uh-uh, wild niggas)
You fucking with your life boy 
(You fucking with your life boy)
Uh, You fucking with your life boy

Back to where I should have always stayed

I'll take you back into my teenage years
See, I did a little dirt
Don't talk much about it
But I was good at it, the cops had never heard about it
I had a few friends who broke up over ends
Man it's funny how that shit just stays a trend
But in the end
I wish 'em all of the best
And all the success
No time to give myself stress
My kitchen now only 1 chef
Left virgin, greenhouse, new success
So, don't stress, mess test us
Just leave, train, plane, car, bus
Circles still reign victorious
So when people try to bring me 'round all drama
I dip and handle just a bit of the scandal
Then I bounce to the Bahamas
Two first class seats, me and hot mama
Two weeks then, back to greenhouse headquarters
More albums on orda'
More hard drives on orda'

My Principle grabbed at the Pope John Paul Cath
I struggled with no cash
No Bel-Air Prince
Just my niggaz gettin' fingerprints on the wall, on the clip
Yeah, I got your letter homie and I did what you told me
No father to scold me, my brother only
Missed him for six years, so I'm raised by his peers
But I love my mama dear, so I chose a career
Now I travel often, condo, valet parkin'
I leave history when I'm in the coffin
Toronto I'll be laid so y'all spread my name
I'm like twenty-one when I entered the game
Seven years lata', now the weight is much greata'
Raise up the greenhouse antenna
Not just the weight now, but the pockets less thinna'
Got the whole circle with us
We monster trucks to you small fucks

Choclair,"Yeah, yeah
Che-che-che-che-check one (one one one)
Y'all can move if ya want to
Yo, yo, picture me just a kid once again
Innocent in this world full of sin
A time, took a pull, pop's head took a spin
Hand came crashing up the side of my chin
A lesson that I learned from him
Rarely remembering him
Even hard to consider him friend
My moms tried to make these ends
We be poor, eviction notice on the door
Will it come to an end?
Pimple head kid in a Pope cardigan
Hoping, the shots don't bust again
Cause I done lost two friends, in the parking lot
Now their mom hates me, and hip hop
Still she moved on, can't fathom the lost of your first born
Some kids got a deal with the devil sworn
They miss the small print then, with a blink
Yo

[Chorus]
I'm a get it my way, that's all I want to do
I'm reaching for the sklyine, where dreams come true
If you came here to party, that's all I want to do
Just reach for the skyline where dreams come true

It was a Kodac moment
When I saw these three people, beat this man honest
Knew the cops would not be on it
Survival of the fittest, now these crew adapt Blue
And outfit in it
Attitudes are well screwed and want to deal with it
Now mommas crying, and babies dying
Earfuls of dudes saying that who's you
Pissed off cause your teen years are through
Newborns 19, you 42
When you get out, you considered old school
And old dogs don't want no new rules
Picture, a new rapper disrespecting Grand Master
Naw, that can't happen
Time to get back in
You call up your soldiers trying to make moves again
You're setting up shop, but your on claimed turf man

[Chorus]

It's still a snap shot in time
When the world knew me and you aligned
Ya, we talked, had dinner, did
All the things that you do in a friendship
A Brass Rail, two G.M.'s, you ale
Three chicks, contract signed, chart rise
My position is, couldn't be better
For a kid in a Sears sweater
Piss coat, uff Tims, no change then (chi-ching)
Straight power moves
But individuals make individual moves
One overseas, other V.P
One got his own, now its just me but it's home
New blood, new heart, but they ain't birth it
And mergers make 'em nervous
But it's the team so it's worth it (we work this shit y'all)
Mad work, mad clubs, got crunk y'all
On tour almost got into two brawls
It's straight love y'all, but I moved on
It's Greenhouse, green baggie, and a green lawn
I'll see y'all when I see y'all

Chocolate Genius,"There's a rumor that an old lady heard a 
Kingpin hiring a hitman to murder
A federal prosecuting drug-dealing witness
But that's how it is in the business
And I'm in it, physically gaining power
Constantly counting up cash by the hour
And it feels good to be paid
Regardless of how many victims get slayed
Accomplices of mine drop like flies
But in this everyday a homeboy dies
Whether shot in the body or cyanide in ya Bacardi
'Cause it's a cutthroat party
Now it's up to me to retaliate
And if I score, I'll increase the murder rate
I move on ones who double-cross
Set them up, now they suffer the loss
Of he or she who's ever on the agenda
Most likely a family member
Informants, rattle-tattle-telling snakes
Get shot up, brutalized and thrown in lakes
The parts of a body is found days later
The other half was done by an amputator
I'm undefeated in plenty fights
My enemies are beaten with many stripes
I'll shoot up funerals, firebomb wakes
Vehicular homicides, whatever it takes
Just to keep control of my empire
I'll set ya own mother on fire
'Cause when it comes down just to me and my money
Ain't a fucking thing funny
All those who pose a threat I'll stick them
Ya friends, ya family and innocent victims
Get caught in the midst when I'm busting of nines
But they was in the wrong place, the wrong time
Decapitated bodies found in lots
While I'm still cooking up kilos in pots
The kilos becomes bricks and the bricks becomes rocks
Then retailed on the blocks
I drive around in expensive cars
And get women who fuck like porno stars
I get them high, you know, like powder they nose
Then put 'em in the streets as my high-class hoes
I'm wild, living foul and I'm ruthless
I leave muthafuckers toothless
I had a worker who stepped on the scene lively
Then started selling my customers Ivory
Soap, counterfeit vials of cracks
I stuck 'em to death with a thousand thumbtacks
You've seen my resume, that's just the half
I'm a bad muthafucker, just like Shaft
A character played by who? Richard Roundtree
The only difference, my guns are sound-free
Silencers ring off then wisp by
Then all you hear is a last minute cry
Of those who triedto control my territory
Not the West Side but the Bed-Stuy story
Police be giving me eye-to-eye contact
But I smile 'cause I'm putting out contracts
Now a G-note is placed upon ya head
You say picture that alright, bang ya dead

Chokebore,"I've been staying up nights talking to the floors like some people that I once knew when I wasn't quite so poor. They let themselves be sad songs. They let themselves be sad songs. I can't stand the silence, I get off my head, she came to me to unwind and let it out in bed. She lives her life like sad songs... She lives her life like sad songs. And so do I. I've been staying up nights walking through the floors, now I can see through her eyes and I don't speak no more. They treat their lives like sad songs... They treat their lives like sad songs. And so do I.

Ooh girl you looking good, give lil Choppa a holla
Cause I could take you out that Baby Phat, and put you in Prada
Choppa Style came from nothing, to having some change
Now everybody's in my face, wanting to look at me strange
Now I ain't even got a Range yet, but that's alright baby
Cause I ain't got my change yet, and I ain't nice
And I ain't right, and I ain't flipping chicks
But I ain't really nothing nice, when I'm spitting hits
You feel this shit, then won't you bob your head back and forward
And if you like the way it sound, go to the store and sco' it
You see me, I'm low key, cause I got this
And Choppa style dropping nothing but some hot hits, some hot hits
I can't wait, till I'm living lavage, call me Choppa
Tim Smooth, cause I gotta have it
And this not for a career, its all for fun
And I'm not from St. Louis, but I'm number one, I'm number one

Girl you looking good, come and ride with me
Hop in my 6 you looking nice, in them Prada jeans
So won't you drop it, bend it over, touch your toes for me
Bend it, make that booty wiggle wobble out for me

I got your head board banging, ooh la-la-la
When I ask you who you loving, you say Chop-Chop-Chop
I'm making it hot, coming through and breaking your twat
Don't you worry bout twenty minutes, cause I ain't gonna stop
You say you wanna get served wobble, so I'm gon find you
You say you wanna hot boy, with a condo
How you like it, from the back or your legs in the air
You could ride it, you could dodge it girl, I just don't care
Cause I'ma serve it like I beat it, like I chop it like a dog
I'ma make you touch your toes, sit you down and break you off
To you fat girls, I don't discriminate on y'all
If you can break me with your wiggle, I'll do you like a dog
I want a slim, fine woman, so I could break her cousin
Cause Choppa's like Popeye's chicken, you gotta love him
The next time you think, that you won't get served proper
I got your head board banging, p.s. just love Choppa

[Chorus - 2X]

[Choppa]
I want a slim, fine woman, who as cute as the (what)
Never ever labeled a duck, but always quick to buck
A attitude sometimes, but not a project child
But if needed to bend some piece, she acting project style
And she walk like a model, when she up in them streets
Prada pants, Prada purse, Prada shoes on her feet
She don't hang with messy chickens, cause she say that they sad
They already know the difference, its lust they got it bad
She don't listen to, what you say bout me and them broads
She never listen from the jump, though her head is hard
If she tell me she gon leave me, so my heart ain't gon stop
I get a playa bring a mill, and my woman I'll watch
And oh, tell your baby daddy, he ain't got nothing on me
Going rounds and he gon shoot me, tell him up it and see
Oh, you wonder how she really got that mark on her chest
Ask your girl, she'll probably tell you, but that ain't nothing but mess

To rest my eyes in shades of green

Under Dreaming Spires 
To Itchycoo Park, that's where I've been

What did you do there? - I got high 
What did you feel there? - Well I cried
But why the tears there? - I'll tell you why - yyyyy 
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful

I feel inclined to blow my mind 
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun 
They all come out to groove about 
Be nice and have fun in the sun 
I'll tell you what I'll do - What will you do?

I'd like to go there now with you
You can miss out school - Won't that be cool 
Why go to learn the words of fools?

What will we do there? - We'll get high 
What will we touch there? - We'll touch the sky 
But why the tears there? I'll tell you why 
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful

When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

You've never let me down
You turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found
I've found with you
Through the years
I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I stayed
Right here with you
Through the years

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted whom, I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

Through the years
Through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had
I've always been so glad
To be with you
Through the years
It's better everyday
You've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay
I'll stay with you
Through the years

Through the years
When everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belong
Right here with you
Through the years
I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out
I've learned what life's about
By loving you

Just friends, but not like before

It's just a void and empty space 
When you are not in my embrace
Oh, there's a lull In my life

The clock stops ticking
The world stops turning
Everything stops but the flame in my heart

Papa had three outside children and another wife

Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death

Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?

Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!

In the places I hide
When I rise, when I fall

At the start, at the end
In the center of the center of it

Some nights I lay awake and 
I can't push these thoughts away
I'm worried where I'm gonna go
Where I'm gonna be are You gonna be there for me
When it feels like the doors are closing
Gotta trust that You're doing something
Come sun come rainy day
You are all I need

There will be days I will forget
Everything You've done for me
But when I go back there again
I'm reminded

In the dark, in the light
In the morning and the night

In the dark, in the light
In the morning and night
In the good, in the hurt
In the places I hide
When I rise, when I fall

In the loss, in the win
In the beauty and the sin

Chris August,"I don't need a rainbow to know who made the rain
Don't need the waters parted to know who made the way
And I don't need a healing to know who is the cure
Of this I'm sure

I believe that there is something more than I can see
I believe that there is someone holding onto me
Sometimes I won't feel it, but that don't change a thing
'Cause it's by faith that I believe

If you had some heartache that made you cry a thousand tears
Then let me tell you now I know just how you feel
And that heavy weight of sorrow that you've carried for so long
Will soon be gone

'Cause I believe that there is something more than I can see
I believe that there is someone holding onto me
Sometimes I won't feel it, but that don't change a thing
'Cause it's by faith that I believe

You might see a miracle and give praises to the Lord
Don’t let a touch from heaven be the thing you're waiting for
Blessed are those who don't see but still believe, do you believe?

I believe that there is something more than I can see

I'm ready to say the words You were speaking back at the start
Come and flood the corners of my heart

I say let there be light, I need mercy tonight
Wanna feel it like the sun is rising
Revealing what the shadow’s hiding
I say let there be light, I need Your mercy to shine
Start living what I've been believing
What I got I want the whole world seein’
Let there be light

I'm feeling something happening, I'm finding hope again
It feels like the walls are finally cracking and Your love is pouring in
I'm seeing this is good just like You did

I say let there be light, I need mercy tonight
Wanna feel it like the sun is rising
Revealing what the shadow’s hiding
I say let there be light, I need Your mercy to shine
Start living what I've been believing
What I got I want the whole world seein’
Let there be light

I was scared of what the shame would do
If I started coming clean to You
But suddenly it's darkness that's afraid

I say let there be light, I need Your mercy tonight

Revealing what the shadow’s hiding
I say let there be light, I need Your mercy to shine

Chris August,"It was just last Sunday
I was sitting in the pew
The preacher told some stories
Yeah he spoke about the truth
Something resonated
I heard a million times before
Somehow I needed to hear it once more, he said

I could use a little more Jesus
And a little bit less of me
I could be a little more humble
If we're speaking honestly
The more I see this heart inside of me
The more that I believe
I could use a little more Jesus
And a little bit less of me

I try to love my neighbor
And love my enemy
I went down to the homeless shelter and I
Gave them food to eat
It made me feel so good inside
But it did not bring me peace
Turns out there's just one thing that I need

I could use a little more Jesus
And a little bit less of me
I could be a little more humble
If we're speaking honestly
The more I see this heart inside of me
The more that I believe
I could use a little more Jesus
And a little bit less of me

We've got rules and regulations
Got a stance on everything
It gets so complicated
When all we really need

Is just a little more Jesus
And a little bit less of me
I could be a little more humble
If we're speaking honestly
The more I see this heart inside of me
The more that I believe

Chris August,"Nobody's growing old together, we've made it easy just to quit
Love has become a negative percentage, why do we bother to commit
We've got a long list of excuses, ways we try to justify
Well, I propose to you the truth is, marriage does not have to die

I know you're feeling like it’s falling apart and it can't go on anymore
But God is a God who knows how to heal so just give it up to the Lord
And He will restore

He said with this ring I promise, and with I do she said forever
But right now if they're being honest they don't know if they'll stay together
Let's fast forward to the future after struggling on their own
They finally figured out they needed Jesus in the middle
Now I'm watching God rebuild their home

I know you're feeling like it’s falling apart and it can't go on anymore
But God is a God who knows how to heal so just give it up to the Lord
And He will restore

The enemy tries to come and divide
Trying to get us to give up the fight
But darkness will always lose out to light
'Cause we've got the power of Christ on our side

I see you growing old together
I pray I find a love like yours

So if you're feeling like it’s falling apart and it can't go on anymore

And He will restore

Like it was before
You may have strayed off course
But He will restore",Restore
