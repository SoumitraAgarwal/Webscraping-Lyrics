Dinah Shore,"Moments like this make me thrill through and through
Careless moments like this close to you
Nonchalantly we'd dine and we'd dance
Yet my heart seems to melt in your grace

Sweet moments like this with the soft lights aglow
Make me long for your kiss though I know
I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares

I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares.",Moments Like This
Dinah Shore,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Dinah Shore,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me
Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every homefire burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Dinah Shore,"Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just for children in school

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me

Oh, I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me",Falling in Love With Love
Dinah Shore,"The farce was ended,
The curtains drawn,
And I at least pretended
That love was dead and gone.

But now, from nowhere,
You come to me as before
To take my heart,
And break my heart once more.

Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love.
Get out of town,
Be good to mister please!

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear,
I care for you much too much,
And when you are near,
Close to me dear,
We touch too much!

The thrill when we meet
Is so bitter-sweet
That, darling, it's getting me down;
So on your mark,
Get set,
Get out of town!",Get Out of Town
Dinah Shore,"I am not such a clever one about the latest fads
I admit I was never one adored by local lads
Not that I ever tried to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I'm old fashioned, I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This years fancies are passing fancies
But sighing sighs, holding hands
These my heart understands

I'm old fashioned but I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me.

I'm old fashioned but I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me.",I'm Old Fashioned
Dinah Shore,"I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good or I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you
I can save money, or spend it
Go right on living, or end it
You're to blame, Honey
For what I do
I know that I can be beggar
I can be King
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

Isn't it sweet to know, Dear
You can help me on
Wouldn't it hurt to know, Dear
All my hopes were gone
Wouldn't it make you proud, Dear
If I made a name
But if I failed to win, dear
Would you want all the blame

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good or I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you
I can save money, or spend it
Go right on living, or end it
You're to blame, honey
For what I do
I know that I can be beggar,
I can be King
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you
Yes, it all depends on you",It All Depends on You
Dinah Shore,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay
Dinah Shore,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)
Dinah Shore,"Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories

Got my bag, got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
Long to hear that ""All aboard""

Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven
I'll be waitin' up for heaven
Countin' every mile of railroad track
That takes me back

Never thought my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam?
Gotta take that sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home

Sentimental journey!",Sentimental Journey
Dinah Shore,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love
Dinah Shore,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

W e may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me
Can't take that away
Can't take that away from me",They Can't Take That Away from Me
Dinah Shore,"It seems we stood and talked like this before.
We looked at each other in the same way then,
But I can't remember where or when.

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore.
The smile you were smiling you were smiling then,
But I can't remember where or when.

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again.

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before and loved before,
But who knows where or when?",Where or When
Dinah Shore,"April in Paris
Chestnuts in blossoms
Holiday tables
Under the trees
April in Paris
This is a feeling
No one can ever
Reprieve

I never knew the charm of spring 
Never met it face to face 
I never new my heart could sing 
Never missed a warm embrace

'Til April in Paris 
Whom can I run to 
What have you done to 
My heart...

I never knew the charm of spring

Dinah Shore,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning' sun

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You
Dinah Shore,"I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I've tried so not to give in
I've said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist, when baby will I know so well
That I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

Don't you know you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin",I've Got You Under My Skin
Dinah Shore,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues

Dinah Shore,"Why do I do just as you say?
Why must I just give you your way?
Why do I sigh?
Why do I try to forget?

It must have been that something lovers call ""Fate""
Kept on saying I had to wait
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall till we met

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you",It Had to Be You
Dinah Shore,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?
And so, all else above,
I'm waiting for the man I love.",The Man I Love
Dinah Shore,"Behold the way our fine feathered friend
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent, you are

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?

Dinah Shore,"Come to me my melancholy baby, 
Cuddle up and don't be blue 
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe 
You know dear that I'm in love with you!

Wait until the sun shines through 
Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear 
Or else I shall be melancholy too!

Dinah Shore,"Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day

Dinah Shore,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.
And if my throbbing heart should ever start repeating 
That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You
Dinah Shore,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair

We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

Some part of the evening
And that's the way I live through the day

I had myself a true love, but now he's gone

There maybe a lot of things I miss
A lot of things I don't know
But I do know this, now I ain't got no love

In the evening, in the doorway
While I stand there and wait for his coming
With the house swept and the clothes hung
And a pot on the stove where I had meal

Where is he while I waste the rising newel?
Where is he? Why'd he gone so soon?
Now there ain't no way that it used to be, what now?

And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes 
And there's no such thing as make-believe 
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns

And it don't rain in Indianapolis",Little Green Apples

Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

All the streets were dark and bare.

not one ribbon for her hair.

Why am I sitting alone tonight,
when I could be out where the lights are bright?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.
Why am i wasting these precios years?
Why am I crying these bitter tears?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.

Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers,
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours,
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim.
Jim never tells me I'm his hearts desire.
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him.
Sometimes when I get feeling low,
I say “Let's call it quits.”
Then I hang on and let him go 
Breaking my heart in bits.
Some day I know tht Jim will up and leave me,
But even if he does you can believe me,
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim.

Don't move, why move

It may be crowded

And cling to each other
And you know how one step
Can lead to another

A waltz or fandango
But oh, what can come from
A new fangled tango

You cling to your partner
And sway to the rhythm
You can't lose your partner
'Cause you're right there with him

You don't have to be worry
About fast or slow steps
The nice part about it
In this dance, you don't need steps

You don't have to worry
If your dancing won't do
It's not what you do do
It's more what you don't do

You don't need a waltz
Or a fancy fandango
You just need a man
And a new fangled tango

Forget the fandango

To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan Serenade
Dinah Shore,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die.

Dinah Shore,"Finally found a fella
Almost completely divine
But his vocabulary
Is killin' this romance of mine
We get into an intimate situation
And then begins this Romeo's conversation

He says, ""Murder,"" he says
Ev'ry time we kiss
He says, ""Murder,"" he says
At a time like this
He says, ""Murder,"" he says
Is that the language of love?

He says, ""Solid,"" he says

And my name's Marie
He says, ""Jackson,"" he says

It's my man

And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too

Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

I'm going to place an order in a little flower shop:

Give me one dozen roses
Put my heart in beside them
And send them to the one I love.

She'll be glad to receive them
And I know she'll believe them

do you make the most of your five senses,
Or is your life like Old Mother Hubbard's shelf?
Well, mark this on your slate,
Life is not an empty plate.
That's if you appreciate yourself.

Ev'ry time you're near a rose,
Aren't you glad you've got a nose?
And if the dawn is fresh with dew,
Aren't you glad you're you?
When a meadowlark appears,
Aren't you glad you've got two ears?
And if your heart is singing, too,
Aren't you glad you're you?
You can see a summer sky,
Or touch a friendly hand,
Or taste an apple pie.
Pardon the grammar, but ain't life grand?
And when you wake up each morn,
Aren't you glad that you were born?
Think what you've got the whole day through,
Aren't you glad you're you?",Aren't You Glad You're You

angels were singing a hymn to your charms,

You keep coming back like a song.

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream

At every stop that we made

Dinah Shore,"They say don't change the old for the new
But I've found out this will never do
When you grow old you don't last long
You're here today and then tomorrow you're gone
I loved a man(gal) for many years gone by
I tho't his(her) love for me would never die
He(She) made some changes that would never do
From now on I'm goin' to make some changs too

For there's a change in the weather
There's a change in the sea
So from now on there'll be a change in me
My walk will be diff'rent, my talk and my name
Nothin' about me is goin' to be the same
I'm goin' to change my way of livin' if that ain't enough
Then I'll change the way that I strut my stuff 
'Cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray
There'll be some changes made

They say the old time things are the best
That may be very good for all the rest
But I'm goin' to let the old things be
'Cause they are certainly not suited for me
There was a time when I thought that way
That's why I'm all alone here today
Since ev'ry one of these days seeks something new
From now on I'm goin' to seek some new things too

For there's a change in the weather
There's a change in the sea 
So from now on there'll be a change in me 
Why, my walk will be be different, and my talk and my name 
Nothing about me gonna be the same 
I'm gonna change my way of livin', and that ain't no shock 
Why, I'm thinking of changin' the way I gotta set my clock 
Because nobody wants you when you're old and gray 
There's gonna be some changes made today 
There'll be some changes made",There'll Be Some Changes Made
Dinah Shore,"Love, to a man, is just a thing apart
To take or leave according to his whim
Love, to a woman means her very heart
She only wants to live her life for him.

Maybe he's not much,
Just another man doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man.
She'll just string along all through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way
When a woman loves a man

She'll be the first one to praise him when he's going strong
The last one to blame him when everything's wrong
It's such a one sided game that they play
But women are funny that way.

Tell her she's a fool,
She'll say yes I know but I love him so
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man

Dinah Shore,"Finally found a fella
Almost completely divine
But his vocabulary
Is killin' this romance of mine
We get into an intimate situation
And then begins this Romeo's conversation

He says, ""Murder,"" he says
Ev'ry time we kiss
He says, ""Murder,"" he says
At a time like this
He says, ""Murder,"" he says
Is that the language of love?

He says, ""Solid,"" he says
Takes me in his arms
And says, ""Solid,"" he says
Meanin' all my charms
He says, ""Solid,"" he says
Is that the language of love?

He says, ""Chick, chick, you torture me

Is that the language of love?

He says, ""Hep, hep, with helium
Now babe, we're cookin'""
And other expressions to wit
He says, ""We're in da groove
And da groove is good lookin'""
He sounds like his uppers don't fit

He says, ""Murder""
He says, ""Murder""
And the way he says, ""Murder"" 
In that impossible tone
I've told him over and over and over again
That it'll be nobody else's murder but his own","""Murder"" He Says"
Dinah Shore,"The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself, where is she?
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her

Dinah Shore,"Oh, how we danced on the night we were wed
We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies
Except for the few that were there in your eyes 

Dear, as I held you close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low 
""Darling, I love you so"" 

The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn 
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

Angels were singing a hymn to your charms

Sing the saddest kind o' song

From Natchez to Mobile,
From Memphis to St. Jo,
Wherever the four winds blow,

An' heard me some big talk,

Don't bury me in this prairie
Take me where the cement grows
Let's move down to some big town
Where they love a gal by the cut o' her clothes
And I'll stand out
In buttons and bows
I'll love you in buckskin
Or skirts that I've homespun
But I'll love ya' longer, stronger where
Yer friends don't tote a gun
My bones denounce the buckboard bounce
And the cactus hurts my toes
Let's vamoose where gals keep usin'
Those silks and satins and linen that shows
And I'm all yours in buttons and bows

In high silk hose and peek-a-boo clothes

There's a lady they call the Gypsy
She can look in the future
And drive away all your fears

She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true

Dinah Shore,"Get your veil and get your duster
Get the yen for goggles when the wind's a guster
Keep your Hubbard gown
Firmly belted down
When you're out in your Stanley Steamer
In a gale we never fluster
`Cause we're told we get that old familiar lustre
If you're dressed in style
Ev'ryone will smile
When you're out in your Stanley Steamer
Honk, honk!
Honk, honk, honk!
The donkey used to have his charm
But he's looking at us with alarm
For it looks like he's back to the farm
But if you fail with your combustor
Then your speed is gonna need a new adjuster
And you must be just
Just the one we trust
Or we won't step inside
No, we won't take the ride
That you plan in your Stanley Steamer
That you plan in your Stanley Steamer
In your Stanley Steamer automobile.

Chug, chug, chug, chug,
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
That flat tyre was so unexpected
There she sat alone and rejected
I started to sigh
Then I caught the eye
Of the man in the Stanley Steamer
It began to rain
When along the lane
Came the man in the Stanley Steamer
He was a sight to make me tingle
And a dish to make me glad that I was single
He proposed a ride
So I hopped inside
And away we started in the Stanley Steamer
It was not that she was stupid
Nor the shot she thought she got from Mr Cupid
I just lost my heart
From the very start
To the man in the Stanley Steamer
Honk, honk!
Honk, honk, honk!
The tandem bike has had its day
If you're ridin' one you'll find that they
Poke along in an obsolete way
With all the bright anticipation
Like a child with a wild imagination
And we wanna ride, wanna ride inside
Of the latest motor deal
Wanna sit behind the wheel
With the man in the Stanley Steamer
With the man in the Stanley Steamer
I'm a-nothin' but a dreamer
In your Stanley Steamer

Dinah Shore,"Younger than springtime are you,
Softer than starlight are you;
Warmer than winds of June are the gentle lips you gave me.
Gayer than laughter are you,
Sweeter than music are you;
Angel and lover, heaven and earth,
Are you to me.

And when your youth and joy invade my arms
And fill my heart, as now they do,
Younger than springtime am I,
Gayer than laughter am I,

Am I with you.",Younger Than Springtime

Getting to like you, getting to hope you like me.

You are precisely, 
My cup of tea.

Getting to know you, 
Getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you, 
Getting to know what to say 
Haven't you noticed 
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy 
Because of all the beautiful and new 
Things I'm learning about you 
Day by day.

Sharing your spirit, 
Sharing your tears and your laughter 
Hoping it goes on, 
Hoping it lasts endlessly

You are completely,

Telling you my dreams, 
Getting to feel that you're with me

Dinah Shore,"Whenever I feel afraid,
I hold my head erect
And whistle a happy tune,
So no-one will suspect
I'm afraid.

While shiverin' in my shoes,
I strike a careless pose
And whistle a happy tune,
So no-one ever knows
I'm afraid.

The result of this deception
Is very strange to tell,
For when I fool the people I fear,
I fool myself as well!

I whistle a happy tune,
And evey single time
The happiness in that tune
Convinces me that I'm
Not afraid.

Make believe you're brave
And the trick will take you far;
You may be as brave
As you make believe you are!

You may be as brave

Dinah Shore,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture

The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Never taste what we took for granted
No they don't know love at all

And so cynical from the pain

It was a quiet night
And I would be alright
If I could go on sleeping.

But every morning'
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today.
You see it your way,
And I see it mine,
But we both see it slippin' away.

You know, we always had each other, baby.
I guess that wasn't enough.
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.
Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love.
Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love.",The Best of My Love
Dinah Shore,"Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Sometimes when I go too high
You pull the string that holds me back
If not for you I might lose track and

Fly away oh I must fly away
And go my own way
To places that we've never been together
I might fly away
Take to the sky someday
But for now
Not today
Cause nobody here is flyin'

You have reasons I have dreams
So we're perfect so it seems
You tell fortunes

I don't worry
I don't think

Dinah Shore,"Don't look so sad, I know it's over.
But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning.
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together.
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning.

Lay your head on my pillow.
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
Hear the whisper of the raindrops,
Blowin' soft against the window,
And make believe you love me one more time,
For the good times.

I'll get along; you'll find another,
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me.
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever,
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me.

How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had

the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay

Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone

Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
At being alive
Tracing a line till we can define

Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me

Still I had wished I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me

Dinah Shore,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues

It would bore me terrifically, too.

The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.

That he'll appear

I'll do my best to make him stay

And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him

Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame

Just because I'm in misery
I don't beg for no sympathy
But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
Please send me someone to love

Show the world how to get along
Peace will enter when hate is gone
But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love

And never get love

Dinah Washington,"Every girl is a beautiful girl,
When you're a stranger in town.
And every chick looks so cute and slick,
When you're all alone and all down.

Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

This heart of mine was doing very well.
The world was fine as far as I could tell.
And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

This heart of mine is gayly dancing now.
I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

You're increasingly sweet
So whenever we happened to meet, I greet you

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start

That a song such as ours came to be?

And these stars will not twinkle and fade out
And the words in my ears
Will resound for the rest of my years

In the morning, I find with delight
Not a note of our music is played out
It will be just as sweet

Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear

Lord, what a difference a day makes

Find romance on your menu

And as I walked through the dreary streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low and it had me down

For, suddenly, I saw you  standing there

Dinah Washington,"Although I know I'm doing wrong
My love for you is still going strong
I feel that heartbreak you will only bring
So why do I let it keep on lingering?

To watch my love make his retreat
Deep within my heart I weep
My heart should be learning how to sing
Instead of merely waiting and lingering

It's by myself I'm walking
It's by myself I'm talking
My heart knows it's too incomplete

It's only in my dreams I find
The kind of man I have in mind
So each day I face a new defeat

So by myself I'm dancing
Still in my mind I'm chancing
That this illusion will not end in tears

Maybe morning leaves him waiting
And perhaps relating that without me
There are only empty years",Lingering
Dinah Washington,"On the day I was born said my father, said he
I've an elegant legacy waiting for ye
'Tis a rhyme for your lips and a song for your heart
To sing whenever the world falls apart

Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hill and stream
Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow who follows a dream
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow
Follow the fellow who follows a dream

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child
Oh, the lure of that song kept her feet running wild
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free
To the east with the lark, To the west with the sea
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes",Look to the Rainbow
Dinah Washington,"I don't want a mountain of diamonds
And a valley of gold wouldn't do
But if you want to make me happy
Just make me a present of you

I don't need a desert of rubies
Or an ocean of pearls to swim through
But if you wanna make me happy
Just make me a present of you

What good is a girl with a million?
What good if the world calls you Queen?
If you don't have someone to love you

Dinah Washington,"Will I ever find the boy in my mind
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Will I recognize the light in his eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass him by
And never even know that he is my ideal?

Or maybe he's a dream, and yet he might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Dinah Washington,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Something here inside cannot be denied, oh no

They said, ""Someday you'll find
All who are love are blind""

Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love

Love me much too much
If you let me go
Life would lose its touch

What would I be without you?
There's no place for me without you

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress my world was overturned
At the very start, all my bridges burned
By my flaming heart you'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

Never let me go
Never let me go

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away

By my flaming heart you'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

Dinah Washington,"Perdido, I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero: 'Let's meet for a sweet fietsa'
High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero
High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido, that yearning telude
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
The day the fiesta started
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
That's when my heart departed
It's perdido

Dinah Washington,"Relax, Max
Your nerves are just like jumpin' jacks, Max
Your heart is thumpin' with a crazy sound

Dinah Washington,"Judge you wanna hear my plea, before you open up your court

Someone's invading my dream.
We were sailing along,
So peaceful and calm,
Suddenly something went wrong.

Someone's rocking my dreamboat,
Disturbing the beautiful dream.
It's a mystery to me,
This mutiny at sea,
Who can it be?

A friendly breeze gave us a start
To a paradise of our own.
All at once a storm blew us apart

I'm captain without any crew.
But with love as my guide,
I'll follow the tide,
I'll keep sailing 'til I find you.

Dinah Washington,"Somewhere along the line
You met this heart of mine
Would you unwind it?
Now you would shun it over a glass of wine

Friends knew it all the time
That no wedding bells would chime
I was just a young dreamer, no match for a schemer
Yours was a lover's crime

Folks gossiped--they said it was too good to be true
They even bet you'd search for someone new
This pendent world of ours was paradise
And I was blind by the star dust in my eyes

While you like gambler with his last dime
I know you will try it one more time
But I prayed like Napoleon Bonaparte
You'll meet your Waterloo somewhere along the line
Somewhere along the line",Somewhere Along the Line

Alone, alone on a night that was meant for love

Alone, alone with your kiss that could make me care

To find you in someone else's arms
Well, what could I do or what could I say?
But do you really want it that way?

If being untrue meant that much to you
I'm certain our love has lost its charm
Oh, how could you be unfair to me?
Do you really want it that way?

My love was so blind; my heart lost its smile
How hopeless it all seem to be
You nearly destroyed the love we enjoyed

If I had it  in  my power,
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms;

Dinah Washington,"The song is ended
But the melody lingers on

But practically everything leaves me totally cold.
The exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree,
Fighting vainly the old ennui,
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face.

I get no kick from champagne.
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some, they may go for cocaine.
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too.
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me.
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me.

I get no kick in a plane.
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do.
Yet I get a kick, um you give me a boot

Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away

This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I grow lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me"
Dinah Washington,"My devotion
Is endless and deep as the ocean
And like a star shining from afar
Remains forever the same

Oh, my devotion
Is not just a sudden emotion
It will be constantly burning
And your love will kindle the flame

What a sweet beginning
To the dream I had planned
All I own is yours alone
Your wish is my command

And this sensation
Was never a mere fascination
Here in my heart, one sweet day, it started
Then with time improved my devotion to you

Here in my heart, one sweet day, it started
Then with time improved my devotion to you",My Devotion
Dinah Washington,"This bitter earth
Well, what a fruit it bears
What good is love
Mmh, that no one shares?
And if my life is like the dust
Ooh, that hides the glow of a rose
What good am I?
Heaven only knows

Oh, this bitter earth
Yes, can it be so cold?
Today you're young
Too soon you're old
But while a voice
Within me cries
I'm sure someone
May answer my call
And this bitter earth, ooh
May not, oh be so bitter after all",This Bitter Earth
Dinah Washington,"All or nothing at all
Half-love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in-between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been?
No, I'd rather have nothing at all

But, please, don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
So, you see, I've got to say
No, no, no, all or nothing at all",All Er Nothin'
Dinah Washington,"He would spend it on the ponies
He would spend it on the girls
Buy his mother gin and roses
For her poor old hennaed curls
And when his wife said, ""Hey now
What did you get for me?""
He socked her in the chopper
Such a sweet, sweet guy was he

[Chorus]
And her tears flowed like wine
Yes, her tears flowed like wine
She's a real sad tomato
She's a busted valentine
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind

How he loved the old race horses
He would bet them every day
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay
He indulged in fancy spending
Ordered rings, cars, and furs
But alas, alack
Like a stab in the back
She found out they were not hers

[Chorus]

He got mixed up with a Maisie
He got mixed up with a Flo
So Flo shoved him in the river
He'll not get mixed up no more
His wife then draped herself in black
That showed her figure fine
Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy
No insurance could she find

[Chorus]",And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine
Dinah Washington,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me

Dinah Washington,"I'm just about as solitary
As anyone could be
Of course my life is not so merry
But that's all right with me

No love, no nothin'
Until my baby comes home
No sir, no nothin'
As long as baby must roam
I promised him I'd wait for him
Till even Hades froze
I'm lonesome, Heaven knows
But what I said still goes

No love, no nothin'
And that's a promise I'll keep
No fun with no one
I'm getting plenty of sleep
My heart's on strike
And though it's like an empty honeycomb
No love, no sir, no nothin'
Till my baby comes home

My heart's on strike

No love, no sir, no nothin'
Till my baby comes home

Till my baby comes home","No Love, No Nothin'"
Dinah Washington,"You've seen him up and down the avenue
And now he's wearing the navy blue
She had a tear in the corner of her eye
As he said his last goodbye

Shoo, shoo, baby
Shoo, shoo, baby
Bye, bye, bye, baby
Your papa's off to the seven seas

Don't cry, baby
Don't sigh, baby
Bye, bye, bye, baby
When I come back, we'll live a life of ease

Seems kinda tough now
To say goodbye this way
But papa's gotta be rough now
So that he can be sweet to you another day

Bye, baby
Don't cry, baby
Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby
Your papa's off to the seven seas

Bye, bye, bye, baby
Don't cry, my baby
Shoosh, baby

Dinah Washington,"When it rained five days
And the skies turned dark at night
When it rained five days
And the skies turned dark at night
There was trouble takin' place
In the lowland at night

I woke up this mornin'
Couldn't even get out of my door
I woke up this mornin'
Couldn't even get out of my door
Enough trouble to make a poor woman
Wonder where she's gonna go

They rowed a little boat
About five miles across the farm
Said they rowed a little boat
About five miles across the farm
I packed up all of my clothes, trowed them in
And they rowed me along

Where it thundered and lightnin'
And the wind began to blow
Said it thundered and lightnin'
And the wind began to blow
There was thousands of people
They had no place to go

I went out and stood up
On a high old lonesome hill
I went out and stood up
On a high old lonesome hill
I looked down on the house
Where I used to live

Back water blues that calls me
To pack my things and go
Back water blues that calls me
To pack my things and go
'Cause my house fell down
And I can't live there no more

Ooh, I can't live there no more
There ain't no place for a poor woman to go",Backwater Blues [Live]

And I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, I say

I say I'll go through fire
And I'll go through fire
As he wants it, so it will be
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, you see

Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The difficult I'll do right now
The impossible will take a little while
I say I'll care forever
And I mean forever
If I have to hold up the sky
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love am I",Crazy He Calls Me
Dinah Washington,"When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet

On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk, I go to work

Love for sale, appetizing young love for sale

Love that's only slightly soiled, love for sale

Who's prepared to pay the price, for a trip to paradise?

Dinah Washington,"The leaves of brown came tumblin' down, remember
In September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember

The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain
Though spring is here, to me it's still September

You say you love me and you hold me tight
But when I awake, you're out of sight
Darn that dream

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit skies
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that crazy one track, mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Without that dream, I never would have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true

Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

And that ain't good

Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

We pray some, and sin some

That's just how I'll guard our love, so love me

Please, love me
If it's the last thing I do, I'll take your hand

Dinah Washington,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Dinah Washington,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still

And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart",That Old Feeling
Dinah Washington,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Dinah Washington,"If you can't say that you still love me
Don't tell me no lies when you call
If you can't say that you still need me
Then why say anything at all?

If you can't say that you're sorry
For all the tears you caused to fall
If you can't tell my heart is breaking
Then why say anything at all?

It's better not to speak a word
If those claims of love cause you pain
It's better not to let it be heard
Those lies you tell in vain

So, if you can't say I'm still your baby

You old gloomy sight

The way you're acting lately, it makes me doubt
You is still my baby, baby
But it seems like my flame in your heart done gone out

That has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You'll find that he's gone and made a change

Well, maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true?

Now is you is or is you ain't my baby?

What they appear to be
And I don't want to happen to you
What happened to me

Listen, There are no words that can describe, what I felt inside
When I found out the man I loved loved another guy
We were at a party, Ohh to have a little fun
But when I looked around my-my man was missing
I walked outside, I couldn't believe my eyes
He was in Bill's arms breathin hard and french kissin

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

Bill has been to my house a thousand times
He and my man would go camping and fishing
Oh I tell you it never crossed my mind
Bill was a friend and he was God Uncle to my only son
Now it looks Uncle Billy wants to be his step-mom

Now you see I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
How do a woman compete with a man for another man

I asked my man why didnt you tell me that you were gay
when you knew, knew I build my world around you
I knew I had those feelings and I didn't want it to be
I thought by being with you, Girl I thought it would change
As tears came to my eyes, hesays I'm sorry I hurt you so
I got to pack Bill is waiting for me and I got to go

I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man
Thank you for using Top40db.com.

I don't feel ashame and I don't take the blame
My man was just a queen, he was a Queen that thought he was a King
He told before he left he said
I know you're hurt and oh I know you're mad
But if that's not asking too much,
could you tell my son I love him and I'm still his dad

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane

I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?

To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,

If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?

And the big bag of leaves was getting old

Dinosaur Jr.,"Turning towards a time so free
Justice has finally escaped
The dripping words of yesterday
Set my feeble mind astray
I yearn to see
The glow of her eyes as I appear
A sign of satisfaction
Could be the sweetest sound
The staircase has one too many steps

I love the caterpillars
Munching on the leaves
Pitter patter
Makes me forget my disease
Bugs have feelers just like me
And I'm feelin' oh so lonely
Disturbed in every sense of grace
The lady wouldn't give me a taste
Of the joy that means that much
It lives within her touch

I would love to hold you tonight
Even if we just pretend
Why won't you be my friend

By the shoreline, will you be fine
Or will it cover you
And when you taste it, do you embrace it
What will you let it do

We grab a look across the water
We grab a smile and then you're gone a while
With you it'd be across the water
When I'm losing it I like your style

By the shoreline, will you be fine
Or will it cover you
And when you taste it, do you embrace it
What will you let it do to you

Come on, baby!
Drive me out of my mind
If I come home alone with you
And see what you do

This is crazy
And nothing more I want to see
Is that the safest place to sit
And be so spacey


Scary things across the water
You'd never know
Till they have their way with you
You won't catch me deep in the water
However much I wanna play with you

Don't stay in long
No one's that strong
Enough not to crumble
Whenever the water wants you

Don't be so crazed
I'm just tryin' to save
You from losing everything you've got
This is no time to rot

Don't be fooled by
All the coolness rushing by
Don't let it grab your mind
Pull out now or you will find

All you strive for
Nothing, gone, no more

You're his servant now",Water
Dinosaur Jr.,"Hey babe, 
Where'd you go 
Just left it sitting in the road 
You can drape it all over your room 
Sit back and let it shower you 
Left it, hoping you'd see it, and wanted to stay

Long as I come away 
Something you'll dig tomorrow

Hope it makes it up for all I lack

When your hair hits the ceiling

I won't cry if you walk by
But if we both kind of stumble
Maybe I'll say hi that's my best
I never try that much
'Cause I'm scared of feeling
That appealing touch

You gotta get through
My maze and pass every test
'Cause I'm choosin' one love
Tattooed across my chest

Know the time has come
I ain't gonna fester no more
Let the world be free of my disease
I never knew a rubber doll
Would be so hard to please

Now I'm preachin' out
One last burst before I retract
No one will know
'Til I finally let go of the one thing
I ain't never going to give back

I want to help you, baby, can't you see
You're better than my pillow?
'Cause you don't stain so easily
You know it's hard just to finally let go

And leave all the pictures behind
Hope I brought you some happiness
I believe I just had to get on
'Cause just wasn't a world
I wished to need to find

Teeth scrape on the last remaining fossil
I wanna to crumble but instead I slit

Dinosaur Jr.,"The rain has washed my dog with fear
A question people think, I call a friend
And the next wave is valentine

See yourself call, no big deal
Ever since that's not a fear
Wishin' the lamp would shine
And beam me at it, give me some fuel

Find a way, to clog it up alone
Terrified, the way you stand
Feeling natural behind the phone

Rain has fallen, the tree does cry and [unverified]
And the toads are running free and [unverified]

It's no fun to that's what stinks
Bought a carrot and still can't see
You know I've been waiting for 6 years
For a ray of hope, leaves me a float

Then I could believe in sunshine
In the winter time, mountains glow
There's always so much to adore
There's a little scenic picture on my skull

See the second building, imagine
Where'd you go, all I wanna know baby

Does it float? Does it float? Does it float?
Does it float? Does it float? Does it float?
Does it float? Does it float? Does it float?
Does float, why? Does it float? Does it float?

Safest to wallow in my own esteem
Afraid, stick my neck out

I'm a leper scared beyond this feeling
I dare to escape

I try to reach for you.  but you have closed my mind
Whatever happened to our love?  I wish I understood
It used to be so nice.  It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?

Dinu Bomba,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.

Those feelings we can't put aside.

Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.

And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls

And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road

You'll feel the rush of it all

Flying away int the clouds
You know you're loosing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul

You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow

You can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're

Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle

Dio,"She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white

Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail

When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail

You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy

Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within

And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin

So I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen

Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the light

So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right

So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean",Gypsy
Dio,"If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for me

In the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there

She had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And the the light, the answer right
Inside her coming down

It said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away

He was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in momma's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said

You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible

Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door

So you can go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible

And go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible

I said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
I disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away",Invisible

When you've tried, do they hide, deep inside

Tell a little truth with many lies

How can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay

Dio,"It has been a thousand years since the once powerful
planet of Blessing lost its life-giving two suns, and
countless millennia since the days of the great
magicians. An expedition of alien voyagers came upon
the now ice-covered sphere, drawn there by an
unexplained lone beacon far below the miles of frozen
moisture, they unlocked a written history of Blessing
from its almost undiscovered tomb. So begins the story
of Magica.

It was a time of celebration. The Book of Magica and
the wizards who had used its spells so wisely for the
good of the people were being honored in all the great
cities of the world. There was however an exception.
Where good thrives, evil survives and evil has plans
for survival.

The celebration of thanks and prosperity would signal
the forces of Evilsyde to begin the attack and
ultimate capture and destruction of Magica. The spells
from the Book would be used to turn all of those
unwilling to join Evilsyde into statues of stone and
send their spirits to Otherworld, where they would
eventually be assimilated into the energy needed to
drive Evilsyde, and maintain its power without the
necessity of the Book and its incantations forever.

Defenses were naturally relaxed during the festive
preparations and although the battle was well-fought
by both factions, the minions of the dark prevailed.
Their assault was well-planned and executed to a
fault. After overwhelming their initial opposition,
they pushed on to the sacred ground upon which the
Book of Magica rested. They possessed a much weaker
form of magic themselves, and although it would be
normally quite useless against the strength of Magica,
the inability of the Wizards to gather themselves
together in time, coupled with the perfect timing and
determination of the attackers, spelled doom for the
Book and its followers.

The leader of the insurrection was the high priest and
executioner known as Shadowcast. His presence could
make the naughtiest of children become obedient and
inspire great fear among the adult population. This
man, most vile, would now be ruler of all and
answerable to none. His reign would plunge Blessing
into eternal darkness and prepare the way for the
coming of his master, Astoroth, the Grand Duke of Hell.

The capture of Magica did not, however, mean that
Shadowcast had finally reached his goal. He must now
find and conquer Blessing's Grand Wizard and legendary
hero, Eriel. Eriel, who defeated Evilsyde time and
again with his understanding and use of Magica's
spells. He would be the last stumbling block of total
domination.

Eriel had removed himself from the general population
in anticipation of everlasting peace and now he
devoted all of his energy to meditation and praise of
his God. Lately though, he had been visited by many
temptations in his dreams. Promises of pleasure,
riches and power raced through his sleeping mind. All
these lures had been placed there by Shadowcast,
hoping to avoid confrontation between this dominant
man and his own villainous forces. Eriel however had
resisted these solicitations and was now warned of
some impending danger. He managed to make his way to
the sacred ground by cloaking his identity with simple
spells, only to be discovered just before his attempt
to rescue the Book of Magica, but not before he was
able to memorize the most important of Magica's
charms, The spell of Restoration.

The ceremony of thanksgiving was now directed toward
the transmission of spirits to Otherworld. One by one
the good souls of Blessing were turned to stone and
sent on to their grisly fate, until only the noble
Eriel remained. The spectacle that followed was meant
to degrade Eriel and raise the courage of the cowardly
supplicants of Evilsyde, but true to his
indominantable bearing, he promised to return and
banish Evilsyde forever. Then he was gone.

The horrors of Otherworld are now revealed to the
masses huddled together for some small measure of
comfort. First the adults were separated from their
children amid cries and pleas for help. Next the old
ones were taken away and assigned to a place very near
the assimilation site. They were guarded by monstrous,
misshapen denizens of this shrouded netherland, who
constantly harangued the inmates with promises of pain
and extermination. Intermittent bursts of flame shot
up from jagged cracks in the ground, threatening to
consume anyone in its path. Shrieks of torment could
be heard piercing the murky atmosphere, further
unnerving the petrified captives. Only one seemed
unaffected by all the inflicted fear and turmoil.

Eriel's strength and determination soon pacified the
men and women with whom he was confined. When they all
became more calm and subdued, he began to speak to
them softly as an adult to his children. ""Long ago you
entrusted me to protect the Book of Magica and to be
faithful to its special purpose. It must seem that I
have failed you and condemned us all to oblivion, but
fear not! This hell is only a test of your faith and
resolve. The power of Magica did not vanish in fire.
On the third day I will evoke the spell of
Restoration. United we shall return to Blessing and,
armed with the strength of Magica, we will be
triumphant. Many will perish, but Magica and our souls
cannot be restored until three days have passed. Take
heart my friends. Victory awaits you.""

Even magic has its limitations and as Eriel explained
to his flock, the spell could not be activated until a
waiting period of at least three days. One third of
the souls of Blessing would be melded into the
Evilsyde collective before Eriel could be effective
with the words of Restoration.

The old ones were the first to go. Cries of
encouragement and hope were shouted to the condemned
as they trudged slowly to their fate. One by one they
were thrown into the assimilation chamber where a
blinding blue spark gave evidence of their demise.
With each burst Eriel's heavy heart ached with guilt
for his part in this slaughter of his charges. If only
he had not become so complacent. He above
all should never have let this tragedy transpire.

In the compound holding the young adults, an
insurrection of sorts was occurring. A boy of
seventeen years called Challis was urging an uprising
among his captured companions. Futile though it was,
it earned Challis a place in the cell adjoining
Eriel's. His rantings and ravings were soon quelled by
Eriel's quiet urging and the two settled into serious
conversation. Eriel knew his time of assimilation was
near and only hoped it would not be scheduled before
the three day waiting period for Restoration was
ended. Shadowcast wanted to personally oversee Eriel's
termination but couldn't abandon his duties on Blessing
until all was secure.Would there be enough time?

Eriel realized some of his own strong qualities in
Challis and decided that this was an opportunity not
to be lost. He instructed Challis to remove all anger
from his mind and hate from his heart. Only the pure
could receive and transmit this most important of
spells. Convinced that this young man was ready, he
joined with his spirit and gave him these words.
""Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna,"" Words that would
resurrect the masses if delivered correctly and in time.

Over two days had passed before Shadowcast was ready
for travel to Otherworld to deliver Eriel to his fate.
His journey through Otherworld was marked by what
could pass for cheers, if they weren't shouted from
the mouths of utterly inhuman shapes and forms. Upon
his arrival he instructed the guards to take him
straight to Eriel. Once there he announced with great
satisfaction that he would personally supervise
Eriel's execution in a matter of hours. Nearby,
Challis loudly voiced his objection to this treatment
of his newly met hero and was rewarded by kicks and
punches until he could no longer speak. Eriel's heart
sank. Had he misjudged Challis and entrusted his
people's future to a reckless youth? Eriel's mind
wandered to his own younger days. He too had been
restless and foolhardy, but in time had outgrown these
traits and become the adored leader of Blessing. He
wondered if Challis had yet experienced love. Eriel
himself had turned his back on the beautiful and
innocent Annica. She was his intended from birth, but
he couldn't let love for this saintly child cloud his
duties to Blessing and the Book.

One hour remained in the wait for Restoration. Eriel's
hopes were soaring. Surely Shadowcast would fail once
again. But as that thought surfaced, so did Evilsyde's
dark leader. Eriel was led away with head held high,
but as he passed Challis he gave just the slightest
nod. A gesture that wasn't lost on the youth. Eriel
was then taken to the assimilation chamber and
strapped to the cross-like structure in the middle of
the room. Seconds were all that stood in the way of
resurrection or destruction. Shadowcast walked to
Eriel, presumably to gloat one last time to his old
nemesis. Eriel welcomed the time that would be wasted,
but at the last moment Shadowcast seemed to reconsider
and raised his arm in signal for the end to begin. The
arm dropped and, with crackle and hiss, Eriel was no
more. Shadowcast and his minions erupted with joy.
Never again to be slaves. Now to be masters.

Challis heard the cheering and knew that Eriel had
passed without time to summon the spell. Now only he
could influence the future. He heard the rattling of
armor and realized they were coming for him. Soon the
guards appeared and dragged the struggling Challis
from his confinement. One of his jailers struck him a
mighty blow across the face and suddenly all his anger
left him. He was sure of what he must do. Thunder
starts from silence and he would be thunder.

Challis was taken to the chamber and secured to the
cross. Shadowcast approached him and asked if he had
any last thing to say before assimilation. Challis
smiled and said he did. Then with an evil laugh,
Shadowcast raised his arm and announced that his
question was only a final killing joke. It was now or
never. As the arm fell in signal, Challis shouted out
the spell: ""Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna"" and all
hell actually broke loose. Challis and the good folk
of Blessing were bathed in an incredible rush of
light. Shadowcast and all his wicked throng writhed in
agony in the darkness they were spawned from, as the
fierce illumination sought them out and consumed each
troll, ogre and gargoyle in a horrible melting frenzy.
Shadowcast, hiding in the last black space to be
found, watched the light creep irresistibly toward
him. At the last moment he cloaked his body with his
unpriestly robe and muttered what sounded like an oath
as the light touched the cloth. The robe erupted into
flame and then there was nothing. Surely Shadowcast
was also consumed by fire! But that tale would not yet
be told. Now as each remaining citizen of Blessing was
transported instantly back to their home, they found
themselves standing among thousands of recognizable
stone statues. These monuments represented their
fallen comrades and would ever be a lasting testament
to the dangers of evil and the power of Magica.

Now came the time of mourning. Funeral pyres
brightened the night sky for weeks and songs of sorrow
could be heard across the land long after the flames
had sputtered and died. When the prolonged periods of
grieving had ended, the citizens and their council
directed attention to the task of anointing a new
leader and protector of the restored Book of Magica.
The choice seemed a simple one. Challis had
resurrected the populace and the Book, but many
questioned his youth and inexperience.

The debate raged on as the time of choosing approached.
The candidates were summoned to the sacred
place. Eloquent speeches were made on behalf of them
all. Only Challis lacked a champion and it seemed
certain that he would be passed over. ""Will anyone
speak for the boy?"" asked the council. The question
was greeted by silence as the judges turned away to
cast their votes. Then the quiet was broken. A
handsome woman with golden hair, now flecked with
traces of gray, spoke: ""Challis must be chosen. This
is the secret I have carried with me for all these
years. Although I was once rebuffed by my only true
love, Eriel, our brief union produced the young man
standing before you. Eriel was never to know that he
had sired this free spirit, but he will live on
through his son's achievements if you now find him
worthy."" So spoke Annica, mother of Challis.

The decision was now reached quickly. Annica's
revelation left little doubt in the minds of the
councillors that Challis should indeed succeed his
father. Evilsyde had been defeated, Shadowcast was
hopefully destroyed, Challis had been chosen to lead
his people and, despite the huge number of casualties,
the old way of life began again. But, evil does not
easily die. Shadowcast did indeed survive and persist
in his attempts to challenge and conquer Blessing.

Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and on

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh well

And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh no

Fool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer

So get a good hold, yeah

Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know
So let it all go!

Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!

Night time sorrow, taken like a pain
Black will not become a white, it's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!

Dio,"One night when the stars were right
For the gypsy queen
And she found she could drog you down
To a place that's in - between it all she's a
Madman with a delicate hand and evil eyes
And I've heard she'll only say a word
And that's enough to satisfy

Don't ask why
Don't even think about it
Brave men die
But what a way to go

She's not above
Death by love

One spell from the wishing well
And you're nevermore
Bad start for the sacred heart
Cause the end has come before the beginning

Knee deep in the darkest sleep
But the eyes see all
So high you could break the sky
And never feel the fall to come

Strong men die
But what a way to go

She's not above
Death by love

Don't ask why
Don't even think about it
Brave men die
But what a way to go

You've got symptoms of

Dio,"If I could sleep at night
Then somehow I'd see
Why everything's wrong
Or maybe it's just me
Does anybody know this place that I'm in
Why I might be alone
Imagination is a terrible thing
What if I'm wrong
But here's what I've been thinking
It must be the end of the world

What ever happened to the rock and roll song
Breaking your brain
Making you stronger
They say you never hear the bullet that kills
And I don't hear a sound

It's not about a change or revolution
What's gone today is still called substitution

Don't get emotional but we're out of time
The melody's gone
And fools have got the sunshine
If I'm mistaken and I see you again
Don't leave me alone
Maybe tomorrow
Could be the end of the world

Don't waste time
Call the ones you hate
You'd say I'm sorry but they'll have to wait

Dio,"Oh no - they're at it again
Looking inside my secrets
Coming through cracks before I mend the wall

Get out - cause you're breaking the law
How did you ever find me
Places where I can hide can't get much smaller

I have invisible dreams
Where no one can touch me
Maybe I'll find a way to disappear

No one moves - and no one dies
Just the eyes

I've run as fast as I can
Thinking they'll never catch me
What a waste of breath a waste of time

Feel like digging a hole
Going in even deeper
Maybe they just can't see what just can't shine

I'll be lost - so no goddbyes
If no one moves then nothing dies
Just the eyes

Oh no - they've done it again
Sending out the detectives
Searching for signs of life and that means me

In my invisible dreams
When no one is watching
I'd make the whole world blind and I'd be free

I'll be lost - so no replies
If no one looks then no one dies
Just the eyes
Those eyes

Magic numbers
Even sacrifice
I can't find a way
Cause nothing stops the eyes",The Eyes

Knocking at a door
That I've been through before

Now I've become the cat

I Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am - stronger without you

Silence isn't gold

And when I become the cat
I'll always let you know that

I Am I Am - stronger than the wind

I Am I Am - brighter than the sun

One more for the road gimme the same again

Well I've never been here before
And the room is really empty
But there's a big line waiting for the show
Nice day for an execution
Another wrong conclusion
But someone's got to pay so let's burn

One more for the road same again

There's a child who just sees evil
And a man who just loves pain
But I've heard that we can't save them

Dio,"Now that my dreams have gone dead
I see them burning in the fire
Just like the words that I've said
Ashes turned to ashes once again

Look for a sign in the air
A light that dances in the sky
Maybe you'll see it somewhere
Oh, shining like a diamond
Promising that hope will never die

I might know the answer
Well, it's back there in my brain
Someday soon I'll be rising again
Higher than the sun

I have been father and son
I cry for children of the night
Just because tears have begun
Beware of quiet voices
Thunder comes from silence - I am light

Oh, look for a sign, is it me
No don't believe with only eyes
Speak to the blind 'cause they see
Truth is just a circle
Spinning round until it meets the lies
Then dies

You'll be caught in the middle of the madness 
Just lost like them 
And part of all the pain that they feel, yeah

There's a storm on the edge of the sky
Does it matter
Well it does to me, and I can tell you why

You know when there's thunder, there should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right? 
No he can play the fool

It's always a mystery, not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery, just like you and me

I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear, but they always shine

Dio,"Sing me a song, you're a singer

The lover of life's not a sinner

Fool, fool

Oh uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and on

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh well

And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh no

Fool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer

Look for the answer

Diogo Nogueira,"Bem-vinda seja a paz de volta ao nosso lar
Depois de tanto guerrear o amor venceu
Mais que um sonho eu não posso acreditar
Abre a porta, pode entrar
Vem ver que nada que foi nosso se perdeu

Pra que brigar
E tentar se desfazer de um amor
Que o bem querer tratou de erguer e defender
Que bom te ver, esta luz no seu olhar
Hoje há de me guiar pra eu acordar nos braços teus

E quando acordar
Quero te amar do jeito que sempre te amei
Matar a saudade que o tempo deixou no meu peito
Tirar esse nó garganta

O amor que apesar das barreiras nunca foi desfeito",Amor Imperfeito
Diogo Nogueira,"Feito dois prisioneiros, escravos da emoção
Não controlamos mais o próprio coração
E pra gente saber se a chama é verdadeira
Alimente o prazer, põe lenha na fogueira
Vai saber de onde vem o amor
Pra saber de onde vem a dor
Toda vez que o sim vence o não
Nasce uma paixão poderosa
Haja coração, sensação maravilhosa

Mergulhado de corpo inteiro
Nada de ilusão
Quero um lance verdadeiro",Vai Saber

A terra desabar
E o tempo nos mudar
Irei estar sempre aqui

Se a idade não perdoar
E quando não me ouvires cantar
Eu não sairei daqui

Se tu pensas em mim
Como penso em ti
Temos tudo então
Pra poder voltar ao sonho outra vez
Se tu dizes que sim
Sei por onde seguir
Que esperamos pra querer voltar a ser só tu e eu

Se o brilho acabar
E um dia for demais para dar
E o nosso olhar não se cruzar
Ficarei por aqui
Mas o amor já nos deixou
E o mundo desabou
Mas o tempo não mudou
O que foste para mim

Se tu pensas em mim
Como eu penso em ti
Temos tudo então
Pra poder voltar ao sonho outra vez
Se tu dizes que sim
Sei por onde seguir
Que esperamos pra querer voltar a ser só tu e eu
Só tu e eu
Só tu e eu

E mostramos depois
Que nada se constrói
Sem que antes tenhas
Errado ao tentar

Se tu pensas em mim

Lo mala que tú has sido conmigo

El mismo que hoy día te tengo, después de tanto tiempo 
Por que has tallado el ejemplo de la madre de Jesús 
Que por medio de una luz, él fue engendrado en su vientre

Diómedes Díaz,"Yo sentí en el final del sendero 
El llanto infinito de una mujer 
Que empuñaba un poema en sus manos 
Escrito por alguien que un día conoció 
Era aquel habitante del mundo 
Del alma sensible que quiso tener 
El amor que le fue un imposible 
Y al ver su destino su vida acabó 

Nadie sabe quien tuvo la culpa 
Ella nunca le pudo entregar lo que estaba pidiendo 
Un poquito de cariño, así fuera un instante 
Y aunque quiso, nunca le obedeció el corazón 

Y hoy cantan 
Versos solitarios que nacen de un hombre 
Que se fue volando 
Con alas hechas de ilusiones 
Que no realizó

Dónde está (en el cielo tal vez)
Un amor (señaló su final)
Dónde está (en el cielo tal vez)
Un amor (señaló su final)

Yo encontré en el final del sendero 
Los sueños caídos de aquel corazón 
Que en su afán de encontrar ilusiones 
Sufrió mil engaños tratando de amar 

Y ahora ella recuerda a aquel hombre 
Que puso en sus manos aquella canción 
Y quisiera entregarle su alma 
Pero ya es muy tarde, la cruz fue el final 

Yo no sé si es valiente o cobarde 
La fatal decisión de borrar con su sangre las penas 
Que llegaron por mirar a alguien inalcanzable 
Que no sabe que le ofrecen la felicidad 

Y hoy cuentan que tenía en sus manos 
La foto sagrada de aquella muchacha 
Y un verso a unos ojos negros que nunca cantó

Diómedes Díaz,"Ay qué culpa tengo yo que no hubiera nacido
Qué culpa tengo yo que no hubiera nacido
En una cuna hermosa con varillas de oro
Mis padres son tan pobres que nadita han tenido
Los tuyos son tan ricos y te han dado de todo

Yo soy un hombre humilde de casta provinciana
Que lucho con pujanza por la superación
Nací en la cuna triste que tú desde tu cumbre
La miras con desprecio y rechazas con fervor

Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela
Cuna qué destino te ha tocado
Eres un poema de tristeza
Eres cual un niño regañado
Que sólo llorando se consuela

Ay mi vida siempre ha sido humilde y peregrina
Mi vida siempre ha sido humilde y peregrina
Como aquel campesino sólo tengo esperanza
De demostrarle al mundo que un hombre con orgullo
Es capaz de vencer los fieros que lo atacan
Por eso me perfilo como en son de justicia
Buscando con ellos una gran realidad
Porque no es el destino quien va a mermar mi vida
Ni voy a se' el vencido sino el que vencerá

Cuna qué destino te ha tocado

Eres cual un niño regañado

Diómedes Díaz,"Ven espera un momento
Porque yo me merezco alguna explicación
Pensé que era imposible que este amor se acabará
Pero ya se acabó

Por favor vuelve ahora
Que si tú no lo haces
Yo pase lo que pase
Allá iré a detenerte

Te diviertes al verme morir
Suplicando tu amor
Sabes que no soy nadie sin ti
Y hoy me dices adiós

Nunca pero nunca en la vida esperé aquel adiós
Que me duele en el alma, aún te amo
Sin saber qué me espera
Soy capaz de jugarme la vida
Por tenerte otra vez

Me inventaste un mundo de dudas
Dos seres que marchan bonita
Sin misericordia estos amores
Tú con tus caprichos dominas
Sabes que te quiero y te adoro
No me dejes solo en la vida
Sabes que te quiero y te adoro
No me dejes solo en la vida  

Uno a uno tus pasos
Los seguí hasta encontrarte
Y hoy te tengo otra vez
Aquí estamos tan cerca pero no eres la misma
Te he perdido la fe

Que le guarda el destino a mi vida vacía
Hoy regreso a tu puerto sin saber lo que quieres
Enseguida intenté darte un beso y me has correspondido
Pero mañana sé que eres capaz de tirarme al olvido

Nunca, pero nunca en la vida esperé aquel adiós
Que hoy me duele en el alma
Se que fuiste alegría en mis tristezas
Con tus promesas me diste la vida
Es injusto tu adiós

Que así era yo también cuando muchacho 
Que sólo me aquietaban dos pengazos

Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 
Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 

Se ponía triste al verme llorar 
Y me daba un pedazo de panela 
Y entraba en discusión con mi vieja 
Por que la pobre le reclamaba 
Que porque diablos me maltrataba 
Que dejara al muchacho tranquilo 

Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo 
Todavía las costumbres aquellas 
Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo

Recuerdo la cartilla abecedario

Porque era día de fiesta 
Recuerdo que iba tan entusiasmado 
Por que desde que me habían bautizado 
No llegaba a la iglesia 

El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 
El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 

Ese fue el día que le escuche al padre 
Que dios a todos nos tiene en cuenta 
Y con deseos también de quedarme 
Pa' allá en la nocha de la caseta 
Y me tocó quedarme en la puerta 
No tenia plata para pagarles 
Por eso es que la vida es un baile 
Que con el tiempo damos la vuelta 
Pero el tiempo acaba la fiesta 
Y me voy solito pa'l valle 

Yo aprendí a trabajar desde pela'o 
Por eso es que yo estoy acostumbrado 
Siempre a vivir con plata 
Y con toda la plata que he ganado 
Cuántos problemas no he solucionado 
Pero nunca me alcanza

Que me dio con esmero

Que valen mucho más que el dinero

Que si te inspira ser zapatero 
Sólo quiero que seas el mejor

quisiera volar muy lejos muy lejos sin rumbo fijo
buscar un lugar del mundo sin odio vivir tranquilo
eliminar la tristeza las mentiras y las traiciones
no importa q nunca encuentre el corazon
lo q ha buscado de verdad
no importa el tiempo q es ya muy corto y las ancias largas de vivir
cualquier minuto de placer sera sentido en realidad
si lleno el alma si lleno el alma de eternidad
si lleno el alma si lleno el alma de eternidad

es muy triste recordar momentos felices
de un cariÃ±o q sangro mi corazon
y es ya la hora de partir sin medir distancias
y ni sombra quedara de aquel amor
y ni sombra quedara de aquel amor

no quiero volver a verla mas nunca en mi camino
distancia q nos separa q hiere sufro el olvido
es muy cierto q las noches tan largas con mi desvelo
rayito de la maÃ±ana tu sabes cuanto la quiero
solitario en el recuerdo se va alejando mis quejas
amigos q me conocen me diran q es lo q pasa en tu interior
no eres el mismo q conocimos lleno de vida y de ilusion
se nota a leguas de verdad q te lastima el corazon
se nota a leguas q estas sufriendo x un amor
se nota a leguas q estas sufriendo x un amor

es muy triste recordar momentos felices
de un cariÃ±o q sangro mi corazon

y ni sombra quedara de aquel amor

Por que siento que te quiero y que te adoro
Y mi vida ha cambiado, y no se como
Ay ya todo lo siento de otro modo
CambiÃ³ mi pensar

He presentido que ya este es el final
De tantos tropezones por andar
Sobre vientos que se vienen y van
Acabaste mi mal

Oye bonita, cuando me estas mirando

Oye bonita, y me siento tan contento
Que en el instante pienso como sera maÃ±ana
Cuando te bese totalmente confiado
Que si alguien esta mirando me comprende en seguida

Que tus ojos me dominan
Que tu boca me fascina
Que tu cuerpo me enloquece
Que cuando estemos juntos todo el mundo diga

Como yo vivo de un lado para otro
Porque mi profesion me obliga a hacerlo asi
Me pongo triste cuando me encuentro lejos
Entonces es cuando quiero estar cerca de ti

Pa' ver si asi no te pones molesta
Por causa de la ausencia que separa nuestras vidas

Como tu dices que vives indecisa
Porque la desconfianza te daÃ±a el pensamiento
Vengo a decirte en mi canciÃ³n, bonita
Que mi alma necesita tu noble sentimiento

Porque en la vida hay cosas importantes
Que son mÃ¡s elegantes si se tratan con respeto

Es que tus ojos me dominan
Que tu boca me fascina
Que tu cuerpo me enloquece
Que cuando estemos juntos todo el mundo diga

Ya he pagado lo que hice 
Ya deja de castigarme

Diómedes Díaz,"Yo quisiera volver al pasado y a mis ilusiones
y encontrarme de nuevo tan cerca estrechando tus manos
Y sentir tu mirada, tu voz, las cosas que hablamos
cuando te confesaba que yo morÃ­a por tus amores.

Y era cierto mi vida esa vez sÃ³lo era un sueÃ±o
y en seguida me viste rodar como hojas al viento
era el tiempo en que yo enamorado aun no sabÃ­a
que destino me correspondÃ­a
ser querido o mÃ¡s bien olvidado

Hoy quisiera que por fin te aparecieras
me sonrieras y lloraras con mis penas
y encontrarte algÃºn dÃ­a en otra parte
solitaria frente a frente y saludarte

Y en un arrebato de mi vida loca
darte un besito en la boca
Y en un arrebato de mi vida loca
darte un besito en la boca

Era triste saber que no habÃ­a una razÃ³n en tu vida
para amarme y dejar que algÃºn dÃ­a se cumplieran mis sueÃ±os
Y hasta quise enfrentÃ¡rmele Dios y pedir de rodillas
que dejaras todo por mi amor sin sentir tanto miedo

Duele ahora saber que lo amado no pudo llegar
y es asÃ­ porque Dios lo ha querido y a si lo serÃ¡
Fue imposible tu amor pero creo que algo sentiste
al mirar en mis ojos lo triste que causo mi posible deseo

Hoy quisiera que por fin te aparecieras
me sonrieras y lloraras con mis penas
Cuanto diera por llegar allÃ¡ mi vida
y encontrarte solitaria en esa esquina

Y en un arrebato de mi vida loca
darte un besito en la boca
Y en un arrebato de mi vida loca
darte un besito en la boca

Y en un arrebato de esta loca vida
darte un beso aquÃ­ en la boca
Y en un arrebato de esta loca vida amor
darte un beso aquÃ­ en la boca

És muy bonita, és muy bonita
Pa' que no se me acabara
Fuera bendita, fuera bendita
Pa' poder vivir cerquita
De las cosas que mas quiero
Que no me pusiera viejo
Pa' estar siempre jovencito
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

A la edad de quince años
Ya yo cantaba, ya yo cantaba
Y a los veintidós cumplidos
Ya yo grababa, ya yo grababa
Ya la gente comenzaba
A valorizar mi canto
Y al lado del gran Colacho
Me llené de requisitos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

He vivido todo el tiempo
Enamorado de una morena
La que meritoriamente
Hizo que fuera yo el dueño de ella
La pobre ha salio tan buena
Pero casi vive sola
Porque salgo a toda hora
A cumplir mis compromisos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

Vivo muy agradecido
De aquella gente que me acompaña
A donde quiera que voy
Cada dia mas dandome fama
Yo no sé cómo se paga
Ese gesto tan bonito
Quiero repartir mi alma
Dandole a todo' un poquito

Que muy dentro llevo tu imagen grabada

Que andaba a media noche turbando el silencio

Que siempre me aparezco en cualquier momento 
A visitar el barrio solo en busca tuya

Que ya no falta mucho para ser tu dueño 
Que en caso tal perdone si le hago dar rabia

If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!",Fools Rush In

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.

That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You

upon the pavement dark and wet
I find my childhood in the ghoarts
of the old neighborhood

shakes my senses takes my feeling

The moment I looked in your eyes I never will forget
And I remember oh the time that we kissed
Remember thinking to myself could it really be like this
And we danced beneath a midnight moon
And I took one lock
One look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still
And we moved so sweet
So sweet and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And then your arms reached out and held me close
And the night stood still
I will remember the song that they were playing then
And if I close my eyes I answer
We're right back there again
Do you remember oh the way it used to be
We were two hearts on the run
So young as wild as free

We think as one person without concentrating 
I'm high on your laughter, it's intoxicating 
We walk on the ceiling, the walls can't contain us 
Together we're flying, the angels can claim us 

You bring the dream 
I'll bring the power 
We'll blend it together 
We'll build a tower of love 
You'll bring passion 
I'll bring desire 
Then we'll light the sunrise, turn it to fire 
And love

With all of this feeling, the whole world can't cage us 
My heart beats with your heart and it's contagious

Folks I meet, they aren't always kind
Some are bad, some are good, some just do the best they could
Some have tried to ease my troubled mind

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound

I had a friend from home, he started out to roam
I hear that he's out by Frisco bay
Sometimes when I drink a few, his voice comes singing through
I’m goin' out there, gonna see him some old day

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound

I had a girl one time, she had lips like sherry wine
I believe that I loved her to my soul
But I was too blind to see, she was driftin' away from me
One day she left me out in the cold

And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
I can't help but wonder

right away   that it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind.  And this is what I heard
my neighbor say-""You know, that girl down the street should be run from our midst.  She
drinks and she talks quite a lot.  She knows not to speak to my child and me.""  My neighbor

I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

But taking back the hand of control feels good for the soul, yay yay yay.

Say you give me everything, then you bring me nothing more than blue
