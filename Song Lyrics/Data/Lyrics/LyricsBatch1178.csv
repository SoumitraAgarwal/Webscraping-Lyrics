Sound the Alarm,"Hello again, may I help you remember
Why we're here and what we're fighting for
We've seen the best and the worst of each other
And you're relentless and you search for more

Take a minute, put your heart where your head is
Take another to collect your thoughts
Final question is this really all worth it
Or are we simply tearing this apart

Falling over once again, [Incomprehensible]

I can't tell fact from fiction, to me it's all the same
You keep creating fiction that's not enough to make me stay

Let's take a step back and do this the right way
'Cause I've been waitin' for a chance to speak
Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to lecture
I hate to argue when I'm love [Incomprehensible]

Just lately I've been having this feeling
I'm not the only name that's on your mind
Think it's best that we both go our own way
And forget about this wasted time

Falling over once again, [Incomprehensible]

I can't tell fact from fiction, to me it's all the same
You keep creating fiction that's not enough

I can't tell fact from fiction, to me it's all the same
[Incomprehensible] create some friction, I can't tell fact from fiction

I can't tell fact from fiction but you don't seem to care
Instead create some friction, that's not enough

I can't tell fact from fiction, to me it's all the same
You keep creating friction, I can't tell fact from fiction

I can't tell fact from fiction, to me it's all the same
You keep creating friction, that's not enough to make me stay",Fact or Fiction
Sound the Alarm,"Hesitate, I'm right behind you
I'll be inside you if you just break away
Give me space to work my madness
You can't deny it when it's in you're face

And I know and you don't, 'cause I know
If we could find a way
To break from these constraints

If I told you we need to improvise
Need some action, wanna feel alive
Give me a reason to unwind and if I told you
I wanna be surprised, would she even come to mind?

A great escape from all exposure
I'm feeling older but I still think the same
I've found my place, I'm in control now
I'm making progress that you can't erase

And I know and you don't, 'cause I know
If we can find a way
To break from these constraints

If I told you we need to improvise
Need some action, wanna feel alive
Give me a reason to unwind and if I told you
I wanna be surprised, would she even come to mind?

Sound the Alarm,"If you're feeling like you need some motivation
A new way to get along
We've found a blend
To keep you safe in song

We've got it oh so concentrated
Got it moving through our bones
This connection's underrated
Never gets old

You desire
Then I'll inspire a few
To try a taste of something new

And it's making me sick
I can feel it on my left side
Creeping closer every inch

To say I'm sore would be an outrage
I'm sitting safely in my skin
I feel this free ride's headed somewhere
At least I'm hoping

You desire
Then I'll inspire a few
To try a taste of something

And I've grown tired
Waiting for your move
Give up, don't pretend
There's something left to lose

Something left to pull us through
And just float away for good
Live this life the way we should
Just go

Sound the Alarm,"A suicide pact, a lit cigar
And a new way to sing along
In a dying culture that feeds on the blind
And waits for the lethal sickness

There's a boy out back with a gun to his chest
Like it's the only way to relieve stress
Then the culture dies and it leaves us blind
In the wake of our resistance

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

A case of hard facts and no one knows
Not a damn thing can be exposed
In this world of ours where we're living in hope
Despair is where we keep our wishes

Not alone or afraid, but afraid to recite
The words you hear and the wrongs you right
The world is ours but we're only in charge
Of our lives and how we live them

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

Today's abused
What is there for you
Just rise above the few
That lay in stone
Trying to obtain an idol to betray

Besides
There's so much on the line
Don't take a step back
Not one more step back

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it
The world could be a bitter place sometimes
It's better just stay inside

Boy, if you step outside
You'll never make it

You're gonna be just fine
You're gonna be just fine

Sound the Alarm,"In the beginning it was worth this
Do the worst, feel complete
Passing standards others meet
(What we do best)

Now, perfect endings make you anxious
Heavy head, a colder sweat
Leaving nothing here
Nothing to regret

Why am I still suffocating?
Constantly devastated just to stay alive
Why am I still suffocating?
Constantly devastated just to stay alive, oh

I miss the old days that we murdered
They're so far gone, out of reach
Watch your fate with summers heat
(Well, it goes like this)

Without a break from this distraction
I need a change
A different scene
A new approach on coming clean

Why am I still suffocating?
Constantly devastated just to stay alive

What my heart tells me to do
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you

Safe outside my gilded cage
With an ounce of pain
I wield a ton of rage

With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you

With a pony on the tether pulling cold and sugarcane.

There go your knees. 
And there she goes.
She's a-hauling cane like it was gold.

And when she calls upon the dead,
To stand up in her place, 
They'll raise the roof up overhead,
And speak out from her face.
And fish jump in her boat all day, 
And flog your feet like steel.

There go the dead.
Out through the roof.
She speaks your name,
Like it was proof.

And they wait for you in town,
They pull back on the lever,
And they bring the truck around.

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town

Yo, this Havoc the Mouthpiece from the S.C.C.
I only got three words to say:
South - Central - Madness

[ Prode'je ]
Hoo-ridin in the Central, yeah, the gangsters mob for life
The Cartel's gonna roll the dice
One time for the mind of the niggas strollin deep
Watch your back, I'm about to creep
It's not Compton, it's South Central like a bitch
Another gee with a gaffled gangster pitch
If your game is weak, you speak straight punk
If funk jump you're soft and try to punk
Cause I'ma hit you in the face with it
I got a posse of crews to serve blues if you fuck with it
Yo, the Prode'je spoke and choke and choke
Who croak when the guns smoke, ?broke, you're half-loc'ed?
But I'ma break it down for those who know
Be real when you claim South Central
Cause on the Central tip you get pistol-whipped
And if the pistol slip, you get Uzi-clipped
211's in progress
Here comes the 187 if a sucker tries to fess
Kaos, Gripp, the ringleader is rip shit
And when I'm grippin the mic or when I flip shit

[ Havikk ]
It's not Compton, what's up punk, it's South Central
A crime wave of gangster-made criminals
Liftin a skit to your dome, I'm relentless, shit
Cock the nine and laugh when I blast this shit
Cause your ass got tossed
By the mafia king, you were hung by the boss
Havikk, my felonous pitch will lynch a bitch
Smoke and choke any punk on a off-stroke
Cause I provide the funk and it's homicide
Suckers collide with my drum and get hung
Gaffle, swarm and alarm and drop a storm of death
Eat your brain and watch your ass melt
In the Central I roam, I'm close to home
The dangerzone, muthafucka, get your head flown
By a loc, I'ma smoke, I'm no joke
Drop the floor on a noose and watch your ass choke
Feel the lyrics that blow, how it detonate
Hide your dome, the Cartel will penetrate
Your damn cranium, punk, who's the baddest?
You can't escape the South Central Madness

[ Havoc ]
Yo, this is the hype of all hypes
Hype-up track for '92
For South Central
Cold droppin gangsta

[ uncredited guest rapper number one ]
Yo, I got a gat, I'm tryin to deal with the Madness
Mexican gangsta, born with a badness
So I drink forties like a wino
And let me get it straight, don't give a fuck about a five-o
Cause I live on the edge like every nigga
A nine for a nine, get fly with a trigger
And man, I gat, so I guess I'm a rider
Bitches know I'm paid, so I guess that's why they strive for
I sling like the Cartel bang
Scorpio is ???? but you ain't gonna hang
My AK is fully automatic
If you want to live, chump, then don't get dramatic
Cause the jail's got a goddamn mafia
want to scrap, punk? Ace'll be droppin ya
When we're done you're gonna be feelin blue
Sleepin on the floor like a muthafuckin ????
Just because you thought you that crazy
Try to rush hard but your shit couldn't phase me
Cause I'm more than a brother that's mental
I'm the one Mexican that roam South Central

[ uncredited guest rapper number two ]
A city with so much credential
Livin in Central is strictly all mental
Coincidental, let me tell you what I'm into
Gamin on the niggas who think they can step to
A pretty seditty lady from the city
Looks are deceiving but my attitude is shitty
And don't try to step to me quick
Cause a 9mm in your mouth I will stick
And make you lookin like a popsicle
Hear the blast, and I see your blood trickle
Yeah, exactly what I figured
A bitch-made nigga that's scared to pull the trigger
On a lady that's got you feelin smaller
Shorter than short, I'm the lady shot caller
The boss that 24 is dissin
Any muthafucka who think they can fade this
S.C.C. is comin out slayin
It's not a gang when no Uzi is sprayin
A lady that's pullin all the cards
I smoke ya and leave ya dead with your dick on hard

Malibu beaches and everyday sunshine
Bullshit - my city's full of one-time
Rollin on a hunt for they favorite toy
Any gangsta nigga wearin khakis and Curduroys
House shoes or a pair of Nikeys
And you talkin 'bout you want to come and sight-see?
Fool, you better stay where you're at and keep your health
Cause where I'm from every nigga's for hisself
Or his set with the vest and a Tec
So if you've never been here, then channel 7 is your best bet
Me, I was raised in Watts after the riots
So I was taught: see the head, fly it
And one-time, I know they name and they faces
Because I see em on a everyday basis
Niggas claim hard cause of a warrant or a bounty
Others try to claim L.A. from Orange County
But ain't even close to claim hard knocks
That's why they dyin of a overdose of buckshots
I can't take it, my mic, somebody grab this
And keep flowin to the South Central Madness

For all you muthafuckas out there don't know how we livin in South Central
Fuck y'all!

And yo, right after this I get to fuck yo hoe
Young nigga, don't sweat that
Cause if you do, Andy Mac get the muthafuckin AK strapped
On your back with a goddamn slug in your head

P.J.'s, 43's don't trip, comin G cool
Keep a glock for a dumb fool
The 64's drop low
The Fruit Town Villains and the Swans actin loc'd
Long Beach, Main Street, ????????, Inglewood and don't forget Compton
Tragniew, they keep stompin
S.C.C. bail deep, 18's get they mob on
The Broadways don't sleep homes
Kelly Park, Lime Hood be down with the real shit
And Tree Top don't play bitch
And if you figure I'm a so-so 
Bring your ass to my hood: 92nd Street in Figuero
In the hood's packed Glocks
Swans gettin licked on the Compton blocks
99's down for the kill, one time muthafuckers can't creep
83'll put that ass on sleep
The 87 gangstas, the West Coast headbangers
East Side wallstreet slangers 
And Jordan Downs want to rock with my crew
Let's bring the shit together with the red and the blue (peace)
Cause Lantana, Atlantic Drivers breakin niggas off quick G
They gettin funky with the S.C.      

(Chorus) 3x

Muthafuckin Rhimeson is here

South Central's back in this muthafucka for the big Nine-Three
Dedicatin this to all you little young niggas

[ VERSE 1: Prode'je ]
Used to be my little homie from the hood when I came up
Chillin with the gee's, slinging ki's, tryin to clock bucks
Be a role-model when the locs wear the nine strapped
Didn't even think about the fact you were bum-rapped
Livin in the S-see 12 tryin to figure it out
Should I go to school, learn the rules, or should I drop out?
Maybe I was blind, in a way I was ignorant
Little knucklehead from my hood was still innocent
Coulda said, ""Loc, what I'm doin ain't the way for you
You should go to school, get a job and you'll make it through""
But I didn't do it, I was flippin tryin to be the one
Rollin in a 6-4 plushed on them things with bumps
Used to kick you down everyday, cause I had it, loc
Let you hit the bud' now and then, it was like a joke
You were goin down, then your mother tried to talk to me
But I was playin dumb and said I didn't even know you, gee
6 months later after doin 2 in county blues
Saw you at the park, khaki'd down, hanging with the fools
Smokin E.T., talkin about some drive-by
Lil knucklehead from my hood on a hoo-ride

A little knucklehead nigga
Just a knucklehead nigga from my hood, loc
Yeah a little nigga from my hood
Little niggas
Slow your roll, soldiers
Word up

[ VERSE 2: Prode'je ]
Now you're from the hood and you're running with the baby locs
Claimin rap-mob, slingin dope, and you're never broke
Got your own 9, and it's smokin every single night
Now I got the word from the streets, and it's nighty-night
Lil knucklehead from my hood on the downslide
Tryin to be the one, my nigga tryin to make it up high
Coulda told him this is nothing, coulda said him straight then
Now he's tryin to bang, and somebody's gonna smoke him
6 months later 13, and a menace now
Got a little juice as we chill with the pot crowd
Gettin fucked up off the E.T. and St. Ides
Tellin me that I'm the nigga that he used to idolize
Now you're like me ,little nigga
Better keep your finger on the trigger
Or it's 6 feet, little nigga
Cause on the slab it's a trip, and if you slip, you're a sleeper
But I'ma be my little brother's keeper
Put him in the spot, let him clock notch
Tryin to keep him safe from the 9s and the 12-gauge buckshots
But one day my nigga tripped
I caught him with a pipe in his mouth, and I flipped
Knucklehead nigga goin down in the hood, and it's bad for my business
So I had to just dismiss
Now he's back on the block
2 months later little loc got shot
2 in the dome by a fool that he jacked for a muthafuckin quarter
I guess times got harder

My little knucklehead nigga
Just a knucklehead nigga from my hood
What's up with all that shit, nigga?
Slow your roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Many niggas talk shit and get banked with the O E

Regulatin' off petitions, callin' on the D L

Doin flips, hittin dips, mobbin to the sto' later
Grabs the Bubble Yum, Jolly Ranchers, Now-Laters

The bigger the nigga size, the bigger the hole he lies in
Cause that's the lifestyle I'm livin, so I express it in my raps
For snaps and collapse fools with the straps
Perhaps the west coast is too hardcore
Kickin down your front do' with the infrared .44
Like [name], but on a mission for props
Everybody hit the flo', no beef no mo'
[ ? ]
Nigga, don't expect for us to let that shit ride on this side
Yeah, you're safe at home, but over here you best to hide
I'm capable of servin niggas problems with my heater
I'm down to put the strap down to let my fist met ya
Niggas don't want no problems now, nigga, you will get broke down
Nigga, you find yourself dead on the ??? bound
Cause I get so hot, niggas, you cannot stop me
West coast comin hard, so your ass best to copy
Sloppy-ass marks, y'all don't want to see me
I throw heat on your ass and bust a cap, cause it's easy
Keep it real

Swervin at miznight I'm deadly
Holdin machetes for murder weapons don't look back nigga keep on steppin
Seventeen seconds from the slammer
But I'm badder than Montana droppin grammar like a sledgehammer
Deeper than submarines nigga take your last breath
Then catch hell like Lucifer when I be blastin Tecs
This ain't no freestyle it's real now
Stackin Penny's like Hardaway it's hard to play with the ill child

No smiles, strictly business as we hit the ave
Do a neighbor and No Limit did the aftermath
I mash, your field into half
Two crooks on the dash *it's all about the cash*
Crash courses with the sources of sin
No love for any woman, no love for any men
Adrenalin stimulates my suspicion
of good intention, cause these fools got ambition
Facin the fatal word, be on the lookout
You'll get took out, when me and Mike put out
dope, can't cope, we killin em
Now witness, the murderizm

South Jersey Seashore Lifeguard Convention Band,"I moved in that very day
The room was small but I liked it anyway
I watched TV while I dreamed through my mind
And the pregnant girl was busy all the time

September and October passed me by
I decided to go home for a while
I got a lift with an old friend of mine
I wanted her still, she reminded me on the way

So when I got home I went to see mom and dad
They asked was I ok, was I happy enough
And I smiled and I said that I was

A few days later I decided to leave
I couldn't find anyone who could take me
The only thing I could do was take a bus
So at half six I left to catch the late express

I boarded the bus with my clean washing over-night bag
I sat beside a girl all dressed in black
We talked and smiled most of the way
'till her jealous boyfriend angrily led her away

Then when I reached the house there was a party on inside
My friend came to the door of my bachelor pad
And welcomed me in from the night
As I was walking through the happy house on Halloween night
My friends were all there, my heart was glad
And my life felt actually alright
My friends were all there, my heart was glad
And my life felt actually alright",Halloween

Her name, Mary Jane

Saggin' my dickies, smoke like a hippy
Smell so good when she get wet and sticky
You lift me, girl you the bomb
Got a nigga blowin' like Cheech and Chong
A bong, a blunt, or a paper square
It really don't matter she'll take you there
You been my gal since the age of thirteen
And it's funny to me, you still make me fiend
You put a spell on me with the green voodoo
You love when my boys come and run us a choo choo
Mary-Jane deep in the game
The way I feel words can't explain
You been true to me, stood by my side
I wake up and get my mornings first high
Other hoes wonder why they get no love
'Cause Mary got a big ol' but, huh

Oh let the Mary-go-round, pass the sweet

Throw your hands in the air with this muthafuckin three time user

Pass the Medusa, I never knews her
Who ya, who ya think ya are

And brought your ass across to the promise lands
I love to lay you down so soft in my swisha
Act like a freak and let all my niggaz hit ya

I follow two my behind a truck with half a mil
I make my first stop at my homeboys ranch 
I ask him ""what's in the bag"" he says ""two acres of plants
It's easy going in but hell gettin out
I want to make this paper and I think I know how
surprise surprise I done made it back home
in an ice cream truck ""who want to buy a snow cone""
  
Hook - repeat 2X

I'm going to the valley

We be hustlin on blocks moving in and out the alley
We call it medicine that's what you need when you get sick
Sometimes it's hard rock sometimes it's white pearl brick
Across, across the state line just me and my girlfriend
From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks
  
[5] - Going back to the valley staying on top of my game
Meeting up wit my bitches snow white and mary jane
Only thing that ever mattered to me 
Stacking dollars shit we making a week
Who the cowards who the killas who's the niggas wit scrilla
Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me
  
[6] - Going to the valley fo' soldiers in a caddy 
And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking 
leaving you hoe ass niggas unhappy
Chopping burs when able, fucking hoes on the table
Watching cable in a Sable, Dope House is the label
Selling em three for ten to my closest friends
Rolling back to H-towm big body Benz

And I'm moving mo weight then a whole herd of cattle

Shit, hell on my surella ice water lyrical good fella
SPM got the hook up, say watch out 
I hit the highway, let twenkies crawl
I'm going to the valley

In a Navigator bus bringing back some bricks
Get to checkpoint now I'm past the border
tell my guy alemar to play some more
Fat money cause we in the mix
I got that white girl and that stinky bitch
Better ryders and roamers can't really ask 
""We going out T?"" ""Bitch I'm headed to the valley
So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride
Chunk a deuce to the guys and I'm back to Southside
Cruisin wit a couple of pines
Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house
  
[9] - Cruisin to the valley checking up on me campos
Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green
My windows are tinted so nobody sees in it
Wit mary jane and snow white the sky's the limit

South Park Mexican,"First Verse:

My homie called me in the morning from a hospital bed
He got holes in his body from a glock full of lead
He said, three motherfuckers that his lady knows
Tried to jack his ass for his 84's
Now in a Ben Taub sick bed, my homie lays up
He got sprayed up, 'cause he wouldn't raise
Caught three of the seven of the shots that rang
Them folks sayin' that he'd never walk the same
It sounds like a job for the uzi gat
And where the fuck did your bitch say these fools be at?
For a real long time, we been the best of friends
And I'll be damned if a nigga don't get revenge
I feel anger, that I'm no stranger to
Bustin' slugs in they guts just a thang to do
Why they pray for you, come and spray they crew
Got love for my homies, I thought you knew?
He said ""Los don't sweat it, let this shit alone,""
but with these punk motherfuckers I must pick a bone
Now will it be the cranium or the chest plate?
Necks break back, snap, put him in checkmate
Lead take me to vengeance, send this
Ripping through tendons I end this
Because you bleed inside and it hurts to cough
I can't take no advice I gots to break them off

Chorus:

'cause my revenge, it tastes so sweet, I gotta do,
What my friends, would do for me,
You muthafuckas gotta beg,
y'all askin' for action,
Eat a fuckin' K,
I'm blastin' some asses
'cause my revenge, it tastes so sweet, I gotta do,
What my friends, would do for me,
You muthafuckas gotta beg,
y'all askin' for action,
Eat a fuckin' K,
I'm blastin' some asses

Second Verse:

My niggas check me, I'm thinkin' of a master plan
I'm straight up blastin' glocks, them fuckin' bastards ran
I'm steady missin' all my homies that done bit the dust
Got revenge 'cause them bitches wasn't shit to us
Now what the fuck can I accomplish?
And when I'm dead, will I find myself on God's list?
Every night I give, thanks I wouldn't die today
Turnin' cane into crack and my mic away
We dealin' 'cause we feelin' that the, pay's right
Hopin' Mama never see me at my, grave site
No daylight, play night cautiously
Could be death, or my freedom what it's costin' me
Lost in dear life my wife be that Mary Jane
And my streets got me strollin' blueberry Lane
Very same song sung in the South
From the mouth of a hustler, never have I trusted a
Trick or a hoe or a dope fiend either
'cause they smoke like a beaver buildin' dams on the river
Live a, life of a ""G' til' the d - a - why

Now her face is too straight in the fuckin' dog cages
Pages of my book, turn like the wind blows
On the paper of a crook, muthafuck them hoes
Hittin' flows as a hustler, rose as a ""G""
Saves his flows to big 8, now he scores half a ki
Some say in his head he got insanity inside
But all it really be is mathematically inclined
Look behind, you might find others takin' over
Rookies movin' cookies, they whipped in baking soda
Baby learn the fuckin' rules, my cheese, is SOLID AS A ROCK
With my homies and we BALLIN' WITH A GLOCK
Tenderoni phony fraud motherfuckers
Best to get out the game, 'fore you die motherfuckers
Bustas trust us, but us hustlas trust no one
You can sure run with no gun
That be a nigga slow guns
So roll one of them sweets
Chug-a-lug on the eightball
And see where this motherfuckin life is gonna take y'all
And haters might fall

South Park Mexican,"[First Verse]
Well Baby Beesh, that's my handle, money mackin'
Commando, blowin' like a candle, on that pearl and
Wood panel, modern day Marlon Brando 
Squares don't understando
Play like a piano when I'm flipping through the
Channel, man don't make me lose convultions, chokin'
On some doja, cars keep flippin' over 
Getting' Jags and Testerosas
Motorola, Coca-Cola, stay high and never sober 
Got them hot girls makin' love to my poster
Attitude kinda flippy, pockets never skimpy 
Married to Marijuana with that drama you can miss me
Fifty-fifty I'm a playa, slash money maker by nature
I get that paper pushin' green and snowyflaka
Make a good girl turn to sinna 
Puttin' inches all up in her
Blaze the bitch up now she's a bread winner
I'm a gold digga, kick a hole through your front door
Nigga, don't try to fight it, give it up, let it go.

Chorus:
Follow my lead huh, do as I say not as I do. (x3)

Follow my lead huh, mayday mayday.  (x5)

[Second Verse]
I remember way back in the day
I used to get spankings from my momma
But uh now this lil' ass baby smokin' on dank in The
Bahamas, got a pair of Versace pajamas 
Little mommas say I'm a sex symbol
I come through with the blue Coug
And shit I'm thinkin' Lexus Limo
I'm a swang three lanes to the piece and chain
And the pinky ring I'm gonna blind
'cause it's my time, I pack my dime, I put two holes
Right in your spine
Every time you talkin' down my rhyme 
Boy I beat yo lil' behind
And stop and rewind, feel my lines 
Bottle like me, I'm gonna shine
Little Christian on a mission 
But listen he gaining recognition
In the Expedition, it's gonna glistin'
Got a line and he went fishin'
Pay attention to the Louisiano recano regano with a
Blano, I be puffin' on a big Fano 
Got mo' green than the motherfucking lotto
Nigga I'm the one, the Christian 
The lucky motherfucker outside of the Yukon
I'm swangin' fo's, I'm slangin' hoes 
Representing of the way Houston
These boys ain't ready for the age of Levy in a SS
Chevy on perely 
Nigga I be sippin' lean 
And I'm counting green
'cause boy I'm all about my feria (feria).

[Third Verse]
I promise this song is harder than my dick is
I won in the Olympics for cooking the most chickens
Gold medal around my necka, living la vida chueca
Puck checka, chuck wrecka, nobody do it betta
I'm best when under presha, smoke up in my chest
Momma mad, 'cause I just just failed my piss test 
Brain deader than a door knob 
This is, for my road dog
Fresh out the Pen I take him out to get a blowjob
I'm so shy, controlling the streets, like a robot
The one to put a dope house 
I'm sorry but it won't stop
My door got kicked in once before
And I'm sho' they won't try that stupid shit no more
I put holes up in they asses 
Broke em' like some glasses
Niggas was falling just like my motherfuking pants is
Answers your questions, throwed as Mexicans
Snatch your bitch up and dig deep in her intestines.

South Park Mexican,"We heard the word now, we know just what you're thinkin'
You want us dead now, you want to see us sinking
We have no choice now, this is the game you've chosen

It's time for action, time for retaliation
You ain't a real G, been watching too much ""Jason""
Ball my fists around clips
May you sleep in peace with the fish, you's a hoe
And in the pen. you be a bitch
Using red M&M's for lipstick

They want to go, to bloody war
Are you sure you want to, take me to war

I got my G's, I got my team
Put me down for murda in first degree
My clip is full, but that'll change
Heard you got your vest on, but I want brains
It's lonely days, and lonely nights
Cause I need my revenge, right by my side
My gun is hot, my heart is cold
Everyone around me has killed before

[Chorus x2]

I snatch your bitch, then snatch your life
And keep your fingers, for braggin' rights
Next week you'll be watchin my trota
Cause your ass ain't shit but a panocha
You have a choice, die or be miserable
Dopehouse, home of the invisible
I warned y'all to stay of my genitals
Now I gotta turn you fruits into vegetables
Having nightmares, homie you ain't dead yet
Waking up with your motherfucking bed wet
I have fun with fucking punks like you
Tell his momma not to worry he'll be dead by Two
His head, impounded, they never found it
He in the dirt, you can say he got grounded
I'm a shouter, livin' how I tell it
And if you see him, tell him I said

You can take Kelly's booty, I'ma do Kim's

Imagine I've been saggin' ever since I could walk
Been beggin' you to listen ever since I could talk
Double-in my money, even make it triple
I've never been a bum, but I'm beggin' for a nickel
Still dippin' sticks with a throwed ass bitch
Workin' those lips, but I don't mean a kiss
Roll with fuckin' killers, we all got straps
Walkin' through my hood with a woodgrain mac
Slip em in a coma, slangin' on my cut
It took a lot of work to get my block so crunk

Cook beef with my nigga, Creep with my nigga
On feet with my nigga, drink with my nigga
Pack heat with my nigga, my nigga

Run around town, in trophy trucks and 'lacs
The wheels keep turnin', I'm choppin' up the wind
I see the ladies lookin', they wanna jump in
Now the front ends hoppin' and the car begins to dance
My forty ounce bottle, is spillin' on my pants
Ridin' too deep, in the four-door '77
I'm tryin' to count my TV's, I think I got eleven
Now we all got love for the '63 Impala
Ruby is the short one, claimin' Guatemala
Bobby is the mix-breed, people think he's funny
Behind us in the Cougar and he's hoppin' like a bunny
Bird's keep flyin', I feel like a Hawaiian
'Cause my backyard looks like an exotic island
Creepin Harrisburg, the party broke left
I make a you-Turn, 'cause I'm Broadway to my death

'Cause my posse's on Broadway

I roll with my nigga, smoke with my nigga
Fuck hoes with my nigga, blow with my nigga
Buy clothes with my nigga, throw with my nigga
Cook dope with my nigga, my nigga

Like a typical fling while I'm sippin on lean

South Shore Concert Band,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

South Shore Concert Band,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say 
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

South Shore Concert Band,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine","Begin the beguine, song (from ""Jubilee"")"

But it's no show so you might as well go

And I know you think you found it

Nearly nobody minds

Wavin' at the limousines

At a losin' game

Too much at half the price
A little too soon

TELL ME HOW DO WE TURN THIS THING AROUND

I CAN'T SEE THE SUNSHINE FOR THE GRAY SKIES UP ABOVE
THERE'S SMOKE AND SMOG FROM THE FACTORIES
OH DOES NO ONE REALLY CARE
CAN’T YOU LEND US A HAND CAN'T YOU SEE WE’RE GOING DOWN

LYING IN MY BEDROOM I GLANCE OUTSIDE  
CHILDREN PLAYING IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE
SUMMER BREEZE BLOWS A COLD CHILL 
TO REMIND ME YOU’RE STILL NOT HERE
I THINK OF YOUR SMILE AND SOME WORDS YOU SAID 
ABOUT A PAGEANT YOU HAD THE OTHER DAY
WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE I REALLY DO
I’DE DO ANYTHING TO BE WITH YOU

CAN I SEE YOU OR CALL YOU ON THE PHONE 
SHOULD I SEND YOU A LETTER OR JUST LEAVE YOU ALONE
I HAVE SOME WORDS TO SAY TO YOU AND I HOPE YOU’LL UNDERSTAND 
IN MY WORLD I WANT TO BE AME’S MAN

I LOOK IN THE CLOUDS I CAN SEE YOUR FACE
NO ONE IN THE WORLD CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE
I TRY SO HARD TO BE A FRIEND 
I DON’T THINK YOU REALIZE THE MESS I’M IN
I’VE NEVER MET ANYONE AS PERFECT AS YOU
CAUSE YOU ARE ALL THINGS AND ALL THINGS ARE YOU 

I WALKED IN A RAINSTORM THE OTHER DAY
POURED DOWN RAIN BUT I WALKED ANYWAY
A RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE SKY SO BRIGHT 
I PRAYED TO HAVE YOU BY MY SIDE 
PUSHING THE LIMITS PRESSING MY LUCK
SINCE I MET YOU I JUST CAN’T GIVE UP
ONCE IN A LIFE TIME IS ALL WE GET 
TO MEET THAT PERSON WE’LL NEVER FORGET
 
OH IN MY WORLD I GOT TO BE AME’S MAN

I WROTE THIS SONG ESPECIALLY FOR YOU 
IT’S A LITTLE SIMPLE BUT ALL OF IT’S TRUE

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready

We seem to fit like hand in glove together
We seem to pass the test of time
And, though I've never heard you say forever
In my heart I know you're mine

One day you're gonna look into my eyes
You'll say you know for sure
That's what I'm waiting for and

When the moment is right, you'll know it
And I'll be right by your side
Maybe tonight will be the night you'll show it
But I won't rush fate
I'll wait till the moment is right

For every star I've ever wished upon
Ah, there always seemed a wish for you
For those who tell me I'm just, I'm just dreaming on
I know this one will come true

Good things come to those who wait for love
You're worth the wait I swear
Oh, baby, we're almost there and oh

When the moment is right
And I'll be right by your side
Maybe tonight will be the night
But I won't rush fate
I'll wait till the moment is right

Time can only take this love
And make it stronger, yea

When the moment is right, you'll know it
And I'll be right by your side, baby
Well, maybe tonight will be the night you'll show it
But I won't rush fate, I'm not gonna rush fate, no, no
I won't rush fate, baby
I'm gonna take my time
I won't rush fate
I'll wait till the moment is right

Making love in crazy places
While the town around us died

I watched the lonely cry
You danced in iron cages
For the boys with hungry eyes

I swore I'd come back for you
Come back and buy this town

I'm coming back

Southside Johnny,"Her sweet scent lingers in your room
Perfumes the sultry Southern night
While across the moon
A whip-poor-will takes flight
A long slow descent down into the depths
Her last words echo in your ear
The saddest song you know you'll ever hear

When the world looks cold and distant
When there's nothing left to lose
Ah, that's how it feels
Living with the blues

The night sky shifts from black to blue
The first unwelcome hint of dawn
Another day, another day and she's still gone
You can't just walk the streets
But you can't go home
Every word they said was true
But it's too late now
There's nothing you can do

When the world looks cold and distant
When there's nothing left to lose
Ah, you learn how it feels
Living with the blues

Remember all those Sunday mornings
Singing in the choir
Remember all those languid evenings
Wrapped up in desire
Remember all those days
Just her touch would set your skin on fire
On fire

When the world looks cold and distant
When there's nothing left to lose
Now you know how it feels
Now you're living with the blues",Living with the Blues
Southside Johnny,"You've got the soul of a lover
But it gets lost in the wires
All the static confusion
Destroys the illusion
Of your secret desires

When I call you long distance
I can't wait till I hear you
But there's a bad connection
No communication
I can't seem to get near you

Long distance, you're so far away
My telephone never knows what to say
Electronic voices never give themselves away
Whoa - long distance

I hear the whisper of voices
They're all adrift in the trunk lines
All those words from the heart
Just one more part of a computer grapevine

But though your voice is so sold
And it's so hard to hear
When I get you alone
In the night - it's alright",Long Distance

Streetlight dances on the sidewalk
As another day fades to black
I check my reflection in the satin black finish
Of a double-parked Cadillac

Radio blasting from a doorway
I fall in with that beat
Moving down Passion Street
Down Passion Street

Neon Leon in his shark skin
With some downtown debutante
Fat Tony bouncin' on the corner
Gets you anything you want
Yea everbody's looking for something
And this is where the loose ends meet
Here on Passion Street
On Passion Street

Yea when I'm out here, everything feels right
Oh I know true love waits for me
On Passion Street tonight

Streets sound rolls like thunder
Electricity in the air
Angel ascends from a subway station
Like the answer to my prayer
Saxophone screaming from a nightclub
Lifts us off our feet
And blows us down Passion Street

She ain't never around when I want her
Hey Southside, have you seen my baby?
No man, I ain't seen her
Well I been hearing some talk
Are you sure you haven't seen my baby?
Oh no.
Here, here she goes now
Well step out the way
I got to do some talking

Listen here baby to what I say
I break my back working hard all day
And just when I need a little sympathy
You ain't home

I know now baby that I don't ask much
Just a little respect and a loving touch
If I support two people the why am I living alone

Then I wonder
How come you treat me so bad
Your the most loving woman I ever had
How come you treat me so bad
Girl I got to know

I got to find out what's going on
All the women stop and they give me the eye
But the woman I love don't even wonder why
I ain't good looking, but I know spending my money
Another man might get her off town
But if your the one that's like messing around
Well I ain't laughing
But something sure seems funny
Don't it

Hey Southside, 
There's something familiar about that shirt
Well eh,
I like to talk to you but I got to play a little something here.

I ask for cooking and you give me food
I ask for, and you give me,
I am asking for time and you tell me I am already to late
What you mean?
Someday, girl, you might change you mind
You realize what you left behind
I got news for you baby
I just might not wait, no more

How come you treat me so bad
Your the most loving woman I ever had
How come you treat me so bad
I am tired of being lonely and I feel so sad
How come you treat me so bad

Yes, he is

No more sleepless nights 
I'm all through walkin' the floor 
I ain't gonna wait by the telephone

Last time that I saw you, baby 
I had nothing left to say

Is that I waited so damn long

I moved a little closer to hear the words she was saying 
She said, ""I'll never break your heart 
I'd never try to fake it
My love is here for you all you have to do is take it"" 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
My little girl so fine 

The night seemed to say it was right but could I believe her? 
My heart said, ""it's time to go"" 
But my eyes wouldn't leave her

My little girl tries so hard to help me make it

Whoa whoa so fine

And whispered, ""hold me tight""
Take a chance on what tomorrow brings 
Won't you be mine, be mine, be mine tonight?

Into the night forever and ever and ever 

Now, I know I'll never break my baby's heart

But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed. Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now

And would it bring you down if I hang around

It's been a long, long time since I felt so fine

And I know your love is fine
I know what's on your mind but
Don't laugh, don't cry
Don't make me wonder why

You're doing what you're doing now
Can't you see somehow
It's the wrong time now

Our glass is now half empty
But the tears will overflow

Everyone above?

This is the valley where animals live
Stresses like wind to a man on a bridge
Stand on the edge with the city below
Below the city is 60 below

Is he alone? Is he a shadow?
And will he be home in the minute of battle?
He's roaming of vandal
No roman candles lit on the night that he died

Let it be I
Should've been me in his place
Scared as I stare in the face of his mother
In case I discover the fear in the fate

My brother I sent another prayer into space
Rest in peace to Prince and Thief 
Can we speak to 
Ghosts?

[Chorus] 

Cold is the hand on the angel of death
Drawing you to it's embrace 
From a caress
Reducing to strangle your neck

Pulling into and from grace
This is your fate
Stare into the eyes of your sin
Every morning you begin

Who are your family?
Who are your friends?
Lost in the culprit of needles and pins
Tommy was itchin'

The fix in the kitchen
He made a decision 
He wanted to scratch
Chasing the dragon

But facing the dragon
Is not really something
He wanted to catch
But he finally did

I wonder
Did he try to repent?
As life slipped from his eyes
Scratching

We still love you
We will miss you
We still love you
Is it blissful?

We still love you
We will miss you
We still love you
Is it bliss?

I call to your spirit!
Answer!
I know you can hear it!

I conjure your soul with these lyrics!
Manifest some kind of appearance!

Where it was that you were carried
I helped carry you physically to be buried
But the rest, every individual varies

Che tira fuori tutta la voglia d´amore che c´è
Un´ossessione ""volare dove sei""
Per dirti que che non dico ma che vorrei
Forse ho preso solo un abbaglio, ma ti penso sempre e se
E se non è colpa del sole allora sono innamorata di te
Mentre poi fingo reale questa mia indifferenza totale ed apatia

Perchè se questo virus d´amore è solo in me
Meglio lasciar sfumare anche se resta che
E mi farò bastare il fatto di potere fantasticare su di te
Cercar banali scuse per parlarti un po´
Sentir la voce che sognerò",Colpa del Sole

Sarà soltanto un colpo in più,
Un altro esercizio del cuore.
Una ragione di più per ritornare a cercare qualcuno che
È la vera metà di noi, che da qualche parte c´è.
Siamo tutti quanti in cerca d´amore,
Lupi solitari con un grande cuore
Aggrappati ad ali di illusioni
In cerca di emozioni, prigionieri liberi.

E non pensarci su c´è tempo per ricordare
La vita non si ferma qui e poi il cuore sa ricucire.
E un´altra storia sarà, senza saper se il domani la rivedrà
Storie vere di tutti noi che non finiscono mai
Dei cuccioli che giocano e si feriscono siamo noi
Che tante volte sbaglaino ma intanto crescono

Span,"Verse 1
They are rock'n'roll rebels
With tea in their bourbon bottles
All tightly dressed up in leather and shades
And they are cute streamline boys
With diamonds in their eyes suckers
I want to wear a guitar and be rough 
'cause it's in now days
Enough!!

Verse2
They want to conquer the world
With nothing but flashy tattoos
And I'm a bit surprised that so few see through
What they're trying to do
'Cause they all went shopping in the rock-star store
A copy of the big thing the week before
They get a hit then they make one more
Repeat the formula and make me bored

Span,"This feeling stings like a papercut
A constant draft from the door I can't shut
My legs are sleeping,
My body is weeping,
And I am searching.

An insatiable lust that can never be fulfilled
An annoying bug that I can never quite kill
A human disorder
A life on the border, the lack of a plan.

There is something lurking in the back of my mind
(inexplicably gone from my) my mind (inexplicably gone)
Vital information that can not be found.

I'm left here stripped of my own free will
My mind is set on this proverbial kill
As I fill my days with egocentric waste
Never evolving.

This powerful urge that is pulling me forth
A constant drive I am unable to ignore
Leaving my sleepless, holding my breath 
As my heart is pacing.

There is something lurking in the back of my mind
(inexplicably gone from my) my mind (inexplicably gone)
Vital information that can not be found

But I just can't leave it alone, 
Found,
But I just can't leave it alone,
Found

No, it can't be found

There is something lurking in the back of my mind

Span,"I never thought that what I said 
Could have so many meanings 
To her one voice is a harmony 
I try to say I care but no, 
It sounds like I don't mean it 
She thinks I'm a parody

And when she won't speak to me she doesn't tell me why 
I'm supposed to know what I've done wrong and make it right 

I think she's made of glass 
She breaks with the lightest touch 
And cuts me when I try to put her back together 
I twist myself to the best I can be 
But I never do enough 
I always do too much 

And when she tells me to leave all she wants is for me to stay 
And when she wants me to stay it's dangerous to leave 

When she stares at me I go down 
When that stare hits me I'm wrapped around 
When she stares I know it won't take long before I crawl 

The moments of hope are the moments of truth, 
With weapons laid aside 
And all is peace and beauty 
I could go on like that forever 
But the call was never mine 
She wins I'm the loser

She hears my words like they're doublecross-designed 
And every time she breaks she gets that cold and piercing eye 

When she stares at me I go down 
When that stare hits me I'm wrapped around 
When she stares I know it won't be long before I crawl 

She's freaking out 
I need a break 
Anything at all
Anything at all

I need something to calm her down 
Anything at all 
Anything at all
Anything at all

It's been like this for all my life 
Everywhere I go I tend to cause confusion 
I go for peace but end up with strife 
The belief in a clear statement 
Is a painful illusion 

Everywhere I stay there's someone asking me to leave 
And every time I leave there's someone asking me to stay 
And everywhere someone stares and then again 

When she stares at me I go down 
When that stare hits me I'm wrapped around 
When she stares I know it won't be long before I crawl",When She Stares

I really believed, that it was over..
I cried out my tears, through the night
I prayed, I'd never hold another

Legal, rocks, go ask your pops
Skip to my lue, drink my rum on rocks
'cause nobody knows the troubles I've been through
Who, who, who, yes it's the man in the middle wit oxy tan
And a little bit of clearer, sail
Jack and Jill went up the hill to buy a pack of franks
Crank up the piece we gotta win this race
These rhyme funkies gotta go to Pennsylvania
Moms always told me not to talk to any strangers
Lone ranger wit saddle, not, come on like Hector Camacho

Sware to God, on a stack of Bibles
Who stack a car, bass line sounds rubber
I can talk deep like the man Ron Harper
Knick knacks, raw tracks back to slam, whoa
Black Betty, lamb the lamb
So go wipe ya tails, 'cause you smell like doodie
Moo-moo-mookie, moo-moo-mookie

Hood times, turn into times in the ghetto
Gotta get the money, but I don't want to use a black metal
But it's temptin, times ain't hirin
Can't go to sleep, 'cause all I hear is police sirens
Street corners, wit black brothers is sellin crack
Nickel D.'s don't cost, 'cause he walks wit a big mack
Hard rock rules, it's easy to get in two
Robbin is a hobby, forget Bobby, 'cause we gettin clue
Someway, somehow, I gotta get it
These brothers I know'll set it off in a minute
Take the gats wit the quickness
Got a hand full of doves, so know you know what a brick is
Next door, they livin poor, they can't eat
Strong survive, but if you weak you sleep on the concrete
Wit blood stains, pants and shit stains
Neigborhood bums up in our alley playin fist games

Back at the crib, a little kid without a babysitter
Hood times, not good times, bad days
Crack head die, but not of crack, because he AIDS
Prostitution, what's the solution?
Blood tranfusion, ghetto execution
Branded buildings, lots full of stripped cars
I be damned if I live behind big bars
Save the homeless, that's just the slogan
Can't stop rape, I'm just givin out Trojan's
So pass the dice, 'cause I want to roll all sixes
One got fed, and pull out, so now he want to stick us
Shoplifters, better yet, boosters
A crew is a gang, and a gang is all troopers
No joke, you see the smoke from the gun blast
You better run fast...

[Chorus 2X]
[Timbo King]
In front of the projects, objects are fallen
Hit and run, drunk drivin leads to man troublin
I come from a place where nobody gives a fuck
'cause if you got what we want, point black, you got stuck
Buck buck buck, just what you heard on the streets
Little kids stealin Jeeps, just to make ends meet
If looks could kill, Billy be doin the government
In and out of trouble, causin trouble, he was a troubled kid
Last night I heard a scream... (Ahh!!)
'cause the only time I'm livin lovely is when I'm havin a dream
I got a dog that's wit roaches
'cause I'm livin next door to all the Rotts and the roaches
Word 'em up, 'cause it's the real thing baby
How to survive in the hoods, you gotta act crazy
I'm out here trynna get mines
Livin day by day in the episode of hood times

Boy, you should have told me that you had somebody else
across town. Oh boy, instead I heard it from a friend of

Near where the chartered Thames does flow,
And mark in every face I meet
Marks of weakness, marks of woe
In every cry of every man,
In every infant's cry of fear,
In every voice, in every ban,
The mind-forged manacles I hear.
How the chimney-sweeper's cry
Every blackening church appalls,
And the hapless soldier's sigh
Runs in blood down palace walls
But most, through midnight streets I hear
How the youthful harlot's curse
Blasts the new-born infant's tear
And blights with plagues the marriage hearse

We're cutting a baby out
With my grandmother's heirloom antler-handled carving knife
They were under her grand chandelier
Where we all, together, have shared holiday dinner
But it was your father that was holding the knife
Yeah, I begged you not to make me tell ya
Yeah, I pleaded with you to, to leave it alone

I told ya
I told you that you didn't want to know
What went on in my horrible dream
I was peering in through the picture window
It was a heart-warming tableau
Like a Norman Rockwell painting 

Until I zoomed in
I was making noises in my sleep
But you wouldn't believe me when I told ya 
That I wasn't with someone in my dream
Catfish were wriggling in blood and gore in the kitchen sink

Brand across your breast
Strain upon your back

Can your batteries replace this heart?
Lying in the yard
Wanted it to be natural love

Leaving only hearts to break

For stripped-down thrills.

Is acting as your go-between.
And for group encounters I'll hit buses,
Mobile homes, or trains to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
It's hard to make acquaintances in our big town;
Most eyes stare at nothing much at all.
But here comes Bob!

Born to queens or corporate entities.

She is better, and out of my life and it's too bad, too bad, it's too bad that...

She's been seen with Belmondo
Eating snails in some bistro
Seen in London and seen in Spain
Seen in L.A. with the Dodger team
Seen in Tokyo with Mifune
Having sushi and hot sake
Calm down, calm down, calm down

Where's my girl, I'm calmer now
Where's my girl, I want her now
A joke's a joke, I want her now

Sparks,"I've just come back from England
With astounding, scientific sort of news
There exist in England living creatures

Sure, it sounds fantastic though,

No no no, no not fair, it was England
Yes it was, it was England
Yes it was, it was in her coal

How was England weather? much like ours but with a moister sort of air.
Their communication? much like ours but with a drier sort of air.

Oh no, now he's hung in effigy
On no, why can't they just let him be

I know she's not just being mean when she screams

Skies are always gray

Somewhere there is hope
Somewhere there are dreams
Far from soot and smoke
Let's go surfing, babe
Tonight as we look at the moon and the stars
From our room with security bars
There's a westerly wind that is blowing both our minds
And both our feet
Walk through sand that's as white as the snow
Past the people named Kelley and Joe
Who have nothing in common with anyone we know
We know they're
Too Wagnerian
Too Shakespearian

Far from everything
Far from misanthropes

Wearing moth-eaten sweaters and gloves
We will open the window and feel an on-shore wind
A-blowing in

Paddle out 'til we can't see the sand
Spin around and drop into the wave we hope will never end

But I have no souvenirs of these crackerjack years
Not a moment I could choose
And not one offer that I could refuse

So when do I get to sing ""My Way""
When do I get to feel like Sinatra felt
When do I get to sing ""My Way""
In heaven or hell
So when do I get to do it my way
When do I get to feel like Sid Vicious felt
When do I get to sing ""My Way""
In heaven or hell","When Do I Get to Sing ""My Way"" [BBC Session]"

I was starting to fade,
'Til I woke to a cymbal crash.
I turned to my right,
You were gone, that's all right.
These platonic things are such a burn.
I walked out on the street,
While the big city lights
Tried to sell me on a way of life
I was already living.
Well, a limousine longer than
The Golden Gate Bridge
Pulled up along side me at the curb.
All the glass was blacked out,
so I knew there was somebody
Very important in there.
Then the door opened up
And a blonde in the shadows said:
""Get inside.""
And of course, I got inside.

Madonna, what 'cha gonna do?
Feelings only you can have,

And showed me all of her platinum records,
And of course there were a lot.
Then we sat on the sofa
And she turned on a classical station,
But the reception was poor.
And we sat there and talked,
And talked a little more,
And one thing lead to another;
As they often do in these situations.
All the stars are shining tonight for me.
All the stars are shining tonight, glory be.

In the morning
She fixed me a continental breakfast,
And then she said: ""Well, goodbye.""
And I said: ""Can I see you again?""

This escept is esssential to live another day",Splinters
Sparta,"Piece this together
And it's always a fight
This puzzles intact
And you're always right
The sky could fall
The bliss of beginning replaced with an end
The sky could fall
It's always the same

And it ends
From a scream to a whisper
Can you free me from these words and let me forget?
Can you free me from this world and help me forget?

Tensioning trouble
We're condemned to repeat
From covered-up lies
What is all out of reach
The sky could fall
The bliss of beginning replaced with an end
It's always the same
I can't be right this time
It's all in my head
You can't be wrong this time
It's all in your head",Tensioning
Sparta,"Did you listen to his stories?
He had some stories that would change your life
This doesn't have to be the saddest day
We can always hold the brilliant memories
You're always on my mind
Turned from tragedy
A source to draw from
A bloodline legacy

You showed me more than just these railways
It was your passion, and I learned that well
You gave me more in life than anyone deserves
And forever, I'll keep your bloodline legacy
And you're always on my mind

This photography, I'll carry to my grave
I never lost so much as I did that day

I miss you",Travel by Bloodline
