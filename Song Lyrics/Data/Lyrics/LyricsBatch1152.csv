Satan's Teardrops,"Little girl don't you want to stay?
I want to be your lover man
All by myself
All by myself

I don't need no one to love you
I'm gonna love you all by myself

You'll find, little girl, you know it too,
Don't you know I'm in love with you
All by myself
All by myself.

I don't want no one to love you
I want to love you all by myself

Meet me in the parlor 'bout half past one,
We'll go on down and have some fun
All by ourselves,
All by ourselves,
We don't need nobody with us
We gonna do it all by ourselves.

Satanic Surfers,"We gather here to dance and play through the night until the dawn of a new day, sweating out our anger, singing to soothe our pain, drowning our sorrow in a sea of joy and laughter, forgetting for an hour but we both know that real change comes from action, and depends more on what we do when we wake up tomorrow. can't sit there with our asses glued to a couch in front of our television pacified in this position entertainment to hold us in submission

Satanic Surfers,"How could I believe in what you said?
How could I be so fucking blind?
I was thinking with my stupid heart
And not with my wicked mind

Why am I so stupid to believe in what you say?
Why? Tell Me Why!

I wish I could change everything
Back to the way it used to be
But no one in this world can turn back time
No not even precious little me

Why am I so stupid to believe in what you say?
Why? Tell Me Why!

I am such a fool to believe in you
Now everything is wrong and what can I do
You put the blame on me
I put the blame on you
Won't you tell me why?!",Why?
Satchel,"Whenever I
Walk on your breath
I'd hope you'd remember
Every word I said
Yea, some by the way have died
And that's trouble with art
Playin' in affairs of the heart
And Hollywood
Is so temperamental, my dear
Where are they now?
All of your friends have fallen by the wayside, my dear
They've all gone home
Whenever I lay down
Hoping to remember anything
To prove that she was ever around
I feel that I would fall into
A failed haze, for all
But out here they don't want me
Back at home they don't want you
Out here I have found
Where the trees are green
(Tell you what we've seen in the meantimeâ€¦)",Hollywood
Satchel,"I just want to taste it
I just wanna feel it too

Satchel,"Why did we ever put up with you
How could we all be so blind?
A lesson in life to last a lifetime
Always and everytime
Hold on with patience, my love
For the present I'm thinking of
Do what you will, what you must
Deserving of my love and trust

Tell me a story
Tell me another one please
I'm sure we'd all love to hear it, go ahead

Satchmo Legacy Band,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Satellite Party,"And it's true that I do fantasize about you
Last night made me feel as real as the forces of nature
Calling me yours eternally
Your bona fide lover, you're changing my hard life forever

Returning to the earth back to their mortal coils

Stay with me, dear, until last night's [Incomprehensible]

When ever spring breaks through again

Will come to me
Though my world may go awry

Memories that must fade

Sathima Bea Benjamin,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Sathima Bea Benjamin,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Sathima Bea Benjamin,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Sathima Bea Benjamin,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new

Sathima Bea Benjamin,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

I can't see anyone but you

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You
Sathima Bea Benjamin,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

Saturday Looks Good to Me,"When they started counting down
I could not believe that you were fast asleep
And I felt like those flashing lights
On the ocean floor, at the liquor store
It's not the type of secret that you want to keep too long
Look for me but I'll be gone
Take your love and step it down
Spin around the room 'til you have to choose
Maybe I'll pick both of them
Maybe neither one
Maybe Emerson
Every time the phone rings it sounds like a song
Look for me and I'll be gone
You can't sing to save your life
Through the alcohol
Drinking champagne off the walls
It looks like after all
They still talk about us like they've got nothing else to do
It could have been lines
And after all this time
They'll still talk about us like we're not even in the room
Outside the birds sing
Louder than the phone rings
Every night you fall asleep with your headphones on
Look for me and I'll be gone",Alcohol
Saturday Looks Good to Me,"I'm standing in a line
I been trying to find that girl of mine
I'm crying all the time
I been trying to find that girl of mine

But you're still at the bar
Handing out those photocopied pictures of your heart
And as cute as they are
They can't conceal your automatic eyes

With the mercury inside
I'm stranded here all night
I been trying to find that girl of mine
I'm picking dandelions

I been trying to find that girl of mine
I'm crying every night
Because of that girl of mine
I threw away all of my valentines

But you're still at the bar
Handing out those photocopied x-rays of your heart
But as fine as they are
They never hide your carbon copy eyes

With the wrecking ball inside.",Girl of Mine
Saturday Looks Good to Me,"Beside the drum kit in the basement
I was trying to get to sleep
I heard your voice come through the floorboards
On my answering machine
But by the time I reached the phone's ring
The only thing still singing was the dialtone

I couldn't find you in my dreams
So I went out into the night
I heard you talking somewhere soft
Your voice bounced off a satellite
But by the time I reached the place
From where the sound originated
You were gone

But I smelled summer in those letters
That you sprayed with your perfume
I breathed your breath
And I was left swaying with the curtains in the room
In the knowledge you would leave me
Beneath the angry April moon where you first found me

You've got one too many lovers
But you're still my only friend
And you got more secret admirers
Than there are snakes in the garden
And by the time you're finished kissing
Whoever's come around hissing
You're spitting out poison

And all the people have their reasons
For the things they think they have to do
But none of the reasons you're speaking
Sound anything like the truth

Each one sounds like a composite
Each one sounds like a new excuse for letting go
So let go
If all that's left is letting go

As the x-ray clearly shows
This thing was broken long ago

The bars will close
And the ashtrays overflow

I won't be there on Thursday night
But I hope you all have fun
You may not recognize my absence
But I won't be the only one
Who goes missing from your party
As the stitches come undone",Dialtone

But my house ain't got no ceiling
And my heart won't hold no lies
I'm not like everybody that you talk to
And I just might shoot your helicopter
Right out of the sky
I was so excited I would fall down in a pile
I'm always reminded every time I see you smile
Walking by I see you through your window

You're higher than a fever
And there's something on your mind
You're daydreaming through another winter
But the dreams that you keep leaning on
Have got to wait this time
I was so excited but that only lasts a while
I'm always reminded, now you're walking down the aisle

Baby, baby you make me so nervous
I think you do it on purpose
And you know you do

Lately I just don't think that it's worth it
Better call the taxidermist

I've felt removed from you for incredibly long.
And coming home to empty rooms again
If these walls could speak, I'd say nothing to them.

I know it's not a good excuse
But I was busy sleeping while you were soaked in misery.
That's why I didn't notice you
But now I'm awake enough to see that you should be happy.
Not just content with me.

This is my song for all the bitter words I've said to you.
Can I ever make it up, recognizing apologies just aren't enough?
This is my plea to you.

Up until now I haven't had to miss you
Because I've been away doing something else.
So I never enjoyed the rain
Because every time it did I'd just walk away.

At least they're for real and right now that's good enough for me.

For every time an hour goes by I wish one hundred times.
If I had more guts I probably give it a try.
Sometimes I feel all I've got are stupid dreams.

Yo Puff Daddy
Get off me
Ladies & gentlemen
You're about to witness something that you've never witnessed before
Sauce Money's in the house & he brought his man with him

I leave rap in a state of shock
Where to rock, from the figures still
Play the block with my niggas
Ill lush, game 20 pounds, but all my niggas still crush
Still stack chips galore
Chicks want out the ghetto, try to hit you raw
Better know that everything I love - roll back
Cop my first gold plaque, soon as my man blew
Still spittin' the fly, hits you can't do nigga
You ain't gainin', you game in, barely maintainin'
I push fly whips without strainin', my cliques smother
Get tougher, hits rougher, Puff is deep in the streets like Chris Tucker
My wrists cluster, on a mobile
P-Diddy, rap mogul, thought I told you that we don't stop
Thought I told you that when I drop, platinum plaques
I cop, push Bentley's without the tops, nigga

[Chorus] (Puff Daddy)

Try to see if you see what I see
Give my game & spit my G
When it's all done, stack, funds, & I'm the one
On top is where I be
Tell me, do you see what I see?
(When I look in your eyes, I see you hatin' inside, so tell me)
Do you see what I see?

No secret, undefeated, I'm top seeded
Whenever I drop hits, you don't want it, you need it
This a hot joint from Sauce, you feel cheated
Unanimous decision, love the way I freak it
Brooklyn, shogun, beat the 4-1
Niggas want to bite off my flow son
I don't think no one, got that, rock a hot track
Like me, nice to the Sauce? Naw
Spit rounds, it's rough did I mention the thorough?
BK forever representin' my borough
Push fly whips, quick to stack my chips
Too easy for you to understand my hits
When the album drops every pocket hold some
Sauce motherfuckin' forever, I told son
Hypnotic, heard the ? war 'fore I shot it
Better cop it, cause all that fly shit, I got it

[PD]
I took rap by the throat & locked it
P-Diddy fixed all those who tried to stop it
Some of y'all tried to blast off, but couldn't rock it
If my flow ain't like a door, how could you knock it?

[Sauce Money] (PD)
As a matter of fact, yo don't you hate that? (hate that)

Mad at you, just because they whack (they whack)

Play your cards right you'll be driving the 6

Popping the Crist, shit hoppin' outta your wrist

It's a shame but, a lot been change since we came up
I used ta run wit them, now I got my guns for them
Treat my hollows like trash, strait dumpin' 'em
Sauce Money show niggaz no love when I come for them
They thought they left a real nigga on his ass black
And that my numbers wouldn't rise like Nasdaq
And gotta re-half that, just pass that
We 'gon clash black for playin' the middle like ya ass crack
You can ball ova here, I play pass that
Exotic cats love ta talk peace when you blast back
No more fair ones, know you shot enuff of them
Don't really want to do it, now you gotta fuck wit 'em
I'ma shit everytime that I hear ???
And make ya real ugly like bitter beer face
Sendin' fake thugs back ta the essence
Since my Rolex was a gift, there's no betta time than the present

Hit the streets lookin' like you a betta disquise
Get a grip, I'm the preacher, you dance wit the devil
Whoever my eyes focus on is not on my level
Not even close, ex-girlfriends hatin' ta see it
You can give me brain or get out, take it or leave it
Relax wit side who, max wit my crew
Operation gettin' money, that's what I do
Insecure artists pay me not ta spit
Show me fake love and then try ta fly if they hit
They could feel it in they bones, 'cause when I drop my shit
All hell'll break loose, that's how hot I get
I rock big in the summer, witout missin' the block
When I want to get M, then I listen ta Pac
Scarface when I'm laid back, whippin' the 3
If I want to hear that shit, then I listen ta me
Stick in the key, turn the knob and open the door

Hit 'em wit that Marcy maneuver, makin' 'em droppin'
I ain't met one yet make me take her shoppin'
But I might 'cause I gotta lotta cash ma
Platinum Navigator glock when the stash ha

I'm that nigga, one you can't even crush
Type of cat shit in your crib and don't even flush
Kind of nigga when you see him that you wantin to touch
On some Russell Simmons shit, but ain't in no Rush
Cause when the shit hit the fan, who the hell can you trust?
Duckin the blow? Really? Where the fuck can you go?
Who the fuck can you get when I'm ready to spit
When you hear my name I make you hate spaghetti and shit
Spit and aim with the fifth, if I get caught in a lie
Ten shots light you up like the 4th of July
I don't need your help, bitch, I got support from the sky
Quite fluid, I'm a definite, you might do it
Bitches, guns and ones, got a right to it
Fuck up against the wall, I send your ass right through it
Tattooed like Mike did it, leave you lightheaded
Swear to God, y'all niggas better act like Christ said it

Hey yo yo who the hell this Sauce nigga think he talkin to, man?
Arrogant bastard
Chubby motherfucker
You think you alla that, man?
I can't even stand to hear this shit no more, man

Hey you know what motherfuckers?  It don't stop there
I'ma solidify my rap spot til it's not fair
Nothin to do with it, niggas say, ""I'm glad it was them""
Somethin to do with it, niggas gon' be glad it was them
Inspire men, or some R&B shit and fire ten
With Mya in it, gettin head from the way the tires spin
My whole circle is hot, like when the dryer spin
You just a cub nigga, trapped off in a lion's den
Lookin for love? Fuck you, you found hate, stupid
I run with a 112 kids who raped Cupid
Plus got head, see my eyes, bloodshot red
Hands where I can cee like Busta said
I lead by example, nigga - must I led?
Last thing you hear is shots and every cuss I said
Real niggas walkin away, paramedics walkin your way
Crackin jokes while I'm talkin to Jay
Gettin head from four dimes from New York in a day
This flow here is stainless, what you thought it was clay?
Thought it was gold?  Only thing it bought was your soul
Split your wig, then confuse you for that fork in the road
I don't play with wack rappers, I slay wack rappers
Only aim to decay and spray wack rappers
If niggas want to front, and say fuck my shit
Don't buy my album, fuck you and suck my dick

Better forget it, just to be specific
Cause if you the one, then I'm too terrific
Better relax, 'fore you get it twisted
It's to the death now, if you make the shitlist

Forget your lingo, and how you primadonna niggas mingle
I'm real money, fold up, you funny money, jingle
News flash, here's a hot-ass item to bring you
Had a car, Roley, and house before my first single
I know how y'all niggas roll, quiet as a tear
My album ain't even dropped, and I'm writer of the year
I got shit, find me in your record store under 'hot shit'
While you register, under 'not shit'
I drop hits in the streets and triggers'll blow
Show after show, watch him, big as I roll
We all know the rules, fool, jewels, bitches and dough
Did you hear?  I'm the fattest, nicest nigga you know
And I kill a muthafucka just to gain a buck
Confuse niggas, bust guns, and aim to duck
If you happen to sell half weight your game is luck
Who write for who?  y'all sound the same, lame as fuck
Can't control it, tried to sell it, heard it the way you told it
Who bought it?  And if you sold it?  Extort it
For somethin I might have smoked, roll it
Never get grimy as me, I fuck a rattle snake if a nigga hold it
I got both sides of the fence in minute
I got hits with Jay, Clark, Primo, and none of my wheels is rented
I got a smash with Puff bout to drop any minute",Middle Finger U
Sauce Money,"y'all muthafuckas want me to stop?
Oh, I'll stop, muthafucka
But you gotta do somethin for me
Say Unkle
(Say Unkle)
Better hurry up

Ah-ah, fuck it, it's too late

I kicks it, oh yeah
Click, spit, don't care
Never see me no mere
Lot of niggas know me
Few hoes blow me
Nigga stay low-key
Sauce Money Faculty, reppin shit for my homies
Def, now we ride, cats screamin ""I'm it!""
That's just too bad, that's the hit I'm with
Been a lot of places, seen a lot of niggas
Lot of different faces, most of them killers
Counted lot of figures, niggas know I'm raw
Off day for sure, packin a .44
Gather round the lightning, now you feelin the volts
Might not see me, but you see the results
Everybody talkin, take a listen, back now
Bullshit cats, muthafuckas dissin that now
One thing I know, never kind of, sort of
Fuck you and that bitch nigga with you, fool, in that order

[ CHORUS ]
Niggas better play dead, let go Play-Doh
I'm about to spray now, fuckin with (aiyo)
Sauce Money my nigga, they don't want no drama
Muthafuckas, we killers, I put that on my mama
Diamond ring shinin, bitches say it's so nice
Sauce Muthafuckin, now she's shakin all night
Non-stop, we get the place cracklin
From North, West, South, East and back again

[ VERSE 2 ]
Niggas know I rock, spittin for my riches
Representin my block, this is for my bitches
Seems as though we next, laughin at you haters
900 CX, platinum Navigators
Since my hits is so hot, now I'm keepin a toast
Niggas ain't about shit, usually speakin the most
Tons of sons kick in your door, nigga, so run your funds
What's done is done, I don't see no one's and you see my guns
That's how I roll, niggas like we know
Hit the spot heavily armed, me and Reno
Hemmed up with three hoes, sippin on a bottle
Cut a check, suck a dick, that's my motto
Like it, love it, fuck it, I'm Sauce Money for life
Keep my circle real tight cause I know niggas is trife
Plottin from long-range to hit me for my figures
But till the day I lay this is strictly for my niggas

[ CHORUS ]

Sammy Sosa slugger, hip-hop nigga, touch em all
Some cute, but suck em all, I say fuck em all
Eat a dick too, soloist choose another route
G.H. form now, go and break my brother out
Henny out the bottle, nigga, eyes low in the truck
Nothin but that good smoke, hydro in the dutch
Ain't no probably, Sauce Money, fool, got to be
Chicken eggs grits, California, call it Oscar E.
Everything I spit hot, baby boy, you're kiddin me?
Hit Flex with it, Stretch with it, then Mr. Cee
Marley Marl Sunday night, can't forget Kid Capri
Hit the turnpike where all my niggas down in Philly be
Just passin through, son, still many guns to cock
30 miles from the bridge where anyone can cop
Chillin at my bitch crib, sip plenty rum and scotch
Put it in the air for them niggas Biggie, Pun and Pac

[ CHORUS ]
Haters frontin in the club
Real gees show us love
Bust slugs for my nigga
(We gonna rock)
Anywhere we do shows
Come through, two hoes
Killers with new flows, playa
(We gonna rock)
Even when eyes low from hydro
Can't another brother cock-block my flow
(We gonna rock)
Can't stop our ones
Can't block our guns
Get your triggers
And squeeze for these Faculty niggas

[ VERSE 2 ]
Haters hate me cause I'm a big nigga with mass appeal
They can suck a dick with ghonorrhea and that's for real
Ain't no secrets, muthafuckas know I might clap the steel
Be ready any given time, I'm like grab the wheel
Let the window down slow, kid just bought the farm
Two chicks in a Yugo, damn, it's a false alarm
Not on this joint, Sauce usually calm with the grammar
But right now I'm like baking soda, armed with a hammer
Summertime comin, now they wonder what I drive next
Represent for big niggas, 3-4-5-X
Wide body jeeps, little dimes puff the herb slow
Know the drill, bubblegum, rubbers in the 3rd row
SUV tinted out, frontin on the hands-free
Real gees happy for me, haters like 'it can't be'
Fighter and a lover, worst enemy or your brother
Just don't forget to call me Dad too cause I'm a motherfucker

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I know bitches who love Sauce for the dicko, straight Gorilla
Fatally, more than likely take at least eight to kill a-
ddicted to my flow, doggy style ain't the way I make my scrilla
[Name], [Name], [Name], [Name], those my niggas
Hit the club half-cocked, niggas shoulda knew me better
Jim Star dillinger, that's under my Gucci sweater
Through the crowd thugged out, took my stance and I spit
Screamed on this one chick like, ""Bitch, dance to my shit""
Part the club with elbows, bump a nigga, love that
Nigga read my eyes and it said 'step the fuck back'
This Gorilla Hill shit, we don't give two fucks
On Gorilla Hill, kid, you tryin to do too much
Must've had a sixth sense, how he knew I clutch chrome?
Probably this a big bitch, front and left his nuts home
Fuck that weak Gotti shit, nigga, let your shotie spit
Sauce Muthafuckin, get your punk-ass body whipped

On the low love the dough between my publish and bigga
Is it wroth a million yet that's what they say now

Do one for money Sauce keep thirst alive
Like the shit filled with fam when I invent that hit
Like to scream Rocafella when and repersent that shit

Late night I hit these hoes while their peoples asleep
I like to wake up in the afternoon religuosly

I like to tell fake thugs man they soft as nerves
Like they drink infront of the heat and take off the skirt
Like when chicks try to make it seam to provoke me the hitter
Handle that diplomatic and try to fuck their sister

Like to stay away from hoes I heard caught a diesease
Like to do shows then hit bums off of some cheese
Everything I spit blaze now us in this week

I like to ride shotgun, roll my dro' in the coop
Like to go gold with you and hold my guns on the stoop
Like to shoot whack rappers and get away with the crime
Like to bag shorties tried to fuck me two at a time
Like to see that bitch nigga who alarmin the cops
Only reason I pull heat infront of his mom and pops

Yo, I'm roaming one man deep, combing the streets
And beat boxing, like the field niggas, singing hymns picking cotton
With massive watts and tickle eardrums wit pleasure
Every single measure apply, exact amount of pressure

What was fastened by the spit, rashing
For its catalytic fashion, showing its passion
For harassing microphones, pass it to the left
And left my nigga bless it

For narcotic cops to mark me inside of the shark bar

Through rhyme form, solely for poetic penetration
Subliminal in this world it minimal ventilation
The task-master dome to gas mask from a clinic

Saul Lubaroff,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Saul Lubaroff,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Saul Williams," 

Acid-wash Guess with the leather patches
Sportin' the white Diadoras with the hoodie that matches
I'm wearing two Swatches and a small Gucci pouch
I could have worn the Lugi but I left it in the house
Now, my niggas Duce and Wayne got gold plates with their names
With the skyline on it with the box link chain
I'm wearing my frames
They match my gear with their tint
And you know Lagerfields is the scent

Now, my nigga Rafael just got his jeep out the shop
Mint green sidekick, custom-made rag top
""Strictly Business"" is the album that we play
""You're A Customer""; the pick of the day
Now there's a nigga on the block, never seen him before
Selling incence and oil, my man thinks that he's the law
But why on earth would this be on their agenda?
As he slowly approaches the window..

""Uh, uh, I've seen you before, I've been you and more
I was the one bearing the pitcher of water
I rent the large upper room
Furnished with tidings of your doom
Or pleasure, whichever feathers[?] decree.""
Yo Ralph is he talking to me?
""No I'm talking to the sea son's resurrected
I'm the solstice of the day
I bring news from the blues of the Caspian""
My man laughs, he's one them crazy motherfuckers
Turn the music back up - 'cause I'm the E-Double'
""Wait, but but but but I know the volume of the sea
And sound waves as I will
Will you allow me to be at your service?""
My man Ralph is nervous. He believes
That this strange tongue deceives
And maybe he's been informed that
He's pushing gats hidden in the back, beneath the floor mats
Come on Jack, we don't have time
For your bullshit or playin
A'salaam a something' or another
""Wait isn't Juanita your mother?
I told you I know you, now grant me a moment""

At the gates of Atlantis we stand
Ours is the blood that flowed from the palms of his hands
on the plow till earth
till I'm now
Moon cycles revisited, womb fruit of the sun
Full moon of occasions wave the wolves where they run
And they run towards the light casting love on the winds
As is the science of the aroma of sleeping women
Lost in his eyes they soon reflect my friend's are grinning
But I'm a pupil of his sight
The wheels are spinning
Yo I'll see ya'll later on tonight

In the beginning her tears where the long awaited rains
Of a parched Somali village
Red dusted children danced shadows
In the newfound mound of mascara that eclipsed her face
Reflected in the smogged glass of carlos east street bodega
Learning to love, she had forgotten to cry
Seldom hearing the distant thunder in her lovers ambivalent sighs
He was not honest
She was not sure
A great grandmother
Had sacrificed the family's clarity for God in the late 1800's
Nonetheless she had allowed him to mispronounce her name
Which had eventually led to her misinterpreating her own dreams
And later doubting them
But
The night was young
She the firstborn daughter of water faced darkness and smiled
Took mystery as her lover
And raised light as her child

Man that shit was wild you should have seen how they ran
She woke up in an alley with a gun in her hand
Tupac in lotus form
Ennis'[?] blood on his hands
She woke up on a vessel
The land behind her
The sun within her
Water beneath her
Mushed corn for dinner
Or was it breakfast
Her stomach turned as if a compass
She prayed towards east and lay there breathless
They threw her overboard for dead
She swam silently and fled
Into the blue sea
La soh fa mi, re do, si
The seventh octave
I don't mean to confuse you
Many of us have been taught to sing
And so we practice scales
Many of us were born singing
And thus were born with scales
Mermaids, cooks, and fieldhands
Sang a nightsong by the forest
And the ocean was the chorus
In Atlantis where they sang
Those thrown overboard had overheard
The mystery of the undertow
And understood that down below
There would be no more chains
They surrendered breath and name
And survived countless as rain
I'm the weather man
The clouds say storm is coming
A white buffalo was born
Already running
And if you listen very close
You'll hear a humming
Beneath the surface of our purpose lies
Rumors of ancient man
Dressed in cloud face minstrels in the sky
The moon's my mammy
The storm holds my eye
Dressed in westerlies [?]
Robed by robes ol' man river knows my name
And the reason you were born
Is the reason
That I came

Then she looks me in the face
And her eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends, hearts rate increase
Emcees look me in the face and their eyes get weak
Pulse rates descends hearts rate increase
It's like ""beam me up, Scottie"", I control your body
I'm as deadly as AIDS when it's time to rock a party
We all rocked fades, fresh faded in ladidadi - and when we rock the mic
Ignore the feminine side - we rock the mic

I presented my feminine side with flowers
She cut the stems and placed them gently down my throat
And these two lips might soon eclipse your brightest hopes",1987
Saul Williams,"I don't know whether to laugh or cry
and I don't know whether to live or die
I kept my love for her locked deep inside
it cuts like a knife
she's out of my life
out of my life, out of my hair
out of my mind, there's no love in there
I move on, move on

dear God, I wasn't breast fed
and most of my conversations with men seem to revolve around music
I'm no musician but the pain has been instrumental
my sense finally tune the instruments of - of - of
of being lonely, of being lost, of being loved, of being human
man I could use a metaphor but I can't get beyond this shit
I could use someone to talk to
but most of my conversations with men seem to revolve around music

I am a poet who composes what the world proses

I kept my love for her locked deep inside
and I don't know what to do
to get it through to you
get out of my life tonight
get out of my life
out of my life, out of my hair
out of my mind, 'cause no lovin' fair
I move on, move on

she had nothing but time on her hands
silver rings, turquoise stones and purple nails
I rub my thumb across her palm
a featherbed where slept a psalm
yay though I walked, I used to fly, and now we dance
I watch my toenails blacken and walk a deadened trance
'til she woke me with the knife edge of her glance
I have the scars to prove the clock strikes with her hands

and I don't know what to do

exactly how much is it gonna cost to free Mumia?
what's he gonna do with his freedom? talk on the radio?
radio programming is just that - a brainwashin' gleamed of purpose
to be honest, some freedom of speech makes me nervous
and you looking for another martyr in the form of a man
hair like a mane with an outstretched hand
in a roar of hearts, thoughts, reactionary defensiveness and counter 
intelligence
what exactly is innocence?

your belief system ain't louder than my car system
nigga walked down my block with his rotwiler, a subwoofer on a leash

the DJ spins a new philosophy into a barren mind
I can't front on it
my head nods as if to clear the last image from an etch-a-sketch
something like Rakim said- I could quote any emcee, but why should I?
how would it benefit me? karmic repercussions
are your tales of reality worth their sonic laced discussions?
suddenly, the ground shivers and quakes
a newborn startles and wakes
her mother rushes to her bed side to hold her to her breast
milk of sustenance heals and nourishes
from the depths of creation life still flourishes

I slept once, The dream has yet to end
It was a purple evening such as this, the curtains had been pulled by a hand unattached 
I lay propped on a pillow of eagle feathers on a couch framed with the skeletons of my uncles and great uncles 
I did not intend to close my eyes but then I did 
The night is falling on the moist palms of children too weak to bear it's weight 
The stars are visibly breathing in fact they almost look as if they are chewing gum 
The moon is crescented on both sides while its center remains unseen
I can faintly hear my mother calling me, or is that my sister singing songs of the railroad?
Robeson is reflected in a floating mirror 
Then I realize that the mirror is not floating but being pulled by a white horse and in great golden chariot, the horse has human feet
I look down at my feet and they are hooves. When I look up it is no longer night, the sun covers the entire sky as if it were stretched to reach all corners, flames are visible but not threatening.
A girl brushes my knee with her tail, she is wearing pink overalls and rollerblades, she signals for me to follow her, as soon as I take a step towards her I'm flying.

There are rocky mountains below me, I decide to land in a small settlement between mountains 
A man walks up to me, he is my father but he introduces himself as John Galt. I ask him if he is the Reverend John Galt. we begin to say the Lord's prayer together, the whole world seems to join in 
The mountains have mouths; 
I am standing at an altar, it takes a second to realize I'm getting married
The woman beside me, my bride, is sitting in lotus position on an Indian silk pillow
She is holding a white umbrella over her head, I cannot see her, I keep whispering to her, It's okay love, it's okay love? and she keeps shushing me, and shushing me, 
I'm wearing a backpack I decide to take it off and open it up, It's filled with colouring books and I keep thinking 
""I have to be done in time to pick Saturn up from school, I have to be done in time to pick Saturn up from school, I have to be done in time
To pick Saturn up from school"" 

My darling Saturn I seem to break your heart daily, how could I ever neglect to hug you 
You are a planet hugged by a rainbow, forgive me
I sometime become so consumed in the travails of my own heart that I neglect yours 
And there is no greater crime I will never commit it again, for there is no other adultery
You are my child, God's gift to the world God's will be done, I love you.",Robeson

Oh ah oh

[Saul Williams]
Children of the night
Only some will star the sky
Only believers in death will die
And fathers must feather the wings of women
For the unfeathered masses dangle ridiculous
Carrying crosses to phalanx filled tombs
The future sells silence through blood rivered wombs
That ripple with riddles of cows and spoons and births
Moons and earths
Sun-centered at noon

[Esthero]

And here I stand
Court jestering infinity
Fetal fisted for revolution
But open hands birth humility
Now what you the density of an ego-less planet?
Must my spine be aligned to sprout wings?
I'm slouched into sling steps and kangoled with gang reps
But my orbit rainbows Saturn rings
Mystical elliptical
Presto Polaris
Karmic flamed future when Saturn's and Aries
And now I'm a fish called father
With gills type dizzy
Blowing liquid lullabies through the spine of time
I'm certain of Saturn's rivers and all else is fact
So baptize me in the stars
And wrap me in nighttime
Moon blue
Pupil my sight with orange balls of light
And echo my plight
Through the corridors of metaphor
What else are we living for if not to create
Fiction and rhyme?
My purpose is to make my soul
Rhyme with my
Mind over matter
Minds create matter
Minds create fiction
As a matter of fact
As if matter were fact
Matter is fact
So spirit must be fiction

Swirl me beyond sometimes
Drench me water proof
Let eve drop forever
Rain sunsets on my roof
As I sit on the front porch of my sanity
Deciphering ham bones to van gogh this vanity
Oiled egos
Canvased and framed
To be reborn unborn unburied unnamed

Saul Williams,"The fiery sun of my passions 
Evaporates the love lakes of my soul 
Clouds my thoughts and rains you into existence 
As I take flight on bolts of lighting 
Claiming chaos as my concubine and you as my me 

I of the storm you of the sea 
We of the moon land of the free 
What have I done to deserve this? am I happy? 
Happiness is a mediocre sin set for a middle-class existence 
I see through smiles and smell truth in the distance 
Beyond one dimensional smiles and laughter 
Lies are hereafter where tears echo laughter 
You'd have to do math to divide a smile 

By a tear times fear equals mere truth. 
I simply delve in the air and if that's the case, 
All I have to breath and all else will follow, 
That's why drums are hollow, and I like drums drums 

Are good but I can't think straight 
I lack the attention span to meditate 
My attention spans galaxies here and now are immense 
Seconds are secular, moments are mine, 

Self is illusion, music's divine. 
Noosed by the strings of jimmy's guitar 
I swing purple hazed pendulum 
Hypnotizing the part of I that never dies

Look into my eyes are the windows of the soul. 
It's fried chicken collies and cornbread, 
Its corn milk flour sour cream eggs and oil. 
Its the stolen blood of the earth

Used to make cars run and kill the fish. 
Who me? I play scales. 
The scales of dead fish of oil slicked seas 
My sister blows wind through the hollows of fallen tress 

And we are the echoes of eternity, 
Echoes of eternity, echoes of eternity maybe you heard of us, 
We do rebirths, revokes and resurrections 
We threw basement parties in pyramids

I left my tag on the wall, 
The beats would echo of the stone 
And solidify into the form of light bulbs, 
Destined to light of the heads of future generations 

They're releasing it up in the form of OM. 
Maybe you heard of us. 
If not then you must be trying to hear us, 
In such cases we can't be heard 

We remain in the darkness unseen, 
In the center of unpeeled bananas we exist uncolored by perception, 
Clothed to the naked eye, 
Five senses cannot sense the fact of our existence 

And that's the only fact, 
In fact there are no facts, fax me a fact and I'll telegram 
I'll hologram I'll telephone the son of man and tell him he is done. 
Leave a message on his answering machine 

Telling him there are none. 
God and I are one. 
Times moon times star times sun, 
The factor is me, you remember me, 

I slung amethyst rocks on Saturn blocks 
'Til I got caught up by earthling cops. 
They wanted me for their army or whatever. 
Picture me, I swirl like the wind tempting tomorrow to be today, 

Tiptoeing the fine line between everything and everything else. 
I am simply Saturn swirling sevenths through sooth 
The sole living air of air and I, and, and all else follows. 
Reverberating the space inside of drum hollows. 

Package and bottles and chips 
And tomorrow then sold to the highest nigga. 
I swing to the tallest tree, 
Lynched by the lowest branches of me

Praying that my physical will set me free 
Cause I'm afraid that all else is vanity 
Mere language is profanity, 
I'd rather hum or have my soul tattooed to my tongue 

And let the scriptures be sung in gibberish 
As words be simple fish in my soulquarium. 
And intellect can't swim so I stopped combing my mind 
So my thoughts could lock. 

I'm tired of trying to understand. 
Perceptions are mangled matted and knotted anyway. 
Life is more than what meet the eye and I, 
So elevate I to the third and even that shit seems absurd 

And your thoughts leave you third (eye)solated. 
No man is an island but I often feel alone, 
So I find peace through OM.",Untimely Meditations

and I ain't gonna lie it
be to hard to deny it
I ain't from your block and never had to deal with your shit
never had a glock never kept it real with no bit
and when I saw a nigga like you, son I practically hit
'cause you did what you did and I wasn't the kid
don't give a fuck now, I be the first one to playa hate
the eye of the needle set the record straight
and I retire late, retire late, retaliate, retaliate
and I be fishin' on that same star you be wishin' on
make you move son, you know the mission's on
so never question who I am, God knows
and I know God personally
in fact he lets me call him me
in fact he lets me call him me

never question who I am, God knows
and I know God personally
in fact she lets me call her me
in fact she lets me call her me

Chorus (x6)

I can recite the grass on the hill and memorize the moon
I know the cloudforms of love by heart
and have brought tears to the eye of a storm
and my memory banks vaults of  forests and amazon river banks
and i've screamed them into sunsets that echo in earthquakes
shadows have been my spotlight as I monologue the night and dialogue with days
soliloquies of wind and breeze applauded by sun rays
we put language in zoos to observe caged thought
and tossed peanuts and p-funk at intellect
and motherfuckers think these are metaphors
i speak what I see
all words and worlds are metaphors of me
my life was authored by the moon
footprints written in soil
the fountain pen of martian men
novelling human toil
and yes, the soil speaks highly of me
but earth seeds root me poet-tree
now, maybe i'm too serious
too little here to matter
though i'm riddled with the reason of the sun
i stand up comets with the audience of lungs
this body of laughter is it with me or at me?
hue more or less though gender's mute
and the punch line has this lifeline at it's root
i'm a star this life's the suburbs, I commute

Chorus (x2)",Wine
Saul Williams,"This is a call out to all the youth in the ghettos, suburbs, villages, townships. To all the kids who download this song for free. By any means. To all the kids short on loot but high on dreams. To all the kids watching T.V., like, ""Yo, I wish that was me."" And all the kids pressing rewind on Let's Get Free. I hear you. To all the people within the sound of my voice.

I didn't vote for this state of affairs. My emotional state's got me prostrate, fearing my fears. In all reality I'm under prepared. 'Cause I'm ready for war but not sure if I'm ready to care. And that's why I'm under prepared. 'Cause I'm ready to fight, but most fights have me fighting back tears. 'Cause the truth is really I'm scared. Not scared of the truth, but just scared of the length you'll go to fight it. I tried to hold my tongue, son. I tried to bite it. I'm not trying to start a riot or incite it. 'Cause Brutus is an honorable man. It's just coincidence that oil men would wage war on an oil rich land. And this one goes out to my man, taking cover in the trenches with a gun in his hand, then gets home and no one flinches when he can't feed his fam. But Brutus is an honorable man.

If you have tears prepare to shed them now. For you share the guilt of blood spilt in accordance with the Dow Jones. Dow drops fresh crop skull and bones. A machete in the heady: Hutu, Tutsi, Leone. An Afghani in a shanty. Doodle dandy yank on! An Iraqi in Gap khaki. Coca Coma come on! Be ye bishop or pawn, in the streets or the lawn, you should know that these example could go on and on and what since does it make to keep your ears to the street? As long as oils in the soil, truth is never concrete. So we dare to represent those with the barest of feet. 'Cause the laws to which we're loyal keep the soil deplete. It's our job to not let history repeat.

So here's the plan. The ides of march are always at hand. And when the power hungry strike, they strike the poorest of man. And if you dare put up a fight, they'll come and fight for your land. And they'll call it liberation or salvation. A call to the youth! Your freedom ain't so free, it's just loose. but the power of your voice could redirect every truth. Shift and shape the world you want and keep your fears in a noose. Let them dangle from a banner star spangled. I'm willing and able. To lift my dreams up out of their cradle. Nurse and nurture my ideals 'til they're much more than a fable. I can be all I can be and do much more than I'm paid to. And I won't be a slave to what authorities say do. My desire is to live within a nation on fire, where creative passions burn and raise the stakes ever higher. Where no person is addicted top some twisted supplier who promotes the sort of freedom sold to the highest buyer. We demand a truth naturally at one with the land, not a plant that photosynthesizes bombs on demand, or a search for any weapons we let fall from our hands. I got beats and a plan. I'm gonna do what I can. And what you do is question everything they say do, every goal ideal or value they keep pushing on you. If they ask you to believe it question whether it's true. If they ask you to achieve, is it for them or for you. You're the one they're asking to go carry a gun. Warfare ain't humanitarian. You're scaring me, son. Why not fight to feed the homeless, jobless, fight inflation?! Why not fight for our own healthcare and our education?! And instead, invest in that erasable lead, 'cause their twisted propaganda can't erase all the dead. And the pile of corpses pyramid on top of our heads. Or nevermind, said the shotgun to the head",Act III Scene 2 (Shakespeare)

Saul Williams,"I used to hump my pillow at night.
The type of silent prayer to help myself prepare for the light.
Me and my cousin Duce would rank the girls between one and ten 
And the highest number got to be my pillows pretend.
Now I apologize to every high ranker.
But you taught me how to dream and so I also thank you.
I never had the courage to approach you at school.
We joked around a lot and I know you thought I dressed cool.
But I was just covering up all the insecurities that came bubbling up.
My complexion had 
Me stuck in an emotional rut, 'like the time you Flavor Flaved me and you called me
""Yo Chuck, they say
You're too black, man"".
I think I'm too black.
Mom, do you think I'm too black? I think I'm too black.
Black Stacey.
They called me Black Stacey.
I never got to be myself 'cause to
Myself I always was Black Stacey, in polka dots
And paisley, a double goose 
And bally shoes, you thought it wouldn't phase me.
I was Black Stacey.
The preachers' son from Haiti
Who rhymed a lot and always got the dance steps at the party.
I was Black Stacey.
You thought it wouldn't phase me, but it did 'cause I was just a kid.

I used to use bleaching creme, 'til Madame CJ Walker walked into my dreams. 
I dreamt of being white and
Complimented by you, but the only shiny black thing that you liked was my shoes.
Now, I apologize for bottling up
All the little things you said that warped my head and my gut. 
Even though I always told you not to 
Brag about the fact that your great grand
Mother was raped by her slave master. Yeah, I became
Militant too. 
So it was clear on every level I was blacker than you.
I turned you on to Malcolm X and
Assata Shakur in my three quarter elephant goose with the fur.
I had the high top fade
With the steps on the side.
I had the two finger ring, rag top on the ride.
I had the sheep skin, name
Belt, Lee suit, Kangol, acid wash Vasco, chicken and waffle.

Now here's a little
Message for you.
All you baller playa's got
Some insecurities too, that you could cover up, bling it up, cash in
And ching ching it up, hope no
One will bring it up, lock it down and string it up.
Or you can share your essence with us, 'cause everything about you couldn't be rugged
And ruff. 
And even though you tote a 
Glock and you're hot on the
Streets, if you dare to share your heart, we'll nod our heart to
Its beat.
And you should do that, if nothing else, to prove
That a player like you could keep it honest and true. Don't mean to call your bluff but
Mothafucka that's what I do.
You got platinum chain
Then, son, I'm probably talking to you.
And you can call your gang, your posse and the rest of your crew.

Saul Williams,"I gave hip hop to white boys when nobody was looking. They found it locked in a basement when they gentrified Brooklyn. I left a list of instructions, an MPC and a mic, my sci-fi library, and utensils to write. Right or wrong, I think hip hop is where it belongs. Where it comes from is one, but, son, we wrote them songs. It was a ploy. Got fools tied up with mechanized toys. We are beings of breath, beyond the beings of boys. Now, you can break all you wanna. Scratch all you wanna. Graff all you wanna. Laugh all you wanna. But I want to show you what the stars are made of. I want to show you the stars. So substitute the anger and oppression with guilt and depression and it's yours.

White boys listen to white boys. Black boys listen to black boys. No one listens to no one. No one listens to no one. Alone on a mountain top, uprooted from the earth. Drifting beyond normalcy. A gold piece in God's purse is worthless here. We're Earthless here. God versus fear. Man versus fear. Fear not. I purse my lips and kiss like a glock. Violence is a metaphor for victory's plot. Change is inevitable, but our death is not. Now, you can break all you wanna. Scratch all you wanna. Graff all you wanna. Laugh all wanna. But I want to show you what the stars are made of.

I wrote a song for you today while I was sitting in my room. I jumped up on my bed today and played it on a broom. I didn't think that it would be a song that you would hear, but when I played it in my head, I made you reappear. I wrote a video for it and I acted out each part. Then I took your picture out and taped it to my heart. I've taped you to my heart dear girl, I've taped you to my heart and if you pull away from me you'll tear my life apart..

There will be no more breath and no more light
I've burned every candle and extinguished every fear
And I've waited for your time to pass
To bring in my new year

Something is dying tonight
There will be no more struggle, no more fight
And I've known that I'd have to live
Through suffering and youth
But I'm the landlord of my dreams now
And my tenets rent is due

Something is dying
Something is dying inside of me
In spite of me
Something is dying tonight

My old paddles off to Saturn
Taking flight and the astronaut within me
Has no air supply at all so
He's plunging into the deep sea
With no parachute to fall

Something is dying tonight
I can't eat and I can't sleep, so I just write
'Cause I wanted you to lean on
To distract me from my feet
Oh, my karma will cure me
Out of bounds and out of reach

Saul Williams,"I drive a yellow Volvo. '86 submarine. Someone's behind me in an escalade trying to blind me with their high beams. I make a left. I'm the road to nowhere, heading west. The sky is purple streaks. The sun is setting in my chest. I feel warm inside. So I'm going for a ride. Put your picture on my dashboard 'til my fate and your collides. Seaweed washed upon the shore. Severed locks of he who walks the ocean floor. I drive a yellow Volvo. '86 submarine. Rims like Tibetan prayer wheels and my tank is filled with dreams. Fuck the game, I practice being in the passing lane. And watch the price of gasoline rise with the price of fame. I'm immortal. I render unto Caesar to be cordial. He sees a wooden casket where I see a glowing portal. Check your engine. Looks like you're running on the blood of Indians. Put some turquoise in that rolls Royce before you crash into a pendulum. Seaweed washed upon the shore. Severed locks of he who walks the ocean floor. I drive a yellow Volvo. '86 submarine. I drove it under water guided by my own high beams. Nothing's left. Witnessed the demolition of the west. I feel like a little kid hiding in my mothers' dress. I'm in space. The lone ambassador of every race. The starfish that discover me plant their flags into my face. I'm a clone of every written and unwritten poem. A shark pulls up beside me fingering beads and chanting om. I can't believe it. I never really thought that sharks would need it. I thought they'd make their peace: bite it, bleed it, kill it, eat it. But I was wrong. Every living being deserves a song. And our passions must be rationed 'til our rations sing along.",Seaweed
Saul Williams,"Well, there're two ways I can say this. 
And one would be: fuck you! 
And there're no two ways around it, because one would be untrue. 
Because I love everything about you. 
But I don't want to be around you. 
If you control my heart will you control my brain? 
If I give in to you, will it still feel the same? 
'Cause I want nothing more than to be here with you. 
If you fulfill my dreams, will that fulfill you too? 
I need a second. I need a second to think. 
Now, the other way to play this would be mellow, light, and, cool. 
Poetry and meditation. Higher ground and higher truth. 
Because I love everything about you. 
But I use everything to doubt you. 
If you control my heart will you control my brain? 
If I give in to you, will it still feel the same? 
'Cause I want nothing more that to be here with you. 
If you fulfill my dreams, will that fulfill you too? 
I need a second. I need a second to think. 
I found the spot where truth echoes and know each beauty mark by heart. 
But I just can't keep her still enough to render perfect art. 
'Cause the truth is ever changing and although she loves my touch, 
I've had my way, but I when I pray, she kisses back too much. 
And it's hard to feel real gangster when you're always getting kissed. 
But you jump at every pucker, 'cause your fear of getting dissed. 
I try not to fight the parts of me that want to kiss her back. 
Egos should be illegal. Mine just don't know how to act.

Saul Williams,"Nah, I wasn't raised at gunpoint
And I've read too many books
To distract me from the mirror
When unhappy with my looks
And I ain't got proper diction
For the makings of a thug
Though I grew up in the ghetto
And my niggas all sold drugs
And though that may validate me
For a spot on MTV
And get me all the airplay
That my bank account would need
I was hoping to invest in
A lesson that I learned
When I thought this fool would jump me
Just because it was my turn

I went to an open space
'Cause I knew he wouldn't do it
If somebody there should see him 
Or somebody else might prove it
And maybe in your mind
It may seem I got punched out
'Cause I walked a narrow path
And then went and changed my route
But that openness exposed me 
To a truth I couldn't find
In the clenched fist of my ego
Or the confines of my mind
Or the hipness of swagger
Or the swagger in my step
Or the scowl of my grimace 
Or the meanness of my rep
'Cause we represent a truth, son
That changes by the hour
And when you open to it
Vulnerability is power
And in that shifting form
You'll find a truth that doesn't change
And that truth's living proof 
Of the fact that God is strange

Talk to strangers when family fails
And friends lead you astray
When Buddha laughs and Jesus weeps
And it turns out God is gay
'Cause angels and messiahs
Love can come in many forms
In the hallways of your projects
Or the fat girl in your dorm
And when you finally take the time
To see what they're about
And perhaps you find them lonely
Or their wisdom trips you out

Maybe you'll find the cycle's end
You're back where you began
But come this time around
You'll have someone to hold your hand
Who prays for you, who's there for you
Who sends you love and light
Exposes you to parts of you
That you once tried to fight
And come this time around 
You'll choose to walk a different path
You'll embrace what you turned away
And cry at what you laughed
'Cause that's the only way 
We're gonna make it through this storm
Where ignorance is common sense
And senselessness the norm

And flags wave high above the truth
And the two never touch
And stolen goods are overpriced
And freedom costs too much
And no one seems to recognize
The symbols come to life
The bitten apple on the screen
And Jesus had a wife
And she was his messiah
Like that stranger may be yours
Who holds the subtle knife
That carves through worlds like magic doors

And that's what I've been looking for
The bridge from then to now
Was watching BET like
What the fuck, son? This is foul
But that square box don't represent
The sphere that we live in
The Earth is not a flat screen
I ain't trying to fit in
But this ain't for the underground
This here is for the sun
A seed a stranger gave to me
And planted on my tongue
And when I look at you
I know I'm not the only one

Jumping from rivers to bridges, 
Drowning in pure air.

Hip hop is lying on the side of the road, 
Half dead to itself.
Blood scrawled over its mangled flesh, like jazz, 
Stuffed into an oversized record bag. 

Tuba lips swollen beyond recognition. 
Diamond-studded teeth strewn like rice at Karma's wedding. 
The ring bearer bore bad news. 
Minister of information wrote the wrong proclamation. 

And now everyone's singing the wrong song. 
Dissonant chords find necks like nooses.

""You have the right to remain silent.""

Maybe you should have 
Before your bullshit manifested.

Descendant of the womb, the lotus blooms when I come near it

That lies in between forgotten dreams
That pile up every year

Up above the highest testaments
Down below the wooden floor
There's a gutted room, pitch black at noon
Beneath a hidden door

Deep within you'll find
The attributes of every sunken man
Who must bang his head against the dead
Each day he tries to stand

And he's standing pressed against
The very woman that he loves
Kissing eyes and lips, embracing hips
Surrendering to her touch

And just at the very moment
That he touches heart to heart
She pulls from his touch
'Cause it's too much to mend what's torn apart

Each time I put them under
But still they wanna test me
I cry out through the thunder
You storm right past me

You can't think of me as you did in the beginning

By the time you hear this song you've gone wrong
Caught in the labyrinths of time in your mind
Unlearn, unwind but not to worry
There is no hurry, come unto me says she

You've been polluted, uprooted by time
You have been muted, computed
But I'm a living vessel of the one
Of the moon, of the sun

Hey, you ain't as dead as you seem what the fuck?
Hey, but you keep living your lies
Hey, your life's a bore but you dream
Bring yourself to be yourself tonight

I see evidence in how you hold your head
And I see evidence in how you say what's said
I see it in your eyes
That you've been hypnotized

You've been polluted, uprooted by time
You have been muted, computed
But I'm a living vessel of the one

Saul Zonana,"Something woke me up
Must have been the rain
And for no good reason here you are
Inside my head again
I know I won't go back to sleep now
I'm in a mood
Must be the midnight rain, the midnight rain

So I get up and wander around
In my dressing gown
Put the kettle on, some music too
But not too loud 'cause the neighbors complain
So I keep it soft and low just about the sound
Of the midnight rain, midnight rain

Yeah, you told me so
I didn't want to know
You sure told me so
Don't you let a good thing go

What coast are you on? What country?
Is it raining there? Is it morning or midnight?
Are you walking barefoot or have you got your shoes on?
Is there somebody there with you?
Are you talking soft and low underneath the sound
Of the midnight rain, midnight rain?

I just want you to know where ever you are
Where ever you go
I hope you're under a lucky star
Where ever you are
By the way, have you still got that stupid car?",Midnight Rain
Saunders King,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

What makes you look so blue
The way that you've been acting

Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So, won't you let me know your point of view

What is your story, morning glory
You've got me worried too
The postman came this morning
And left a note for you
Did you read it, then you know that I love you

Saunders King,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide

Savage,"When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment, please
To tame your wild, wild heart

I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
It's hard to find relief and people can be so cold
When darkness is upon your door
And you feel like you can't take anymore

Let me be the one you call
If you jump, I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away
With you into the night

If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash
And burn, you're not alone

When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one way street
With the monsters in your head

When hopes and dreams are far away
And you feel like you can't face the day

Let me be the one you call
If you jump, I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away
With you into the night

If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash
And burn, you're not alone

'Cause there has always
Been heartache and pain
And when it's over, you'll breathe again
You'll breathe again

When you feel all alone
And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment, please
To tame your wild, wild heart

Let me be the one you call
If you jump, I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away

Lift you up and fly away

Savage Garden,"Anytime I need to see your face I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal minds and magenta feelings
Take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chica cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight and If it happens again
I may move so slightly to the arms
And the lips and the face
Of The Human Cannonball that
I need to I want to

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when
I get to you

Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out

I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect is what I live for
But a look and then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place in the interaction
Of a lover and a mate but the time of talking
Using symbols, using words can be likened
To a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when
I get to you

Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out

Savage Garden,"And we stare each other down
Like victims in the grind
Probing all the weakness and
Hurt still left behind and we cry
The tears of pearls
We do it. Oh we do it.

Is love really the tragedy the way you
Might describe?
Or would a thousand lovers
Still leave you cold inside?
Make you cry
These tears of pearls

All these mixed emotions
We keep locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions we
Keep locked away from all the world

Your kisses are like pearls,
So different and so rare
But anger stole the jewels away
And love has left you bare,
Made you cry
These tears of pearls

Well I could be the tired joker
Pour my heart to get you in
Sacrifice my happiness just so I could win
Maybe cry
These tears of pearls

All these mixed emotions
We keep locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions we
Keep locked away from all the world

We twist and turn where angels burn
Like fallen soldiers we will learn
Once forgotten, twice removed
Love will be the death
The death of you

Keep locked away from all the world",Tears of Pearls

To relinquish?

Goes down
I'm floating high and my feet don't
Touch the ground
I'd take advantage but I can't see
Through this charade
So don't you, don't go make it harder

Cause it comes down to the making
You'd better be damned sure you can
Take it

It never did a thing for me
But heartache and misery
Ain't nothing but a tragedy

Take these broken wings
I'm going to take these broken wings
And learn to fly
And learn to fly away
And learn to fly away

Savage Garden,"Hey  if we can't find a way out of these problems 
Then maybe we don't need this 
Standing face to face 
Enemies at war we build defenses 
And secret hiding places 
I might need you to hold me tonight 
I might need you to say it's all right 
I might need you to make the first stand 
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man 

Hey  more than angry words I hate this silence 
It's getting so loud 
Well I want to scream 
But bitterness has silenced these emotions 
It's getting hard to breathe 
So tell me isn't happiness 
Worth more than a gold and diamond ring? 
I'm willing to do anything 
To calm the storm in my heart 
I've never been the praying kind 
But lately I've been down upon my knees 
Not looking for a miracle 
Just a reason to believe 

I might need you to hold me tonight 
I might need you to say it's all right 
I might need you to make the first stand 
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man 

Do you remember not long ago? 
When we used to live for the night-time 
Cherish each moment 
Now we don't live we exist 
We just run through our lives 
So alone

Savage Garden,"I would like to visit you for a while
Get away and out of this city
Maybe I shouldn't have called but
Someone had to be the first to break
We can go sit on your back porch
Relax
Talk about anything
It don't matter
I'll be courageous if you can pretend
That you've forgiven me

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed
And so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

Springtime in the city
Always such a relief from winter freeze
The snow was more lonely than cold if you know what I mean
Everyone's got an agenda
Don't stop keep that chin up you'll be alright
Can you believe what a year it's been
Are you still the same?
Has your opinion changed?

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed
And so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

I know I let you down
Again and again
I know I never really treated you right
I've paid the price
I'm still paying for it every day

So maybe I shouldn't have called
Was it too soon to tell?
Oh what the hell
It doesn't really matter
How do you redefine something that never really had a name?
Has your opinion changed?

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed
And so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

It's been seven months and counting 
You've moved on 
I still feel exactly the same 
It's just that everywhere I go all the buildings know your name 
Like photographs and memories of love 
Steel and granite reminders 
The city calls your name and I can't move on 

Ever since you've been gone 
The lights go out the same 
The only difference is 
You call another name 
To your love 
To your lover now 
To your love 
The lover after me 

Am I all alone in the universe? 
There's no love on these streets 
I have given mine away to a world that didn't want it anyway 
So this is my new freedom 
It's funny I don't remember being chained 
But nothing seems to make sense anymore 
Without you I'm always twenty minutes late 

Ever since you've been gone 
The lights go out the same 
The only difference is 
You call another name 
To your love 
To your lover now 
To your love 
The lover after me 

And as time goes by so slowly 
The nights are cold and lonely 
I shouldn't be holding on 
But I'm still holding on for you 

Here I go again, I promised myself I wouldn't think of you today 
But I'm standing at your doorway 
I'm calling out your name because I can't move on

Slowly she opens the door
Check that he is sleeping

Now it's time to get away

Another bruise to try and hide
Another alibi to write
Another lonely highway
In the black of night

Another ditch in the road
You keep moving
Another stop sign
You keep moving on
And the years go by so fast
Wonder how I ever made it through

And there are children to think of
Baby's asleep in the back seat
Wonder how they'll ever make it
Through this living nightmare
But the mind is an amazing thing
Full of candy dreams and new toys
And another cheap hotel
Two beds and a coffee machine
But there are groceries to buy
And she knows she'll have to go home

But you can still be free 
If time will set you free 

Time now to spread your wings 
To take to flight 
The life endeavor 
Aim for the burning sun 
You'll be trapped inside 
But you can still be free 
If time will set you free 
But it's a long long way to go 

Keep moving way up high 
You see the light 
It shines forever 
Sail through the crimson skies

If time will set you free 
Sail through the wind and rain tonight

I've been working up the courage to call you all year, oh
There is nothing I can say 
There are no good words left anyway 
Besides people look cool and the world still moves without you, oh 

Welcome to my Californian home 
You don't have to call me you can leave when you want 
There's a picture by my bed 
There's a light in your eyes

Well I don't know 
Why you still feel alone 

And we were dying from the get go 
I was dreaming but you never believed 
I was trying to fit myself in the spaces between, oh

You said all the world's love couldn't satisfy you 
And nothing could have hurt me as much as it's truth

Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy, but oh, baby
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me

I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby let's talk about this, man

Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause I'm good holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right

All my pride is all I have
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)
You'll be needing me, but too bad
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)
The path you chose to run alone
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)

The nights I waited up for you (oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you

It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creeping all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now, come here

Stop playing you gamin'
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause I'm good holding down my spot (stop acting like that)
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (now you know you need to stop)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock

People make mistakes to make up, to break up
To wake up cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me
You love me, I'm like your homey
Instead of beef you come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony
Don't bounce, baby, console me, come here

Ain't nothing you can say to me that can change my mind
I gotta let you go now
And nothing will ever be the same, so just be on your way
Go ahead and do your thing now
And there's no more to explain to me, you know
I know your game and I'm feeling what you do 

So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah

To a world gone astray

And they say whiskey was the slide

Living on the action
Till it took him down
Crawled into his bottle
Oh, and let us watch him drown

In Skraggy's tomb
Yeah Skraggy's tomb

Sometimes in the evening
Before the moon goes down
Before the dark is leaving
I could swear
Swear I see him
Hanging round

So I watch the shadows
And I stop and think
And wade into the shallows
And I have another drink

From Skraggy's tomb

Welcome to

He was a loaded man going down
Always out there screaming at the moon
And every night he'd load another round
From Skraggy's tomb

There are certain things we can't explain
We all have our attractions
But then that boy he was insane
Skraggy made his life
Made his life a crime of passion

Way out there in the distance
Can you hear me
Are you there

Call off the attack
'Cause if you look deep
Dreams are nothing that I lack
And all I seek
A final chance to speak
And I would let the whole thing keep
If I could just sleep

Hey there you
Way out there could you show me
Just a signal
Or a sign
That after all
All these years that you've known me
And I'm not just killing time

Call off the attack

Dreams are nothing that I lack
And all I seek
A final chance to speak
But I would let the whole thing keep
If I could just sleep

Building castles in the air
Out of alibis and all those little lies
And then I look inside
And pray that I don't care

Still I always thought you'd wait for me

Which of us is now in exile
Which in need of amnesty
Are you now but an illusion
In my mind alone you breathe

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
Till inside a rainswept night you just let go

You've thrown it all away
And now we'll never see the ending to the play
The grand design, the final line
And what was meant to be

In the dark a distant runner
Now has disappeared into the night
Leaving us to stand and wonder Staring from this end into your life

Of a sun but now is falling
As the feathers of his life fall free

Tomorrow and after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue
Perhaps inside this midnight sky
Perhaps tomorrow's newborn eyes

Gotta get back

What am I to do

Could we then reclaim a dream refused
Knowing what we know could we let it go
Realizing that all the years are used

You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue

Better get 'em now, while we got 'em in store

And so his eyes are drifting to the house next door
He wonders if his neighbors might be leaving

So he makes a little offer that they'll understand
There is no point in letting things get out of hand
For no one wants to see their widows grieving

There's a church aside one corner most believe was always there

It was built a thousand years before any now were born
And its glory was its belfry with its stones all gray and worn

Now there's a gargoyle on that belfry and he's been up there for years
And he has watched and he has pondered: ""What is laughter, what are tears?""

And he's never found his answers as he sees the years go by

Run away, no delay do we have to show you?
Don't expect mercy yet, we don't even know you

Between two crates of iron ware

As they sailed away from shore
Was that there were other stowaways
And he was one of four

And meanwhile the old sailor
Had walked right past that pier
While still conversing with the ocean
On the strengths of his idea

And as he walked he came upon
A youth he thought asleep
But the ocean said that he was not
And brushed a wave against his feet

And when the young man didn't stir
But lay quite still instead
The sailor took a closer look
And saw that he was dead

And all around the body
Was something he had never seen
Little cellophane packages
Marked ""blackjack guillotine""

And so he asked the ocean
What these strange packets were

And she answered they held the heroin

Close your eyes and just believe again

We were young and faith was not pretend

Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

And in the night he sees the ocean
Carve its thoughts upon the shore
For in the way it was created
It can do this and nothing more

And every message it would leave him

Were so real that you could

And as he walked away he thought about

That third stowaway once more
And wondered if the body had washed up

Upon some far and distant shore

The sailor asked how so young a man
Could have fallen into such a trap
And the ocean said the first time was with a friend
Who now can't take it back

It was a friendly gesture
As they all claim at the time
When that friend or kindly stranger
Free of charge gave him his first line

To harm this boy they're sure to say
Was never our intent
And we were as shocked as anyone
With just how far he went

He never thought it dangerous
As he stuck it in his vein
That a needle that had seemed so short

Could reach straight into his brain

It was upon this very beach
That his first line was tried
And who'd have thought way back then
That here is where he'd die

That I give back to you now

From a journey to nowhere towards a soul on the ocean

From the wake of Magellan to Magellan's wake

In the dark he heard a whisper
Asking him to understand
In the desert look for water
On the ocean look for land

In the dark he heard a whisper
Asking him to understand
In the desert look for water
On the ocean look for land

And there in the waves
Was a man in his grave
That he saw in the night
'Tween the flashes of light
And he

Could not be there

And all he had prayed

Or had given away
He now found to be wrong
In the grip of the storm
And he
Could not be there

Could you keep our lives together
Safely back onto the shore
Could you grant this last illusion
Only this and nothing more

Could you keep our lives together
Safely back onto the shore
Could you grant this last illusion
Only this and nothing more

And all at once the heavens bled their fire
The anchor broke the chains they flew away
And suddenly the waves were reaching higher
And in the dark I thought I heard them say

Could you keep our lives together
Safely back onto the shore
Could you grant this last illusion
Only this and nothing more

But what the sailor did not know
And would never learn
Was on that beach now far away
The young child had returned

And finding the broken hourglass
He reset it upright
Then placed sand from the beach inside
And placed the lid on tight

Then examining his handiwork
He left it in the sand
And then he quickly ran back home
Thinking god would understand

Everything I ever had for one more tomorrow
Everything I ever had for just one more night
And if this is not to be I pray could I borrow
Just another final hour onto my life

Did you ever really want to
Did you ever really want to

Lord, tell me how it will be
Lord, tell me how it will be

Standing once more by a boat on a river
He pushes it off while he stays on the land
And seeing the hourglass now so much clearer

Which someone had refilled by hand

And somewhere that boat's now adrift on the
Ocean

The mast at full sail and there's no one on board
The hourglass no longer sits by the ocean
Only his footprints all alone on the shore
And soon they're no more
No more

No more

Now our story's nearly over
And we've reached the final scene
But we're sure that some have wondered
What had happened in-between

From the moment when the boy was saved
And their boat had reached the shore
Well, they talked about life and death

And perhaps a little more

The boy said he'd been a stowaway
Aboard the ""maersk dubai""
When the captain had him thrown to the sea
And left him there to die

At this the old sailor had stood up
His face now filled with rage
And swore that he would never rest
Until that captain had been caged

But the boy implored the sailor
That he not say a word
Because he was an illegal immigrant
And as of recently he'd heard

That going to the authorities
Could often be unwise
When one's paper were illegal
The police just might not sympathize

So when they reached the harbor
With their journey at an end
He left the boy on another ship
Whose captain was a friend

And when he saw it pull to sea
And was once more all alone
He leaned against the tiller
And turned his ship back home

Eventually he reached that beach
He'd left the night before
Then stepped a last time from the boat
And waded to the shore

Then the old man picked the glass up
That he had left behind
And headed for the small cafe
For it was nearly time

And the ocean watched him leaving
To find his lady fair
And as he left he heard her last words
Drifting in the air

That every man

Is born you see
Beneath the sword

Damocles

For young and old
Are all alive
On that next beat

On which we ride

And that beat is such
A fragile thing
In both old men
Or youthful king

And that beat

Stands all alone you see

Between us

And black eternity

And until that time
When death won't wait
Let each man rage

Against his fate",The Hourglass
Savatage,"When you look at the morning sun

Do you see what I see
Or could I be the only one
Seeing just what I need

I envision a different man
Than the one I've become
Pray the ocean will understand
That my time isn't done

Everyone's leading
But nobody's dancing
You stand on the stage

Just to turn all alone
I have waited this way
For a lifetime of days

I can't wait for the morning sun
As I stand with the sea
And the ocean she understands

Just the man I could be

Somewhere else there's a different world

With a sun that will rise
And a moon that will take its place
In another man's eyes

And perhaps it's a better world
Than the one that I see
Or if better for no one else
Perhaps better for me

Here in the dark where the sky shows its graces
Revealing each star while the moon plays the fool
Saying how it must be while the night disagrees

I can't wait for the morning sun
As I stand with the sea
And the ocean she understands

Just the man I could be

No, no, time doesn't wait for you
No, no, leave it alone
No, no, your days are far too few
This thing I have always known

When your time is up it's through
They never give another day to you

When your time is up it's through
No one cares how

Can't keep it

Can't save it
Can't take it away with you
So I say we use it now

Now his thoughts gave way to anger
And he loudly cursed at fate
That in a world of opportunities
That he was doomed to wait

That his life could be predestined
To be stuck here on this shore
He could not make himself believe
That there was nothing more",Morning Sun

Looks in the mirror
And sees what she wanted to be

Safely unknown

To anyone near her
She sees what she wanted to see
And turns to me
And turns to me

And turns to

She was prophesied
For an early slide
Followed it to the letter

Well kept beauty queen
If there, always seen
Still you thought she'd know better

No erasing

The time you're wasting
But when you're wasting

You don't care

All those pieces
In short term leases
But when you need them

They're not there

For all those moments of yesterday
She's traded every tomorrow
And now all those moments are so far away
Ghosts haunt each word she would say

As she walks among the decay

She had oscar wilde's

Timeless sense of style
As had been her intention

Still she was afraid
Time must be repaid

And there'd be no redemption

Youth and time collide
She could not decide
On a certain direction

Time was catching up
Carefully made up

She avoided detection

For all those moments of yesterday
She's traded every tomorrow
And now all those moments are so far away
I saw it too
Closer than you
What else is there left to say

Wait for me now
I will be there for you
This I will vow

If you still want me to

But it won't be
This I have always known
And in the dark
There's no one to pray for me now

I don't understand what I'm feeling tonight
I don't understand but I'm waiting
Searching the shadows that fade in the light
But I'm feeling alive
Trying to survive
Float with the tide
Till you arrive and I

So he now turned to the ocean
Saying it was never meant to be
And the ocean never said a word
Though in truth she disagreed

And on the sand before him
While the waves broke gently white
The ocean listened carefully
As he told her of his life

I have been around the world
I've pursued the moon in flight
I have read the words of Shakespeare
By a midnight arctic light

I have run between the dragon's teeth
And lived to tell the tail
I have danced across a stardust sky

And never left a trail

I've seen things few could imagine
And I never will forget
But I've never had a family

And this I do regret

Now all I've loved have gone before me
And of the future I have great doubts
And though it seems I still have time left
I now feel time I can do without

And I have wondered to myself
Why should death set its own time
Is it just a final jest from fate
To add onto her other crimes?

For I have no wish to wait around
While all my senses fade
And one by one return the gifts
That youth so freely gave

Wired to some cold machine
That maps my every breath
And signals at the proper time
Less they should miss my death

And all this service I suspect
Is less done by goodwill
Than by the fear that they should miss
A final chance to bill

So I've decided to leave this world
And have devised a plan
To sail to sea in a small boat
Well out of sight of land

To sail once more upon the deep
Like a viking to his resting place
Then slip forever neath the waves
An exit with some grace

And the ship shall be my coffin
On this last voyage that I take
And my trail left through the water
Will be my final wake

I have done more than thought about this
On my life I've closed every door
I have left a will beside my bed
And the boat is there offshore

And all I ask is your assistance
When that ship is well away from the land
That you send a storm to embrace us
And take us gently in your hand

When he had finished speaking
Some points the ocean did concede
But when he said his final word
She once more disagreed

I'll think about this if I may
I need not rush the tide
For in this world of too little time
There's always time to die

You seem so eager to end this life
And with your death to dance
That you ignored his putrid breath
Now perfumed with romance

The sailor said you cannot understand
The needs or wants of men
So I'll ask you once more for your help
And I shall not ask again

Then the ocean pulled her waves back
And beckoned him stand near
And when he had stepped closer
She whispered in his ear

That every man

Is born you see
Beneath the sword

Between us

And black eternity

And though death is surely

Each man's fate
Until that time

Let each man wait

So be careful as you go through life
What you romanticize
I find such things are rarely true
And far more rarely wise

The sailor then listened carefully
And every thought was filed
And though he was still not quite convinced
He agreed to wait awhile

And meanwhile further down the beach
There stood a younger man
And he too felt the sand of time
Was running through his hands

But this youth felt they ran too fast
As he stood near a rusting dock
And heard the waves marking time
Like some relentless clock

He felt his future was not here
Of this he had no doubt

And even though he was eighteen
His time was running out",Turns to Me
Savatage,"Each man has a soul
That struggles to escape
And in the shallows of his dreams
We can often see its wake

For we all have our secrets
That we all keep deep inside
Away from light, in darkest night
Where it's always safe to hide

Away from all that we should meet
Less someone else should share
That thing that hides inside our soul
That we pray was never there

And out upon that ocean
A lifetime from the shore
Miguel stood his night watch
Recalling everything he saw

For he was a deckhand
Aboard the ""maersk dubai""
He had sailed her round the world
From hamburg to sendai

But this trip had been different
More than any he had known
For on board there was an evil
And the evil had been shown

For halfway through this voyage
They had found two stowaways
That the captain had thrown in the sea
And left them to the waves

And when he tried to close his eyes
And pretend he did not know
The evil did not go away
But used the time to grow

For later on that same trip
They found a stowaway once again
But the captain soon met this one too
And brought him to the same cold end

He wondered what that boy thought inside
Before that final sleep
When water was all that was around
And his lungs had screamed breathe deep

He wondered what went through his mind
As he gasped for air
And the last moment when he prayed for help
To find nobody there

He wondered to himself
If he could have been the one
To stand up at that moment

And say this cannot be done
To stand up to the captain
And say this thing it cannot be
But there is nothing closer to god on earth
Than a captain on the sea

And he was just a deckhand
With no right to plead the case
Of this stranger in their midst
And so he kept his place

And what is done is done
And undone cannot be
And so he pushed it from his mind

And stared out across the sea",Underture

But at night when the waves are near
They whisper
And I hear

There are wounds that bleed inside us
There are wounds we never see
They are part of our refinements
That allow a man to be

There are wounds that bleed in silence
With aristocratic grace
There are tears we keep beside them
Never seen upon a face

Do you think it's wise?
To remember everything that

Dear god

To buy another nickel sack
Twelve o'clock time to greet
Agony and ecstasy

Ecstasy
I'm the cry from within
From when your day begins
You'll follow me like sheep
This shepherd never sleeps

So tell me what's your price
Came skate on my ice
My blades they never rust
I'm asking you to trust

Listen now the time is right
And what a way to start the night
Spend your money endlessly
Another grand insanity

So D.T. here is the plan
I'll make your brain a rubber band
Time to stretch it out and see
Agony and Ecstasy

Feel my whisper through your haze of pain
Feel the calling of a neon vein
I'm the name upon your soul's marquee
I am agony and ecstasy

Savatage,"So after all these one night stands
You've ended up with heart in hand
A child alone
On your own
Retreating
Regretful for the things you're not
And all dreams you haven't got
Without a home
A heart of stone
Lies bleeding

And for all the roads you followed
And for all you did not find
And for all the things you had to leave behind

I am the way
I am the light
I am the dark inside the night
I hear your hopes
I feel your dreams
And in the dark
I hear your screams
Don't turn away
Just take my hand
And when you make your final stand
I'll be right there
I'll never leave
All I ask of you
Believe
Your childhood eyes were so intense
While bartering your innocence
For bits of string
Grown-up wings
You needed

But when you had to add them up
You found that they were not enough
To get you in
Pay for sins repeated

And for all the years you borrowed
And for all the tears you cried
And for all the fears you had to keep inside

I am the way
I am the light
I am the dark inside the night
I hear your hopes
I feel your dreams
And in the dark
I hear your screams
Don't turn away
Just take my hand
And when you make your final stand
I'll be right there
I'll never leave
And all I ask of you is

Need a little jump of electrical shockers
Better leave the town if you only wanna knock us
Nothing stands the pressure of the clash city rockers

See the rate at they come down the escalator
Listen to the tube train accelerator
Then you realize that you got to have a purpose
This place is gonna knock you out sooner or later

So don't complain about your useless employment
Jack it in forever tonight
So shut your mouth and pretend you enjoy it
Think of all the money you've got

And I wanna liquefy everybody gone dry
Plug into the aerials, poke up in the sky
Burn down the suburbs through the half-closed eyes
You won't succeed unless you try

So don't complain about your useless employment
Jack it in forever tonight
So shut your mouth and pretend you enjoy it

I get so tired I can't sleep
The voices in my head are haunting my dreams

To kill the thoughts inside
I can not
I can not hide

The crack and lines along my face
The times I try to get things straight but could not
I know how hard I try
To keep myself alive
I don't know
I don't know why

Funny how
When the darkest of knights falls down
Worry that I will never see sun shining again
The world goes round 
What comes up doesn't get back down
Wonder if I can stick around
Feel the light of the day

Sometimes I feel like I am dying down here

Hang myself alone in the dark

I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me

Before I watch your sea birds flying

Through the window I watched it all
Go

You've been here seven years clothes on the floor
Shadows crawling along the walls
Reminisce reticence learn to move on
Without you 'I would be' is gone

Try or fail to forgive
Nothing left to relive
I watch your black hair blow in the wind

Do you feel a thing?
Will you take my hand?

Together we can be okay
If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

Seven years will go by in a blink of an eye
Suddenly here we are, thinking what are the odds
Born on opposite coasts for the two of us both
Knowing in 20 years we would not be alone
Might have made us a pair of zen-like two-year-olds
With a couple of ring pops no need to propose

Before we live forever say
Together we can be okay
If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

And in seventy years when somehow there's a way
To be frozen in time forever we will stay

Before we live forever say
Together we can be okay
If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

And hear you singing too
This is our song
I'll always song for you",Ring Pop
Saves the Day,"Let's at least give it one more-another try.
In your eyes I can see for a thousand miles.
Out in between where the ocean becomes the sky.
Where we can go get so lost we can't find the time.

I wanna go all the way.
What do you say?
While tomorrow's memories are ours to make.
Don't hesitate.
So maybe some day after midnight before morning
Meet me to stare down the moon.
Lets take in the air in the space in between us
Til nothing is left save us two.

Take the car to the coast, drive right off the pier.
Making the highway our runway, and shifting gears.
Behind the clouds take off into the atmosphere.
We'll get so high up the whole world will disappear.

I wanna take you away, what do you say?
While tomorrow's memories are ours to make.
Don't hesitate.
So maybe some day after midnight before morning
Meet me to stare down the moon.
Lets take in the air in the space in between us
Til nothing is left save us two.

We'll stand in the stars
Spinning in a circle sideways
Silhouetted by a hundred million burning constellations.
I'm Orion upside down,
In my arms you're Artemis,
Our love so out of control.

I wanna make our own way
What do you say?
Yeah, tomorrow's memories are ours to make
Don't hesitate.
Tell me yes, no, maybe so?

Maybe some day after midnight before morning

They were there
They were drunk

No one was thinking at all

We noticed something was wrong
Outta the corner of my eye
I saw him stumble inside

What is the point of it all

Savina,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,

It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Since I?d look at myself
I don?t wanna have to change
If I don?t then no one will
Is it my state of mind
Or is it just everything else
I don?t wanna have to be here
I don?t understand it now

Cause its been 18 days
Since I first held you
But to me it feels just like
It feels like a lifetime
I?m trying hard to re-arrange
Some say its the hardest thing to do
But that?s another 18 days
Without you..

Time after time
I?ve been through this
You show me what it means to live
You give me hope when I was hopeless
As my days fade to night
I remember that state of mind
I?m soaring straight into your heart
And I?ll fly high

But to me it feels just like

Full of words of wisdom, I'm seeing double vision
From a dead on, head on crash course in collision
A sucker for a kind word, every voice I've heard

Setting fire to all you hold on to
There's a blaze in my hands portraying one-sided views
I'm letting go again, won't be another friend
To a beautiful, a beautiful you

A mirrored image, another shade of grace
Molded by pride, barely holding on to life
A prejudice lover always and forever

I was off on a road trip
A couple hundred bucks and a case of beer
Outside Panama City limits is where it all begins

2 a.m., I saw hazard lights
Appeared to be a dame distressed in the night
She was 5 foot 6 and damn she was built
I slammed on the brakes and got sideways and told her to get in

She said, ""Where you headed, to the city?""
I said, ""Yeah, I'm gonna have some fun""
She tossed back her hair in confidence
And said, ""Mind if I come?""

2 days later we ain't left the room
Did all in there that we could think to do
I could see she was restless, so we hit the town

Ended up at a place where the windows read
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here

Into the back she went and disappeared
Reappeared an hour later cheesing ear to ear
I thought, hell, I need to try and get back there
When she unzipped her pants and said, ""Lookee here""

I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you

The blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
And the red is for the color we're about to paint this town
Ooh, I gotta new tattoo

One week passed, woke up a day late for work
I found my good time gone and she took my shirt
Drove by all the places that we had been
There was one where the windows read

Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here
Tattoos, piercings, belly rings here

Into the back I went and disappeared
Reappeared an hour later cheesing ear to ear

I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you
I gotta brand new tattoo
All the colors in it remind me of you

The blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
And the red is for the color we're 'bout to paint this town
Ooh, I gotta new tattoo

That smile when she said
I gotta brand new tattoo

You are my angel, my angel

Than you tucked away with me

You're my angel without wings
Don't need them we're high enough

I'm still here fighting, be proud of your son,
My friends are dying, and I just wanna come home.

Hey there love, how have the kids been,
Wish I could be there to tuck them in,
But freedom is calling while your tears are falling.

I've seen lives broke in two,
Through these eyes: red, white and blue,
I know why I'm here, still, I just wanna go home.

I know what's coming but I'm still breathing,

Running for cover, take cover my brother,
To die another day as that banner yet waves.

Hey there son, it's your time to go,
I'm so proud, more than you'll know,
But freedom ain't free and now you're just like me.

Little Miss Mary Sunshine had a bad day
She says it's overrated, living this way
She took her hair down, left her sweater on the floor
She's not a nice girl anymore

She says I won't apologize
Stand up girls, and dry your eyes 
And I'll see you on the other side of good

Where we sing

She paints her fingernails in black, she's on the run
On the wrong side of the tracks where life is fun
Points a finger, but there's nobody to blame
All the people in her memory look the same

Chorus

Everybody's favorite girl
Doesn't fake it anymore
I'm okay with who I am today
Everybody's gotta change
I'm just doing what I can
Could you love me anyway?

And I hate the way I'm wearing all these lies

[Chorus]
So I let you go
And I watch you leave
And I hold my breath
So you don't hear me scream
When you walk away
But the words are only in my head
It's not what I said
It's what I didn't say

Is she everything you wanted her to be?
Yeah, I bet she never breaks your heart like me
So it's one more night I cover up with you
And I hate myself for what I didn't do

[Chorus]

Should've known better, now
All I have left is a permanent stain
The only part of you I get to keep forever
To prove I lived this pain

Maybe I was never as smart as I thought
Maybe we can never be as good as we want
Maybe you just didn't need me enough
Maybe we're too clever to be falling in love like this
Like this

Secrets told in the silence of my sin
And I'm the one who loses in the end",What I Didn't Say
Saving Jane,"I hope life brings you what you need
And I'm sorry that I couldn't keep you
Bet you never thought that I would leave you 
In the cold like this
Too broke to fix
You promised but I don't believe you
Anymore

Took your picture off the shelf, don't wanna remember
I couldn't save you from yourself

I'm giving up on the way we've always been
I can't seem to get your sink to swim
You don't see the writing on the wall
Can't stand to watch you self-destruct
Throw away your magic and your luck
There wasn't room for three here after all
You and me and alcohol

What happened to the boy I knew?
Every now and then you know I miss you
Every now and then you know I still wish you were 
Here with me
But honestly
You'll never even know the damage that you've done

We couldn't reach the other side
But at least I know I tried

I'm giving up on the way we've always been
I can't seem to get your sink to swim
You don't see the writing on the wall
Can't stand to watch you self-destruct
Throw away your magic and your luck
There wasn't room for three here after all
You and me and alcohol

So misunderstood
Well not everybody gets what's good
And maybe that's alright
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I wanted to believe that it just might

I'm giving up on the way we've always been
I can't seem to get your sink to swim

Savoir Adore,"Even when the night comes
After all the setting suns
You're still the glowing one, aren't you?
Even on our worst days
When love was stripped away
You always made it stay, didn't you?

I still feel our fragments rush
Into each other, keeping us
On the edge of ecstasy
A place where we are constantly

Beating hearts from the start
So combined that they can't be torn apart
We will stay in this way
Here together 'cause we know there's no other way

Two bodies now aligned
Twin thoughts into different minds
I can't imagine time without you
No matter what song we sing
I feel everything
Anything that hurts you hurts me too

Give me every tragedy
I want it all, every little piece
Fold the mould in two-by-two
Shedding aches for truth
In a shape that's new

Beating hearts from the start
So combined that they can't be torn apart
We will stay in this way
Here together 'cause we know there's no other way

I feel it when you're near me
And when you say my name
Our pulses merge to one
They beat the same

Beating hearts from the start
We can bleed but we'll never be be torn apart

Strange but true
In our bodies, we will find it
Something new
Who we are now, we will finally love

Beating hearts from the start
So combined that they can't be torn apart
We will stay in this way
Here together 'cause we know there's no other way

To let yourself grow
Watch it burn into cinders
Can you read the smoke?

Savoy,"Washington square's right up the street
That was the place where we would meet
Outside the dog run, don't be late
Most of the time I'd sit and wait

Looking at people pass me by
A customer's bagging his supply
Just as you thought she wouldn't show
There she comes running, don't you know?

Oh, daylight's wasting
Your daylight
Yeah, I can taste it
It falls from the sky

I had a band of certain fame
""The brownstone walk ups"", was our name
Singer was fair but got it wrong
He never did justice to my songs

He did more for me and that's a fact
When he went and stabbed me in the back
So, I've gotta do now, don't you know?
What I should have done five years ago

Do, his daylight's wasting
Daylight, yes, I can taste it
As it falls from the sky

Daylight's wasting, day light
Daylight
'Cause daylight's wasting
Daylight, daylight
As it falls from the sky

Daylight's wasting

Savoy,"Woke up
To a lonely type of day
I'm running out of reasons
I should stay

Put your arms around me
What can I say?
Leave me where you found me
Then walk away

I'm staying through to Friday
Then I'm gone
Unreachable by letters
Or by phone

But one day I'll be calling
Way down the road, baby
Stop me then from falling
Don't let me go

Put your arms around me
What can I say?
Leave me where you found me
Then walk away

I let her slip away
That was foolish
I bow to the ovation
In my head

Put your arms around me
One for the road, baby
Leave me where you found me
Then walk away

Someday you will know
I'll be damned if I ever
Can't let you go
It keeps me together to know
Keeps me together to know

Someday you will know
Be damned if I ever
Can't let you go
Keeps me together to know

Put your arms around me
Then walk away

Savoy,"In the dawning hour, break of day
Strikes an old church tower, a mile away
Based on old transcriptions from a song

From a stone

We'll be adding curses to a prayer
Taking notes down as we go along
Yeah, we'll be mining tears from a stone

Her face cut from stone
Her eyes when she's smiling
Will never reach home

But hear how she sings

Her touch would be tender
Her lips would be warm
But when we're together
I'm always alone

But hear how she sings
But hear how she sings
But hear how she sings

Her skin is like velvet
So I went to her home
Her place like a palace
With things you can't own

Her skin is like velvet
And hear how she sings
Hear how she sings

TASTE AND TRY SAVOY BROWN

My mother told me
When I was young
Many people try
To con you son
You got to separate
The truth from the lies
You got to taste and try
Before you buy

The army man says
Sign on for five
The army show you
A real man's life
You know I don't dig
That army jive
You got to taste and try
Before you buy

My woman looks at me
My woman says
Now pack your bags boy
And get out of my bed
Five long years
You still ain't done me right
You got to taste and try
Before you buy

Now this is my life
It's the way I be
May not suit you
But it sure suits me
You got to live before you die
Taste and try

Go to the place where everyone goes to Boogaloo all night long

She take my train to the city and mother you should look at her now 
With her rattlesnake boots, elephant bag, genuine crocodile hat 
Around her neck to top it off she even wears a persian cat 

She's a poor girl 
That was the story of the poor girl but now she uses her head 
She's back home working on the land instead of playing in bed

Ain't got time for doubts or fears
Ain't got time for shallow tears
Ain't got time to bare my soul
Because I still got a hard way to go

Said that you got a losing hand
Ain't no point in you raising sand
Ain't got time to bare your soul
Because I still got a hard way to go

And it's a crying shame
That you can't lay the blame
On anybody else but yourself

Wish that you had my sympathy
You ain't got no hold on me
And my heart is getting cold
And I still got a hard way to go

And it's a crying shame
That you can't lay the blame
On anybody else but yourself

There was twenty at the sharer, I was there myself
Trying to establish who may reap the wealth
I said I cannot take this, you know these cards dealt
There's one for you and three for them
Sixteen for myself

Yes it's always the same

As the mornings mists were clearing I could set my course
There were nineteen souls came in on foot, while one man rode a horse
And the nineteen ragged souls, the battles they had fought
But the man who rode ahead he never fired a shot

I've loved you for a long time but I never let you know
All the times we were together I never told you so
You've been my dream lover but I never let you see
How I really felt and what you mean to me

You're deep in my heart, deep in my soul
It's burning me up, I want the whole world to know

Since I first met you I've been feeling this way
Listening from a distance to everything you say
I've thought so long about you, baby you and me
I've dreamed of life together and how it could be

You're deep in my heart, deep in my soul
It's burning me up, I want the whole world to know
Deep in my heart, you're deep in my soul
It's burning me up, I want the whole world to know

You're deep in my heart, you're deep in my soul
It's burning me up, I want the whole world to know
Deep in my heart, deep in my soul
You're burning me up, I want the whole world to know

Deep in my heart, you're deep in my soul
It's burning me up, I want the whole world to know

Burning me up, I want the whole world to know



",Deep in My Heart
Savoy Brown,"To hurt to cry
I'm holding back the tears
I want to run and hide
From all the wasted years
In this lonely room room
I sit and stare

A man alone 2x

To down to smile
Now the love has gone
A look for reasons why
Where did we go wrong
In this lonely room
I sit and stare

A man alone 4x

There is cold feeling
It's like ice around my heart
I feel confusion in my mind
And it's tearin' me apart


To hurt to cry
I'm holding back the tears
I want to run and hide
From all the wasted years
In this lonely room room
I sit and stare

A man alone 4x

Everybody says they want it
When they think you got it
If you don't know you have it
Everything is just fine
It's a blanket situation
This life of mine

People say get real
Get a job, get a life
Stop wasting your time
You only get one try
Take care of what's yours
And it'll be all right

That's why I live my life for Rock and Roll
Lifts me up to satisfies my soul
Keep the edge on me, keep me strong
Keep me going on

From Sioux St. Marie
To Boise Idaho
Muscle Shoals Alabama
To the Gulf of Mexico
You gonna catch me Rockin'
On the road

That's why I live my life for Rock and Roll
Lifts me up to satisfies my soul
Keep the edge on me, keep me strong
Keep me going on

Gotta watch some people
When they think you're on a roll
They do and say something evil
Try to hinder your soul
They'll do it just to see
If you'll lose control

Gonna bide my time thinkin'
In my old rockin' chair
I'm gonna bide my time thinkin'
In my old rockin' chair
I'm gonna stare at the clouds
Remember when I didn't care

The snow is fallin' down
We make our way in a one eagle sleigh
'Til we reach another town
Our name is in lights on the billboard sign
In every town we play
But if you may, all it really need say
Are gypsies, gypsies on parade

We pull in to a diner
Folks just stop and stare
You here 'em say man
It's a rock 'n' roll band
By the look and the clothes they wear
Then you telephone home
'Cause you're feelin' alone

Are tears of regret

Come on and don't forget the big broom.

Take me mind off all the troubles

Old photographs bring back sweet memories
Lookin' at the way I held you then

Like all my love for you still feels the same
All those yesterdays that I wanted to remember
Are sittin' here beside me where these old pictures lay

Sawyer Brown,"He said he was the grandson of Johnny B. Goode
Some thought he couldn't but I thought he could
He set his mind talkin' about Elvis lookin' like James Dean
He said a country boy rockin' ain't all that bad
You shake your leg or you wear you a hat
You bring the house down and you make all the pretty girls scream
He said a complicated rhythm folks don't understand
Just stomp your feet and clap your hand and play

Blue, blue denim soul
Blue, blue denim soul
A country boy rockin' will get on a roll
Playin' blue, blue denim soul

He poured me out a helping of rhythm and blues
It was bad to the bone-you see to me it was news
Spreadin' wood sheddin' in pair of faded overalls
He said scratch your throat when you start to sing
You make 'em cry when you bend them strings
And one more thing I will tell you before I go
The only thing that you can count on are both of your hands
And having holes in your britches when the boys in the band are playin'

Keeps me wonderin' when does the gettin' over you start
It's hard to let go when a part of me keeps holdin' on
I'm back to the start, fallin' apart at the heart

Now I've told some lies, said I'd be okay
But don't you believe me, nothings really changed
I still wish that you were here

A twenty thousand dollar pickup truck

Sawyer Brown,"You come into this world your daddy's girl
And your mama's little baby
Was a time I could see nothing left for me
'Til you got me thinking maybe

You came along when I was down to love's last dime
With a heart of gold and a chance to make it mine
There ain't no stoppin' love when it's meant to be
Mama's little baby loves me

Ever since the dawn of time there's been a woman on man's mind
But sometimes she meant danger
Guess I'm livin' proof of what a woman's love can do
To a man in need of a saving

But you ain't seen nothin' till your baby drives a Buick

I could always walk away before
I thought, I could get away untouched
But you think to much when you run from love
When you run from love

When you run from love
The quickest way ain't fast enough and the
Trains and the planes will let you down
If you hide your eyes

You make a chain of pain and lies
And you know that
You're only losing ground
When you run from love

My heart never beat the beat of a losing kind
Could always touch the flame and not feel the fire
Your heart ain't the place, you want shelter from
When you run from love
When you run from love

When you run from love

Life never gave us time to settle down
And you questioned whether frightened love can last
And that ole highway song is just not where it's at

The trees roll by and the white lines hold me back
From mobile to Denver there's something that they all lack
So until we find a place to make a new start
I will build you a homestead in my heart

Well I'm lookin' at you sleepin' across the seat
And the whine of the trucks are fillin' up my ears
All the highs and lows left somewhere in between
All those one night stands between Dallas and new Orleans

Well I can't offer much except the love
Of a guitar picker ain't nobody thinkin' of
So until we find a place to make a new start
I will build you a homestead in my heart

And by the size of the crowds in and out of church
When there's this many men out shopping with the women

Perfect strangers on the sidewalk, singing songs
Giving is such a part of living
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas all year long

When the news hunts down something nice to say
And they even get along in the legislature

Bells are ringing as the people go their way
Christmas time around the world for every boy and girl
There will come a time, they'll wonder how it started

In just one night the world was changed forever
Just one life given willingly
And I remember that December how it started
In just one night

Little children with a list of all their wishes
Busy shoppers with a list of what they need
Every year we start anew with so many things to do
We forget sometimes just why it is we do them

Just one life given willingly
And I remember that December how it started
In just one night, in just one night

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep a thousand stars go by
Yet in thy dark street shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight

How silently, how silently the wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts all the blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming but in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still the dear Christ enters in

Sawyer Brown,"I saw a garage sale
Pulled up in the yard
Found a statue of Jesus
It was eight feet tall 
He held out his arms
And he seemed all alone
So I loaded him up
And drove him home

Out by my driveway he
Looks down the street
With his long hair and sandals made
Of rebar and concrete
I painted him white with a long purple robe
He's a rock of ages on our gravel road

[Chorus]
He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
Standing taller than a tree
He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
A bigger man than you or me

I thought loosin' my job was 
The end of the world
Till my best pal ran off with my best girl
I felt suicidal with no real friends
So I walked outside with a rope in my hand

Out by that statue there's a big old tree
So I stood on his shoulders
And I counted to three
I had every intention of buying the farm
But when I jumped off he caught me in his arms

[Chorus]

I wanted to return the favor to him
'Cause I never had a more solid friend
So I planted some flowers
All around his feet
And I bought him a flock
Of ceramic sheep

But the stars on the water dancin' from the sky
Makin' the way for that big one out tonight

And I know this is love hangin' in the air
This could be the night
The night of all nights
If we just take our time
Oh I know we'll find
There's still a moon over Miami

Key Largo is just way too far to go
These old trade winds are blowin' warm and slow
There's no mistakin' what's goin' around tonight

Got so much around me that I can call mine

What's in my heart that makes me who I am
I'm goin' soul searchin'
'Cause I know that I can be a better man

In the good book on the table by my bed
Simple direction for my life to be lead
I've got to slow down got to take some time

Sawyer Brown,"Well, I've spent a lifetime lookin' for you;
singles bars and good time lovers were never true.
Playin' a fools game hopin' to win; 
and tellin' those sweet lies  and losin' again.
 
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.
 
And I was alone then, no love in sight;
and I did ev'rything I could to get me though the night.
Don't know where it started or where it might end;
I turned to a stranger just like a friend.
 
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.
 
Then you came a knockin' at my heart's door;
You're ev'ry thing  I've been lookin' for. 
 
No more lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Now that I've found a friend and a lover;
I bless the day that I discovered 
you, oh you; 
 
lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.

Sawyer Brown,"Everybody likes a celebration
Happy music and conversation
I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't have the blues

In the corner there's a couple dancin'
From the kitchen, I can hear 'em laughin'
Oh, I wish I was celebration' too

I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun is gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
And I know this heart is gonna mend just fine

So, pardon me for my disposition
I wish I didn't have to sit and listen
They're playin' the same old songs on the stereo

She's been lyin' since the day I met her
I'd be better off to just forget her
Oh, I would rather be lonesome all alone

And I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun is gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
And I know this heart is gonna mend just fine

Suddenly there's a strange vibration from my head to my toe
Fillin' me with a strange sensation
Somebody's tellin' me, somebody's sayin'

I know this night won't last forever
And I know the sun is gonna shine sometime
I need some hope for a bright tomorrow
And I know this heart is gonna mend just fine

I see that river, and I see the shore
And I walk down into the water

Is now the hand of something divine

Sawyer Brown,"On a black and white TV back in grammar school
I was watching Neal Armstrong walking on the moon
That same day I pretended I was an astronaut 
on the playground monkey bars I flew above the stars
I was in a Dallas disco the night John Lennon died
The DJ played ""Imagine"" and everybody cried
I remember a thousand lighters held up in our hands
All we were saying was let's give peace a chance

[Chorus]
Where was I when you stopped lovin' me
When did I become history
There's not many things that escape my memory
Tell me where was I when you stopped loving me

On a blanket we watched it sail across the sky
A Moment like that comes just once in life
It felt like our first time at 11:35

Is there one man living to deliver the message
To the ones who won't let go
It's been long time coming and I'm tired of running 
From a lover who won't let go

Oh, move on, if your loverâ€™s still alone 
Said move on, if your loverâ€™s still alone",Lovers Still Alone
Sawyer Fredericks,"Stranger in my head, ain't nothing like him 
Kicked me out and seems he's moved in
Stranger in my bed, something about him 
Face he's showinâ€™, keeps on changing
Oh, am I changing? 
Oh, am I changing? 

Please decide if me, not I, is who you love
If what you want is me, then I, I'll go 

Stranger in my bed, why are you laughing? 
Does my loving mean nothing?
I can't control him, he's not listening
For the last time dear, do you love him?
Do you love him? 
Do you love him? 

Oh, please decide if me, not I, is who you love 
If what you want is me, then I, then I'll go

Sawyer Fredericks,"My head is spinning around and my heart is on the floor
Beating louder than the roar of thunder
Banging on my door
So take it all, take it all

I left my world wide open
It felt like a dream
You found me as another, I barely knew my name
You take it all, oh take it all

Take the hurt in my chest
Take the pain in my eyes
Take the fear in my soul
Take the tears that I cry
You call me out of my head and I was ready to fall
'Cause you are all that I need
So take it all
Take it all

My body's almost broken, it can't contain my soul
This storm is going quiet, but I still feel the cold
I left my world behind me, I'll never be the same
But these memories still screaming loud, calling out my name

Take it all
Take the hurt in my chest
Take the pain in my eyes
Take the fear in my soul
Take the tears that I cry
You call me out of my head and I was ready to fall
'Cause you are all that I need
So take it all
Take it all

Hay now, its hard to let go of everything that I use to know
Hay now, there's nothing left to hold and darling I can't make it alone

Take the hurt in my chest
Take the pain in my eyes
Take the fear in my soul
Take the tears that I cry
You call me out of my head and I was ready to fall
'Cause you are all that I need
So take it all
Take it all",Take It All
Sawyer Fredericks,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine
Sawyer Fredericks,"She come to me with a gentle touch
A love so real it was far too much
For a boy like me with a worried mind
To believe in you, I got to close my eyes
You want me to say please
Baby, I can say please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby, I can get down on me knees
I can say please

My will was strong, but my legs were weak
I could not walk and I could not speak
Love that you gave me, was so way down south
Baby, I was born just to kiss your mouth
You want me to say, (You want me to say)

Please
Baby, I can say please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby, I can get down on my knees
I can say please

So I became apart of you
And you became apart of me
See, I had no choice but to lie to you, you see
If I'd told you the truth, you'd a set me free
You'd a set me free
You want me to say,

Please
Baby, I can say please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby, I can get down on my knees
You want me to get, down on my knees
Baby I can get, down on to my knees
I can say please
Baby I can say please
I can say please",Please
Sawyer Fredericks,"Mama told me when I was young
Come sit beside me, my only son
Won't you listen to what I say
And if you do this it'll help you some day

Oh, take it slowly, don't live too fast
Troubles will come, troubles will pass
You'll find a woman and you'll find love
Just remember my son, there is someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can

And don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart and nothing else
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can

I'll be a simple kind of man

Sawyer Fredericks,"Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone,
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow.

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this

One step closer
One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

One step closer",A Thousand Years
Sawyer Fredericks,"So you ask me
Why I'm so blue
Well, you got open fields
And blue, blue skies up above you

And your white clouds are never
Never turning gray
Oh, you got everything you need
Ask you, why must I be happy?

'Cause I don't need the sun to rise
In the mornin'
And I like my sky to stay dark and cloudy
You know I like a good storm when it comes

So let the cold take me in its arms
Sail you cynical man
Just like you've always been and
You said I'll die alone

That would be after you're gone and your
Harsh words still linger
And my friends keep on tellin' me to move on
Ask them why I let this consume me if it's all I want

'Cause I don't need to be loved or love someone
It's an empty space in my heart
Might never fill
But what do I care if I die alone?

Just let the cold take me in its arms
'Cause I don't need the sun to rise in the morning",A Good Storm
Sawyer Fredericks,"I've been, I've been away so long
And I am, I am feeling alone
The sun doesn't shine down on my home
So don't wait up, I won't be comin' home

Oh, oh, oh, comin' home
Oh, oh, oh oh
Comin' home oh, oh, oh
Comin' home

I do, I do still remember that house
The joy it had and the warmth it lost
And I know, I know those times are done
The house it was is long, long gone

Oh, oh, oh, long gone

Ain't comin' home oh, oh, oh

Enemy's moving in
Battle line's filled with red
And I know how this ends

But I hold on 'til the hope is gone
I hold on 'til all is lost

Lookin' straight down the barrel now
Won't you pull the trigger?
