The Click Five,"Children behave
That's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play
They don't understand and so we're

Runnin' just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doing
What would they say
They don't understand and so we're

Runnin' just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now (alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now (alone now)
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I think we're alone now (alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now (alone now)
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I think we're alone now
I think we're alone now

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound",I Think We're Alone Now
The Click Five,"She calls me baby, then she won't call me
Says she adores me and then ignores me
Jenny, what's the problem?
She keeps her distance and sits on fences
Puts up resistance and builds defenses
Jenny, what's the problem?

You leave me hanging on the line
Every time you change your mind

First, you say you won't, then you say you will
You keep me hanging on, and we're not moving on
I'm standing still, Jenny
You got me on my knees, Jenny
It's killing me

She needs her own space
She's playing mind games
Ends up at my place saying that she's changed
Jenny, what's the problem?

I'm trying to read between the lines
You got me going out of my mind

First, you say you won't, then you say you will
You keep me hanging on, and we're not moving on

Let's hold on to where we are
If it's real we'll make it through
Cause all I need is you

They say
Don't waste
Your time
They're obviously blind

So let's
Forget
The words the thoughts they put into your head

I waited for your friends to walk away
So I could say just what I mean

I know we're moving fast
We're running from the past
I'm holding on before it fades away

Could it be that maybe it's our first mistake
And Baby that's alright
It's crazy how we lost ourselves tonight
There's a reason why they say that we should give it time
But time is not enough
And that's the reason why
When you're young you fall in love

Standing still
I'm waiting round to see if this is real
Cause I feel like I'm asleep
I'll open up my eyes
Cause you might be the type
Of girl that makes me dream when I'm awake

And baby that's alright
It's crazy how we lost ourselves tonight
There's a reason why they say that we should give it time
But time is not enough

So tell me can this really work
Or will we end up getting hurt
Is this love or myth
So tell me are you in for this
There's so much than we can see
More than you
More than me
It takes two to believe

Maybe it's our first mistake
And baby that's alright
It's crazy how we lost ourselves tonight

It's so simple just to let it all begin

To kiss your lips again

And stoop to touch your hand

When I get home
So let the gas fire glow

Everybody's gone and the fever
That lights up the empty room
Floods the distance
And the emptiness between us
Like a miracle

Your bed untouched
You haunted me so much

Your make up on
Your bed untouched
You haunted me so much

Now see the dying summer moon
It's shining just for me and you
And the night that seems so alone is gone, gone, gone

Weave the sunlight in your hair, catch it in your arms
I can see you movin' in, I'm easy and I'm calm

You got my name, pick up my number
Come on, darling, let's be lovers
You got my name, pick up my number
Come on, darling, let's be lovers

It's shining just for me and you

Now where can I go?

Somewhere the wind
Don't blow me back
Into the conversations
Promises and situations, yeah

Cryin' in the streets

On their beats

And what do they see?

Make my walls to piece tonight
But friends keep calling in my head

Staring down at me

Nothing here is real

Sarah and Julie hook up in the park
Jessica cries, she's got nothing to add
I sit beside her, but nobody's there

Spin me 'round
I'm fallin'

You end up alone
I call my folks

Every day is the same, Lord
Girls in the trees
Have the faces of angels

Somebody changed
It's like the year has another face
Smilin' all night long
Through the glass and the pine

You paint the nighttime blue
Lord and the daytime too
Lost in the night with you
I don't wanna wake
I don't wanna wake up

High on a dream
Weary nights of the victory
Heading home
Kicking stones on the ride

Down in the lane
I was so home till I saw your face
But it was just my mind playin' games
With the light

You paint the nighttime blue
Lord and the daytime too
Lost in the night with you
I don't wanna wake
I don't wanna wake up

Back on the streets
Every day is the same, Lord

Have the faces of angels

The Clientele,"Your eyes have grown tired of
Hunting for the fox and the owl
For smooth stones
And a safe place to hide
In the hills is near your home

Now you walk with bare feet through the wet sand
And a boy sees you and comes running over
And stands for forty meters away
Wanting to walk on water
To turn you on
But you don't pay any attention at all
As the world rises and falls

Now you have a woman's shape
Thunderbolts in your fingertips
He has his eyes pinned on you
Be careful, he has whips and chains
And he plays ancient games
Over anyone standing in his way
He can change the color of the sky
If he wants to
But its only magic use to him
Don't be easily taken
Or he won't remember you at all
As the world rises and falls

I tried to tell you not to love him
Strongly as you did
You'll go out again someday
But you won't forget him for a long time
He tore the mask off your face
And then put you down
And made you want him
More than anyone before
And then he walked away
And you don't hear from him at all",As the World Rises and Falls
The Clientele,"What shall we do now then, Jerry?
Nothing's on my mind
August heat has come and set
The tenements on fire

If the night brings jasmine on the breeze
Everybody looks like police
See the light see the shade
Are you afraid? Am I afraid?

Pick me up or let me fall or change me all around
With the afternoon in darkness,
Will it still come round?

See the light, feel the heat
See the faces in the street
See the stars see the sky
Like a razor on mine

And the people drift down from the avenues and lines
With coat and shoes I'm on my knees

What shall we do now then, Jerry?

Haunted in the dark

The Co-Dependents,"Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said you've got to go back,
You know they didn't even give us a chance.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honeymooning down by the Seine.

Peter Brown called to say,
You can make it OK,
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, say what're you doing in bed,
I said we're only trying to get us some peace.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.

Last night the wife said,
Oh boy, when you're dead you 
Don't take nothing with you but your soul think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
Eating chocolate cake in a bag.

The newspapers said,
She's gone to his head,
They look just like two Gurus in a drag.
Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.

The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Caught the early plane back to London,
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said we wish you success,
It's good to have the both of you back.

You know how hard it can be.

The Concretes,"He sings a song and it brakes my heart in two
As he choose to place the chorus in the end
And then he gives me sugar again instead of salt
So that I'll come running back for more
Bye, bye
Sugar again.",Sugar
The Concretes,"Under your leaves I laid
With wishes you'd call my name
And bring me to you well
So my thirst no longer is
You know I'll do anything for you
Bring singing birds to your crown
Climb to the very top of you
Though I might fall
But one day I must go
To get myself a warmer coat
I'll promise I'll be back real soon
Back under your leaves again",Under Your Leaves
The Concretes,"I remember you, bird of my heart
Flew in from the west
Your chest so red n' strong
Have you been to war, have you been to war
Lay you battle axe down
And come around for me
Final nest for you, bird of my heart
Lay down to rest
This song I made for you
Have you been to war, have you been to war
Lay your battle axe down
And come around for med, and come around for me",The Warrior
The Concretes,"I was held by a woman known as the holder
And I'll stay in her arms for the rest of my days

She told me she had something,
Something sacred to give me
And she asked for me to open my mind, so I did

It was very hard
And the struggle nearly killed me
Then she told me to inhale
Whatever came my way

Then a color turned up
Which never been seen by human eyes
And she said it was mine to keep,
To keep, to keep

Now it's deep inside of me
And it holds four different women
Who am me, if you see what I mean

That was why she gave me that gift,
So that I could make room
For the me, the me, the me and the me",As Four

The Concretes,"I don't know about falling in love
'cause it comes to an end I've been told
But when it comes to falling in love
It runs me over

To hand it over

In my hand

Have you seen my chosen one recently
If you do tell him I'm in for love",Chosen One
The Concretes,"You don't seem to grasp your own importance
You misbehave in almost every chapter
You take your rescue in some written fiction
While your own book could use a better plotline

The font should be bold

Try and turn the next page with some tenderness
And maybe things will take a nicer turn
You can't control it like some written fiction
But try at least to pick a selling title",Fiction
The Concretes,"Dressed in lilac
With a scarf wrapped 'round your head
All that beauty fading in the dark
Hope and youth they with come the grey

Dressed in Jackie
Dress she wore some fall before
Revolutionary for the day
Technicolor made it stay the same

Baby, baby, baby you have to leave this town

Flag in one hand
Polished shoes for perfect march
Eight hours of practice is too long
With no one there to see your victory dance

Like a kitten
You sure adored the sun
Ocean view, the blue called out for you
Swim suit on, what kept you in the grey

Love the city
Yet you stay in that old house

Doing what she loves the most, not you",Grey Days
The Concretes,"I must say it was love from the start
when you gave me a tune to sing
But I guess you'll never know
'cause some things are meant
to stay unrevealed

I heard a song on the radio
and it was sung for your ears only

When you're lost though you know
all directions by heart
take a look what's behind the scene
There are hills and trees to be climbed
when you know someone awaits your return ",On the Radio
The Concretes,"He has a voice you can't stop listening to
'cause it touches like a lover
Then the strings come in and ask you not to mind
As he says farewell to Caroline

I loved a crazy man from Mexico
Because he managed to get all
The questions wrong
But the daughter of a sumer month in black
She got her heart broken really, really bad

Then there's the couple with the marching band
The wife she really wanted out
And the horns were shining brighter than the lights
As she was pleading, then leaving for the night

This is for the songs
The songs we had to love",Song for the Songs
The Concretes,"Our sunbeams will have a rough year this year
trying to shine you through 'n' through
Yes I've got all the mirrors it'll take
Don't you worry
you won't get burned

Spend some time in the shade with me

I'm terribly sorry I didn't let you through
I didn't know you were you

I've built a house by the sea for you and me
Walls of glass so don't bring any stones
One of these days we'll open the blinds
Not to worry, you won't get burned

Just spend some time in the shade with me
Close your eyes don't let go of it

I'm terribly sorry I didn't let you through
Don't worry you'll be as new ",Sunbeams
The Concretes,"Yesterday I lost me a memory
I kept too long for no good reason
They seem to hang around to greet the future
And what goes around will come around most likely

Can I go with you tomorrow
I just wanna go, tomorrow

I remember an insect some kind of bee
That came around for a visit on my balcony
It made me so glad I cried
You got a pretty costume indeed

Can I follow you, tomorrow
I just wanna go, go tomorrow
Tomorrow

We landed on an old forgotten shore
That been kept away from sight
since ancient times
Then I took command of some river boat
And steered it into the great wilderness

So if you wanna go where I go
If you wanna go where I go, tomorrow",Tomorrow
The Concretes,"The color of you eyes has faded,
They're not as brown as I remember them as a child
Oh why wasn't I a real child
Why did I have to run before my morning came
Around

You were looking for a way of life
Some way to put your mind aside

This chance you had was your last you said
I admired you strength to give it one more try
Though the cards were stacked against you,
You decided to fight it
And you, you looked so young again

Then the day came around, or it was actually
An evening, when you failed
I remember the moment wasn't anywhere
Close to right,
But will there ever be for those things

I am still glad you decided to give it a final try
Now all I wish for your well deserved rest
I know we don't choose our parents
But we can't ignore the feelings
That we grow for them",A Way of Life
The Concretes,"As I walk in you get up to leave,
You head straight for the door
Is it because what happened between us
I liked it better before

My comment really wasn't that funny
You were never polite
I recall your laughter as sweeter
I guess those things can change overnight

Forgive me, I take it back
Forgive me, I'd take it all back if I could

I call you, hang up
I call you, hang up
I call you, hang up
I call you, hang up

So many things came out bad
I didn't mean them at all
I regret not telling you sooner
On the other hand you never called

Believe me I'd take it back
Believe me I'd take it all back
if I could

Moments you wish never happened
Other you keep for the rain
Forget that they'll be forgotten
Running through you like a train

Believe me I'd go back
Believe I'd go all the way back

The Confession,"They heard the virgins weeping,
Down to town square we go!
There they'll be cleansed by fire!
I know your yearning to burn the virgin!
Let's bring the morales back to,
Back to the town we know.
Nothing is ever sacred,
My final warning, to you I will sing.
I've got the time to lie,
I've lost my faith in you!
These city lights show me what's true!
And it's time for you and I to die!
The city's eating us alive!

And we're running from the start,
We the blackest ice.
Running from what we can change.

Bring on hellfire, you might as well.

Into the ground they'll go.
And I shall be the cleasing,
Taste her sickness.

And I want you purest virgins.
You know they need me too!
Cause it's been hard to resist,
The father of lies will die tonight!
And it's time for you and I to die!

And I'll never be the same!

The Confession,"Downtown where no angels are found, 
We got our own underground, now let me show you 'round.
Welcome, yeah sinners and saints, 
Come see the king in restraints, the queen with his crown.
Pure cry, as we pass 'em all by, 
And you can look in our eyes, and see no signs of light.
Hang 'em high on the street lights tonight, 
And there's no losing the fight, 
We tie our nooses tight.

[Chorus]
You can dance with the devil, but you must wait your turn.
He'll bring you to his level, so you can feel the burn!

Get down, pass the bottle around, 
Pray to the lord you don't drown, and we can show you how.
Sluts twist through the smoke and the mist, 
So get your hand off your dick, and I can show you how!
Hell bent, none of us heaven sent, 
Around the fire we chant, so just walk on by.
Hold tight, to your daughters tonight, 
Cause you know I'll fuck 'em right, you know I damn well might.

Suck it all in I'm watching them cringe
Damn what a waste the boy's got that prescription taste
He's dying away look at 'em fade
There has to be another way

The aftermath is devastation writhing leave me medicating
The hating the horror that haunts my day
If I can get a chance to bursh off this decay
Who gives a fuck, gimme what I need, another dose

And I stop shaking tonight, pull myself up off the floor
Kneel down and exorcise prepare for what's in store, I'm resurrecting
And I stop shaking tonight pull myself up off the floor
Kneel down and exorcise, I'm resurrecting

Lock it away beneath the pain beneath the insane
Take it all in and I'll take the blame
Pushing the grave the cancer radiates in her face
You ruined my stay so I'll destroy the faith there has to be another way

I'm in the rubble contemplating the pills that thrill killin' not aiding
The hating the horror that haunts my day if 
I could get another chance I'd probably throw it away

Who gives a fuck gimme what I need another dose
I'll resurrect for all to see and death to those who've forsaken me

And I stop shaking tonight pull myself up off the floor
Kneel down and exorcise prepare for what's in store
And I stop shaking tonight pull myself up off the floor

Dead man walkin' baby I call 'em how I see 'em
Killin' time killin' pain baby but instead yer killin' me

Back away from the pain it's insane and I will throw away all the things that sting
So back away it's okay you're a stain and now you'll rot away it's sickening

PARTY GIRL
Would you blow up my balloons? Flash!

(Captain Kwirk clears his throat.)
PARTY GUY
Shhh! Cut it! Everybody be quiet!

KWIRK
This is the Captain speaking.

PARTY GUY
(on ?Captain?)
Shut up!

HUNKIE
Who is it?

KWIRK
It?s the Captain! We?re 23 billion miles off course!

SMOCK
29 billion.

KWIRK
29 billion----Operator! Operator!

EUBANGDERE
I?m sorry, sir, but that line is busy, heh!

KWIRK
Smock, we don?t realize what a mess we?re in 29 billion miles off course.

LIMEY
(stupid voice)
Captain, this is engineering, Lt. Limey speaking. Do you realize we?re 34 billion miles off course?

KWIRK
Limey, I just called you! What?s going on down there?

SMOCK
Captain, according to my calculations, we?re 38 billion miles off course.

KWIRK
Thank you, Smock!!!

SMOCK
Why are you pinching your eyes together, Captain? It doesn?t help the situation or does it have any physiological effect? Highly illogical behavior. Tsk, tsk, tsk! You?ve heard me.

(Kwirk sighs in grief.)
LIMEY
Captain, where did you go? We?re 45 billion miles off course.

KWIRK
I?m still here, Limey. Lt. Eubangdere, have the computer compu--course correction coordinates, engineering, curse creation--coor--crea--curs--uuh--engineering standby.

LIMEY
It?s about time, Captain, by now we must be 52 billion miles off course. They?re traveling faster than lightning.

KWIRK
Lt. Eubangdere, where are the course readings, eh? Where? Lt. Eubangdere--uh...Where in the hell did she go?

HUNKIE
She went to church, sir!

KWIRK
Church!? She can?t be, it?s Tuesday afternoon!

HUNKIE
It?s her sect, do you know?

KWIRK
I am aware of her sex, lieutenant!

HUNKIE
No, no, her sect, her sect, she?s among with a poodle-lay(???) you know Kimiwaukee-too-long(???)

KWIRK
Ugh! When will it ever end?

HUNKIE
Captain! Captain! All the stars have gone out!

KWIRK
Lt. Hunkie, if you lean on that button once more, I will have you ejected into hyperspace through the garbage chute!!! Take over the controls, Smock! I?ll find Lt. Eubangdere myself!

SMOCK
Aye aye, sir!

KWIRK
Aw, let?s see, where did she go now?

SMOCK
She?s in the ship?s saps!

KWIRK
The ship?s what?!

SMOCK
The chapel, the meditation area. Although I personally find religion highly illogical.

KWIRK
(sigh) Uhh, I?ll have to take the elevator down. Aw these problems! You see I?m never on this level. Uh, maybe it?s in here. 

EUBANGDERE
Oh my way, oh my way, oh my way...

KWIRK
You can?t do that in there, this is the broom closet!

SMOCK
We?re engaged!

KWIRK
Well, disengaging report back to your stations. Humph! Oh, I must be down the corner to the left. Oh, I?ve got to stop talking to myself.

SINGERS
Ooh-ee-ooh-ah-ah-teeng-tang-walla-walla-bing-bang! Alive men!(?)

KWIRK
Uh, but...but where?s Lt. Eubangdere? Chaplan! Chaplan!

CHAPLAN
There?s a Room 70...???

KWIRK
Aaaahh! Oh! That mask, you scared me! I thought this was the act--uh--uh--the chapel!

CHAPLAN
I?m sorry, I didn?t mean to startle you! Since there?s only one chapel on the Starship Intercourse. I become very indebt as a number of different religious service. 

KWIRK
Oh.

CHAPLAN
I?m afraid I get quite in mast in my role. Oops, there, I?ve spattered blood all over your tights.

KWIRK
Yech!

CHAPLAN
Don?t worry, it?s only pig blood it comes off with a little lemon and salt. You know it?s really wonderful to be a Chaplan in outer space. 

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
Space is so wonderful! So vast! So infant! So religious! I was just thinking the other day when I was doing the terrible complicated Flip-Ziggy(??) services for the worshipers from Zakaan?s...

KWIRK
Zakaan?s...

CHAPLAN
Oh! Which reminds me, Captain, that is a mind of extremely important so of which I must speak to you.

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
It is the matter of the psychic moral of the ship...

KWIRK
Who?

CHAPLAN
Many of the mystic men. How do Americans say it? The little people?

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
Or undergoing a great deal of strange...implants(???) are ruining about the ship. Some of the men are saying that the dietician is putting the salt Peter in the food supplement tablets.

KWIRK
Mmmm...

CHAPLAN
Then, there is the problem of beaming down.

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
The mystic men feel that it does not fear that only officers get to leave the ship.

KWIRK
Huh?

CHAPLAN
There as they put it, going stir crazy acquainted, don?t you agree?

KWIRK
Uh-uh.

CHAPLAN
I even just alone to go dirty religious service, I overheard a room out to the effect. The ship is over 125 billion miles off course.

KWIRK
It is?

CHAPLAN
It is. Isn?t that wonderful? Space is so vast! There are so many possibilities.

KWIRK
Chaplan, this is an emergency! I-I-I must speak with Lt. Eubangdere!

CHAPLAN
Oh dear, she seems to have left.

KWIRK
Oh! (g-are-are-are-are!)

CHAPLAN
Well I?ll bet she?s back in the control room right now. You know, if you keep calm instead of turning purple like that, only your problems would solve themselves.

SMOCK
Captain?

KWIRK
What is it, Smock?

SMOCK
We?ve located Lt. Eubangdere, he?s locked in the woman?s room on Level 4.

KWIRK
Oh no!

SMOCK
We?ve sent a janitor over there with a skeleton key, we should have her out in any moment.

KWIRK
But this is an emergency! Can?t you do anything faster? Can?t you blast her out?

SMOCK
But the woman?s room on Level 4 is only three by three. We wouldn?t want to reduce her to atoms, that would be illogical.

KWIRK
Listen, Smock! We must at--quickly the ship is already 125 billion miles off course!

SMOCK
140 billion miles off course!

KWIRK
Well--W--We must do something quickly, anyway! Say, can?t you operate the computers yourself?

SMOCK
Of course, I can operate the computers, I am the Vulgarian!

KWIRK
Well why didn?t you?

SMOCK
You didn?t ask me, after all, I?m only the Squire, rule of the night, you didn?t order me, Captain!

KWIRK
Listen, Pixie-ears! Get on that computer!!!!!

EUBANGDERE
The price is ten more cents or another five, or three minutes! Whoopee!

KWIRK
I?ve really got to have that operator replaced! Excuse me, Chaplan, I must return to the bridge!

CHAPLAN
Y?all we watch over you! Now how am I to be with you? I?m a ga--uh--guide your error. May this shnook be with in you.(?) Let Christ be above you. And they unbleed(??) of the seven rooms light your way.

KWIRK
Uh, if only I can get up to the main control room in time.

(Controls had gone bad.)
KWIRK
Now, Smock, how?s the computer doing?

SMOCK
I?m programming it now, something seems to be wrong, listen to this...Maybe if I do this...

(Telephone line going fast.)
HUNKIE
Captain! Captain! All the lights have gone out!

KWIRK
Take your hands away from your eyes, Lt. Hunkie. All right, damage control, give me an estimate on the damage.

SMOCK
Well, Captain, it?s easily $27,000,000 worth of damage.

HUNKIE
Uh...$27,000,000 worth of damage?! Grrrr!

SMOCK
Well, actually, it?s only one tube that costs fifteen cents, but the service charge is enormous since the result of many light years away from the service area. That is provided and they can find us anyway seeing us we?re 200 billion miles off course.

EUBANGDERE
What?s going on here?

KWIRK
Lt. Eubangdere! If you leave the control room again without telling me! I?ll--I?ll--

EUBANGDERE
Urgent! (crying) Oh--oh--ah--oh, that?s the way you feel about it! I quit!

KWIRK
Oh! Oh no! Oh! I--I don?t--I don?t feel that way! No--here, have a seat, make yourself comfy, oh, you look nice this afternoon--evening--morning--whatever it is, it?s so hard to tell on ship boarding. When did I say ?blast? anyhow?

EUBANGDERE
Why are you pinching your eyes together like that, Captain Homie?

KWIRK
Can you fix the computer? Please!?!?

EUBANGDERE
Well, of course, I?ll just stick these little old bobby pin in here!

What?s he talking about?

EUBANGDERE
I?m so high!

KWIRK
Limey? You?re demoted!

LIMEY
Oh ho ho, well then you?ll have to get someone else, won?t you? (chuckle)

KWIRK
Oh, oh, oh, no, no! You?re not demoted! Uh--uh--You?re--You?re advanced! Just get us back on course!

Hey! Let?s track ?em down!

Hey, what?s that sound on the elevator?

What are you people doing here? You aren?t allowed on the bridge! You aren?t even off the surface!

Take him to the beam room!

Hold your hands!

(Fast telephone line stops.)
SMOCK
Now, Captain, we?re going to beam you down to one of the large asteroids in the feminine cluster. Well of course in form of space trawl of your co-ordinance, but since we are quarters of trillion miles off course. Guard knows when he?ll find you.

KWIRK
You can?t do this!

You answer back with a, ""Don't say so""

But the best word to describe would be ""ah""
Piffed, mad as me
Which hand is free?
Shake the one that is and I gotta handle my biz
Until I got the achin' ribs
Salute to all them scally-wags and fresh kids, yes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
We can dance if you wanna
We can leave your friends behind
Cause if your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Then they ain't no friends of mine
Yo, it just hit me
I'm the fresh prince
And that means I'm Will
And I chill with the chicks in the back
On the real in my ville
I get kick in the back
From gorillas, but chill that's the skill that I pack
Sonny, you need to rottweiler to do the wop
Old schoolers bop cooler while we movin' through the spot
Cruisin' through the roof '88 frames on Adidas track suit
Ask who? Be quiet when the game's on
Cause I'm in champion ship
And I going through time in my championship
We cannot fall
So I'm leaving you with these 3 words
Yes, yes ya'll

[Chorus:]

Break it, Bop it, Niggas beat-boxin'

The Cool Kids,"They say if you ain't got no money take yo broke ass home
I say if you got you two dollars, then come through to my party
But get bent before you come because for that liquor I'll be charging
And take down these directions
It's right past the intersection
Make a right at the light
It's the first house on the left
And get it, got it good
You made it, I knew you would
We got them drinks up in the back and them chic-key's looking good
Hold up, here come one ay what's yo name hun?
Jackie brown, yea that pop
Ay I'm chuck, this Mikey rocks
And let me introduce you to some kids that you ain't used to
Yep we bet that we ride bikes
Carrying bones and Jordan 5's
Got every single color so
Just in case you wonder
My party's is always live
As a mother is for supper and
In the summer when it's hotter then the oven
We the coolest kids we know
So you know we into something
That involve doing something
With a trunk to get that bass drum pumping
It's my party, so get up
If you don't you getting jumped

What's happening?
Where's the party?
Say you heard me say there's a party
Right around my way
So if you finna' start it
Then don't do nothing small
Get everyone involved and
Say that it's a party

Let me tell you a little about myself
Everywhere I go I act an ass
And if you ain't know
Better go and ask
At every party
I hop the bar
And then dance with the chicks
On top of that
Bartender be like, get off of that
I'm like not till I get rich off of rap
And I look to the left, she dipping her hips
And making her lips, at me I guess
And I look to the left and look to the right
Point to my chest and she was like ""that's right""
Now let me tell you the recipe
To all you niggas tryna' get like me
It takes a scoop of being cool
And the recipe include it
When you purchase my movie
Cause if you knew what I knew
You would prolly' try to
Do whatever I do
Prolly' move to Chicago
If you want instructions
Then I could prolly' front them
Just as long as you shortys pay attention
So if you ugly keep you hands by yo side
But if you not then put em' in the sky
And if you knowin' what it is
There's a party at the crib
Come and party with the kids

Got the gold hundred spokes like ""Boyz N the Hood""

So,
With a little bit of Gold (gold)

Fresh haircut clean shave with the razor
It's a sickness but god is my witness
Blessed with this gift since the day before Christmas
I'm tryin'

Nice with the science on how to stay king of the jungle just like lions
I gotta stay humble and move just like a bumble bee

But I don't brush my shoulders off
So much in the past months 
They looked polished

I'm just being honest
I'm putting on a clinic
niggas dropping out of college
Just do it like we did it

Pigeons always flocking
If you tossin' out bird seeds
I'm in a lions den
With a steak they can't touch me

In these Spike Lee's nikey's
Sucka's they want to fight me

Because their girl friends 
Want a guy just like me
You know what, bite me
Hey they all like me

No sense of throwing punches
Let's do lunch man

I'm a 100 dollar bill
In the hay stack cousin

Want it
You can have as long as  
You stop the frontin'

I be tryin' to pay MC's to behave
But they don't co-operate with me

And lately
They been impatient
They don't like waiting
And that's why they hate on me

So damn

They never had a hand like kings of Ordain

The Cool Kids,"[Verse 1:]
So I'm sitting on the couch holding the remote
Flipping channels, I'm a rebel eating a bowl
Of them fruity pebble, fruity pebbles, fruity pebbles
How gangsta is that. not gangsta' at all?
Aw you judging me dog, please you shop at the mall
Me I shop at boutiques, limited quantity sneaks
Where do these quantities be maybe they all on my feet
But I don't get it tho, about year ago you said my gear is wack
Nigga now my gear is dope, I guess it goes full circle like a cheerio
Cause you rocking what I was rocking like a year ago!
You said my chain was lame then you go and get a rope
You clown jokesters pose for poser posters
Told you when I woke up hold it like holsters
And Stop! While fold the rest of my clothes up
Love the hypocrites hating until you make it
Wack swagga jackers but my styles ain't for the taking

[Chorus:]
(Nigga you still playing sega?) I'm cooler then that guy
(No red monkeys with the bapesters?) I'm cooler then that guy
(What you riding on that bike for?) I'm cooler then that guy
(does that belt say star wars?) I'm cooler then that guy
(Why your jeans ain't sagging?) I'm cooler then that guy
(You ain't smoking on the dro cause?) I'm cooler then that guy
(Where your stunna shades at dog?) I'm cooler then that guy
(Man ya'll niggas ain't got no?) I'm cooler then those guys

[Verse 2:]
I'm in the crib Saturday night with my Sega thats right
Playing a game of that street fighter, street fighter, street fighter
I guess that makes you think you cooler then me
But any girl you can pull I can pull em with ease
Like the letter after D not X to Z, It's easy to me yes yes indeed
It's hard to believe but swallow it
So much game I that I could put it in a bottle and sell it too lames
And getting graphics in ya fade was fresh in the day
But it was jacked by the losers I'm bout too say screw it and
Grow a jerry curl wear a diaper like cupid or something else stupid
And see if people do it and if they do it then that proves it
People are just losers and they'll anything if someone cool do it
But they won't do it first so I guess they not cool
And it's the end of the verse so I'm chucking that deuce

Hold the phone like a call on the other line
I'm on the phone with a bone of another kind
So hold on we could roll to the other side
Side of my dome is the zone you could never find
Quick hands? you might need assistance
Try to find where you are inside of my head
Stay in line single file if you can
Then, we can kick it like kickstands and,
You know I peddle to the chainslip
So fly propellers propel us to the angels
Re-pellin the fellas that's jealous of the name
It's Repellin to rappers as soon as I stage hit
So one two one two mike check
I'm out for hot in e.q. my steps

Just keep 'em off the wall like vans logos
Pull it together the spare change and hobos
Cause if you got change in your pocket
Then instantly the dames start flockin'
And if you'll show me to the stage
I rock.
Yea
Yes that song request, all I need is a mic and English
Drop the beat all right I proceed to spit
Me and the beat start fightin' with the snares and kicks
Now it's a riot on the track
Reason why is cause I'm fire and I'm hired to do that
And I'm fire cause I'm liver then the wire that was tired
Bought back from the dead
Let it rest on ya head.

To myself (thought thought 2 myself) that I need to
Take a trip to the grocery store cause the bread is low and

The chicken I was eatin' with the mash potatoes need 
(a little bit of gold) 
Opps wrong song lyric man a little bit of pepper stepped
Out the crib with the bear claw slippers robe tied tight chest
No chest hair store close at four 
So I gotta get there cause it's like 3:50 and

I'm just wakin' up and it take five minutes just to get to the front now
I'm standin' in long lines lady with the baby probably buyin' some
Dog food, dog probably crazy on the daily basis ma days be like
This cause I got to the register and then the store closed

Yo what up man if you u cool what u do warm it up then
I can't hold it cause it's hot put it down then. I left ma kids at
Day care pick em up then I'm tryin' but some new shit what you
Tryin' spend all I got 5 dollars so u broke man I thought I had
10 dollars so you broke then t.v dinner on the counter warm
It up then, warm it up man, warm it up then

Come get some you little bums I got a lot and you can't get None 
That ice cream truck just left if you run you can catch
But it's out cause I got the last one 
But I got a box of combs that I'm willin' to sell 
I'll sell the ice cream too, two scoops for a bill 

I could build a sand castle without bringin' a pale 
And go cat fish fishin' and come up with a whale 
But but you know what that was easy as hell 
Well maybe not the line about me catchin' a whale 

But if I did it then it's nothin' then I did it as well 
Probably easy as it is to move slow for a snail 
Did you know I made this beat with my mouth and a bell 

Just a F.Y.I, I'm f.l.y and for those who can't spell
I'm a pretty swell guy
I caught a lot of fish I think I have a fish fry.

Need a loan, bad credit need funding
If I go to the club, I ain't gotta spend nothing

In the middle of Chicago?
Sitting 20 inches up, precipitation
On the pavement, I've been waiting for
The warm weather, this sweater's getting
Heavy on me, getting sweaty while I'm getting
Ever-ready, like a wrestler, mentally in shape
I train about 5 times a day for like
9 hours straight. Tied tight on my waist
Run a mile under 3 it's a breeze
I can do it all angles: 90 degrees
Gotta keep your knees up, Young Buck
Never ease up, kids take a seat
It's time to meet teach. Mike rock
Economics while I be on physics
JP engineers while Chuck instructs English
We up in this, don't think for one minute
I'll play dumb, you dumbs, you come
Sit front and center. Pay attention
To the lessons of professors
Speaking to our generation: now or never

This for all y'all
Roll call
Arrive and state your name

Chip 216, it only take about an hour
For a young G to get ready. How long it's gonna
Take you lightweights to get heavy?
A lot of niggas got rock, but my rock's steady
System, a couple misfits with some 'fetti
Ride round LA blowing them trees
I need a soccer mom like that MILF off Weeds
Who sell trees so I can pay rent for her
With this, she says she needs a Raging Bull
Husband must be fired and
Paypal's the new-new
No need to wire that invoice balance
Sweat is the challenge
Hop on turnpipes, smoke out in palace

And shut these corny rapping ?

Triple fat Goose, rocking Goretex
And Air Max boots

Took me running from police on the concrete
Without scuffing my Timberland or Nike

When P had the white Lexus, Silkk had the headband
You and your man's looked like them
Right then my right hand reached my cell phone
And I needed her right name to type in

Surround you with my long limbs
My dear, let me grow in the shade
In the sands by the bank of your river
Let I drink from your streams
The cool breeze fill my leaves

And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
Sweet river caress how softly
Stir my searching roots
Shading the sun in the summers heat
Let I cool you
We have been dancing so long
In the winters freeze and the summers drought
We survive
We belong

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

True and from the heart
There's still the same old hang ups so don't fret
It's not safe yet
And who knows there's always time to screw up again

The Cooper Temple Clause,"I'm not quite how I should be
Been finding tricks to hard
I'm thinking something must be broken
'Cause it wasn't like this before

Now everyone is ugly
And everyone is stoned
Small things about you excite me
But then I'd hate to spoil the tone

All my little somethings just ran out of luck
Secret dates with strangers
Dirty words and fighting talk
I'm so scared just kill me

Time and time again
I can't live with compromise
So maybe we can talk as friends
If at first you don't succeed try again for me

Today is gonna be fine
Tomorrow will be fine too
I asked for things to better me
Even though they silence my soul

I can taste it just for a second
And then it disappears
The flowers looked like glitter
But then so do you my dear

All my little somethings
Just ran out of luck
Secret dates with strangers
Dirty words and fighting talk

I'm so scared just kill me

If at first you don't succeed try again for me

Its in the way that you look
It's in the books that we'll read
It comes and goes like a friend
It's with me right till the end

It's in the memories I lost
It's concentrating to much
It's breaking down our relations
And it's the beat of the clock

It's not being able to explain
Or get your feelings across
It's in the pain that won't leave you
It's coming straight back for us

It's in the new lease on life
And the search that ends well
It's in finding that change
It's being happy again",Talking to a Brick Wall
The Cooper Temple Clause,"Haven't you heard it's getting that time 
So go spread the word and get practising your rhymes 
The foot and the bear and signature moves 
A word in your ear 
And look who's doing stuff 
We love the way you move 
I know we've been gone and we're never around 

But we're coming home and we've missed getting down 
You'll always remain the beautiful boys 
So don't ever change and just go get the girls 
And it's all a request just to carry it on 
A force of a habit to drag us along 
We gave you excuses we gave you a song 
You carried it on 
We love the way you move",Written Apology

But hang around and I'll try and land this thing

Yeah I made a list of all the things
That I could change how I could win
I can't and I refuse to say

All in the name of slavery

Together alone as he greeted the tide

Stand naked my soul laid bare

To shelter from the rain

The Coral,"Sheriff John Brown just wandered into town
Looking for a cripple and a thief
A black man and a woman and a lonesome guy like me
Just trying to raise the stakes so we can be free
The dustballs were blowing the sun it cracked the ground
Where could a crime like this ever be found
Good people of the town said to sheriff John Brown
Go and shoot those invalids right down 

I said Sheriff 
No don't you be cruel 
It could happen to you now 

What exactly have they done said sheriff John Brown
For me to shoot those poor old bastards down
Then outstepped the preacher with his hand upon his heart
Can't you see that I've been chosen by god
And I tell you this for nothing
That crowd ain't no good
They're standing out just like a sore thumb
But yes I do agree said the lawyer on the left
I'd kill them now if it were up to me 

But I said sheriff 
Don't be cruel 
It could happen to you now 

Out into the wilderness the sheriff he did ride
Heading for the river bridge the laws you must abide
Two hours became three, I knew he would come for me
The day grew long and I began to tire
John Brown's face appeared from behind the fire
Boys and girls whatcho doing gonna be so free
The people of the town talk dissapprovingly
Don't want to take you in, that's not up to me 

But I said sheriff 
Don't be cruel 
It could happen to you now 

But guilt and doubt they cloud his mind
He thought what exactly is the law
He didn't even know what it stood for
And who pays the cost for all that is lost
Seems to me an impossibility
And who says what's right and who says what's wrong
Who benefits it sure ain't me
And outstepped the woman saying we mean you no harm
Come closer and I will read your palm 

But I said sheriff 
Don't be cruel 
It could happen to you now 

That night he left a long road came back without a rest
Knowingly he questionned ??? lawyer on the left
Bet you've gone and set them sinners free
Well yes replied the sheriff they done nothing wrong
My god why can't you people see
And the preacher shot him down and his head it hit the ground
The last you'll ever see of poor John Brown 

And the moral of this tale it is simple it is plain
People always need someone to blame

Lives a man we can't forgive
His felony was jealousy
An impossible personality 
And if you think it's you then let me know 
He wasn't rich, he wasn't poor
Though how he longed for so much more
At night he dreamed of buccaneers
Pirate ships and privateers
And if you think it's you then let me know 
His window was his favourite seat
For watching history repeat
Was he cursed or was he blessed
In the end well he confessed 
And if you think it's you then let me know 
This is what he said... 
The warning signs
Are on my wall
There's no feelin' anymore
Has it always been like this?
Signed and sealed without a kiss
Well I know it's there
It's just something that I missed 
And through the tears of madness
Souvenirs of sadness
Is all he sees, all he sees 
So how do I begin to end this tale?
Of a time when all was well
And he'd laze on summer days
Down by the lake
Where the seagulls play
What a way
To waste his days 
Who is to blame?
Have I been framed
Who is to blame
Have I been framed
For the death of these days?

The wind keeps whistling the same old tune

Her hair hung long and her eyes were closed

From all of the feelings that are making you blue
You'll never know how much I... You

Stuck outside of that same old dream
I need to leave but my minds intrigued
Follow close as she does to me

By her grave she awaits her fate
My only crime was to want too much
I could look but I could not touch

And heard her whisper out a name

Are haunting her days

And just like a water baby, baby born to float
And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high
And your heart is Amelia dying to fly
Heaven knows no frontiers and I've seen heaven in your eyes

And if life is a bar room in which we must wait
'Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates
Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates
And we stack all the dead men in self addressed crates

In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
That somehow this black night
Feels warmer for the spark
Warmer for the spark
To hold us 'til the day
When fear will lose its grip
And heaven has its ways

Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes

If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails
And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails

Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right
And your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night

In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
That somehow this black night
Feels warmer for the spark
Warmer for the spark

And heaven has its ways
And heaven has its ways
When all will harmonise

There are couples standing on the street
Sharing summer kisses and city sounds

So I step inside, for a glass of wine.
With a full glass and an empty heart,
I search for something to occupy my mind

But you are in my head, swimming forever in my head,
Tangled in my dreams, swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
All the songs we used to know (listen to the radio)
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go

Now its morning light, and it's cold outside,
Caught up in a distant dream I try
And think that you are by my side

So I leave my bed, and I try to dress,
Wondering why my mind plays tricks
And fools me into thinking you are there

But you're just in my head,
Swimming forever in my head,
Not lying in my bed, just swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
All the songs we used to know (listen to the radio)
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go
I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)

My heady footsteps to this place 
I'm in heaven right now 
And I don't want to come down 

'Cause even if the sun came tumbling down 
You light the ground I walk on 
Even if the moon fell out the sky 
You light the ground I walk on 

Now we're alone gonna show 
How much I need you 
Kiss you so won't ever want to leave me

Oh Bríd O'Malley
You have left my heart breaking 
You've sent the death pangs
Of sorrow to pierce my heart sore
A hundred men are craving
For your breathtaking beauty
You're the fairest of maidens
In Oriel for sure
 
No spectacle is fairer
Than moonbeams on the harbour
Or the sweet scented blossoms
Of the sloe on the thorn
But my love shines much brighter
In looks and in stature
That honey-lipped beauty
Who never said wrong
 
I'm a handsome young fellow
Who is thinking of wedlock
But my life will be shortened
If I don't get my dear
My love and my darling
Prepare now to meet me
On next sunday evening
On the road to Drum Slieve
 
'Tis sadly and lonely
I pass the time on Sunday
My head bowed in sorrow
My sights heavy with woe
As I gaze upon the byways
That my true love walks over
Now she's wed to another
And left me forlorn",Brid Og Ni Mhaille

Translation
I'm a boy from Ireland and I could charm a nice young girl
I would not ask for her wealth as I am rich enough myself
I own a good part of Cork, two sides of the glen in Tyrone
And not to repeat mysel I'm the heir of County Mayo
 
I will go tomorrow to make ale in the wood
Without a cot without a boat without a pinch of gruel with me 
But leaves of the branches as bedclothes over my head
And think well done for you as you watch me from over there
 
A cowherd, my pet, I've never been accustomed to be
Instead of playing and drinking with the nice young women
on the mountain side
If I lost my riches I probarbly didn't loose my senses
And your kiss is no more to me now than a shoe worn for a year",Buachaill on Eirne
The Corrs,"This old house is falling down around my ears
I am drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
And I need you at the dimming of the day

You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
And I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant

I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me

And I need you at the dimming of the day
Yes I need you at the dimming of the day",Dimming of the Day

And my love for you is like a sinking ship

It comes once and then it's over
But my one only wish is for that deep dark abyss

And it's only love and it's only love
That can break a human being
And turn him inside out
That can break a human being
And turn him inside out

What I can't understand please

That lie near the Moorlough Shore
Your vines that blow by Borden's grove
Will I ever see you more
 
Where the primrose glows
And the violet grows
Where the trout and salmon play
With my line and hook delight i took
To spend my youthful days
Last night I went to see my love
And to hear what she might say
 
To see if she'd take pity on me
Lest I might go away
She said, ""I loved an Irish lad,
And he was my only joy,
and ever since I saw his face
I have loved that soldier boy""
 
Perhaps your soldier lad is lost
Sailing over the sea of Maine
Or perhaps he's gone with some other one
You may never see him again
Well if my Irish lad is lost,
He's the one I do adore,
And seven years I'll wait for him

I can't deny it
My heart lies smothered in my breast
But it's not for you to
let the world know it
A troubled mind can know no rest

I put my head to 
a glass of brandy
It was my fancy
I do declare
For when I'm drinking
I'm always thinking
And wishing Peggy Gordon was here

I wish I was in
some lonesome valley
Where womankind cannot be found
Where little birds sing
upon the branches
And every moment
has a different sound

The Corrs,"Last night as I lay dreaming
Of pleasant days gone by
My mind being bent on rambling 
To Ireland I did fly
I stepped on board a vision 
And followed with the wind
Till next I came to anchor at the cross near Spancill Hill

It was on the 23rd June
The day before the fair
When Ireland's sons and daughters
And friends assembled there

The young ,the old, the brave, the bold came their duty to fill
At the parish church at Cluney
Just a mile from Spancill Hill

I went to see my neighbours
To hear what they might say
The old ones were all dead and gone
The young one's turning grey
I met the tailor Quigley
He's bold as ever still
Sure he used to mend my britches
When I lived at Spancill Hill

I paid a flying visit
To my first and only love
She's fair as any lily
And gentle as a dove
She threw her arms around me saying ""Johnny I love you still”
She was Meg the farmers daughter
And the pride of Spancill Hill
She was Meg the farmers daughter
And the pride of Spancill Hill",Spancill Hill

Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Till ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head
“There is no peace on earth,” I said,
“For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.”

“God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men.”",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

I said, that I come from Dixie land
Suzanne, don't you break down and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
Cause I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee","Oh, Susannah"

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff,
and brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. Oh

[Chorus: x2]

Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail,
Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came,
Pirate ships would lower their flag when Puff roared out his name. Oh

[Chorus]

A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
Without his life-long friend, Puff could not be brave,
So Puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave. Oh

The Countdown Singers,"Mornings, evenings, days that hurried past
Dreams that should have lasted
Moments, hours, slipping by as we
Told each other secrets

Somehow I'll never let go of the memories
Something always seems to remind me
Of how it was, of what it was
What it was, all there was

Laughter, love songs, footsteps that I hear
Make me think you're near me
Poems, pictures, letters never mailed
Boats that never sailed

Remember that even though we can't be together
We're more for having loved one another
We shared the sky, we learned to fly

Someday when someone else's arms are around us
When time has put some distance between us
The years will kindly show, how memories come and go
They ebb and flow like the tides

There are quiet, places in my heart
Ever since we've parted
Gentle, tender, traces of a song
Places that belong to you

It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.

that I'm sheltered by your heart.

Here they come, those feelings again!

The Countdown Singers,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

The Countdown Singers,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water [Made in America]
The Countdown Singers,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.

The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

How could I let my angel get away

Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari on my way to rehab

'Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
You can act just like a fool
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
I can throw a major fit
When my latte isn't just how I like it
When they say I've gone insane
I'll blame it on the fame
And the pressures that go with
Being a celebrity

I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters when things don't go my way
And I'll get community service no matter which law I break
I'll make the supermarket tabloids, they'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down the more my price goes up

'Cause when you're a celebrity
It adios reality
No matter what you do
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
I can fall in and out of love
Have marriages that barely last a month
When they go down the drain

Think its time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane

But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But your blind if you can't see
That his love is holding me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, Ain't that a shame

But maybe you misunderstood
Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took

I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is apart of my life
I know its killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture
Your the past I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine

They say that I think I'm in my own world 
What makes them think that I have changed 
A little dough cannot erase my problems 
Me like you I have to try and solve them 
Yes everything is quite the same 

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to be me 
Doing what I got to do 
Some people think that I'm 
Just sittin on top of the world 
I'm just try to be me proving what I got to prove 
Some people think that I'm 
Just sittin' on top of the world 

I wonder why it's often said 
That my life's a fairy tale and 
Everything is so right 
I wish that you could know the truth 
My life is real so please don't get it twisted 
Problems the same and got to be dealt with 
These are the things I wish you knew 

Always in someone's eye so many questions why 
How is it to be down with me with me 
Afraid to express myself always me and someone else 
I need to be free but its not that easy 

[Chorus]

Don't understand why people 
Think I don't have friends 
Who knew me bad when 
This was my dream nothing has changed 
I still do the same things 

Yo,you can quit cookin' short if it ain't about cake 
I ain't sittin' on top I want a house on a lake 
I'm that snotty nosed cat with a new BM 
If you mess with Brandy I gotta bruise your chin 
I be with Puff the girls be like ""Who's his friend?"" 
If I hit a chick once you probably move me in 
So you gotta tell me right now 
Either your wit 
The cats that make the hits or the ones that see the chips 
(Slow down Mase your killin' me) 
But don't stop it 
Whats the use of buying a weight if I'm a hav to chop it 
I use the let a lady till I learned the logics 
She only mess with Mase know the money ain't an object 
If it ain't crissy he won't pop it 
If it ain't platinum with ice he won't rock it 
If it don't cost 60 he don't drop it 
If it don't come with TVs he won't cop it 
u can stop it , yea yea yea what what what?

For droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail?  Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty/fifty, uh-huh

I see you vision mama, I put my money on the long shots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot; sleepin on futons and cots
To King Size, dream machines, the green fives
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type braile
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies

Baby girl was draped in Chanel
Said she love Tupac but hates some LL
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince, turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really wanna thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it on
She keeps these clowns thinking like Jack B. Quick
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats   
No joke all this love, let it stay broke out
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up, outta there, push and check
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist
Or play paper games or floss the Rolls Royce

I give you two, Italian, ice my whole crew

You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my six
You reach it then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'
Hell no, must be out Chicago 
on your knees and your elbows each and every time
That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth though your legs over the bed baby
Work me out

A brand new year, me and you can bring it in

Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chicken heads go up in flames

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

And she's gone.

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

Waiting to take you away

For a lead role in a cage?

The Countdown Singers,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

You led me away from home

Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love

But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

You hoped it would come true
That one day your Prince Charming
Would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
You will never forget
The way you felt when Romeo kissed Juliet

All this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more

I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move Heaven and Earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that

I never make a promise I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever, forever's what I mean

I'm no Casanova but I swear this much is true
I'll be holdin' nothing back when it comes to you
You dream of love that`s everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes

I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move Heaven and Earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart

Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all,

But he just can't see.

His health is fading and he doesn't know why.

Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain

For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime

Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true

Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time

But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise

On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies

And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

Late December back in sixty-three

What a lady, what a night
Oh, I, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon
 
Oh what a night hypnotizin' mesmerizing me, 
She was ev'rything I dreamed she'd be 
Sweet surrender, what a night
I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder,
Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under

Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring

Why, why did I ever let you go?

My my, I could never let you go

I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""

I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

It won't take much longer now
Time makes me stronger, way
There's nothing more to say

[Chorus]
One day in your life
Said love would remind you
How could you leave it all behind
One day in your life
It's gonna find you
With the tears that left me cry
And baby I'm stronger then before
You gotta lay it on the line
Maybe one day in your life

My love
Did you think I'd break down and cry
This thing we had
It mean the world to me
Guess I wouldn't lie
It won't take much longer now
See time makes me stronger way
And I know you'll be coming 'round some day

[Chorus]

You called me in the midnight hour
With your velvet lies
So many sleepless nights, I wonder
Is it time to say goodbye?
Oh yeah

Wondering what went wrong, why love had gone
And left me lonely
I, I was so confused, feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me and my loneliness left me

I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better
Since I found you

You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel the same way

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

'cause I can tell that something is bringin' you down.
(Why are you down?)
Is it the rumor that another boy wants to take your place?
(I hear he's after your heart.)
Have you been hearin' the stories?
They're goin' around.

Your love is all I need.
You should know that I don't need nothin'
That money can buy.
So if a boy were to come along
And try to make me leave you,
(Girl, I'd go out of my mind.)
There'd be no reason to worry,
I'm tellin' you why.
(I need to hear that you really love me.)
Baby, don't you know that I love you,
And I'd never put nobody above you.

For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.
But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all.
I know you've forsaken me,
Till the shadows fall.
But then once again
I can dream,
I've the right
To be close to you

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.

Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.

Could ever hurt me

Weaving a weak alibi
Cause when the night falls, you make me forget

The Country Dance Kings,"They were farm kids way down in Dixie 
They met in high school in the 'sixties.
Everyone knew it was love from the start.
One July in the midnight hour, 
They climbed upon the water tower,
Stood on the rail and painted a ten foot heart 
In John Deere green, on a hot summer night.
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene in letters three foot high,
And the whole town said that he should've use red 
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere Green.
 
They settled down on eighty acres,
Raising sweet corn, kids and tomatoes,
They went together like a hand and a glove.
On a clear day, from their front yard,
If you look and know what to look for,
Off to the east you can still read his words of love
 
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene in letters three foot high,
And the whole town said that he should've use red 
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere Green.
 
Now more than once the town has discovered 
Painting over it ain't no use.
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it, 
The heart keeps showing through.

The Country Dance Kings,"I was goin' through the closet
Back in my old home
Found my letterman's jacket, so I slipped it on
Deep in the pocket, still folded up tight
Was the letter you wrote to tell me goodbye
The minute I saw it I just had to smile
It smelled like old leather, as smooth as a child
I took a deep breath, then put it away
There was no need to read, I knew just what it would say

[Chorus]
I know the words by heart, I know every line
From ""this ain't easy"" to ""you'll get along just fine""
I know every comma, every question mark
No, I don't have to look, I know the words by heart

Scenes like home movies flash through my head
The homecoming game, that night on my bed
The words that you wrote still cut me in two
How you said you still cared but that we were through

[Chorus]

Ain't it funny how a memory 
Can play tricks on your mind
I don't remember a thing from my classes
But I can quote you every line

I took off my jacket and put it away
With your note in the pocket 
Like I found it that day
Poured me a beer, then pictured your face
And drank a silent toast to things that time can't erase

She said she was fresh from the farm
I remember thinkin' for a country girl

We sat there talkin' by the lobster tank
I ordered her a sloe gin fizz
And when them chicken fried steaks arrived
She said ""I like livin' like this"".
So I made her?

With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
Sometimes she runs off and I've gotta trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck

With some stranger on a park bench
She said 'he rebuilds engines and his name is earl
He's the Charlie Daniels of the torque-wrench""
I whispered 'Honey let's just go on home
Have some onion rings and watch TV""
As I walked her to the truck
Earl was crying ""Don't you leave me""
I told him, this here's?..

With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation 
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer 
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam 
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden

Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Vowed we'd never give it up

That September day?
Out in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor,
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones,
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white, and blue
And heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

Teachin' a class full of innocent children
Or drivin' on some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor?
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened,
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger,
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your fam'ly,
Thank God you had somebody to love?

Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love.

The Country Dance Kings,"She was aware of her insecurities
As she took the stage
But she was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered some day
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
She brought them to their feet

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight
To twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us

She's a big star
She eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star",Big Star
The Country Dance Kings,"Folks call me a maverick
Guess I ain't too diplomatic
I just never been the kind to go along
Just avoidin' confrontation
For the sake of conformation

And I'll admit I tend to sing a different song
But sometimes you just can't be afraid
To wear a different hat
If Columbus had complied
This old world might still be flat

Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain
Well, I have been accused
Of makin' my own rules
There must be rebel blood
Just a-runnin' through my veins
But I ain't no hypocrite
What you see is what you get
And that's the only way I know
To play the game
Old Noah took much ridicule
For building his great ark
But after forty days and forty nights
He was lookin' pretty smart
Sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
By havin' strength to go against the grain
Well, there's more folks than a few
Who share my point of view
But they're worried
If they're gonna sink or swim
They'd like to buck the system
But the deck is tacked against 'em
And they're a little scared
To go out on a limb
But if you're gonna leave your mark
You can't follow like a bunch of sheep
You got to listen to your heart
Go bustin' in like old John Wayne

And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call

He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

They never found her body, just her diary by the  bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'  she said, 'Then I don't give a damn

The Country Dance Kings,"From the hills of Kaycee, Wyoming,
Where life's wooly and wild
Came a Air Force brat, in a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile

And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy song
We were much to young, having too much fun
As we all sang along

And we sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows, and the crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side
They tell you ""Good ride, cowboy, good ride""

(Take a ride)

Well gold buckles to gold records
Once again he was spinnin' round
Took the whole world on, and he turned us on
To that Western underground

And from bareback jack to this cowboy's hat
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down, from town to town
Like children running through the rain

And he sang Life's a Highway
There's only one way you're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist, be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows, and that crowd explodes
And them pickup-men are at your side

I lie awake and watch her sleeping 
She's lost in peaceful dreams 
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark 
And the thought crosses my mind 
If I never wake up in the morning 
Would she ever doubt the way I feel 
About her in my heart 
If tomorrow never comes 
Will she know how much I loved her 
Did I try in every way 
To show her every day 
That she's my only one 
If my time on earth were through 
And she must face the world without me 
Is the love I gave her in the past 
Gonna be enough to last 
If tomorrow never comes 
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life 
Who never knew how much I loved them 
Now I live with the regret 
That my true feelings for them never were revealed 
So I made a promise to myself 
To say each day how much she means to me 
And avoid that circumstance 
Where there's no second chance 
To tell her how I feel

But she covered her mouth and her face got red
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't' even act like I was mad
Yeah, I live for little moments like that

Well, that's just like last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was goin' off
And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah, I live for little moments like that

I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank God that she isn't 'cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections, it's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and we're lost but holding hands
Yeah, I live for little moments like that

When she's layin' on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it 'cause it's tinglin' and it's numb
But she looks so much like an angel that I don't wanna wake her up
Yeah, I live for little moments
When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it
Yeah, I live for little moments like that",Little Moments
The Country Dance Kings,"I've got some big news 
The bank finally came through
And I'm holdin' the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake   

There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires

Moonlight on a duck blind     
Catfish on a trotline
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singin' in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

I tell you what we need to do is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little camp fire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

The Country Dance Kings,"She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until' the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her till I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years, she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath

Clinging to his picture for dear life

The Country Dance Kings,"I woke up early this morning around four a.m.
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's okay
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishin' I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em
And take your cap and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need 'em

I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me saying sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear

But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me

I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
Crossin' my fingers, and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

Could melt my heart of stone

I whisper I love you in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say

But I won't say yes to him
Unless I know he's the half that makes you whole
He has a poet's soul and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough

The Country Dance Kings,"Out in the shiny night, the rainwas softly falling 
The tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away 
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling 
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace 
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom"" 
We were part of the lonely crowd Inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, expecting to fly, we would meet on that shore in the sweet by and by 
Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away 
And some of the stayed behind inside the Sad Cafe. 
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore 
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more 
Now I look at the years gone by, and wonder at the powers that be. 
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and let's the rest go free 
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall 
But things in this life change very slowly, if they ever change at all 
There's no use in asking why, it just turned out that way 
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Cafe.

There was something strange about her, for her face was deathly white
She sat so pale and quiet in the back seat all alone
I'll never will forget that night I took Mary home

I pulled into the driveway where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car and opened up the door
But I just could not believe my eyes 'cause the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car but Mary wasn't there

A light shone from the porch, someone opened up the door
I asked about the little girl that I was looking for
Then a lady gently smiled and brushed a tear away
She said: It sure was nice of you to go out of your way

But thirteen years ago today a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life and we miss her so
Thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shone
You're the thirteenth one who's been here bringing Mary home",Bringing Mary Home

Or some other seaport town
I'd put my foot on a steamboat
I'd sail the ocean 'round.

While sailing 'round the ocean,
While sailing 'round the sea
I'd think of handsome Molly
Wherever she might be.

Don't you remember, Molly
You gave me your right hand?
You said whenever you'd marry
I would be the man.



I went to church last Sunday
Molly came ridin' by
I could tell her mind was changin'
By the rovin' of her eye.

The Country Gentlemen,"It was in the time of autumn
The golden leaves lay all around
That we laid our dear old father
Alway beneath the cold damp ground



   It seems but a short time ago
    That he was in the fullest bloom
    But death, alas, has laid him low
    Another victim to the tomb



Many sad farewells were given
Many bitter tears were shed
Our sad hearts all beat with anguish
As he lay on his dying bed

And he needs someone who will listen



    Come and sit by the river with me for a while
    And I'll tell you a story that's true
    Of when I was a boy playing here on the shore
    And the grass was so green and the water so blue



Well our house stood right over there
Of course they took it down for the highway
I can see my moma's tears, we've been there for twenty years
And you know we would still if I had my way

There was always some raft that we were building

The Country Gentlemen,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine

Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine

The Country Gentlemen,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""

For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?

The Counts,"Lift me, won't you lift me above the old routine;
Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.

When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.

It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide,
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Jazzman take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.

He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Oh lift me, won't you lift me with ev'ry turn around;
Play it sweetly, take me down, oh jazzman.",Jazzman
The Coup,"Check it out, it's the motherfucking c-o-u
To the p now you're fucking with the real dudes
Who will meet you with a fleet of brothers in the street
Getting drunk off liberation fuck the hennessey
Cause you calmly kept us down for far too long
Now you're going up in smoke like cheech and chong
And the song ""I ain't the nigga"" is the constitution
Niggas die but africans make revolution
So what happens when a people do not get their dues
Well it's tried there's a riot so flip on the news
And let's go reach the 98th here in oaktown
But let's just say for story's sake that it's in your town
A hundred brothers taking factories, warren's law is gutters
And now they're handing out free chicken and free peanut butter
Free food to the people, how it should be
But now let's go a few blocks over to 7-3
Channel 2 says at the mall twelve cops got shot
Cause there's eight hundred sisters taking over eastmont
With nines and ak's doing the right think like spike lee
And now their babies got free pampers and free nikes
Up at the schoolhouse they said motherfuck a hall pass
Until you teach the truth, check it we ain't going to class
You're teaching lies, we got wise, now we realize
There's no end to this road, you disguised the prize
So peep game for real mental penetration
Our education's liberation

Things ain't gon' never be the same

At 6-9 there's a rally and it's swinging
Through the crowd with a thousand voices singing
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
Motherfuckers took over, and now we running the show
We don't give a damn about section eight though
For what we really need we're gonna have to take mo'
The same thing was heard in the a courts
In kendall village, across the bay in fillmore
And in the hills where all the rich folks live
They're in shock we're not failing to vote and build
Instead of brothers on stage singing ""do me""
A black man has a gauge singing ""do this, see?""
All of a sudden everybody is out of jail
But it's funny cause no one is out on bail
And somebody shoved some police against the wall
I guess today they should've worn their clean drawers
Cause an ambulance came, that's the reality
There's now a new meaning to police brutality

All we need is satisfaction
We don't want just a fraction
And we've come to
A conclusion
Revolution is the solution

Check it
Now the uzi's that were once used to kill each other
Are now used to serve and protect the brothers
And the sisters cause they're packing .45's and nines
We're down for revolution not just down for their behinds
Cause the word is heard across the bay and in l.a
In new york, ny, chicago, and atlanta, g-a
We gives a fuck if you've got money and the millions
Cause motherfucker we've got posse in the billions
So break yourself bush, it's collection day
Break yourself trump, it's collection day
Break yourself dupont, it's collection day
You stole the shit from my great granddaddy anyway
The liquor stores around, but they're not selling beer or ale
Motherfuckers selling molotov cocktails

(E-Roc: What a brother with a afro know?)
Yo, go and flow for the mack and be the hoe
So grow cause the lynchin brothers might get hung
Better rip through em from the tip of my mouth/Mao, say/Tse-Tung/tongue
Deficit (money spent) catch the glint
(E-Roc: of my nine as they cut welfare twenty-five percent)
And I dissent, as I clench and raise my fist
(We did away with, that) so you could get with this
Here's a twist cause we'll overthrow like Kwame N'Krumah
Spread around the wealth as if it were a, vicious rumor
Pam, cuts a record like a surgeon cuts a tumor from a brain
(E-Roc: We're all cooped up so feel the pain)
From four hundred years of exploitation
Anesthesia provided by your local TV station
Patience is not a virtue (I ain't waitin)
Turn this shit over like Bush did a boatload of Haitians

How now Brown Cow I'm down with the Mau Mau
Clown downtown tried to put us in the dog pound
Like H. Rap Brown with the situation
(Won't get no callouses) cause I'm spittin dialectical analysis
So how is this, we never had no Funk
Until you found out that I turned to revolutionary hunk
(Chump!) Bump you over like dominoes, rat
(E-Roc: So free Geronimo Gi Jaga Pratt!)
Lyrics hear it fear it can't get near it
Got a sample didn't clear it
Point Blank says, ""Fuck five-oh!"" That's the spirit
Cheer it, spat out, the fat that I consumed
Knew that I was doomed since my date of birth
To be the wretched of the earth, never had a Dream that was American
(The golden ?leg to chair again?) Despair again
(But that ain't nuthin new) Told the streets were paved with gold
Whoever paved that shit got minimum wage too!

""Do you understand, the metaphoric phrase?"" (repeat 3X)
""Do you understand, do you understand...""

(E-Roc: Gunned us, stunned us) exploited and they hung us
I'd like to take a moment to say, ""Fuck Columbus!""
(Millions off my back) the black on black crisis is a myth
The crack that did this to us (was the one from the whip)
The record skip, the record skip, the record ship *SCRATCH*
The record skips, cause my voice is kinda scratchy
From yelling, ""Oh shit!"" when five-oh comes to harass me
They never pass me, no one to go and tail bro
(E-Roc: Trying to kill the movement with the new CoIntelPro)
Leaders they killed, if I said it, it would threaten em
They only see my back because I'm three steps ahead of em
We're not fallin in the slot you slated
(E-Roc: We realize that our power's nickel-plated)
Masses move as well as asses do, class is through
Our time is over, past it's due
(And you still wanna know) the origin of the flow

Little do they know, they're a little or a big hoe
But they have a car they can side at the sideshow

I'm the type of brother that'll tell another, ""Hell no""
To the seller struck hiking rocks in a hellhole
Whether you can slide you can glide in your hoo ride
But you're gonna drown in the high tide of genocide

Brothers give my five but it's live jive
Can't understand with their hands in a beehive
I'mma take a risk on the dis take a big dive
Just to make it rhyme on time I'll say ""Overdrive""

Missed 'em, I'm not with them but they're victims
'Cause they're just a part not the start of the system
No hocus pocus, that's the focus of the song

No I am a factor that they don't need

'Cause labels are stable in this big world
Talking 'bout sex, you're a boy or a girl
Talking 'bout a kind you're a jerk or the jerker
Talking economics, you're the boss or the worker

Right about now I'm gonna change the flow
Going straight up like my new wave afro
I say it and they play it
Do you hear me though, you're guessing there's a lesson
But teach me, I want to know

Conjunction, junction what's my function?
Connected with the genocidal pace of a race reduction
Funny there's no money for my people's production
The Coup is not through cause we've got some gumption

If you don't make it then they treat you like trash

At times I find my mind can think fast
Like when a pig has a trigger saying nigger that's your ass
Thoughts of a slave master rise from the past
The past is the present, 'cause I still feel the lash

It's against the law just to be black
'Cause the war on drugs is just thugs on the attack
The C is not the source of course so just get back
Why try a lot, I doubt it's just about crack

Maybe could the dream be the dream of an overthrow?
If so no mo' we'll play the big toe
In a shoe that's cramped so break a brother's sole

Slip and stuck slowly to the same game
Several hundred years we have been in a chain gang
Let our shackles only add on to a migraine
Old fame, thoughts of pain slowly drive me insane

But then I started rapping for The Coup
A lot of rappers out there just looking for the pay-off
Listen to the message that the Boots brings to you
The Coup is just a group to bring order out of chaos

Misguiding many to think it's a mistake

Whose brother Elmo, looked like me 
Elmo used to elbow lots of brothers in the nose 
Kick em when they down and he'd steal they shoes and clothes 
Elmo would develop lots of beef as a tweaker 
And all of them was mostly come lookin for me 
Imagine that, fat motherfuckers with bats tryin 
To rat pack, hmm, time to get a gat 
So I'm strapped cause I'm trapped like brother Thomas in his fat 
Momma's lap, what's happenin here's a rap 
Saturday twelve o'clock, told E-Roc, the whole block 
And what not, about, how men are spottin he said 
""This little homey gets bread like flossin 
You ain't Steve Austin, Elmo got paws in Boots 
Maybe you should move to Boston"" 
But you get lost when you play like a punk

""I'm trying, not to lose..."" 
""I'm trying, not to lose my head...""

""I plan to tell you what it is later"" 

Bet George and Bootsy, never had funk like this 
Catch twenty-two, twist no fist can dismiss this 
Rip that I'ma go through, maybe I can flow through 
This whole ordeal and not pull out the black steel 
And my friends make suggestions... 
That I should squeal to the cops but that's out of the question 
If I die by the trigger of a misled brother 
Could he be judged by the system that is scared of me and others? 
I believe no, so I don't go, with the flow 
Even though I'm bout to roll with no paddle 
Up a creek called shit, light is lit on the situation 
Cause me and him is gonna decrease the population 
Now we wonder why our revolution never grow 
Killin motherfuckers just for steppin on our toe 
If we had as much funk for our oppressors as we did 
For ourselves, the blood would never flow again 
And then, the uzis that were once used to kill each other 
Could be used, to serve and protect the brothers 
And the sisters and the cousins or whatever others

Don't want to be eighty-sixed, three six and six ain't in my mix 
Don't flap your lips about me takin no, trips 
You won't be takin no sips from a milk carton 
Seein my face with a caption, askin 
""Have you seen Boots, he's missing in action"" 
This shit is more Off the Wall than Michael Jackson 
Cause brothers who be doin brothers who be doin others 
Screwin brothers but The Coup be doin more than shoo-be-doin 
On the corner, talkin revolution from Victoria to Florida 
It's why it don't make sense that they want me a goner 
On a, run cause some brothers in a ratpack think I'm 
Poppin junk cause they don't see for centuries 
The genocidal funk so I'm a punk if I don't blast they ass 
But I gots more funk for the rulin class 
Will it ever end, will we ever win, drinkin juice and gin

You want to pop the trunk we got serious funk 
""I'm trying, not to lose..."" 
""I'm trying, not to lose my head..."" 

Aight, back it up 
I want to say whassup to the brothers and sisters that really got my back

Of course it goes without saying, that E-Roc and DJO from The Coup 
Got my back at all times and at all costs 
Same goes for D-Force and Sneaker, Point Blank

Osajih Po from the Tenth Planets 
Chuck Da Pharaoh got my back 
Evo got my back, Rose got my back 
Niko and the whole Mau Mau Rhythm Collective 
Got my back cause I got theirs 
The funk is on, and African Identity is there 
The funk is on and Midnight Voices is there 
The funk is on and T-More and Twin from Elements of Change are there 
And I'm there for Cindy, I'm there for 3rd Rail 
I'm there for Aztlan Nation 
I got your back Leftside Sim 
I got your back Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy cause you got mine 
All y'all got my back, Neckbone got my back with the sax 
Problem Child got my back with the piano

The Coup,"Now I shall tell a story that's filled with words 
That start with the letter N 

Step into the world of a nigger, figure 
To stay a little while so pack your bag up bigger 
First of all just let me introduce you seduce you 
Into a frame of mind that's easy to get used to 
Nigger hasn't always meant a man with melanin 
It used to be a piece of wood that sat on the cotton gin 
Masta put it there and it wouldn't move, smooth 
So what does it mean, to be a Nigger With an Attitude? 
You tell me that a nigger's crazy or lazy 
Not about the skin so, don't let it faze me 
Well you amaze me, with that ignorant bizull-shizzit 
Get a grip on the new fit 
'Cause that's a lame frame of brain for the nineties 
I know the game so it don't sting, my mind sees 
So what the fuck you want to race for the trigger 
I ain't the one, I ain't the nigga

Nigger is a word we use today, you say 
It don't mean the same if you spell it with an A 
But that's an argument that makes me itch, I twitch 
If I took the T out will I still mean bitch? 
My name is E-Roc, and I ain't the nigger main 
Save your sellout strut shit for Soul Train 
'Cause I've been known, to knock a motherfucker out 
Without a doubt, The Coup gives me much clout 
But there's a factor when I know that my skin is brown 
And never ever will I put another brother down (gawd damn) 
So I make the mental rule to massacre the word 
'Cause when I hear it, it gets, me straight stirred 
It's mental trash so I'm pickin' up the litter 
I ain't the one and I ain't, the nigger 
My people use this word each and every day 
You see a nigger, slap a nigger, that's what I say

""Boy I love playing the drums, I can do the grooviest rhythms 
I can do rhythms like"" 

My attitude is this (what?) don't call yourself a niggerole (why?) 
Unless you're just an oakie-doke it'll make you sicker though 
'Cause it's all about a mind-time mind-frame 
The system is a chess game with, pawns all the same (haa haa) 
Until we change our mind too
Identify yourself, it's a part of being conscious (yeah) 
If I call myself a gangster then I'll rob you with a gat (yeah) 
If I call myself a brother then you know I got your back (yeah) 
If I call myself oppressed then I'm clear on where I'm at 
But if I call myself a nigger what the fuck is that? (yeah, you know) 
Don't be the coolie or the moolie or a boob with the jigger 
Don't be the one Don't be the nigga

And it wasn't in a trip cause he's not a dealer or a pimp
But now he walks with a permanent limp

Walcy Hawkins and her son's up in double-rock
And it don't stop to the funky beat
Till my people get together and kick you pigs off the street
I grit my teeth why can't I be like Rodney with a camcorder?
Seems we need one every time you get a court order
Or pull me over in order to check identification
I'm in the back of your car with a bruise or laceration
You're in the hood and it's one more disaster
We know you're here to protect and serve the master

On my back, on my head, through my house and once more
You called my mother a ho, you threw my brother in a headlock
You did this to about six thousands on the block
Say you try to stop the rock so it makes me perspire
Hmm...but you work with a supplier
So I inquire what's your role in my elimination?
Ain't got a choir so it sure ain't one of salvation
But if I sung you a song it'd be of damnation
Cause all they do is let me sing in this damn nation
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, how many kids have you killed today?
Pig, now I realize our relation
Your occupation is to keep me in occupation
How many brothers have you left in a cast?
How many graves have you made in the past?
Useless! Not my task to even ask

This little piggy's gun was smoking
Cause this little piggy shot my son
This little piggy went wee wee wee all the way to hell!
Cause we stomped a mudhole in his ass, ha ha ha

I know you motherfucker, my face prints in your knuckles
Hit my head back to the rear and I can hear my knees buckle
And you chuckle...as the blow blurred my vision
You make a game trying to tame me for colonialism
The stars and bars are all you need to make a perfect prison
No chains or fences here so you can make me think I've risen
I'm given rations on the first and fifteenth
Just so I won't be out organizing in the street
And so I'm beaten in the court with charges trumped, see
My eyes is swollen and my nose looks like Humpty's
But I'm not laughing cause I'll take a bath in this one
The judge is looking at me like he wants to have me hung
I never swung, I got the dung kicked out my ass

Step two, say something like ""Nigger you'll never learn""

Now check it, the topic of discussion
Is more than a financial profit
United Snakes won't stop it
Blow for blow, the flow with the commentary gets
Seventy-six septillion tons a-spinnin'
[Steady steppin into a new phase
New thoughts representing our slavery days]
The seeds of weeds and crops is much more than you figure
Yo if he's a black man he must be a nigga
They make a gimmick I wouldn't doubt
[A sucker selling out for the sake of a scream and shout]
Elements don't grow with nonsense
Rather kick a little bit of science
[Science about controlling actions of another
America was built on the sweat of black sisters and brothers]
Never allowed to breathe but allowed to bleed and breed
[Stripped of our creed and religion surviving on intuition]
And what the master said give 'em
[And besides the black man is the original lord of the land]
So I'm clenching my right hand
[Brothers and sisters we must fight this slumlord]
Overlord of the concrete jungle but I'm humble
As I witness my opponent crumble
Like the shack that I live in the house that I rent from him
[Roach infested I'm sure that the rats are nesting
The heat doesn't work he still hasn't checked it
Disrespected me for the last time
I loaded up the nine stepping double time
Bullseye
Another point scored
Right between the eyes of my landlord

They tell me to hold my peace but I just can't
But I'm Defrost of the rap group of Point Blank
So me I'm chilling at the table with my family
Hypothetically trying hard to keep my mind off the economy
Yeah I know the reason I find it hard to pass the test
Call me a victim cause I'm another brother jobless
Every day it seems like I'm moving closer to the streets
PG&E repo'ed the lights and my fucking heat
The situation's getting hard for me to handle
Had to trade my Nike's to the store to buy some candles
Last to first and I'm a-hunted and a ho I know
The man is going to come and throw me in the cold
Tears in my eye as I'm thinking of place to stay
While I'm staring at the freebie cheese up in my plate
I heard a bang bang bang knocking at my door
I looked up it was my motherfucking landlord, let him in quick
Followed by the sheriff deputy trying to come in
Every po on my property, staring me down
Mugging hard up in my family's face
While they're sitting at the table trying to say grace
But before I make this one my last meal
Any moves, yeah I'm looking for the damn kill
I said it twice in case he didn't hear me though
Sucker made a move evidently when he hit the floor
So now I'm in cuffs for the crimes I've committed
Maybe I'll go to jail, heh, or maybe I'll get acquitted
But the fact still stands I killed my landlord dead
Now I've got three meals and a roof over my head

Cash is made in lump sums as street bums eat crumbs
So I defeat scum as I beat drums
Rum-tiddy-tum like the little drummer boy song
Here comes the landlord at the door, ding dong
Is it wrong that my momma sticks a fat-ass thong
Up his anal cavity cause he causes gravity to my family
Says we gotta pay a fee so we can stay and eat
In a house with light and heat
The bastard could get beat, stole the land from Chief Littlefeet
House is built on deceit, got no rent receipt
So I'm living in the street and I'm down now
Don't you know to not fuck with the Mau Mau?
Notice of eviction, four knuckle dental affliction
Friction, oh did I mention
You'll be finger licking as I handicap your diction
And you say you're not a criminal like Tricky Dick Nixon?
While we're fixing to impose rent control
We didn't vote on it, this land wasn't bought or sold
It was stole by your great granddaddy's ganking
Osagyefo said they call it primitive accumulation
Plantations, TV stations wealth is very stationary
I learned the game and I became a revolutionary
Scaring the corporate asses cause the masses are a loaded gun
Killing the world banking and international monetary fund
I'm done, we're done with what you've done
For twenty-five score we've got a battle cry
Kill my, kill my, kill my, kill my
Kill my, kill my, kill my, kill my landlord

I need six hundred dollars by the end of the week
My body is cold, dirty socks on my feet
Not a black sheep, but who's the creep
Trying to put me on the street while I'm trying to sleep?
I wanna kill my landlord, murder in the first degree
If there's something wrong he wants to blame me
Wants to be a threat so he carries a gun
Well I pack a Well I pack a 9 cause I can't trust 911 cause I can't trust 911
Son of a gun, I'm the one who cuts the grass
Wash the windows and he still wants me to kiss his ass
But I laugh cause America's not my home
My landlord took me away from where I belong
But it's a sad song so I face reality now
Pick up the phone and now here comes the Mau Mau
To the rescue, down with The Coup
Yo landlord, I've got a little message for you
I'm going cuckoo, fuck a machete or sword
E-Roc is on a mission to kill my landlord",Kill My Landlord
The Coup,"*sounds of smoking, coughing, and choking* 

""Do you know what's green?"" 

*DJ Pam cuts and scratches Cypress Hill ""puffin on a blunt""* 

[Boots] 

Last night I puffed on my last blunt, damn that was a stupid stunt 

Cause I done said this ten times befo' 

That when my life has come to a crescendo, I would let that indo go 

But I'm still kissin it like I'm under the mistletoe 

So here we go I'm Mork'in with the steady swagger 

Speakin with a stunt, steady stagger preachin with a Southern drawl 

That sounds like Jimmy Swaggart coughed and played it off 

Said I know I'm flippin since the last one G my laces are tied 

So you can't trip with me, I remember 1988 December 

Someone said, ""Puff on this before you go up in her"" 

So I did it and I guess it must have did the trick 

She enjoyed it so I guess I must have rocked the clit 

Felt like a man and I loved her with an indo trip 

Don't know why, cause I couldn't even feel my dick 

Ego trip lasted and I'm always gettin blasted but it's drastic 

Cause sometimes that shit can help you get your ass kicked 

Can't buy it with plastic so I'm off to drain the vein for days 

I get complaints, cause the neighbors say my house stink 

Call myself a saint, cause I won't touch a bowl of food 

I gives a fuck, just don't interrupt my Looney Tunes 

This afternoon cause I can find a job anytime 

Step off my behind I'm in a Doobie Brothers state of mind 

Run-D.M.C., AT&T, yo they both Be Illin' 

I smoked that blunt for last month's three hundred dollar billin 

And I'm willing to admit that when provoked I smoke to cope 

But if I didn't take a toke I'd be leadin a street revolt 

So I make a mental note, and to my frustration 

I decide I can't do shit about the situation 

Put the spliff to my lips, flick the Bic and it's on hit 

Coulda been my last blunt... but I can't quit 

Cause then I have to deal with, some motherfuckin real shit 

Squeezin me tighter than you gotta squeeze a cow's tit 

But on the flip tip I know I gotta get a grip 

Even though in high school he used to be hip 

*coughing* 

But shit I'm hockin spit like I thought it was worth somethin 

My throat can't take no more, no future in my frontin 

But it's rough when you grow up and the tough men roll joints 

That's why I been on the bench for marijuana to this point 

But it don't faze me though I take it lacadaisical 

It takes a while for ways to grow and get out of the old flow 

But I'm an old bro, I done passed two decades 

I'm wearin shades so my eyes don't reveal the red haze 

Caused by my yung, cause days like Frankie Beverly 

Amazin em back it's tried again, no roaches and no safety pins 

Now I'm pennin rhymes about gettin on the wagon 

And I get skittish when I think of how the British 

Put the opium in Asia, fat one to that tactic 

Gankin black folks while they daze ya, if you're gettin perved 

You're gettin served this economic, like the gin and tonic 

Brothers get moronic from the chronic bionic, and it's ironic 

Cause we're not gettin fucked up, we're just gettin FUCKED 

Shit out of luck and we're stuck with our mind in a muck 

So don't duck the situation cause I used to smoke fat Taylors 

Til I figured out that the ganjah was a jailor 

Wait a, minute, while I get up in a funky situation 

The Coup is coming through, and there's no hallucination 

So what the fuck they say that junk is good for meditation 

If you smoke a sack, take some Ex-Lax it's mental constipation 

There's no hesitation when I'm talkin bout political friction 

Stoppin evictions 

Government made afflictions and I have an addiction 

That's a big contradiction so I must confront it 

Cause ain't no revolution gonna come from a blunt

Of some soon to be cake grounds, and then go make rounds
Firearms protectin' wads of gorgeous greens
Paper stacks of paid tax off of broken dreams
At puberty his liberty was found within a key

It's all the same (the business game) but you go to jail for this shit

Who's the fittest, as I raise my fists up can't survive and not be ruthless

Well Lonzo says the County is the slipper, tripper, stucker
Years of unsettled funk and who gets what bunk junk
Makes you feel like you took a test and flunked
(But don't get disturbed or perturbed; the teacher's
On my last nerve, plus he grades with a downhill curve)
Told Lonzo kick it, the system is wicked, trick it, predict it
We got a way to lick it, gave him a book, said, ""Here's the ticket""
(Now he's addicted) to learnin' how we been afflicted
And what distributin' that shit did
I made a quick bid to say, ""Don't trip kid
You never worked for the mob"" (You had a government job)
Lonzo knew I was right, no fight, now we're tight
(Plus he been out of jail about a year ago last night)
Now he hangs with us poor revolutionary brothers
And five-oh, more than ever wants to fuck us

And everyday I pulls a front so nobody pulls my card 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin hard 
I'm lookin behind me beside me ahead of me 
There'll be no feet makin tracks here instead of me 
But I can't disregard just what the news says to me 
I'm twenty-one, so I've reached my life expectancy 
At any minute I could be in some shit that kills my skinny ass 
From motherfuckers doin the sellout strut or probably Oakland task 
My relationship with OPD has been like one big diss 
Long arm of the law, grips my dick so tight it's hard to even piss 
So I forgot ain't even got a pot to do it in 
Up at the church they're tellin me it's because I live in sin 
So I grin, but nevertheless my mind won't dwell 
I must be trippin cause I thought I was livin in hell 
Capitalism is like a spider, the web is getting tighter 
I'm struggling like a fighter, just to bust loose 
It's like a noose asyphyxiation sets in 
Just when I think I'm free it seems to me the spider steps in 
This web is made of money made of greed made of me 
Of what I have become in a parasite economy 

In the winter there's a splinter with the smell of the rain 
And the scent of the street, but all I smell is the pain 
Of a brotha who's a hustler and he's stuck to the grind 
Of a sista who's a hooker gotta sell her behind 
Desperation makes her brotha get a little more bold 
The circumstance gets deeper when it's damp and it's cold 
So I spend my time thinking bout the ultimate gank 
Can I get my Coup together pull a move on the bank? 
I be the picture perfect hustler for the piece of the pie 
But my daddy always taught me just to reach for the sky 
Now my dream and aspirations go from single to hoe 
As I realize there's a million motherfuckers in the cold 
No need to be told, cause when you got a million po' people

here's a FOOT for his anus!

It was evident the President didn't like us

Get down, get down, get down

It's almost 10 o'clock, see, I gotta ball of lint for property
So I slip my beanie on sloppily
And promenade out to take up a collection
I got game like I read the directions
I'm wishing that I had an automobile
As I feel the cold wind rush past
But let me state that I'm a hustler for real
So you know I got the stolen bus pass
Just as the bus pulls up and I step to the rear
This old lady look like she drank a 40 of fear
I see my old-school partner, said his brother got popped
Pay my respects, ""Can you ring the bell? We came to my stop""
The street light reflects off the piss on the ground
Which reflects off the hamburger sign as it turns round
Which reflects off the chrome of the BMW
Which reflects off the fact that I'm broke
Now what the fuck is new?
I need loot, I spot the motherfucka in the tweed suit
And I'm in his ass quicker than a kick from a greased boot
Eased up slow and discreet
Could tell he was suspicious by the way he slid his feet
Didn't want to fuck up the come-up
So I smiled with my eyes said ""hey, how's it hanging guy?""
Bumped into his shoulder, but he passed with no reaction
Damn this motherfucka had hella Andrew Jacksons!
I'm a thief, or pickpocket, give a fuck what you call it
Used to call em ""fat cats"", now I just call them wallets
Getting Federal, ain't just a clepto
Mastercard or Visa? I gladly accept those
Sneaky motherfucka with a scam, know how to pull it
Got a mirror in my pocket, but that won't stop no bullets
Story just begun, but you already know
Ain't no need to get down, shit, I'm already low

Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

My footsteps echo in the darkness
My teeth clenched tight like a fist in the cold sharp mist
I look down and I hear my stomach growling
Step to Burger King to attack it like a Shaolin
I never pay for shit that I can get by doing dirt
Linger to the girl cashier and start to flirt
All up in her face and her breath was like murder
Damn, the shit I do for a free hamburger!
""Well you got my number, you gonna call me tonight?""
""It depends, is them burgers attached to a price?
I'm just kidding, I'mma call, even write you love letters
Thanks for the burgers, um, hook me up with a Dr Pepper""
""That's cool, you want some ice?""
""Yeah, and some fries would be hella nice""
""Damn my manager's coming, play it off, okay? Have a nice day!""
""I'm up outta here anyway""

I use peoples before they use me
'Cause you could get got by an Uzi over an OZ
That's what a OG told me
Gots to find someplace warm and cozy to eat the vittles that I just got
Came to an underground parking lot
""This place is good as any, fuck, it's all good""
Walked in, found a car, hopped and sat up on the hood
Ate my burger, threw back my cola
Somebody said ""hey"" it was a rent-a-pig, I thought it was a roller
""Want me to call the cops?"" I don't want them to see me
Looked down and saw that I was sitting on a Lamborghini
It was Rollses, Ferraris and Jags by the dozen
A building door opened, damn, it was my cousin
Getting off of work, dressed up, no lie
Tux, cumberbund and a black bow tie
I was like ""hey!"" (""Who is it?"") ""me""
(""Oh, what's up man, I just quit this company
They hella racist and the pay was too low"")
I said ""right, what was up in there though?""
(""A party with rich motherfuckas, I don't know the situation
I know they got cabbage, owning corporations
IBM, Chrysler and shit is what they said"")
Just then a light bulb went off in my head
""They be thinking all black folks is resembling
Give me your tux and I'll do some pocket-swindling""
Finna to change in the bathroom and not freeze off my nuts
Lets take a short break while I get into this tux

Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

Fresh, dressed like a million bucks
I be the flyest motherfucka in an afro and a tux
My arm is at a right angle, up, silver tray in my hand
""May I interest you in some caviar, ma'am?""
My eyes shoot around the room there and here
Noticing the diamonds in the chandelier
Background Barry Manilow, Copacabana
And a strong-ass scent of stogies from Havana
Wasn't no place where a brother might've been
Snobby old ladies drinking champagne with rich white men
Alright then, let's begin this
Nights like this is good for business
Five minutes in the mix, noticed several different cliques
Talking, giggling and shit
With, one motherfucka in betwixt
And everybody else jocking him, throttling
Found out later he owns Coca Cola bottling
Talking to a black man who he's confused
We looking hella-bougie
Ass all tight and seditty
Recognized him as the mayor of my city
Who treats young black men like Frank Nitty
Mr Coke said to Mr Mayor: ""you know, we got a process like Ice T's hair
We put up the funds for your election campaign
And, oh, um, waiter can you bring the champagne?
Our real estate firm says opportunity's arousing
To make some condos out of low-income housing
Immediately, we need some media heat
To say that gangs run the street and then we bring in the police fleet!
Harass and beat everybody til they look inebriated
When we buy the land, motherfuckas will appreciate it
Don't worry about the Urban League or Jesse Jackson
My man that owns Marlboro donated a fat sum""
That's when I stepped back some to contemplate what few know
Sat down, wrestled with my thoughts like a sumo
Ain't no one player that could beat this lunacy
Ain't no hustler on the street could do a whole community
This is how deep shit can get
It reads ""macaroni"" on my birth certificate
""Puddin'-Tang"" is my middle name, but I can't hang
I'm getting hustled only knowing half the game","Fat Cats, Bigga Fish"

Known in the states as Mr. Thomas' boy
He found that preventing this affliction was lost
With the mention of the phrase, ""Um yessir boss!""
When that phrase was uttered many stomachs would wrench
Some jumped in the Atlantic to escape the stench
He know that ass-breath came from kissin ass a lot
To be the boss's knight-in-armor like Lancelot
Doctor Misoi years later, before he was hanged
Developed pills with the taste, of lemon merengue
Made from ground gunpowder, of Haitian slaves
And swept from Seminoles who just wouldn't behave
He tested first on young Nat from the Turner plantation
Then sent a batch off to the French speakin nation
It should also be noted a bottle of it was found
In the clenched dead hand of the white John Brown
Everytime it went 'round new people would find it
They would take their essence, put it in and grind it
In Russia, Africa, Asia too
Mao Tse-Tung made the flavors new
In Cuba, the people make new shipments
Of this pill that is on the FDA shit-list
That is not recommended, to take befo' dinner
When supervisin Presidents and such type sinners
Take this pill and say what you wish you said
It hardens backbones, they might wish you dead
And it's not to be confused with courage juice
Which we drank in chains and we still ain't loose
These pills really should be taken in groups
Cause ass-breath motherfuckers move with troops
MLK took half a pill, procrastinatin
Once he took a whole pill, they assassinate him
Take Ass-Breath Killers, to really get down
Wherever rocks, fire, and struggle are found

[singers]
When it's time to speak up and you can't make a sound
Take the pills that'll make you kick the king in his crown
Take Ass-Breath Killers, to really get down
Wherever rocks, fire, and struggle are found

So you done took the pill, is it workin yet?
(Nah; man is yours workin yet?)
I think mine is about to start workin now
There it goes
""Hey what are you guys supposed to be doin?""",Ass-Breath Killers
The Coup,"I'm a walkin contradiction like bullets and love mixin
Slur my words with perfect diction, I'm guilty of my convictions
Complicated compositions punctuated propositions
It's tenacious two-step, audio with ambition
Make you rev your transmission, in the intersection twistin
When the Henny hits the ground, sidewalks will be christened
I'm so nervous and sweaty, that this gat might slip out my hand
A homeless dude need a tip in his can
He put his bid in this man, now it's just bitterness man
We need to better this plan, I'm not just spittin at fam
When I'm runnin from the police I don't have to rush
I'm so dope I just jump in the toilet and flush
We cut it boil it and hush, 'luminum foil it and such
Tryin to catch the few bucks them big boys didn't clutch
We use a tweezers for crutch, when we done burned down the dutch
But when they Starsky & Hutch, we just shit out of luck

Ay, obviously what we've been doin so far ain't workin
Get your hustle right

Excuse me colonel sir, may I request please
Permission to go home or blow off your knees
It's a wrap then (HEY!) grab the Mac-10 (YEAH!)

In case you're wonderin, well yes I'm gon' fight
I'm fin' to join the army, but one you don't like

Needed some stackoli to get free like a parolee
Now I'm in apparel colored shirt and guacamole
In another country brought to you by Coca-Coley
Ordered from the top to shoot everything holey
Shit I'm 19 and I'm missin all my homies
All that fight for freedoms hit; we know that shit is phoney
Free to work at Shoney's 'bout one hour for six boneys
And everybody we hustle scratch and scrape for macaronis
And cheese, bullets squeeze outta my assault weapon
Tear through the air, then his chest, then his breaths and
Looked like my homie from the hood I be reppin
I wept then, changing from a soldier to a veteran
Left in shambles 'bout this kin of no relation
Crept in the sergeant's tent with quiet calculation
Message from the soldiers to the brass administration
Looks like Captain Sterling's fin ta have a situation

[Chorus]

Get yo' ass off the flo' {*4X*}

""I have just killed my first but it may not be the last one""
I screamed this at the sergeant with his head press to the magnum
You brought us to this country not to free but bodybag them
And free up all their money so accounting firms can add them
Drag them and their corporates to their own battle
Now they're dragging us to the slaughter like cattle
Me and the whole unit we will start to ramshackle
Listen very closely you can hear the fire crackle
You could weigh the air as he was breathing out his nostrils
Couldn't understand we we were semming so hostile
Said ""We spread democracy"" like he was preaching gospel
Slapped him in his head and said ""Now shut up Sergeant Roscoe!
If this is not explicit, lemme tell ya straight out
We'll no longer kill to keep this country drained out
We want up outta here like on the next planes out
Tell the Cap'n make it happen or we'll blow his brains out!""

Y'all motherfuckers heard what we said

In a land not very far away from here
George W. Bush was drinkin' beer
His daddy was head of the CIA
Now listen up close to what I say

The CIA worked for Standard Oil
And other companies to whom they're loyal
In a whole 'nother land by the name of Iran
The people got wise and took a stand

To the oil companies, ay ain't shit funny?
This is our oil, our land, our money
CIA got mad and sent false info
To Iraq to help start the Iran-Iraq wo'

Pronounced war if I have to be proper
The CIA is the cops that's why I hate the coppers
Saddam Hussein was their man out there
They told him to rule while keepin' people scared

Sayin' any opposition to him, he must crush it
He gassed the Kurds, they gave him his budget
Said you gotta kick ass to protect our cash
Step out of line and feel our wrath

You know the time without lookin' at the little hand
Time came for them to cut out the middle man
Children maimed with no legs and shit
'Cause the 'Bomb's over' you know the OutKast hit

And they really want you to hate him dead
When just the other day they made him head
War ain't about one land against the next
It's po' people dyin' so the rich cash checks

",Head (Of State)
The Coup,"I love them boosters, they love them boosters
You should love them too, even if they don't know ya
They'll get it for ya like a whole outfit or shoe

I love them boosters, they love them boosters
You should love them too, even if they don't know ya
They'll get it for ya like a whole outfit or shoe

A booster is a person who jacks from the retail
And sells it in the hood for dirt cheap resale
In these hard times and press on like Lee Nails
In all of my experience, sex has been a female

Back in elementary, my shoes used to rap
Every time my soles would hit the street they would flap
Then in high school Langston Anderson would cap
'Cause my jacket didn't have a brand name on the back

Years later, this lady took me to her apartment
It looked like the Macy's sportswear department
Clothes on the chairs, on the couch and the carpet
A twenty had me icy like leasing in the Arctic

If it wasn't for the hard work of a booster
Most couldn't go to the clubs that we're used to
If you won't get the dress cold, they'll boot ya
Like people who did dress up won't shoot ya

For some of y'all folks, this stuff might phase ya
This ain't the way the society raised ya
But most of it was made by children in Asia
The stores make money off of very low wages

The next time you see two women running out the Gap
With arms full of clothes still strapped to the rack
Once they jump in the car, hit the gas and scat
If you have to say something, just stand and clap

I love them boosters, they love them boosters
You should love them too, even if they don't know ya
They'll get it for ya like a whole outfit or shoe

This goes to all them hard working women
Who risk jail-time just to make them a living
We know there'd probably be no one in prison
If rights to food, clothes, and shelter were given

Plus they be giving me dress so fresh
Even when my wallet yells 'SOS'
In a cheaper Sunday suit, you feel a little more blessed
So until the revolution that I profess

My shirt is from Stacey, my pants are from Rhonda
My shoes came out the trunk of a baby blue Honda
My wardrobe's in luck if something falls off a truck
If you're looking for some leather, then go see Yolanda

I'm on the red carpet and they ask who designed this
I'm gonna give a shout out to Bay Area's finest
All on our own, we survive this with slyness
But when we come together, all our fashion is flyness

I love them boosters, they love them boosters
You should love them too, even if they don't know ya
They'll get it for ya like a whole outfit or shoe

",I Love Boosters!
The Coup,"[Chorus]
They're givin us a mind fuck
They don't have to put our hands in cuffs
They can tell us stay put and that's enough
We bust, they feel the earth vibratin
It ain't a earthquake, we just need a new equation
Mind fuck; they don't have to put our hands in cuffs
They can tell us stay put and that's enough
We bust, they feel the earth vibratin
It ain't a earthquake, we just need a new equation

The fog rolls in like the thickest cream
Nightfall comes and the crickets scream
Deafened by the latest lotto ticket schemes
Cement lies and white picket dreams
The pain on his face is glistening
No one's eyes are listening
'Til his 44 starts whistling
Hairs on necks bristling
You can holla so loud 'til the silence comes
Ask that hustler with the Midas tongue
He was born after you but not quite as young
Waitin for the day when the fighters come
She said, ""Seem like traffic lights is always red""
""Your application's on file,"" is all they said
She wish the great leaders wasn't always dead
She could resurrect 'em inside of her instead

[Chorus]

He was killed in the end by quiet persuasion
Not the FBI home invasion
Nor the cross on his lawn emblazoned
The predictable fights didn't phase him
Bullhorns off holidays given
House notes nine to five prison
He yells at the news sayin, ""There'd be a movement
If the new generation was a little more driven""
One mind, two hands, four walls
She says Babylon's gon' fall
She'll tell you the signs since everybody's dumb
She'll be home waitin for the Messiah's phone call
There was pride in the fact that the blunt was massive
Tight like the ships in the middle passage
They escaped through the flames, then wondered
If the flame in their soul, if the smoke has smashed it

[Chorus]

Day broke in like a fiend with a ladder
Suicidal dew drops splatter
Teeth on shirtless bodies chatter
A blowjob short of a breakfast platter
Crowded rooms on lonely souls
At work before the whistle blows
They never knew their strength in numbers
So power seems so mystical
They're waiting for that perfect day
When they've paid all their bills
They kids are grown, they graduate
And guerrillas come out the hills
And for her it gets too much
'Til she won't accept my touch
She'll fix it by herself
She's fallen into their mind fuck

Lash out for your just desserts
It's not just the worth
Some of y'all heads up in the clouds
I'ma bring y'all back to earth
It's black back to birth
Bullshit y'all talkin' 'bout
Out ya mouth, I'm not concerned
Cause y'all got the nerve
It's y'all turn like Detroit red
When he said he had an ultra perm
The long walk to burn your bare heels
So they worn your boots
The game camouflage like army suits
But I can see it more clear cause I came with the coup in here
Ring the alarm and form the troops
Send 'em out into the world, go to war in a fluke
Eye to eye with the enemy you sworn to shoot
Now comin' at ya neck sick ya hand, something wrong with me
Motherfucker somethin's wrong with you
When you cheat just way to smart to question
The enemy the brothers of a dark complexion
The governments of the world is shark infested
They heavy on weaponry like Charelton Heston
Man yeah it gets low here uh, real low
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

[Boots]
Death to the pigs is my basic statement
I spit street stories 'til I taste the pavement
Tryin' to stay out the pen while we face enslavement
Had a foolproof hustle 'til they traced the payments
I was grippin' my palm around some shitty rum
Tryin' to find psalm number 151
To forget what I'm owed, as I clutch the commode
Alright, put down the bottle and come get the guns
I get off the chain like Kunta Kinte with a MAC-10
They want us gone like a dollar in a crack den
Said at least a track then, seeds & stems
Mind cloudy through the wheeze and phlegm
I'm get my brain off of that and the Jesus hymns
If we waiting for the time to fight, these is thems
Tellin' us to relax while they ease it in. We gettin greased again
The truth I write is so cold, It'd freeze my pen
I'm Boots Riley it's a pleasure to meet you
Never let they punk ass ever defeat you
They got us on the corner wearin pleather and see through
All y'all's gold mines they wanna deplete you
I ain't just fin to rap on the track, I fin to clap on the back
And it's been stackin' to that
Been a hundred years before iceberg ever lean back in the 'lac
Before they told Rosa black in the back
Before the CIA told Ricky Ross to put crack in the sack
And Gil-Scott tradin' rappin for smack
This beat alone should get platinum plaques
I'd rather see a million of us ecstatic to scrack
'Cause if we bappin' 'em back we automatically stack

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
This the guy like Truman C[e1]
Riq, Boots and me
Activate in the community
Up in the bay like Huey P
It's like a free, it remind me of the be	 Kder's love for me
But beats got it twisted, I'll untangle it
Black mind is entwined like the ropes they used to hang us with
This is my favorite shit, I came in the game with any way to spit
Ya got a questionnaire, who you bangin' with?
Take it back to M hotel
Throw a step deeper like a poor righteous teacher with holy intellect
Killer flow form a real niggaz laughin'
And forni fairly at a jigabou at a penitent (???)
Once again you can feel hip-hop
Underground, still about McGruff
Gangsta like, fuck the cops
Talib Kweli revolutionary mc, and that ain't about stuff

You was all smiles and no games
Teeth white as cocaine
Dark skin, knew about the struggle and the dope game
Quick to spark a convo into flames like propane
Filled the air, and I was thrilled you cared
In summer bridged hiding from the tutors
Bumpin gums about the future
You said that one day we'd be ruled by computers
I said, ""It's like that now cause we all machines""
And you replied, ""But I'm a robot with dreams""
Which I thought was clean
And all the fellas used to talk about ya
How you had a joyful aura and a walk about ya
Necessitated by a beautiful backside
We thought you was fine
And we didn't let the facts hide
Nevertheless we would call you ""waddle waddle""
Somebody shoulda slapped us with an old hot water bottle
Could called you ""talky talky"" or nothing at all
I was crushed when I got the call

You had warmth and sincerity, a heart with no barriers
A laugh that made slightly funny turn hilarious
While everybody else mouthed off about answers
You get up and started workin with some ex-Black Panthers
Leadin campaigns and writin in they newspaper
You always seemed happy, an idea that I would lose later
We would see each other sayin stay in touch

I'm just chantin your name out loud and confessin
That maybe I was part of your demise
You want and got liposuction on your ass and thighs
Came straight home as you bled that evenin
Bloodclots from the operation stopped you from breathin
Your shape was great if I may say so, way before J-Lo
Whoever told you it wasn't had horns not a halo
Or is it just that your behind was up to discuss?

We, we are the ones
We'll seal your fate, tear down your state, go get yo' guns
We, we came to fight
It's yo' disgrace, smash up your place, that's just polite

Once upon a time when crack was gold
And hip-hop was not yet platinum sold
I scoured the streets for stacks to fold
My mood like my hair was relaxed and blowed

I hated police and my teachers were beasts
My heat in the trunk of the classic Caprice
The one university, I knew the deal
So I cooked it, bagged it, put it on sale

Now philosophically you'd be opposed
To one inhaling coke via mouth or the nose
But economically I would propose
That you go eat a dick as employment froze

And I felt like an abandoned child
Left to fend for myself in the wild
While every courtroom, judge and gavel
Were there to bury me under the gravel

Or at the bottom of the finest malt ale
Observe, you'll find without fail
That in every neighborhood and penitentiary
There exists many others who are similar to me and

We, we are the ones
We'll seal your fate, tear down your state, go get yo' guns
We, we came to fight
It's yo' disgrace, smash up your place, that's just polite

In later years I lost some peers
Who mixed burners with Belvedere
And took shots from gung-ho cashiers
The world was cold yet hell was near

So I seek for a kilo
And my stack got a little bit taller like Skee-Lo
A street C.E.O.
There was all of this hell well and not one hero

The intensity was fortified
As I clenched five digits on the forty-five
Barely down at the retail store, I would detail more
But I don't wish this action to be glorified

There was a plan I was eager to listen
To not sleep in the park in the fetal position

Otherwise I'd survive without legal permission

It's an equal division and then we go to prison

We'll seal your fate, tear down your state, go, get yo' guns

The dreams in the dust, the evidence flushed
The grieving is just, they're thieving from us
Insulted and cussed, this evening we bust

Appears unstable and under the table
We like free speech but we love free cable
We're taught from the cradle, the Bill Gates fable
Which leads to high speeds in Buick LeSables

We have no excuses just great alibis
And poker faces you can't analyze
Our politicians sell our soul and our cries
With blood on their hands, they can't sanitize

We're the have-nots but we're also the gon'-gets
Not just talkin' 'bout the Lex with the chrome kits
You can get that by yourself with the four-fifth

Just because they won't bat both eyelids,

When you walk past with your eyeliner on, one hand in glove,
They're here for the music the thing that they love,

And it was literally carnage at the back of piccadilly,
To see who could buy it first,
And does the limtied edition seven inch quench your thirst?
For an album that will probably let you down,

I know it seems strange but things, they change
Older woman and a younger man
Both of them doing all they can

Tried to get your attention all night long
Asked you once, I asked you twice, asked you four times
If you'd like to dance to that song
Front crawled the crowd down the stairs
And I followed you out in the rain, nowhere to be found

Because you said you'd never ever heard of the La's?

But then your finger tips wrapped round those knuckles of mine,
The fear walked home and your smile returned,
And all of a sudden everything was fine.

but those days have passed 
And these types of relationship never last.

so please don't pretend that we'll stay friends,

With those boys that we used to argue about?
You walk over all flustered and stuff 
Telling everyone inside that you've had enough.

you spend eighty five per cent of your night

Why you were standing so close while you're kissing him.
And why you left that place holding his hand,

And the storm, it seems so scary
Your face lit up on beats of lightning

And your eyes are like screaming
And since there is no end and no beginning

You will run

You will run

Girl, I know the woods look dark
And the trees, they seem so deadly
The girls around you are so frightened

And you start, you start to panic
And the courage starts to vanish
And the world, it really is on fire

And it burns
And it burns
And it burns
And it burns

Vivian, your life is told through 19 thousand pages
In a world too unreal to behold
Your innocence has faded
Faded all your blues to gray

Your skin has bruised through moving days
Glue is peeling back away
Curling, cracking, painted
Girl, you’ve been rolled up in colorful carpets

Your blood is rushing, look around you
You're froze, you're frozen quiet
And your eyes, they are widened

Room unfurnished, no light for nightfall
Just rugs for rolling you up, you know you can't get up
When you do, you swear you will run

You will run
You will run

If no one can ever find you
No one will ever save you
