Muddy Waters,"Don't say I don't love you
Because I stays out all night long

Don't say I don't love you
Because I stays out all night long

You know I'm a country boy
And I don't know what's going on

Don't say I don't love you
Because I will never treat you right

Don't say I don't love you
Because I will never treat you right

I may be a country boy

But I will always treat you right",Country Boy (All Night Long)
Muddy Waters,"I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love to you

I don't want you to wash my clothes
I don't want you to keep our home
I don't want your money too
I just want to make love to you, love to you
Love to you, love to you

Well, I tell by the way that you switch and walk
I can see by the way that you baby talk
I can know by the way that you treat your man
That I could love you baby, until the cryin' shame

I don't want you, cook my bread
I don't want you to make my bed
I don't want you because I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you, love to you
Love to you, love to you
Love to you, love to you
Love to you",I Just Want to Make Love to You [Single Version]

Muddy Waters,"I used to live with the whiskey
And the good time and the ladies of the night
Then the whiskey took control
Left me waltzing with the witches in my mind

But imaginary bottles won't be everywhere
To haunt me like before
'Cos I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

So, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

It don't matter where you came from
All I know is that you gave me back my pride
You reached out your hand and saved a man
Who strayed about as far as he could slide

And you probably came from heaven
Who else could've sent you but the Lord
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

So, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

Yeah, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore, yeah

Yeah, go to sleep, my weary lady
Heaven knows you've done your chore
You were sent here just to save me
And I'm not dancing with those demons
I'm not dealing with that devil anymore

The country air and all of its joys
But badgers couldn't compensate at twice the price
For just another night with the boys, oh yeah
And boys will be boys will be boys

If life is your table and fate is the wheel
Then let the chips fall where they may

And as I was drifting past the Northern Lights
I heard those slinky sirens wail, oh
So look out sailor when you hear them croon
You'll never be the same again, oh no
Their crazy music drives you insane, this way

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Das Mädchen aus Gold hat Erziehung, Ehre
Macht ihrer Familie keine Probleme
Eine wahre, treue, loyale Freundin
Musst ihr als Freund nichts mehr beibringen
Weil sie weiß, was richtig und falsch ist
Bewunderst dieses Mädchen sogar, wenn du ihr Feind bist
Eine Schwiegertochter, die jede Mutter sich wünscht
Weil sie weiß, es kümmert sich um ihr Kind
Eine ehrliche Frau, denn Lügen haben kurze Beine
Sie interessieren keine Autos oder große Scheine
Ein Herz, so groß wie ihr Stolz
Achtet auf ihr Image, dieses Mädchen aus Gold

Mudi,"Wenn du durch harte Zeiten gehst 
Und du dich fragst, wo Gott ist, denk dran
Der Lehrer ist während einer Prüfung immer leise
Sabr ist, wenn es im Herzen schmerzt, aber du trotzdem weiterkämpfst
Sabr bedeutet nicht, wie lange du es aushältst zu warten
Sondern wie du dich verhältst, während du wartest
Wann auch immer dich Kummer
Unruhe oder Probleme aufsuchen
Schließ deine Augen und sag dir selbst
Auch das wird inşallah vergehen!
Sabr ist mehr als Geduld
Sabr ist die Art, wie du bei einer Erschwernis handelst
Während du wartest, dass diese vorbeigeht
Sabr ist, wenn du deine Situation akzeptierst
Sabr ist die Stärke deiner Seele
Sabr lehrt dich nicht zusammenzubrechen, wenn du das Gefühl danach hast
Denn nach jeder grauen Wolke folgt ein Sonnenschein
Und nach jeder schlechten Phase folgt eine gute

Was kannst du ihr bieten? Wer bezahlt den Haushalt?
Sie sitzt allein, während du dich draußen rumtreibst
Meine Tochter verdient einen echten Mann
Einer, der studiert hat, einer, der was bieten kann
Einer, der sie schätzt und es weiß, sie zu lieben
Ich frage dich, was kannst du ihr bieten?“

Was kannst du ihr bieten? Ich leg' die Welt ihr zu Füßen
Kein Geld braucht sie, um meine Liebe zu spüren
Denn sie weiß, Materielles ist vergänglich
Nur meine Liebe ist unendlich
Was kannst du ihr bieten? Ich leg' die Welt ihr zu Füßen
Kein Geld braucht sie, um meine Liebe zu spüren

Ihr fragt mich, was kann ich ihr bieten? Diese Frau ist mein Leben!
Mein Ein und Alles ich würd' mein Leben für sie geben!
Was kann ich ihr bieten? Ein reines Herz aus Gold
Einen treuen, loyalen Mann mit Stolz
Ich hab' meine Prinzipien, doch weiß es, sie zu schätzen
Weiß es, sie zu lieben, und weiß um sie zu kämpfen
Weiß, was ich zu tun hab', ich kenne meine Pflichten
Vertraue dieser Frau blind, sie lässt mich niemals sitzen
Genauso lass' ich sie nie im Stich, es gibt nur sie und mich
Die Meinung andrer Leute über uns interessiert mich nicht
Soll sich einer trauen, meiner Frau zu nah zu kommen
Ich kämpfe bis auf's Blut für sie, bis zum letzten Gong
Schwiegervater, deine Tochter ist in guten Händen!
Und will ihr jemand ein Haar krümmen, wird's blutig enden
Ihr fragt mich, was kann ich ihr bieten?
Meiner Frau? Ich leg' die Welt ihr zu Füßen

One set of footprints in the sand
No one to take my hand, I'll
I'll walk through as long as I need
I'll drift through my life though I'm alone
Outgrown the cradle that once housed me
And I've found that all I need is

Found I've never needed you

All the s*** that stacks up 
Inside of my life
Endless plight that circulates through my body

Teething on the rind and

Well, I can't see goin' on

Of trying to mend the wounds of all my suffering

And, all I'm asking from you please
Send me a sign
To guide me through the times that lie in front of me
I'll get by

Still feel you on the inside
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

Shadows in the sun

Still wrestle the demons
That arrested me as a child
Confession rejected

To give up
People step on the cracks
For wounds owed paid back
Through the words of surrender

Emptiness
Loneliness
Listlessness
Worthless

From these memories
Can you save me?
From myself
From these memories

Surrender
To the shadows
Haunting inside
Bleed through you
Surrender to the secretes, inside
Lies within you

I feel it on the inside
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again
Still feel you on the inside
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

Can't feel you on the inside
Set down the bag and left it
Lost memory has left me
One again
Open up the inside
Admission for the cleansing
Now that I've forgotten to remember

Surrender
To the shadows
Haunting inside
Bleed through you",Forget to Remember
Mudvayne,"In this hole, that is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole, thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders

I feel into me, so overwhelmed
All this pressures sent arising
My life overturned, unfair the despair
All these scars keep ripping open

Peel me, from the skin
Tear me, from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear me, from the bone
Tear me, from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

In this hole, that is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole, so limiting
The sun that's settle darkens

Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel
Internal pathways to contention

Peel me, from the skin
Tear me, from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear me, from the bone
Tear me, from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Happy?
Happy?
Are you feeling happy?

In this hole, that is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release what sets me free
Do you pull me up just to push me down again

Peel me, from the skin
Tear me, from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear me, from the bone
Tear me, from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Peel me, from the skin

Am I an ornament of longing
A seed trapped inside the shell that is me

Nobody can save me from this
From myself

Hurricane of head space
Spinning circle
Stacking up the walls that hide you

Crumbling pieces of me
An offering to you
Falling gifts from me to you
Left nothing for myself
You had my cake and ate it too
And left nothing for me

No one would care
If they took the time to stop and stare

Swim through waves that crash to shore memories in me
Cocooned in misery
The darkness overcomes soul soars to the other plain
Existence past the door I sail through purgatory's bay

I asked a god for poison cradle me sown to my dreams souls searching
Death blossoms where clouds lie over me held in god's hands death
Blooming

Dark for fear of failure an inner gloom as wide as an eye and
Fermenting roiling hate death grip in my veins unveiling rancid
Petals flowering forth foul nectar the space between a blink and a
Tear

All work and no play makes me a dull boy [Repeat: x4]

Live in a secret
Live in a lie
Live in a dark hole beneath the black sky
Live like a martyr and draw my last breath
Feel like an old man with a knife in my chest

Live like a transient
Live like a thief
Hide in a closet, grinding my teeth
Sit in a small room with the walls closing in
Open the shutters but everything's still dim

Jump from the sill and I'll plunge to my death

Throw back my pills and take a sip of my drink

Mudvayne,"What have I done?
Where have I come from?
When I burnt the backs
With the sun through a glass
Did I seal the loss
That's become me?

Feeling undone
What have I become?
When I turned my back on you
I turned my back on myself
And became this machine

Thoughtlessness
Selfishness
Hopelessness
Arrogant

I feel it on the inside
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again

Still feel you on the inside
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

Shadows in the sun
Filter through us
Still wrestle the demons
That arrested me as a child
Confession rejected
We grow up
To give up
People step on the cracks
For wounds owed paid back
Through the words of surrender

Emptiness
Loneliness
Listlessness
Worthless

I feel it on the inside
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again
Still feel you on the inside
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

Can you save me?
From myself
From these memories
Can you save me?
From myself
From these memories

Surrender
To the shadows
Haunting inside
Bleed through you
Surrender to the secretes...inside
Lies within you

I feel it on the inside
Twisting and contorting
Memory has shaped me once again
Still feel you on the inside
Biting through and stinging
Will I ever forget to remember?

Can't feel you on the inside
Set down the bag and left it
Lost memory has left me
One again
Open up the inside
Admission for the cleansing
Now that I've forgotten to remember

In this hole, thickening, dirt shoveled over shoulders

My life overturned, unfair the despair, all these scars
Keep ripping open
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind, does it make
You happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself, are you
Feeling happy now?
In this hole, that is me, a life that's growing feeble,
In this hole, so limiting, the sun has set all darkens,
Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel,
Internal pathway to contention
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind, does it make
You happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself, are you
Feeling happy now?
Happy?
Happy?
Are you feeling happy now?
In this hole that is me, left with a heart exhausted,
Whats my release? What sets me free? Do you pull me up
Just to push me down again?
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind, does it make
You happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself, are you
Feeling happy now?
Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind, does it make

It's the same old thing as yesterday

There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop

With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I always thought that you could end this reign
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain

There's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall
There's a dead salmon frozen in a water fall
There's a blue whale beached by a springtime's ebb
There's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web

There's a king on his throne with his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed
There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread

There's a red fox torn by a huntman's pack
There's a black winged gull with a broken back
There's a little black spot on the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday

I'm over, personalities, conflicting
I don't need you, or anyone, but me
I'll just be, living my own life
I feel my glowing center grow, infecting I feel alive
Shovel dirt over lime
Plant it in myself to sit like a seed under covers of earth and just be
Sinners, pointing fingers at me

Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow, I'm fueled godless

Where it all went wrong he's followed us too long.

Throw me down the stairs since I just don't care anymore.

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

Wanna sail the sea just like a sailor, but it's not the end of the world

You find da world

You'll find da space

You look at the sun
And you see a light
You look into my eyes
Then you'll find me mind!

Oh it's so cold
When rain falls
Got stupid brain
When I'm on da train
I was stupid child
And I'm still stupid now
My head hit da ball
And da ball hit da ground

Tatoos and interviews, another way to say
You've grabbed us by the balls and taken us away
Halleluja, another video
Surgically removed, reimproved, its the way to go

I was raised on cigarettes and jazz
Cheap drive-in movies and soul
Now I live in basements and flats
Where did the simple life go?

Talk show, talk show,
Talk about nothing that you really wanna know, talk show
Freak show, peep show,
You're on the cover of a magazine, in between
There is a scene that you really wanna know

I was raised on alcohol and blues
Front porches and the front page of the Sunday news
Now I live in silicone crowds
Where did the simple life go?

Surgically removed, reimproved, its the way to go

Now you want to change the world

Didn't even know their names
Now I live in a suicide trap

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Mumford & Sons,"And after the storm,
I run and run as the rains come
And I look up, I look up,
On my knees and out of luck,
I look up.

Night has always pushed up day
You must know life to see decay
But I won't rot, I won't rot
Not this mind and not this heart,
I won't rot.

And I took you by the hand
And we stood tall,
And remembered our own land,
What we lived for.

But there will come a time, you'll see, with no more tears.
And love will not break your heart, but dismiss your fears.
Get over your hill and see what you find there,
With grace in your heart and flowers in your hair.

And now I cling to what I knew
I saw exactly what was true
But oh no more.
That's why I hold,
That's why I hold with all I have.
That's why I hold.

I won't die alone and be left there.
Well I guess I'll just go home,
Oh God knows where.
Because death is just so full and man so small.
Well I'm scared of what's behind and what's before.

And there will come a time, you'll see, with no more tears.
And love will not break your heart, but dismiss your fears.
Get over your hill and see what you find there,
With grace in your heart and flowers in your hair.

The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's hand

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

The days were short and the father was gone
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield

I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store

There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you always denied
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""

Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind

Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals

And darkness is a harsh term don't you think
And yet it dominates the things I see

It seems that all my bridges have been burned

Means less and less to me without you breathing through its trees

So come down from your mountain and stand where we've been
You know our breath is weak and our body thin

Press my nose up to the glass around your heart
I should've known I was weaker from the start
You'll build your walls, and I will play my bloody part
To tear, tear them down
Well I'm gonna tear, tear them down

And I'll believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is fast

Stretch out my life and pick the seams out
Take what you like, but close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over

I have done wrong, you build your tower
But call me home and I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again

But love the one you hold
And I'll be your goal
To have and to hold
A lover of the light

Skin too tight and eyes like marbles
You spin me high, so watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward

I know I tried, I was not stable
Flawed by pride, I miss my sanguine eyes

Mumford & Sons,"Love was kind for a time
But now just aches and it makes me blind
This mirror holds my eyes too bright
But I can't see the others other in my life

We too young and heads too strong
To bear the weight of these lovers eyes
I feel numb beneath your tongue
Beneath the curse of these lovers eyes

But do not ask the price I pay
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
And let me die where I lie
Beneath the curse of these lovers eyes

There is no drink or drug I've tried
To rid the curse of these lover's eyes
I feel numb beneath her tongue
Her strength just makes me feel less strong

But do not ask the price I pay
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind

Swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy

And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break your heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark
I was to slow to depart
I'm a cad but I'm not that flawed
I set out to serve the Lord.

And my heart
Was colder when you've gone
And I lost my head
But found the one that I loved

For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve and my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve and my hands to learn

And I was still
I was under your spell
When I was told by Jesus all was well
So all must be well

You know your desires and mine
Wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
For I must be well

Keep the earth below my feet

You cut me down

And I will not tell the thoughts of hell
That carried me home from the Holland Road
With my heart like a stone and I put up no fight
To your callus mind, and from your corner you rose to cut me down,
You cut me down

So I hit my low, but little did I know that would not be the end,
From the Holland Road well I rose and I rose, and I paid less time,
To your callus mind, and I wished you well as you cut me down,
You cut me down

But I'll still believe though there's cracks you'll see,
When I'm on my knees I'll still believe,
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found,
If you believe in me I'll still believe

So when your hopes on fire
But you know your desire

Don't let your heart grow cold

Or even spit out some holy word.
I have no strength from which to speak
When you shoot me down and see I'm weak

We will run and scream.
You will dance with me.
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars.
Sadness will be far away.

So as we walked
Through fields of green,
It was the fairest sun I'd ever seen.
And I was broke,
I was on my knees.
You said yes as I said please.

This ain't no sham.
I am what I am.
I'll leave no time
For a cynic's mind.

We will run and scream.
You will dance with me.

And we'll be free

A light that might give up the way
Is all that I'm asking for

You never see my bleeding heart

And your lights always shining on
And I've been travelling oh so long

Haunting your days, consuming your prayers.
There will be healing but don't force this girl to stand
As she's counting the ceilings with pale voice and trembling hands

You find yourself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be around for those below

Whispered notes from the piano in the corner of the room
Hold your throat is that healing that you're hearing in her tune
Wanting change but loving her just as she lies
Is the burden of a man who's built his life on love

You told me life was long but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be around for those below

I'll be locked up and stored

But I have seen the same I know the shame in your defeat

To live my life as it's meant to be

And I have no idea where else my heart could have been

So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got

When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store
There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you've always denied

Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""

Crawl towards a life of fragile lines
And wasted time

What would you have me do?

And wandering without that much to say

Is there another way?
Oh love, is there another way?

In your precious face

But these hot gates you spent your victory on
Though your swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
And though we cry, we must stay alive

Near a duller blade, a promise out of sight

For some whispered words

I didn't fool you but I failed you
In short, made a fool out of you
And a younger heart

And I rage and I rage
But perhaps I will come of age
And be ready for you

That courses down my spine
To leave a love divine
Don't leave a love divine

We had it tonight, why do we always seek absolution?

Just slip away?
And abandon, that greets you in the night
With snake eyes, the most precious kind

And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love

Waiting on the edge again
You sleep so sound with your mind made up
Drinking from your cup of broken ends

Your eyes follow like tracers in the night
And the tightrope that you wander everytime
You have been weighed, you have been found wanting

Been wondering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I want to learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for

Sheltered, you better keep the wolf back from the door
He wanders ever closer every night
And how he waits begging for blood
I promised you everything would be fine

Been wondering for days

Leave behind your wanton ways

Hold my gaze love, you know I want to let it go

Mundell Lowe,"Our waltz is music fashioned in heaven,
Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Angels were watching one day,
And our love was their inspiration!

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

That you could ever care for me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

Mundell Lowe,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

I am so awfully misunderstood

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

At the people passing by, who didn't know or didn't care

He's got no money or no home of his own
The back street's his kitchen
The footpath's his hall
And the chalk on the brick work
Are the pictures on his wall
He lays down his head
On the pavement that's his bed
And when he sleeps, his dreams fade away

He walks down the street, with his hands in his coat
Looking down at his feet, for a dog-end he could smoke
He thinks about food, good drinking and good fun
As he searches through the dustbins, his life almost done

And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.

I'll be forgiven on judgment day

Tell my wife in our yard buried underneath the pine
There's a shoebox full of money of which I never earned a dime
Use it to start over the way things should have been
Live honest, and love again
Tell my wife, tell my kids
I never meant for this to happen

When they flip the switch please do not stay
I couldn't bear for you to remember me this way

Murder by Death,"In Dynamite Mine your hour will come
In a shower of stones steel beams
They'll push and they'll pull against the rock wall
And find you buried among the debris

When they search for you the dogs will sniff him out
From a torn peace of his shirt 
They'll bound down the path with lust on their breath
And find you under a patch of fresh dirt

Son cover your ears
Lord how the blast will ring
And when that rumbling shakes the walls
You can hear that devil sing

You cut off the past
Buried him here
Deep in the belly of the mines
Blasted the wall sealed the tomb 
Lived out those short days secure in your crime

Many years have passed
But still we trudge on
So we will till the end of our days
Many have come and many have gone

I unwind 
She sleeps in comfort in my arms
She is plain but she is mine
Our child is silent but awake
I run my hands through his hair
I teach him manners and how to stick up 
For himself when things get bad

I tell him son never throw the first punch
And If you must fight, make it clean

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, will all be forgiven?
SHIOLA, SHIOLA, Am I strong enough to start again alone?

The taste of home is filling up my mouth
Is it wrong to love a family of ghosts?
Her door is open the windows are all up
She says ""come inside""

I live alone more or less
I summon wife, child, and happiness
Build them up from the dirt and clay
I have to believe that all will be forgiven

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, will all be forgiven?
SHIOLA, SHIOLA, am I strong enough to start again alone?
SHIOLA, SHIOLA, my heart is overflowing
SHIOLA, SHIOLA, with love and anger coiled into one

I've given quite a few
I swing my firsts and the cities all fall

I've broken a law
I reckon I only missed a few
I watch these long days pass through the bars
I curse the brass

I've had a cracked rib or two
I guess I've busted more
I've laid a couple out on the coolin' board

Sometimes you walk the line
And sometimes it walks you
You get quick to anger
Quick to put a knife up to another man's throat
I cannot still the hell that's in these hands

When they came to take me
I didn't fight just let them win
A man died in my cell
Damn the guards sure gave me hell
I'd love to see them horsemen ride

Muriel Anderson,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow i'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two

We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Why do you hurt me so
I tried to please you

You turned around and hurt me

And all heartache I went through

Chill at the crib all day
No, no, no, no,
It's time to get that ass off of the couch
Get up!
It's Friday night you gotta get the fuck out
Get the fuck out!
Okay, I got nothin' to say
Cause we been chillin' at the crib all day

[Verse 1: The Professor]
We chiefin' laid back, loungin' like 3 pimps in the shade
Me, Murph we take a pair we at it again
Well OK, you should have nothin' to say
We guarantee it goin' be another hit man, ok?
For your reference, I been inside the house since 6
Bakin' up bars of rap, chiefin' and munchin' on chips
Now should I go dip? debate what style and color to get
We go out, we don't go out, this strickly parkin' lot pimpin'
That there sounds like a nice game plan
Nice thangs wit thick frames, no need to think twice man
Pick up some bud, pick up my boys, wipe off my dubs
Hittin' on chickens and buckets, so what they rollin' on hubs
I'm honkin' my horn like a animal straight from the barn
So what if they foreign? Prince don't discriminate not 1
(Outrageously, my baby mama pagin' me
I been at the crib all day so it's crazy see)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: King Jacob]
Now, usually I get my way
Hit my hay, yeah sip my drank
Call up a chick to come strip if I say
Let the phone just ring while I pick my place
Smashin' in John Madden whuppin' everybody ass
And it's a fact, Green Bay sendin' em Packin'
Man it's goin' on a three day thrashin'
Fuck this for real why'all, I need some action
Aw man, Murph don't want to drive the Benz
But he's too busy tryin' to dodge his friends
I just want to go back outside again
Get high again, sippin' Heineken's
Grab my 22 inch wired rims
Hit the street, got bitches pilin' in
Wait 'til this nigga get through ironin'
Jacob up, fuck this game I'm retirin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
St. Louis
(Murphy Lee, what size drawers ya need?)
A 36-38 cause 40 be too big
And hurry up so I can get out the crib
(Babysit!)
I love my nieces and nephews but I ain't got no kids!
And shit, hurry up before the bank close
(Boy you ain't goin' to no bank, you prolly gonna see sum hoes)
Ah, I guess my sista know a brotha
I'm a nasty mothersucker cause I'm poppin' wit cornbread and butter
Cause there ain't nuttin' like booty in the daytime
Look at it wiggle, sunshinin' on the waistline
And matter fact fuck the whole nine
The whole time I'm thinkin' bout this party goin' downtown
I had to get my ass outta the bed (ah get up!)
Ain't nothin' like a lil' last minute head (ah you right)
Plus I see this girl like twice a week
And my granny made macaroni-n-cheese
So I'm out

[Chorus]",Gods Don't Chill
Murphy Lee,"[Hook - Murphy Lee]
Hey Maa, what ya need, what ya like?
You can get it from Granpa Gametight
She looks at me and she says..
""I wanna go outside in the rain""
So I took her...So I took her
I packed all her bags yes I took her
I took me a drag then I took her

[Verse 1 - Murphy Lee]
To be pacific she in summin fitted when I visit
""Murphy why you gotta go?"" Oh, just so you can miss it
She like me for my huggin' and kissin' and how I listen
And how I, talk wit precision, how I make my decisions
She like my, Pimp Juice potion, my motion in the ocean
And how I, keep you hot but the johnson be frozen
How I treat you in the mornin', mami you know how I be
Gotta job, not a hobby, so I'll walk you to the lobby
""Can I at least see you later?"" Now you know I gotta party
People askin' who ordered, they just victims of me and 'Cardi
They ain't the same when they get out the hood
Man I offer a fish sandwich and show em the goods
I kick fine lines, sometimes got cool things to say like
Fuck tomorrow what you doin' today?
""Ah, you a baby"" Hey hey, compliments? okay
Anyway I'm Murphy Lee, you wanna plaay?

[Hook - Murphy Lee]

[Verse 2 - Murphy Lee]
I'm like a new deck of cards, dert hard to deal wit
Can't live without me and I'm hard to live wit
My toilet don't take no shit
Plus most women need Murphy Lee like a makeup kit
I'm too nice, my future read two wives
I'm too right wit two dykes in the mirror of a new bike
I'm so the da the da the da
That the women don't mind comin out they drawers and bras
For the young brotha, the Young Dude, we young dudies
Yours truly, baby you and Murphy Lee the Skoolie
Homeboy! still cool, movies in the jacuzzi
Eatin french fries, wit belly warmers and wives
See I try to do right but the women keep callin'
They like bill collectors, they won't stop callin'..

[Murphy Lee & (Girl)]
St. Louis
(Hello? I just wanna go outside..)

[Hook - Murphy Lee]

[Verse 3 - Murphy Lee]
Sometimes I feel like I'm from Georgia
'Cause I got G-A-M-E
I'm a pimp that's fo' sho then I Boom like Benny
I only seen a few but I've been through plenty
And that plenty don't believe that I'm 20
I got this lady 31, she be like ""damn he young""
Like Pamela, I deal wit her AND HER SON
I'd be hittin her AND HER BLUNT
And when it cost too much, I'd buy her friends AND HER LUNCH
See I'm summin like a playa man, summin you know nuttin about
Lost the words man, nuttin it ya mouth
My women like to say ""Down South""
Yes Yes, I guess the Midwest would the middle of my chest
Love the attention that the ladies provide
I'm a Sagittarius that need a nice variety
I'm Bad Boy like Mike Lawrey, call the fireman
All my workin' ladies be in on Saturday

Keep summin hot on tour, couldn't keep anything hotter
Make sure they know before what is really in store

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
Check, back in '93 I had it all
I was a kid, yo I grew up on the ""Player's Ball""
Shiit, born in the 80's man, St. Louis Hailey Ann
Showin' my jewels to prove I was the ladies' man
Shake all the ladies' hands, feel on the ladie's pants
I'm doin' the latest dance, makin' the hatas glance
I'm wit the older crowd, big brother showed me how
To make my mama proud, look how it turned out
Well lemme get back on my bullshit
To be a playa yo you had to learn to push it
Yo, 'cause it was crazy how we hooked up
I looked up, found my face in her butt like ""What the fuck?""
""Stop, what you doin? get yo face out my fanny""
Tuckin' her shirt in so I wouldn't see her panties
We laughed, and that was a beginning of a past
That keep on huntin' my ass, now who the asshole..

[Hook: Avery Storm]
I don't really think
I don't think that you..
I don't think you say ""my ways""
I don't think I want to stay..
I don't think that you can say, your way
I've done made a lot of mistakes befo'
Yo my girl, I think I better go..

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
Yo, yo, yo..verse 2 is how we set it off
It took ya derrty 2 years just to get it off
Shiit, and even though it wasn't bout that
'cause we was young and I knew I'd be the first cat (eh-eh)
And I got proved wrong, and I knew all along
Cause 2 years lata someone said they was the first to bone
Now I got a circumstance on my hands
Supposed to be her man, first one in her pants
I stayed wit her, spent much years, days wit her
Laid in the shade wit her, sit and played spades wit her
I always knew that it would happen again
So on the side I always kept about 2 or 3 friends
Two wrongs don't make a right, but yeah right
I was in love, you what it took to keep it tight
A year later, the shit didn't shape up
I caught her on the Kastle lot straight shakin' her butt
Whut?

[Hook: Avery Storm]
I don't really think
I don't think that you..
I don't think you say ""my ways""
I don't think I want to stay..
I don't think that you can say, your way
I've done made a lot of mistakes befo'
Yo my girl, I think I better go..

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Verse 3 is how I fell for it
If a happy home at 70, you gotta go through hell for it
I answered calls and chanced it all
Knowin' damn well we wasn't advancin' at all
Now we back at Mickey D's and movies
Chicken from Popeye's, ""I know a biscuit come wit this two piece!""
Her attitude used to urk me, sweet as can be
Booty like pie, but bah, please dessert me
And I'm not gonna be able to do it
And she knew if we spent time together we'd be right back to it
Yeep, she be like ""spend the night"", I be like ""damn right""
But when I wake up in the mornin' man I see the light
I got the same circumstance on my hands
Instead of bein' a man, controllin' what's in my pants
I left, I thought it'd been the end of the mess
But she still call my phone to death, I need help..

You make a brotha want to faint (damn!)
Or put you on a plate, sock you up wit a mu'fuckin' biscuit
Maan, it was a house party ayyo I probably sound corny
I got oatmeal hormones ma, I'm instantly horny
I mean, the way you carry yourself
I mean, if I wasn't you I'd probably marry myself
I'm in ya eyes, did I say ya ass? I mean ya eyes
Face bangin' haven't even got to ya thighs
I mean the walk-to-walk is like the Matrix
I could sit a drink on that ass if I had nowhere to place it
Face it, how could anybody dislike you?
These others girl are cool, but not quite like you
I mean, ayyo I focus on my pass a lot
But relationships like Twista, gotta hold ya spot
I mean, and you know that my time is skimpy
If I'm the only in yo heart then it's probably empty

You too fly to be askin' a guy why
All my life love kept on ""passin' me by""
You can't change a woman by diamond chainin' her
Change don't make change, mathematically train her
It's a two way thing
Now Scott tell a Motorola by high chairs and baby strollers
I be the sun, you be the moon let the kids be the star
I know who you is, you know who I are
And when the do' close, you know I ain't goin' that far
You got keys to erry house, keys to erry car
And hell yeah, I need love too like LL
I must be on Neptune, 'cause love is for real but still
You not from much and, so girl it ain't no rushin'
And respect how there be more talkin' than touchin'
Seein' you no frontin' is way better than nuttin'

You a housewife
The type of girl that always know what time it is
The tick-tock type, keep her own shoes tied, push her own riide
Quick to give me money when my bills too high
..I need top-notch sex
Wash dishes, and sweep, mop topless
Never give me stress, love when the God bless
Makin' love to the mime boo could be a mental mess
And you don't like me like shy but I'm a lover mon
Other the other hond, can't stand you wit another mon
I went from Timberlond's, tuxedo's, camabons
I got a fast, fast girl I don't want to run
I can't help it I ain't ready

Love is deadly, in the shower singin' melodies
I'll make it up if ya let me girl..

I'm Murphy Lee and I'm Zee Lee, yo

Yo and I'm here, 'cause I'm here
Yo, plus I'm here, cause I'm here
Yo, yo, I'm 'bout to tell you what I like

I'm with five individuals, they say we not original
We all started underground like Digital
Now the haters lookin' pitiful, we humble and un-spittable
But lyrical, we still sh-sh-shit on you

I got a number two, Nelly got her number too
We call a tip, girl, you prolly call it a switch-a-roo
We be at Amoco, D's on that cantaloupe
Wit my folk's pocket full of bread and toast

In my Timb's and coat, do it big in the winter time
Prolly full of Air Force Ones up outta Finish Line
And I call myself normal, casual or formal
I still be blank like a carnival

But y'all won't let me be or see
'cause I'm so D F that I'm considered a G
I be H I off J's, K's and L's
Um, M, N, to the O's, they can't tell

He's a regular guy
(I can't lie, girl)
I can't deny
(I can't deny neither)
You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy

You see I'm young with information, I don't play like Station
'cause it took education, dedication and patience
To get a record deal, fo' real, this ain't no fluke
To you, we like a fat dude playin' a flute

Like my granny do in the troop instead of the James Brown
Look at all these boys reppin' the same town
Come from the same moms and owe dues
Aunties and uncles, man, they went to the same school, yeah

St. Louis ain't that big
Ayyo, we stay on the hill and steal a 30 ball to get to the crib
And I can do it on a quarter tank, a quarter of dank
It's ya home, wake up and maybe go to the bank

And I think you people need to open up like mail
If you can't tell Skool Boy, normal as hell
So don't let the TVs confuse you
'cause if you didn't knew, now you knew

He's a regular guy
(Ya, I can't lie, girl)
I can't deny
(I can't deny neither)
You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy
(Yo, I'm just like you)

I ain't different from those that think I'm different
Still enjoy fat checks overtime, I'm just like you
I ain't changin' for nobody, mixin' up your talent wit yo hobby
End up wit no jobby

I guess you got personal problems
The bigger you are, they start openin' up ya personal closet
A Ram 150, man, still couldn't dodge it, dislodge it
Take advantage derrty, live off ya profits

You right, I ain't ya average lil' dude
We had the number one song when I was still in school
Shoot, I can say it though, I'm glad that we made it mo
No neva bein' in class, song pop up on the radio

And it's a beautiful thang
To turn street money to legal money and beautiful change
Yo, I gotta use my beautiful brain
And understand when I'm sprinklin', man, in my rain

He's a regular guy
(I can't lie, girl)
I can't deny
(Yo, I can't deny neither)
You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy, oh
",Regular Guy
Murphy Lee,"(feat. Toya)
[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
When I first started back in 1989
I was trying to claim games, I was barely writing rhymes
I was 7 to 8, a little nigga with his head straight
Never got to school early, always went to bed late
Grew up with the older dudes, do what your brother do
It's just so he happen to rap, ""Man you think you cool?""
Ali was my motivator, rapper slash educator
Kept these boys dedicated mama like we better had made it
'cause my first name's paid, my last name bills
Even though I got a record deal I paid bills still
And erreybody changed to sell us
I wish the fans would understand to except us and just us (?)
I know we blush, on a well-equipped bus
And money we got enough, at least enough to not fuss
We still got stress like you
So in other words little dirty we just like you
ya know!

[Chorus: Toya]
They thought he changed up since he came up
But he's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his game up 'cause the fame stuck
But it's the same ol' Murphy
Might have switched his friends up since he done been up
'cause it's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his rims up on his benz
But he's the same ol'.. Murphy

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
I know you ain't acting front-why (?)
My fans are like the police they be asking for me
Ask them do they know me they probably say who cares
Tell 'em I'm with Nelly they getta coming in pairs
The fame thing is the same thing as the devil
People who see you never put on you on a hell of a level
I once wore scuffed up Air Force 2's
And this girl said, ""That ain't Murphy Lee look at his shoes!""
See these kids are so smart recognize you from head start
They be like ""I know that ain't you up in Wal-Mart""
Can't a brother buy his own draws I'm not a star
I'm a grown ass boy I'm not staying the in car
But people gonna recognize, they know who you are
Well if they see me today, they gon' be cool tomorrow
'cause I'm a be at Circuit City buying DVD's
And hungry eating fries at your local Mickey D's

[Chorus: Toya]
[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Yo, yo, I'm still the same dirty, dirty I still make mistakes
I know my birthday was the only day a dirty saw a cake
I'm humble like an African King I appreciate things
Let me refer you on what's happening then
In 93, had an idea we really believed in
94, 95 we began critiquing
In 96, I think we signed some bullshit
97, yo we had the number one hit
98, had to vacate to get our shit straight
Signed with Cool-to-love to get rid of one of the headaches
In 9-9, it's when them boys got signed
and if Nelly don't sell a record then it all goes down
0-0 through 0-1 we weren't below no one
and no one could ever take from or want more done
0-2, Lunatics sold damn near 2
So in 0-3, we gon see what Murphy Lee gon do

I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrolls, you know I never changed that (nah uh)
Your body is banging mamma, but where your brains at? (Come on)
I'm still the same cat when I was young I was running with bad boys
But now I'm older hope they saw I'm running with bad boys (that's right)
Here come another man
Unlike no other man
Candy coated whoa!
Switching in every lane
Ya'll help me
Why don't cha
Please help me

>From New York to the Dirty how they loving it player?
Baby you impressive let's get
To know each other
You the best of the best and
You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here momma you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see you're thong
My pocket's full of dough shake your feathers till the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly man somebody better warn them
[Chorus]
[Bridge: Nelly]
Oh no I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (yea)
Because we go party till them lights come on
And then my song start thumping because my mike still on
[Verse 3: Murphy Lee] + (Nelly)
Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like them thick with their mind right (Awe)
Banging personality conversate when the time right (Naw)
I'm not hard I've got women to handle that
They be like he the man when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the lap
I'm just a juvenile (Wha)
Because I be about G's
Keep your women wizzy man they say they have my babies
I'm young like Tucker like the cash and the money (I'm going to eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See I'm starving like Marvin girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys you'd think I was valet parking
[Chorus]

Who be doing what I do?
Uh huh yeah, yo whoo!
Let's get at it dog, come on, whoo!

Now what goes up, must come down (shit)
But we ain't coming down, it be them same ole' clowns
Aiming your pound pretending they proud
But when you leave town they go around they running they mouth (man)
They something like a hater man
Talking bad about a playa as if I'm not gon see ya later man
You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like whats going on goin' to another song
'Cause I keep a hater guilty
My cars and my money all alike man, both them filthy (get it?)
From skimpy and empty to fuel on full
See I be high when my 'Ca-go Bulls
Obey no rules to school you fools
Schoolboy's err'y where, we're Young Dude news (man)
St. Louis like Blues, D. Miles and Larry Hughes
And the Young Dude done paid young dudes' dues dude

But yo, what da hook gon' be (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shit)
All I need, is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin 'round and I'mma rip

(But yo) What da hook gon' be (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shit)
All I need, is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin 'round and I'mma rip

The sun'll come out, tomorrow
And I will never have to borrow
Got my first car when I turned sixteen
Only drove it home outta town limousines
Plus we was broke wit a deal but nobody could tell
So we did what we had to do for ""Country Grammar"" to sell
Haha, I stay on my own melodies
Plus I like my Booties and my Boobs like a capital letter 'B'
That's how it is, how it better be
I preferably rather have two or three girls in the bed wit me
Close your ears ma you ain't heard nothin' (whaa?)
I always pay ma let a brother hold somethin'
I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons
(We all we got!) Used to be creative on Halloween (how you gon?)
Stop a hotter teen went from nada to a lot of things

But yo, what da hook gon' be (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shit)
All I need, is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin 'round and I'mma rip

(But yo) What da hook gon' be (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shit)
All I need, is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin 'round and I'mma rip

People always saying man it must be nice
No hi, no nothing not a simple house life
Understand the money's good but I'm still from the hood
So don't be asking for no ""inch"" and be expecting the ""foot""
Unless you want a foot (whoo!)
I know a few crooks that can place you where you need to be put
And it might not cost me playa
Got a Benz pepper interior, paint salty playa
And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood
Catch me on your local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty
I'm the same dude that came through wit my crew
Let the girls do me while you do you
(And umm) All I need is JD beat to be banging
And I'll come up wit these verses that I'm usually slanging
I be ripping man

But yo, what da hook gon' be (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shit)

Just enough light to fire up this mo heat
Got just enough ice to not be low key

But ya, you so real so you gotta know me
Addictive type and my baby moma OD

Hey yo I'm Murphy Lee the trouble maker
I'm in the club with my house shoes on
Don't like being in the house too long
Having dreams about buying the bar out
I don't own a dog so sometimes I got to let my cars out
Hit the lawn on my humble abode
My car dusty but it rassle the road
See I used to have ""freetime""
Now my life like a ""Nextel"" and it's not ""free OP"" time
I'm three times, four minutes away
Peace to printed shirts for the LA in the ashtray
I ain't been in this car for a month
So I think I'm a call this a throwback blunt
Hit the corner bumping Old School, ready to drink
Cause my stomach full of Barbeque Tofu
I knew two people at the door
So I EIP, parked it and ordered some more

Hey wait, hey hey, hold up, is it my turn yet?
I been waiting the many let me introduce you to 'prentice
Plot - me in the club and it's 3 AM
With Murph and Jake so drunk I had to lean on them
Disgusted, I snapped myself up, this ain't no fun
I took a girl by the fat girl and smoke my one
High as can be, back on the scene, what do I see?
Dance flo' hiding her plan, they taking off things
Daisy Duke shorts unzipped with the thong inbetween
Girl, you got the fattest ass I ever seen
I give you, what you need dick, weed, but you gotta be clean
A fat ass ain't err'thing except if burning up slings
King I stumbled in to him, he still want to drink
A thick chick took him away and gave gim head on the scene
Blinking, looked over my shoulder and tried to spot Murph
Spotted three dimes that swooped him up, Menage time

And I'd fell so much better if I told you
I was seeing pictures from a world naive
I was really lost I do believe
In another time
Living in another time

We all have minds that wander, I know
But mine always seems to want to go
To a city full of sound and light
Underneath a sixteenth-century sky
In another tin
Living in another time

In another time
I thought I was in the renaissance
In another time I
I had a head full of lofty thoughts and big plans for the
World

In another time
Science and art and alchemy
In another time
Were just part of everyday life for me, in 1503

Now life is more convenient, I guess
We Seem to be a little more grotesque
But only by comparison, I find
That I am truly living in another time

Murray Attaway,"There'll be no tears tonight
Slowly the shadows fall away in time
Now I know no future dreams
The things I have today are fine
And as I stumble through I find that I can choose
And lose the things I'm not afraid to lose

Hold your hour
Live today and let the past go free they said
Try again and I will do the best I can today instead
And as I stumble through
I find that I can choose
And lose the things I'm not afraid to lose

With nothing to guide us but our souls
And we keep on looking for something that we must have
Lost two thousand years ago

Murray Gold,"Well, I've roamed about this Earth
With just a suitcase in my hand,
And I've met some bog-eyed Joe's,
I've met the blessed, I've met the damned.
But of all the strange, strange creatures
In the air, at sea, on land,
Oh, my girl, my girl, my precious girl,
I love you, you understand.

So, reel me in, my precious girl,
Come on, take me home.
'Cause my body's tired of travelling
And my heart don't wish to roam. No, no.

I have wandered, I have rambled
I have crossed this crowded sphere,
And I've seen a mass of problems
That I long to disappear.
Now, all I have's this anguished heart,
For you have vanished too.
Oh, my girl, my girl, my precious girl,
Just what is this man to do?

So, reel me in, my precious girl,
Come on, take me home.
'Cause my body's tired of travelling
And my heart don't wish to roam.

Yeah, reel me in, my precious girl,
Come on, take me home.
'Cause my body's tired of travelling
And my heart don't wish to roam. No, no.

Well, you took me in, you stole my heart,
I cannot roam no more.
Because love, it stays within you,
It does not wash up on a shore.
But a fighting man forgets each cut
Each knock, each bruise, each fall,
But a fighting man cannot forget
Why his love don't roam no more.

Oh, reel me in, my precious girl,
Come on, take me home.
'Cause my body's tired of travelling
And my heart don't wish to roam.

Yeah, reel me in, my precious girl,
Come on, take me home.
'Cause my body's tired of travelling
And my heart don't wish to roam.

Yeah, walk with me, my love, my love,
Walk tall, walk proud, walk far,
For you know my love, you are, you are,
You are my shining star.

Walk with me, oh my love,
Walk tall, walk proud, walk far.
For you know my love, you are, you are,

Murray Gold,"Well I woke up today
And the world was a restless place
It could have been that way for me

And I wandered around
And I thought of your face
That Christmas looking back at me

I wish today was just like every other day
'Cause today has been the best day
Everything I ever dreamed

And I started to walk
Pretty soon I will run
And I'll come running back to you

'Cause I followed my star
And that's what you are
I've had a merry time with you

I wish today was just like every other day
'Cause today has been the best day
Everything I ever dreamed

So have a good life
Do it for me
Make me so proud
Like you want me to be
Where ever you are
I'm thinking of you oceans apart
I want you to know

Well I woke up today and you're on the other side
Our time will never come again
But if you can still dream
Close your eyes it will seem
That you can see me now and then

I wish today was just like every other day
'Cause today has been the best day
Everything I ever dreamed

I wish today was just like every other day
'Cause today has been the best day

Murray Head,"Darling you'll love it, it's down on the corner
Wearing those star-studded high heel boots
Wear your mascara, try on the tiara
Perhaps it'll cover up some of your roots
She's such a drag
She's such a drag

Leather for pleasure, whatever the weather
Cruisin' and losin' her old cares and woes
Street invitation, the newest sensation
Forget your intention when your petticoat shows
She-she such a drag
Ooh! She such a drag

There's plenty room for more
It's a carnival, a circus that we've gotta preserve
It's the meatiest show of all",She's Such a Drag
Murray Head,"Can't you hear me calling, I'm shouting out loud
Maybe you've mistaken me for one of the crowd
My back's against the wall, my feeling's on show
Silence is the only reply that I know

The sleeping dog in me won't lie
But when I'm woken you can't, no can't deny
When you fall in love from the very start
You give your love and then they break your heart
When dreams are broken silence is a strong reply

Can't you hear me laughing, exposing my fears

Can't you see me crying, withholding the tears
There isn't any point in closing your hears
The silence that's between us is the passing of years
Take a breath where the earth touches the sky
We can both feel the reason why
When you fall in love from the very start
You give your love and then they break your heart
Because silence is a strong reply
Silence is a strong reply",Silence Is a Strong Reply
Murray Head,"I've been travelling hard tho' there didn't seem much to move me,
And my senses were numbed as the scenery passed right thru' me,
Down a telephone line it was easy enough to lose me,
But with you on my side, it was easy to ride
The storm and the tide, as they bruised me.
How many ways are there left to say I love you.

I kept telling myself my wounds were on the mend.
But my confidence slides when I can't tell who's a friend.
There were nights when I cried and I could not see the end.
But something within, made me still want to win
As I realized within me, was you.
How many ways are there left to say I love you.

She said, ""I don't know what to feel anymore
When you're home it's too much, when you're gone I'm unsure
Can't you admit there are times when you're wrong,
You've been away from me one week too long"".

I'd lean against bars, hopelessly killing time
Talking out dreams and drowning my fears in wine.
Avoiding the bed that brings a sadness that's hard to define.
When the day breaks again I go back to the same
Empty room, and the pain of us being apart.
This is the time when I need to say I love you.

How many ways are there left to say I love you.",How Many Ways
Murray Head,"Mademoiselle remembers too well
How once she was belle of the ball
Now the past she sadly recalls.
Mademoiselle lived in grand hotels
Ordered clothes by Chanel and Dior
Millionaires queued at her door.

Oh, she pleased them and teased them
She hooked them and squeezed them
Until like their empires they'd fall
She very soon learned
That the more love she spurned
The more power she yearned
Until she was belle of the ball.

Oh, Mademoiselle, such a soft machiavel
Would play bagatelle with the hearts of young men as
They fell
Mademoiselle would hide in her shell
Could then turn cast a spell on any girl
That got in her way.

She would crave all attention
Men would flock to her side
Woe betide any man who ignored
For she'd feign such affection
Then break down their pretension
When she'd won she would turn away.
Turn away, thoroughly bored.

Mademoiselle, long ago said farewell
To any love left to sell, for the sake of being belle
Of the ball
Mademoiselle knows there's no way to quell
Her own private hell, just a shell, 
With no heart left at all.
Poor old Mademoiselle.
Still a Mademoiselle.",Mademoiselle

Play at this level there's no ordinary venue
It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings, or this place!

When your head's down over your pieces, brother

To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha
And thank God I'm only watching the game, controlling it
I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you better go back to your bars, your temples, your massage parlours
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history

Haunts my reverie

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town
Murray Ross,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart

Murray Ross,"How do you keep
The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever
Forever

If we can be
The best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day
To make it better as it goes
With any luck than I suppose

Murray Ross,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Murs,"Aight,
I'm the sickest with this microphone, nigga better learn it
All them bitch industry niggaz you know I ain't concerned with
See I move thousands hand to hand, even got an increasin' number of fans
In foreign lands, Amsterdam, Australia to Japan
All before my sign hit the line that was dotted
The man holdin' the golden apple, y'all grapple for the one that's rotted
To the core I've been hard, since 1580
Mack attack nigga I've been scarred, knowin' what the fuck I gotta do
Fuckin' rockin' a spot or two I wanna leave an impression on minds
Like reading ""Behold a Pale Horse"" for the first time
Expose wack niggas like secret societies when Murs rhyme
Explore cyphers after I visit, for close encounters with the serf kind
Your nigga thought he was nice, until he heard mine
And the doper you think you gettin' the more you ain't understood the first line
I said learn of my affliction, and how my words wrap around
More niggas necks than the pictures of the crucifixions
Rippin' mics when on
Name hold more weight than a 24 inch python
So what'chu gonna do, when Murs-mania run wild on you?
Bringin' that crack to your back like the whip in Castlevania 2
And I'm through, bitch

[Chorus]
When I grab a microphone, all I want is feedback
Energy from the crowd shit a nigga need that
Y'all wanted a change in rap, well fool we be that
And all you bitch niggas best to ease back
Now when I grab a microphone all I want is feedback
Energy from the crowd shit a nigga need that
Y'all wanted a change in rap, well fool we be that
And all you bitch niggas best to ease back

Now I write rhymes as dope as Jennifer Lopez
Words, beautify blank paper
Like, top to bottom pieces on skyscrapers
Ain't no stoppin' us
Rollin thick like smog through your metropolis
Makin' it hard to breathe
When you enter the 20,000 leagues, so stay at your level and place
Cause amateurs fuckin' with the treble and bass
Will get left dead before they make the third pace
See I turn around shootin' off at the mouth, like New Year's Eve
Sayin' that shit you just, wouldn't believe
Retrieved from the far corners of my mental space
Leave you shocked like John Travolta once you open up this mental case
So we happy, as long as fools stop tryin'
To come up from the back and attack me, like my name was Marcellus
And those overzealous we got our blowtorch and pliers
So you for damn sure gonna tell us what we want to hear
Sorta like my album but ""Life is Too $hort"" so I'm tryin' to make one a year
To make y'all niggas watch what you do like the Wonder Years
Watch them niggas you think is down
They only down cause they carryin', a ton of fear
It's been a while since I've relieved myself of that burden
So I'm makin' sure I'm goin all out, until they call it curtains
While you busy in the man's face shuckin' and smirkin'
I'll be lurkin' in the cut, happy with bein' the broke nigga that I am
It's all about the Washington's, what!",Ease Back
Murs,"""Ready to BREAK, THE, ICE
 Feels like time is standing still""

Now this fool been on my ass for the past couple years
Jumped on the scene from nowhere, takin out all my peers
And of my whole squad I'm the last one left
Cause for some strange reason I always stay one step ahead
Of this Agent named Red
But for the life of me, I can't figure out why my ass ain't dead
And now I clear my head, as we arrive on the site
Makin' sure, all routes for escape are sealed off airtight
Thinkin' to myself, tonight's the night
Cause I know exactly where he's going
Fuck the double-oh-seven, I'm the Living Legend
With the Goldeneye holding my rifle for assault
Aimed directly at the vault
But what happened next, wasn't even my fault
You see from the rear, a strange mist appeared
Strapped on the infrared gear too late
Because soon as it came, it disappeared
And when the smoke cleared, the package was gone
My squad searched savage 'til dawn; then had to e-mail HQ
That the knight had just captured the pawn
We swept the crime scene but it was clean, no clues left behind
So I shot back to the hotel
Had a couple drinks, now I'm back online
Not knowin that's where I'd find the next clue
It said Agent Blue, I'll meet you next
Where the stars are at they best and the sun rest too
So I headed due West
To the town where every night creates a new murder story
But stars at they best didn't mean Hollywood, but the observatory
So I cased the joint
Faced the point that I might not know if I was it
Came across the schedule of events
Next on the list to speak was the scientist
Set to unravel, new theories on time travel
Theories that my agency, already knew to be proven
I guess Red's clients was gonna try to stop us on the move-in
Now I know exactly what he's doin'
So the next day at the lecture
I came disguised as the staff director
Even ushered Agent Red himself down the aisle
And just had to smile cause he didn't even know it was me
Then I shot to the balcony where I was supposed to be
Got to the top, my heart damn near stopped
This boy left the spot
Before I could ask where did he go
I turned around lookin' down the barrel of his fo'-fo'
He was like hey yo, just follow me down the hall
And we won't have no problems at all
So I did that, slid the gat into position
Just in case he tried to make this my last mission
Walked all the way down the hallway into an empty room
Where I assumed I'd be dead
Waited a couple of seconds, turned my head
Fool puttin' down his weapons, so I did the same
Slipped my coat off, and jumped into a stance
To let this fool know he was about to get broke off
He spoke soft, said it was to death
I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, but when I opened my eyes
This fool's about to catch me by surprise
With the first series of blows
I'm up to par, I stayed on my toes
But connected with the next swing
Cut me hella deep with his ring
I looked down at his hand, damn
That's the same ones the man from the agency
Said I had around my neck when they found me
I thought he was the only one in existence
But this nigga ground me, so I held up my hand
So he could see what I saw, he stood there in awe
Dropped his guard, I took one to the jaw
But he didn't trip cause it only made us even
We stood there for a second not believin' the shit
We sat down, talked for a grip, I came up on hella dirt
Found out we was brother separated at birth
By the agency especially trained to maintain
The illusion of international espionage
By holdin' up this mirage
Everybody in the Department of National Defense got rich
Now ain't that a bitch? They say we ain't got enough ends
In the budget, for public housing education and health care
So right then and there
Me and my brother about to plan to get over on the man
Went back to the agencies and played the role
But on the under strived towards one common goal
See we both contraband in foreign lands, it'll be enough
We give a fuck, we move the shit by the truck
And the scheme worked like a beauty
So after a couple years we injured ourselves in the line of duty
And of course the agencies showed us no love
But now this is the story I tell my children
On the shores of the islands we bought
From the money we came up off of, bitch!",The Saint
Murs,"You didn't think me and El was comin like this
Def Jux Motherfucker and we run this shit
Got you all up on your keyboard stunnin and shit
Oh you got a couple jokes now you funny bitch (HA HA)
Have you laughin all the way to the bank
On point make a cut like we holdin a shank
Got it all up on ya back now you walkin a plank
Try to do it like this but you drawin a blank
Do it double time all up in yo face
Like piranhas when you drop fresh meat in the tank
Fell off of the game can't keep ya rank
Mad cause you try to rock sweet but you ain't
Been around no-will shit where crews peel clips
Niggaz that kill for fun
Wanna talk that ill shit sayin how you kill shit
Bullets still in ya gun
Koolaid in ya veins so now you gotta change clothes
'cause you pissed ya pants
Saw me durango said you wanna tango
Now this is the dance
Where ya shoes at where ya crew at
Claim you do gats but you do rap
What you gonna bust a verse right before the guns burst
Push ya girl on the ground so that you can run first
Now you about to get rolled up hold up wait
Just an emcee that was tryin to make cake
Now you gotta gun all up in ya face
All of a sudden found god like run and mase
Thought it be fun to front on tape
Now you wish you woulda have stuck to drum n' bass
But you had to be hard on the boulevard
When you never gang banged a day in ya town
Try to be a manhuter the streets ain't a jungle gym nigga stop playin
Around
Lay it down

(Chorus: repeat 3X)
This is the Dance!
You don't wanna be late 'cause the moment won't wait betta get ya shit straight
This is ya Chance!
You don't have to be fake with a heart full of hate just try to say thanks

Murs fall up on the spot like what up bitch
Approached the finest girl like shutup bitch
Than I grab the microphone and I cut up kids
Like a hot knife straight through a butter stick
Now I'm in the spotlight about to rock all night
Shot of tequila than a hot mamacita
Who said she know to swallow but not margaritas
Body on point so I follow the leader
Need more tequila so I swallow the liter
How can the night get sweeter (cant)
So I passed out woke up do it again
Won't neva roll up ya crew in the wind
High velocity high viscocity slippin right pass your animosity
Fans are constantly, askin me
Who said what and who has beef
My crew got stuck in we to musty
So try to weigh it out with the truth laid out (stop the gossip)
That's just played out there's more to ya life than underground rap
What you waste all ya time and you wanna run it back
All on the message board runnin ya yap
At the end of the night only wanted to chat
Now you know that you got issues
That early in the morn you should look at some porn
And jack off right in the tissue
Than call it a night that's probley the life
Go to sleep with the girl that you callin ya wife
Wake up to the same shit different day
Everybody onto work and they on the way
Cause we all got bills and rent to pay
Lent to the earth wasn't meant to stay
So before I'm gone I wanna make a hit song that'll always get some play
Got the homey el producto workin in the cut so what you got to say

(El-P)
You wanna trace along the pattern of fair please rest
I wanna pattern how the drum scheme mechanism I.D. jux breath commence fresh
Test the mesh, metal on the chestplate tech
Better wear the smile right, wanna frown like die right
With a highlight primal fright in a prime life of a double ox razor blade fade like 88'
It's the revenge on the whits and lazerface oh break two three
God to analog monkey not me rock hard and shit
The radio flyer kit, flyin with a boombox pack wit' clips
Faggots wanna ratta tat tatter this
And a PT cruiser he creed lucifer
Here comes the booster bruiser, betta get used to losin movement
They couldn't move like el, ox, murs, lif or bazooka tooth die so useless
So use this tip that'll have a little truth in it like (poof)
Deep space nine milli mechanism fist raise the roof again
Who stays on a move that says
Jukie with a shake ring catapult crawl through the trenches
Revelation manifacture eat senses all city
All compositive battle turn logic pretty
All the hard edge tomorrow brings heads or home up in me come get me
I'm for this shitty dizzy spinning lawless constant progress whose with me
Fabolous thunder bird word nerd unda that tom pill shit
Who heard kill quick
And independent since 96' they still ride ya dick
I refined the style with wild wit from an era with an automan mix
Community watch groups enlist young kids
Hit the road skippy
I don't answer to you george bush or the war time committee
Dumber than a mongaloid race movin shit
With a heart of hell's tutelage bruisin shit
Every time you make a move the industry start the new movement kid
I'm not losin bitch
Essentially on the edge of a generations new ruthlesness
Who's in charge, take me to ya leader man stop the foolishness
Cop the new shit bitch



",The Dance
Murs,"[Verse 1] 
Now some claim gangsta rap's the CNN of the streets
But it's used as an excuse to pretend over beats
So I'ma lend my speech to all within my reach
To tell what really goes on from cells to the streets
Now in LA as you know there's a war going on
And it's been going on since before I was born
Though the undisputed origin has yet to be formed
It all used to boil down to the red and the blue
But that got fucked up as the many led the few
Now there's bloods killin' bloods and crips killin' crips
That's niggas killin' niggas they play kickball with
It ain't as simple as it was way back in '86
Let me give an example of some ol' MURS shit
My sect of mid-city is livin' on the edge
'cause there's four gangs at war and none of them wear red
Any new car or face could mean bloodshed
Which led to the other night, I'm in my girl's Bug, right
I'm bout to hit the block to see who's chillin' on the spot outside
When I put it in park, the homey got a SK aimed at my ride
So I step out slowly, 'body no one fear
He yells, that's Murs I see his beard from here
But I told this whole story just to make things clear
So it don't seem weird when I tell ya this here

[Chorus ? 2x]
Last night I almost got shot on my block
Not the block where I live at, the block where I chill at
Where I keep it real at, and used to pack steel 
At times I feel it's the spot I'll get killed at

[Verse 2]
Now in the entertainment industry they have sweeps weeks
But it's Thursday in my hood when they sweep them streets
A whole fleet of the task that they simply call CRASH
That's Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums
If anyone should ask what the acronym reflects
Put into effect to try to keep the gangs in check
Now they're just another gang out bangin' they set
Known for stirring up some shit when your hood is at peace
The only pig I know dying to create beef
But let me get on with my story so that all of y'all can peep
Once again I'm on my block right, known as Cloverdale
Playin' 2K2 while I'm talkin' on my cell well
While I'm inside eyes glued to the screen
CRASH rolls on my homies with the Thursday routine
What's your name, where you goin', where you been, where you from
We say the same thing while they just play dumb
We don't gang-bang we got J-O-be's
Still they make 'em turn around and get down on they knees
Me, I'm screamin' in the house I just won by three
So when I run out on the porch to tell the homies come and see
I see 'em on the ground and I'm like, god damn
Plus I got this black Nextel phone in my hand
They both yell freeze, guns aimed at me
And even though I drop my phone it's plain to see

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It was a 2 month tour that ended in Japan
So the first day back I had to spend it with my fam
That night I was goin' down to holler at my folks
Have a few beers, smoke, and share a few jokes so
To the block I bail but when I got to the dale
Everybody's on the porch lookin' distraught as hell
They start to tell me on how some fools from the other side
Just tried to kill T, he don't fuck with nobody
Just be mindin' his biz
So you have to understand what an explosive situation this Terry thing is
My nigga never gang-banged a day in his life so
Fuckin' with him is not a way to earn stripes
But a way to get wiped off the motherfuckin' planet
I don't claim to be a killer with a heart made of granite
But try to kill my best friend and it's on goddammit
I had the big homey roll me over to my place
So I could pick up this nine I kept just in case 
Of some shit like this, a box of hollow-tips
I slipped back to the block with the heat in my hand
We sat up in the house loadin' guns, makin' plans
They asked me was it stolen, and why I never told 'em
Nobody in the hood ever knew that I was holdin'
I told 'em I forgot but I did it on purpose
So they wouldn't ask to borrow it to go and do dirt with 
Now we locked and loaded and about to hit the streets
When we look to the corner there's a Jeep tryin' to creep
With its headlights off, we all leap for cover
They start to let off ? now how does this sound?
When I hit the deck, my pistol hits the ground
So the homey picked it up and let off a couple rounds
After that went down I knew I might get clowned
So I shook to the crib to take a shower and lay down
The next morning woke up, rolled out of bed
I called my girl up and this is what I said

[Chorus]

",The Night Before
Murs,"[MURS]
Alright I'm ready
No, you're not ready
I'm ready, you're not ready
Motherfucker

(Indistinguishable singing)

[MURS]
Now this here's for your spouse or significant other
You were in love with the person, now you hate the motherfucker
Get the fuck out! Tell 'em to get the fuck out!
You weren't lookin' for love when you met 'em at the club
y'all exchanged numbers and went out for some grub
You waited three days then decided to call
Went for dinner and a movie, then a walk through the mall
All you saw was the physical, a sexy individual
Never had the thought that they would make your life miserable
A couple more dates, consummate the mating ritual
Soon you will encounter the habitual liar
The sex was so good it set your body afire
But why are you still with this nut?
Every time they come around you get this feelin in your gut
want to tell 'em, ""Raise up,"" but your mouth stays shut
When you stop to think about how good they fuck
An' when the sex gets old you'll wind up stuck
So here's some words of wisdom that'll help you with the chore
Count up their I.Q. before you kick 'em to the door
It goes:

[Chorus: MURS]
One, two, three, four
I had it up to here and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody come on!  One, two, three, four
I had it up to here and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody!

[MURS]
Now say you have a homeboy who's been sleepin' on your couch
For weeks on end and he's (words walk em out?)
Get the fuck out! Tell him to get the fuck out!
Now he walks around your house in nothin' but his drawers
Throws the trash once a week and expects to get applause
Let him stay at your crib you was down for his cause
He was in between girls, or in between jobs
But it's still no excuse for him to be a slob
Your girl stays mad cause she's cleanin' up behind him
You can't get your calls when he's on the other line an'
You can't get laid cause he has the worst timin'
Knockin' at your door at odd hours of the night
If he does that shit again, you swear to God you're gonna fight
But you can't kick him out cause it's just not right
He has nowhere else to go, but you're losin' self-control
want to kill him in his sleep, God bless his soul
Maybe it's not that bad but it could get worse
So here's a little tip from your homeboy MURS
Before you tell him ""Bounce,"" do a countdown first
It goes:

[Chorus]

[MURS]
Now let's talk about these old motherfuckers on the mic
Who were dope but now are whack and won't leave the spotlight
Get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
He had some albums that I loved way back in the day
But as he puts out new shit, the memories begin to fade
When I heard about the comeback I said ""No way!""
I was waitin' on the real, the anticipation built
But with age came degeneration of the skill
So I pushed it to the back of my mind, and hoped in time
Those fine memories would once again shine
But he just won't stop, even though his album flop
Everytime I turn around his new one's about to drop
Make me want to take all his old records off the shelf
Cause the man I now hear's a shadow of his former self
So when he stopped on tour, in my town for a show
I played a true fan and was in the front row
As he started doin' classics, then he stopped and said ""No""
We had to say we love the new shit, before he did the old
I tried to count the countdown, but then I lost control
It went one, two, three, four
I had it up to here, and I'm not takin' no more
So get the fuck out! You gots to get the fuck out!
Everybody come on!
One, two, three...",Please Leave
Murs,"Southern California underground funk assassin
Known to blast the competition
Break 'em up like New Edition
I'm gonna rob you, throb you, rip you with mics
And make you question your commitment like my dicks in your wife
And I'm hittin' it right
Now how's that for a visual to make your brain stall
Your old ball and chain now chained to my wall
I'mma reign 'till I fall, when I do I'll get a stunt double
Like to play it smart so I hump when there's trouble
While you try to go for broke with them punks in your huddle
I play Voldermolt and bring the magic to the muggles
Just dove in the struggle
Not waitin' waist deep
Lickin' kicks off the snairs while you suckas waste beats
Lose your hunger for success once you taste defeat
So I'mma show you how to eat
You gotta let it wet your appetite
Spit it out and rap just tight
Keep a sense of humor and just kick back and laugh at life

[Chorus]
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it

That's how I got these panic attacks and frantical raps
that's cold as a chick mixed hispanic with black
But still spit it so hot they'll have to ban it from wax
Or at least press it on that heavy european shit
So you can't want beef when you're a vegan bitch
Props to BLX, I hope y'all see them checks
I'm uppin' woman from the back like a CRX
And real heads can stop waitin' 'cause WE are next
Def J-you-X and Living Legends coming through when I play two sets
Like Shock G and D.U. don't know the half about blowin' up
I call you see too
Treat it like an opening act of movie preview
'Cause everybody in the house came to watch what we do
Since your rhymes are as fly as a fuckin' Emu
So even if I only make MTV2
It's better than me stuck in a rut being you

[Chorus]
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it don't forget it
Take control of your life or you just might regret it

Quit letting your girl run you life and
Homie be a man
Your ladies not supposed to be your one and only fan
Or your manager
That's a conflict of interest
I expect nothing less from a product of incest
I been fresh
Since my first song in '92
When I got with 3MG we put it down since high school
So mother fuckers, know, how, I, do
I shove this mic down your throat and start speaking into you
And my mic sounds nice, check one
I can sing in the middle of this verse just for fun
Like, ""la la la la laaa""
I know it's off key but when Oh No's on the beat
He can make something even that vile seem sweet
As revenge on your ex-girlfriend who fucked your best friend
While you were drunk passed out in your den
So while you were downin' Hen(essy)
She was goin' down on him

[Chorus]
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Have you stressed to the point where you can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober
(It'll drive you crazy)
If you let it take over
Got me stressed to the point where I can't stay sober

A slave to the rhythm, 9th spark that whip
Cause my heart can't quit, I got something to say
Cause these niggas wanna act NWA
Niggaz wit artillery and nothin' to spray
Just some non-right assholes with nothin' to say

(That's right motherfuckers)
(Old salty-ass, sideways-ass motherfuckers)
(Y'all fucked up now, huh? Murs, get em)

I'm from where we leaving running and we hop outta cars
Jump out and beat you down in some new All-stars
No stars and stripes, just bars and pipes
And niggaz just start shootin', they too hard to fight
I'm scarred for life, and charge this mic with bars of fright
Dare any one of you frauds to bite
I'm raw as life with loss of wife and causin' strife
Spittin' sharp wit like I floss with knives
Not contrived or conceited, on your radio repeated
I'm elitist and I leave this Red Hot like Kiedis
I'm a Californicator and a street narrator
Steady runnin' rappers down until they meet their maker
Concrete caretaker to these weak imitators, they a
Screech to my Slater, piece of beef to a gator or the
Heat versus Lakers, I'ma speak to ya later
And let 9th take me out
With techniques and a fader

(What's wrong wit y'all man?)
(The fuck is y'all thinkin' bout?)
(Damn, them motherfuckers is lame man, get ya shit right man)

I'm from the home of Double K, nothin' but trouble gang
K-W-S's, L-T-S's, O-F-A's
And every other crew that used to rack cans and spray
And mob the R-U-D before the M-T-A
So don't hate what I say or talk down when I bust mine
Tryin' to make some green like the Culver city bus line
I'm unsigned and hyped, dump mines on site
This Living Legend gang what you punks rhymin' like
I combine with 9th, sickest with these beats
I mean so sick like he's forgettin' to eat
A hard man to take down like Michael Vick on his feet
And anybody chose me they was thinkin' defeat
I'ma spit with this heat until I get my credit
I'm a verbal martial artist like I'm signed to Shady Records
And you bitches best respect it or I will destroy you
Have your whole crew screamin' out ""You're My Boy Blue!""",3:16
Murs,"Damn time's done changed these thugs do what they like
Some of them be your friends to try and find a new wife
And still hit the block and slang rocks at night
But you could be dead wrong with your pockets right
Contrary to what the legendary B.I.G. had to say
You don't have to sell drugs or make the NBA
It's easy to get a grant and get an MBA
To achieve one goal there's more than one way
Young people on the whole we have lost our way
I don't care what it cost I'm not impressed my nigga
That throwback jersey is a dress my nigga
I remember diamonds used to be girl's best friend
Enslaving Black children with them third world gems
I don't care about your rims, kids ride Big Wheels
Up until they learn balance and it's obvious you haven't
With way more ego than you have true talent

",And This Is For...
Murs,"I heard your style and I beat you nigga
Your whole album I sleep through nigga
'cause 'Te's an avalanche so call an ambulance
And tell 'em to pick up ya people nigga
Don't call Pharocon to squash it
Better yet call the sheriff
And the coroner's office
Tell 'em there's a dead body
In the corner of Lawson
And Alston, I would proceed with caution
These motherfucka's really think the 'Te done lost it
He sold a couple records now they think he flossin'
But I ain't stopped battling, I just stopped rattling
Off rhymes for free 'cuz y'all were making me nauseous
Understand fucka I'm gon win regardless
I still got the hunger pains from my apartment
When me and 9th were both splittin' cans of StarKist
Arguing about who LP was the hardest
And a hand full of CD's ready to burn
Some real hip hop for your listening nerves
A year later hooked up with a nigga named Murs
Now everybody play our records for they women and churn
Jay-Lee got the Eastcoast getting the loot
Living Legends on the Westcoast, ready to shoot
Get ourselves while they call up the troops
Phonte Taylor made for the game y'all just following suits

Hey yo the animals, ready for war, destined for combat
Play the CD or tape and then rewind that
You want beef motherfucker never mind that
(And if he owe me money, bitch nigga better find that)
We animals, ready for war, destined for combat
Play the CD or tape and then rewind that
So let me know where ya mind at? (what!)

Murs 3:16 meets Foreign Exchange
Keep ya ear to the speaker, quit ignoring the names
Welcome to the next level, top floor in the game
Felize done hooked up with a clubbed-out nigga so
Skip the sidekick, I'm a nextel nigga
If I hit ya on the chirp, with a verse you better roger that
Picture word-perfect from the land where the Dodgers at
Trying to get some money with some pussy on the side of that
Never have to ask where my killas or my riders at
But when fake gangstas try to find where them dollars at
Go to any city where there's pretty ma's to holla at
The illest in your state, one on the tour-date
And more-great, than your grandfather's father
'Te I know it gotta hurt a man they stand by the slaughter
Oughta be locked away when I rock this way
Get rocked on the airwaves but not for play
If my heart should stop and I drop today
I went against all odds and I got my way

Hey yo the animals, ready for war, destined for combat

Murs,"After tonight
Don't leave your girl round me, heart breaker for life
Ask my homeboy 9th

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

All I wanted was to fuck, from the start I never lied
Now it hurts my heart to have to see you cry
Let you know from the jump, I was that type of guy
Now you all on my voice mail askin' me why
Never kissed you in public and I never held your hand
I never said I loved you so I never was your man
How can we break up?, when we never broke down
And committed to each other, we was fuckin' around
That's how people get hurt, and we both do dirt
Now we could put this all behind us and make things work
Or I could get behind you cause I like that skirt
Sorry 'bout that, got a one track mind
But if you say you don't wanna fuck me too, then you lying
Tryna fight it girl, shit bring your ass here
Who else can make you wet by doin' this in your ear
(See why you playin', all that bullshit you sayin')

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

She got me screamin' in public, in the middle of the mall
I lightly touch her arm, what'd the bitch do?, fall
Now they call security, it's about to be drama
I would never hit a woman, I was raised by my momma
But I kinda feel bad even though I didn't do shit
Now I gotta waste time to find a new chick
Someone who understand a man's gotta be a man
I don't wanna have to lie just to get into your pants
And ain't nothin' wrong with a one night stand
That happens twice a week, plus I'm nice in the sheets
And you look like a freak, it'll be to your benefit
A nigga you can fuck, and a nigga you can kick it with
I'm sick of this phone tag text message foreplay
I like to be spontaneous, that's my forte
Let's go to my crib and have, sex in the door way
We'd talk all night if you had things your way

Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

She said this might make me look like a knight in shinin' armor
Great way to escape or get away from the drama
So I got a little momma, first, had to disarm her
Said she heard about us rappers, I still got to charm her
I'ma tell you what you wanna hear and make it the truth
Haven't been with a woman since I left Kamloops
Two months ago in Canada, ask my road manager
He'll tell you I'm a good guy, I wouldn't lie to you
Just because you look fly, look my bus cards are new
We'll shoot to my room, make the best out of twelve hours
We can wash that club smell out your hair in the shower
Turn down the power, lie down and make spoons
Or we can talk all night and listen to iTunes
You assume this the game that I spit to every girl
But I'm careful with my heart and who I let up in my world
(So, here's my number, call me anytime girl)

Just because I'm a musician she must think I'm a (Bad Man!)
All alone when she listens and I know what she's wishin'
But she won't pay attention cause she thinks I'm a (Bad Man!)
It's not as bad as you think, cause you had a few drinks
I'll hold you hair out the sink, you still think I'm a (Bad Man!)
I don't do this all the time, you are just that fine
Get that shit out your mind, I am not the (Bad Man!)

Bad Man!",Bad Man!
Murs,"[Verse 1 - MURS]
First let me ask for forgiveness, since I might go to hell
But I'm addicted to these girls, though where they fuck feel smell
And I been around the world in and out of hotels
Now I'm finally off tour I got some stories to tell
It all started with Mel my first time doin' it
Nervous, couldn't speak, I was scared I might ruin it
Something like a pulse she knew how to take it slow
Knew one false move and I could fuck around and blow
So I went with the flow, it went better than I planned
Finally found something better than cummin' in my hand
They say you come twice the first time, now I understand
I came once inside of her, then I became a man
The next couple of times weren't quite that memorable
Temikha, Glydia must've thought I was pitiful
Bustin' after two minutes, I thought that shit was typical
That was probably why they never got back at a nigga so

[Hook - MURS]
Once upon a time in a land around the way
There lived a couple of girls that would never give me play
Used to wear tight shirts and short skirts everyday
Everytime I tried to hit it they say, no way
Till one fine day in this land of L.A
We finally slipped up and she let me have my way
She kinda turned me out, changed my life I must say
Cause I haven't stopped chasin' these bars to this day

[Verse 2 - MURS]
Now out the city walk come at this iddibittybitch
About 4'7..hmmm..4'11 with a switch
Now lets just say, ehh I think I got it backwards
But big things do come good in small packages
As for actrices in L.A. there's so many
Let me tell you about this freak named Small Town Jenny
After bad auditions, she was guaranteed to hit me
To fuck her on a break when she was waitressing at Danny's
Now there was Umi, female emcee
We talked most of the night about the M-I-see
When it was time for us to get down to be	-I-Z
She let me stick it straight in her asshole, lyrically
I love chicks on e that you meet out at these raves
They use it as an excuse for them to misbehave
I met Rachel in the corner all emotional and mushy
Put my dick on her tongue, glowstick in her pussy
And

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - MURS]
Alright I had a dancer named Candy stripper chicks
Said she only had to dance to get her family out the fix
Fine as hell, but the bitch made me sick
Cause after datin' two months she'd still make me tip
I know a female mexicana by the name of Iliana
She likes me dinky's and a wife beater not pyjama's
Caught her with another dude poppin' up by her casa
But I keep her on the team just to represent la raza
Now Lesbian Liz hasn't called a lot lately
She love to live the legends but she also loves the ladies
I had to let her go, before she led me to crazy
She was lousy in the sack, laid back and hell of lazy
A couple of weeks back it was all about Meretta
Straight up hood rat always beggin' me for cheddar
Had to keep her hair did and her manicure was real
But now I'm fuckin' the corean broad that used to do her nails

Murs,"Everybody out here wanna be hustlers, man
Buit they dont have any idea what I used to do
I used to do anything imaginable
A nigga like me was scared to go to jail
So I'd use my brain and just think up the most outlandish shit
Shit niggas would never do, I used to get dirty
Now these niggas out here just be out here queer hustling
Man these niggas got it all backwards
I'm gonna show 'em how I used to do it

A lotta people wanna knock what we do on my block
But we do what we do cause we ain't got a lot
And you might get shot if your tounges not watched
Casue dudes walk around with hand cannons in their crotch
Fucking up the way they walk, stuck to the strip like scotch
With the top notch Bosch that can cook clean rocks
See times is too hard for us to ever go soft
So the doc got me on prescription strength zoloft
So I can deal with the stress and I won't go off
But I'm on top, won't stop 'til the microphone drop
Rollin' four deep in the Cut like, what?
Hit you up and then roll off, we tryin' to get this dough boss
We don't do diamonds cause my dudes ain't show offs
Tryin' to keep it low so we don't see no cops
Wanna blow up, but I don't wanna go pop
Gotta blow up cause I can't let this dough stop

You'll never find a dime that ain't mine motherfucker
Roll not to be broke and have to stroll like a sucker
So pay me what you owe me, and don't play with me homie

I used to sell insense bottle 10 cents a dozen
Hit the strip and make 'em flip for a dollar a sack
Everyday before juinor high I bought a six pack
And sold 'em for a buck a piece down by the track
And I never sold crack, did aluminum cans
Used to get laughed at by you and your mans
But I never let it get, stay true to my plans
I used it all for the studio (Now you understand)
In the grocery store parking lot, like can I help you ma'am?
To the car with those bags, used to run that old drag
For a itty bitty tip, maybe a quarter or more
And when I wasn't doing that I was knocking at your door
Like, ""May I speak to the head of the household?""
Then give you the speech on how buying this candys keeping me out the
Streets
Cheap dirt hustles, no glorious tales, but it did keep my black ass from
Going to jail
And I'm a

You'll never find a dime that ain't mine motherfucker
Roll not to be broke and have to stroll like a sucker
So pay me what you owe me, and don't play with me homie

I can make a dollar out a dime when I hollar out a rhyme
From the school of hard knocks, so a scholar of the grind
Used to dub tapes myself, claim the quality was fine
But it sounded like shit, lots of hits, hella static
But for three plus two, them shits moved like magic
That's five well spent for true hip-hop addicts
And once they're friends heard it, then they all had to have it
So I took it on the road with little to no baggage
Just some draws and casettes, droppin' jaws with my sets
Once they saw the live show they had to take a piece home
Now I'm almost famous, used to be least known
But not to big to walk the streets alone
Stand in front of any venue witha box of cd's
And these kids love me I stay DTE
Down To Earth, and down to merch at any given moment
If there's money on the block, then where am I, Cause I'm a

It's Murs, 9th Wonder
Murs 3:16, the 9th Edition
Shut your fat mouth, and listen

[Verse 1]
Anticipation got the deck stacked against me since the outset
9th got 'em fiending for an instrumental version of an album that ain't out yet
But now it's my outlet, and it feels so good to them punk fans
When I'm still so hood, so good it's ridiculous, still iniculous
That means three times doper than your favorite mc riding round with a chauffeur
These niggas need Jesus, fuck it, niggas need Oprah
All this killing and this pimping and these foul ways of living
See, everyone's forgetting that the struggle's not over
I got sober, then got drunk again
Got my boy from Carolina, picked up the pen
Threw my nuts on the finish line, I +cum+ to win
While you nothin' to lose, I'll shake you out your shoes
with ease, with moves parallel to those and other three
Couldn't wait for George to make the new Star Wars scene
So I made my own episode 3:16
To answer all the rumors that been shooting through your group
Yes 9th really does make these beats on Fruity Loops
But what does that matter?, this is more than music
By buying this disc you have bought into a movement
Not a revolutionary, nothing but the truth I carry
change if you want to change, that karma is for you to carry
All I'm trying to do is lighten your load
So in between I'm getting faded, some of y'all getting blowed
But I couldn't fall off and lose sight of my goals
So I got sober, got drunk again
Murs 3:16, let the fun begin",Intro
Murs,"See I'm a single black male, dark hair, dark eyes
Long walks through a park and a lot of them lives
I'm a little bit shaded by a lot of what I see
So if you're still interested you should come get at me
Cause I'm tired of getting shot down, put down and dissed
I want to be picked up, held tight and kissed
But things like these don't happen to dudes like me
Because I'm more Coldplay than I am Ice-T
They say that good girls love bad guys and that might be
But a bad girl with a good guy, that's unlikely
So what's a man to do to get to hold hands with you?
Do I talk shit and stand and look hard with my crew?
I don't know what to do, so I drown in my drink
It helps to numb the pain, cause when I sit and think about it
Eyes get clouded, thoughts get crowded (thoughts get clouded)
So I'ma sit right here, wait for you to talk about it
In the come on

Said she had a boyfriend, just trying to be nice
But I've heard the same lines from different women all night
Too easy let down, but don't let it get you down
Shit, that's what my boys told me, but end of the night
I was still sitting lonely, if only I could find 'em
Without all the drama, without the one-liners
Excuse me miss, hey mam, you got a man, what's ya name?
I'm in my mid-twenties so enough with the games
Simply put I think you're stunning, and what about some kids?
A couple dogs, a couple cars, a four bedroom crib?
Look, I'm not trying to jib, I'm just speaking from the heart
But we can start with a drink if you want to play it smart
She looking at my boy who got two kids at home and
I know how it goes, here's his number telephone and
He does the girl's turf, and I know you're smelling on him
But every bitch needs a dog, so I guess that's why you want him

I try to be subtle, but even flirting got me shooked
I would never get a smile, all I got was dirty looks
And my self-esteem is low enough, I got teased growing up
And what I do, I beat 'em up, but that only made me tough
It didn't get me girls, or notes in class
Same girls who used to tell, when I would pinch their ass
But if another boy did it, then they would get gritty
So I pretended the handball was their face when I hit it
And I admit it's part the reason why I'm do em like I do
And women in my life, there has only been two
My mother being one, and the other one is done
So my philosophy on dating is; ain't no fun
Cause they come and they go, and even if they don't cum
They still have to go, girl I give the best head
But you just wouldn't know, cause you stuck up in some diddy
But even if you dissed me, I ain't mad",The Pain
Murs,"Now there's one in my hood off Pico or some shit
Through the years it's been the epicenter for a lot of dumb shit
Let me tell you about this one trip to the store
On the early mornin' tip some time 'round four
I was standing by the magazines readin' a Maxim
When I heard a familiar voice to the the counter dude and ask him
To empty out the register (Nah that can't be Trevor)
Excuse me, Tiny T-Bone from the neighborhood gang
Who if his head wasn't screwed on he would lose his brain
He was with two other dudes, never knew their names
I thought great, it was time for me to shake
But as I headed to the door I heard a voice say (""Wait!"")
When I turned around, he recognized me and I knew it
I was about to leave, that's when that nigga blew it
He lifted up his mask and said (""Hey Murs it's me Trevor."")
I said ""You dumb motherfucker do you use your brain, ever?""
Nevermind, I turned around gave the deuce
Walkin' to the car feelin like Q in Juice
Remember when he went in the bar and Blizzard let him loose?
Anyway here comes this nigga running, big bag of money
He hopped in ride, I said ""You God damn dummy
They got yo ass on tape"" (""But they didn't see my face."")
""Well they got my car and my fuckin license plate
Man get the fuck on"" (""Murs why you gotta hate?"")
""Hate nor love got shit to do with this
You better run for the fives come through this bitch
You know you got two strikes, you better use them new Nikes
To dodge all them blue lights"" He looked and said (""You right."")
Then he bolted up the street
Once he left my slight I gave a sigh of relief
But that was right before I peeped, this dumb motherfucker
Left the bag full of money sitting right there on my passenger seat",Trevor an' Them
Murs,"Now I used to walk with the gun now I walk like a man
And I walk what I talk and I walk never ran
And I never say never but I mean hardly ever
And if shootin' is the solution then you're not that clever
If you don't know shit then you still know better
Human life is so precious it could never be measured
Have you ever had a load of it, cock back the heat
Poppin' on the next nigga while he walkin' up the street
Trigger off safety spacin' an opportunity
These niggaz want to waste me it ain't nothing new to me
Soon as he walked by I was ready to bust
But he just posted up like he was waitin' on the bus
Now I'm all pumped up with a steroid trigger
Cause most of y'all are easy just some paranoid niggaz
Used to walk with a gun but I never did use it
What's the point of holdin' heat if you ain't gon' shoot it
Stupid

It was a late night sunset me and him out
Lookin' at the ladies to come up on some trim
Everybody wildin' out cause the summer's about to end
He had the hypnotic he was missin with the hand
Of that mean green, laid back with the deep lean on low pro shit
That's how we rolled on the scene
Two girls lookin' probably in they late teens
But these days you can't tell but I figured what the hell
So we yell out: Hey girl, they yell back
Maybe two in the front maybe two in the back
But they had this dark tag couldn't see through the black
We roll up ask 'em where their party at
They just start to laugh and I knew it was a trap
But I couldn't roll out cause the strip was so packed
Now I'm lookin at this nigga in this motherfuckin' hat
Start talkin' that bullshit like we was on some bullshit
My nigga used to bang but we ain't know no thug shit
I tried to dismantle it but you know Los Angeles
This nigga kept talkin' so my boy had to handle it
He jumped out the Lex snatched the dude at his hat
I put it in park jumped out to get his back
But as I did that, I heard two shots
I turned to my right and I see my dude drop
Time stopped, couldn't believe what I seen
I was struck by reality when the two girls screamed
I saw his killer stand up put the gun in his jeans
Saw him wince from the pain as the heat burned his waist
Then he turned up the block disappeared without a trace
I remember his face but what I remember most
Was when I got to my knees and held my nigga close
And asked not to leave us in the name of Christ Jesus
But he's gone and all I got left is his blood on my sneakers

It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine

It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine

The day began with me standin' at his grave with his mother
His old girlfriend, his two younger brothers
We said a few words faces covered with tears
How we missed him so much and we wished he was here
Then his girl said a poem put some roses on his stone
And we said our goodbyes and they all went home
I thought I'd use this time for me and him to be alone
I broke out the Hen' poured a little out for him
Told him who was gettin' married, who had went to the pen
How the homie named his newborn son after him
But as the sun went down the talk came to an end
So I said a quick prayer, amen
And I shook in the lab plus the well wrote tracks
And I headed up saw the homie Eyezeer
I asked him what he doin' he was way out of bounds
That he had a freak that lived on that side of town
He always kept the heat just in case it went down
A clown, I rolled down my window 'bout to light a ciga-
Hey! Is that that nigga that, hey give me the motherfucking gun
Man, drive around the block and post up for a minute
I hit you on the shirt hit the corner nigga bend it, splendid
Now with vengeance in my grasp
I couldn't dream of a better day for me to catch his ass
Slippin while he dippin into the ride by himself
I slid up behind him in the shadows hell of stealth
He started to breakin' stuff I said I didn't want a dime
Remember what you was doin' last year at this time
He looked into my eyes with both shock and surprise
When I split his face with the glock right before he could reply
He cried as I pressed the heat against his cheek
The I squoze two times for the homie rest in peace

It was a year to this day that my best friend died
For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried
And I tried to pretend everything was fine
But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine
And I thought that's what I wanted until the problem was confronted

And out of twenty-three, thirteen was the hottest
If it's rare and it goes on your foot, then I got it
I'm that undefeated off of Brayer playin modest
While you runnin' up to eBay to empty out your pockets

Sock it, in the mouth if you don't wanna get clowned on
Metro-actin' cats gettin' frowned on, we sound on
everything from ball to y'alls women
Ballers up in here and they braggin' how they livin'
'Til they car get pulled, still at home with they mommy
Changin' faces, Bull City, there's where you find me
Gettin' a low-down from the nigga internet
You ain't done with my haircut, yet! I swear to God

[Chorus: x2]
Now if your fade is as tight as we is on the mic
Just got your whip clean and your kicks on tight
'Bout to pull the fliest chick you ever pulled in your life
Then you doin' what we doin' and you doin' it right

Hey yo Murs, it ain't all about a cut to me
Wanna go somewhere, catch some comedy
and get the low-down on the drama, B
This lil' dude showin out, ""Who his mama be?!""
It's a lotta trash-talk ""I dress better than him""
""Look better than them, you ain't got no style!""
Keep the pagers goin wild with my new-new joints
Caught a glimpse in the mirror, can't keep me on point

Finally made it to Midtown, walked in the Legend's Isle
Got one waitin', so I gotta go second
Checkin' it with Quan, cran and Goose
C-2 got his son in the shop runnin' loose
to set the slang straight, ya girl is ya cape
and if she's blowin' you out, then you gotta set her straight
Now everybody hate to wait, but it's so much fun
A buncha dudes chillin', no beef, no guns

[Chorus: x2]

Now my barber named Lester, he from the N-O
Best fades in LA if you, didn't know
Tighter than Jamie, in the Kanye video
Still freestyle and gettin' Gs' when I rip a show
Especially when it's in the scope, you know I'm gettin' low
Shout out to all my playas that be chillin' in the Mo'
Slim, you don't want it with him
Peel ya cap back to the fat meet with this pen

I been, in the chair, four bucks and some change
Can't keep takin' breaks, 'cause he wanna go eat
Then he start takin' breaks, 'cause he wanna go speak
I shoulda known better coulda went over to T, but
It's all gravy bread, put the money in his hand
Right now, got me cut like a new man
Caught up on my jokes, fashion to folks
who I ain't seen since the last time we spoke

[Chorus: x2]

(YEAH) Hey yo, 9th man, me and Murs we was in the Circuit City the other day, man
An, and-and then took me back to the barbershop
'cause I ask ya boy, I said ""Yo man, is Chris-Chris ? here today, man? He workin'?
And y'know what this dude told me man?
You, you-you know what this dude told me, 9th? (What?!)
He was like, he was like, ""Naw man, to-the-Canvas ain't here today""

Murs,"She got that mocha chino baby on the back of the bus
If you close your eyes and listen she would be one of us
Never did trust, her family at home
So she kicked it in the hood
Raised herself on her own
She talked with that tone but she white to the bone
You would swear she was black if you spoke on the phone
Some say it's overblown but she don't give a damn
All the black girls think that she want they man
But it's not your fault they attracted to you
That you blessed and you got as much back as you do
Most white boys say that you way too thick
And some brothas might say you the number one pick
You say ""Girl!"", roll ya eyes, twist ya neck
But it comes from the soul
You don't mean no disrespect
And even when they check you, you just keep it movin'
Cause in your heart you feel you ain't got nothin' to be provin'

Cause she wore her hair different and she never joined cheer

Went on the choir, she could hear her mom say
""Look at how she walks, why she talk that way?""

Ya black is beautiful
No matter how you dress
Or no matter what music you like

Murs,"I'm only 9, on the block
Bailin' to the liquor store with 2 dollars in my socks
Say ""cause"" when I talk, pants sag when I walk
Bumpin' K-DAY, just discovered hip-hop
I play Pop Warner and I love Transformers
But you see the big homey standin' out on the corner
He got real guns, not the ones from G.I. Joe
He feared and respected like everywhere we go
Can't wait 'til I'm 10 and I get jumped in
You should see the tattoo he gave himself with pen
He did in the pen like 3 years ago
And he just got home, now he bigger than befo'
Liftin' weights in the yard he, way too hard
Been shot 5 times, even let me touch the scars
I can ride in his car when I get from the hood
A fresh Iroc with a dope Kenwood
Two 15's and his curl on sheen
A big booty freak with some airbrushed jeans
Don't dis put the hood in your childhood dreams
Growin' up these days ain't as easy as it seems

[Chorus]
We live life like death ain't a thing
Fear and respect we collect like kings
Relive stress with every breath I sing
And we all chase money cause we scared to chase dreams

19, almost 20 years old
Cut the baby curl, now I got an afro
Cornrows, some say french braids
Weed and robberies the only way I get paid
Couldn't slang crack, O.G.'s do that
So money hungry wouldn't front me a sack
That's why the old timers keep gettin' jacked
I'm full time bangin' ain't no turnin' back
Dropped out of school, no G.E.D
But in these streets I'm a G-O-D
Enemies tell they B.G. stories 'bout me
A nightmare, when I'm off that P

That's why they always run when they see me in the street
Known to beat 'em down, straight take they heat
What about the police, man even they scared
When I see ya hit the block I put 2 in the air

Got my momma scared of me
And she's the only woman the would ever dare to love me
Respect from my peers, on the set 10 years
Bonafide so I hide my regrets and my fears
On the front porch buzzin'
High that's probably why I didn't even see 'em comin'
5 rounds to the chest now I'm fightin' for my life
Cause some fool from the other side, wanted stripes

Days got shade let me take you 'round the way
Lot of out-of-towners can't handle this city
Where you wear the wrong color and it can get tricky
But that was eighty-six and, things done changed
We a lot mo' evolved with the way that we bang
Not the rips and the dogs, man the smog might kill ya
But you ain't gotta worry if you stayin' north of Wilshire
Don't be scared of Crenshaw, the Slausson super-mall
Or Earl's Hot Dogs man you gotta do it y'all, c'mon
Come to the hood where we do the most good

And I hope the way we do the damn thing don't insult ya

The land where the six-fo's, hop up and get low
Your favorite rapper gettin' jacked for more than his sick flows
Home of the pornos, we mess up award shows
The weather's always warm so the women wear short clothes
Our beaches ain't the cleanest but the {ahh} is the greenest
And we got the blonde bombshells and sick latinas
Then mix in the dark-skinned light-skinned sisters
Where you never have to wear your triple goose on Christmas
You can miss us with the blizzards and the winters
The hurricanes unless it's in some glasses with some actresses
Perfect frame, silicone or real it don't matter if she paid for it
Every single trend you can probably thank L.A. for it
Bandannas, face lifts, quick trips to Vegas
White t-shirt, Chuck Taylor's or them K-Swiss
Pop lockin', Crip walkin', chronic blunts, G-Funk
A place that everybody hate, but you gotta see once

Murs,"I get the feeling girl, you need someone
To love and appreciate you
To love and appreciate you

Now I was lost, confused, caught up in my feelings
When I first started finding other women appealin'
Thinkin' that the grass is greener on the other side I panicked
Settlin' down so young, wasn't how I planned it
Man it seemed like yesterday, we was all about each other
Never in a million years would I need another lover
But you got too familiar, not like I didn't feel ya
But sayin' something new while we make love would it kill ya?
Calm baby girl, its not an excuse
Cause I probably could have put that gym membership to use
I put on the weight
You put on the brakes
Now we both sit around with that look on our face
You wonder who I'm seeing
And I'm wonder who you're seeing
But we too afraid to ask cause we both got our demons
The reason why we should try to keep this thing together
Cause we stood by each other through all types of weather

I get the feeling girl, you need someone
To love and appreciate you
To love and appreciate you

Now all that takin' you for granted done stop
And the love that we standin' on is solid as a rock
Not but nothing but couple months back when we fought
I couldn't live with myself thinking that you were lost
And now we found common ground
The crib found empty never havin' you around
Now we getting down and the sex is full throttle
Chillin' on the couch watchin' next top model
Don't wanna be nowhere else
It was time for me to put the pimp game on the shelf
You helped with the bills, and I helped with the bills
They say that I'm Whooped, but it's cool I know the deal
I found a real women that'll stay down for me
Shoulda' never had doubts cause I found you early
While my homeboys search, I had what I need
And I'm glad you agree

Got a question for you rappers rollin' wit'cha heats out
Is this really where you wanna be when Jesus come back?
Lyin' 'bout your life, over beats comin' whack?
And you say I'm backpack, cause I don't have a gat
Man I just love life, and I'm dealin' with the facts
I'm young, I'm gifted, I'm beautiful and black
And my momma didn't raise no fool like that
I understand that you broke, you tryin' to get money
But you don't start gangbangin' in your mid-20's
Don't know nothin 'bout the beef, or the gang that you claimin'
You ain't even worth namin!

Take this outside, set it straight like gentlemen
I do feel the music so I kinda respect it
But don't confuse ill lyrics with real street credit, c'mon

What 'chu gon' do man, ha?
Get knocked out
I'm real official like a referee with a whistle boy
Get it right man
My man Murs yo shut these cats down, holla!

I got my wallet in my pocket and my money in my sock
Cause that's how it be when it's funny on the block
Like it be on TV when these dummies try to rock
With they secondhand flows like they runnin' on a clock
In a one minute cycle, I'm done with the rifles
The tecs, the 9's, the killers, the psychos
Look, now can we party?
And I want a Shirley Temple cause I don't drink Bacardis
But in a minute I'ma probably
Try to holla at a hottie with a, nice shaped body
If she's into what I'm into we should worship at my temple
I'ma, grind from behind as we wind to the tempo
If she break it down slow, then it feel like mo'
That's a Mayfield line for all of y'all who don't know
All I do is have fun and bring life to the fans

We shocked the world last year when, nobody heard of me
My boy he got skills that's like, musical surgery
Me you know the deal I'm a lyrical emergency
We keepers of the real, just consider us security
Of the world, 9th, somethin' like top flight
As long as we in control everything's alright
While the rest will steer you wrong with them songs that they thought up
I wrestle with these words but I'm never gettin' caught up
In the drama and the BS
Jumped up out the underground, you know I gotta be fresh
Rhymes runnin' through my mind all day, I press eject
I gotta lay 'em down on these beats cause they need wreck
Yes, I'm back for the title
And I brought an iron fist, just to smack all your rivals
Woulda thought I ran track, the way I ran through my rivals

Murs,"I'm a, hood legend, you should feel threatened
Front I'ma show you what's good in a second
The best in the business, I mean what is it?
The dopest MC to walk talk it and live it
A wide bright screen with a blockbuster signature
Every new line I speak should be in cinemas
Champion sound, I win with words
Like you finally talked your girl into sleepin' with a friend of hers
Oh yeah, I'm off on a good one
Momma's so proud of what her boy from the hood done
Got off the meat and I got my mind right, I
Got out these streets I got my grind like I
Got on these beats I gotta come tight it's
Gotta be me, it's gotta be 9th
Your boy dropped some stuff and it was probably nice
But they need a little help, and a lot of advice
Quit while you're ahead, you ain't seein' no bread and
Don't sleep on us, you can sleep when you're dead
And grateful, you didn't live life hateful
Change for the better like the weather in April
Food for the soul, go ahead and grab a plateful
A heart full of hate, is a waste and disgraceful
Uh, don't ingest, turn your stomach
When a brother only wanna see another brother plummet
Come with cha best and you can lose like the rest
Straight shots when I shoot how we do on the West
Yeah!

You know who we might be, man myth or M-C
But Murs sums it up best now, wouldn't you agree?
I, stuck to the plate like it's And1 and straight
Sew the mic around your neck and then bounce it off your face
With grace, the ace in the hole, replacin the old
Cause the new generation got a taste for some soul
Hold on to opinions 'til I tell you to have one
That mic wasn't hot until the spot 'til I grabbed one
Off the stand now it's off the hook
And when the beat is this nuts, then I'm off the books
Meaning, off the head, freestylin' makin' bread
And I shoulda been in a movie but I made my own instead
Still pioneering with this independent hustle
And your mic cord is much too short for you to tussle
For the man that pro like 40-Water, poured in remembrance
Of every hood soldier that died in ghetto tenements
Innocent 'til proven guilty
Should I die don't look for the dude that killed me
Look for a brighter tomorrow, and in spite of the sorrow
Live every moment to the fullest so your life isn't hollow
And you can holla out my name from the top of the game
And since you passed homey I promise I'll do the same
For if a soul is avenged through the deeds of a friend
Then success has always been the best form of revenge

Murs, 9th Wonder
Murray's Revenge!
Y'all know what time it is
Shut your fat.. nah
Watch your mouth and lower your tone and keep your hand on that cell phone
We back

Now my day in the sun has come, the one chosen
To break up the ice that got the rap world frozen
Speak that slang that'll heat up the game
Now, roll down your window turn the beat up, it bang
Feelin' the breeze
Let the world know they still makin' real MC's
So please, make a call, tell your friend, tell the hood
That we back and revenge never sounded so good
Questionin' 9th about choppin' vocal samples
I chop you in your throat 'til you choke on the answer
Nice with this mic since I was broke and handsome
'Til I get my respect I'm holdin' dope for ransom
From the West coast, everything I flow's an anthem
A&R's who slept are now throwin' a tantrum
Hand 'em over boys, your jewels and your girls
Bow down to the sound cause ""Murs Rules the World""
I'm better than your favorite rapper
But it don't take much these days for you to master the mic
Most of these rappers trapped in the hype
They makin whole albums, only half of it's tight
So they never really have an impact on your life
That's why ""3:16"" was genius
We all connected through this ""Minstrel Show"" man, I mean it
Until my days end I'm gettin' paid my friend
Without pimpin' my soul, the gangster limpin' was old
So I ""Walk Like a Man"" and, talk to my fans
Clocked a few grand but you gotta understand
I got a little money and I, coulda bought a chain
But my momma woulda killed me, simple and plain
Exchange foreign currency, for legal tender

And that's about all you need to know
And you need to use your inside voice when you talk to me

Now, fellas we all know that's the oldest trick in the book
What you do, you wait around, wait until she break down
One day at the crib, she gonna let you break ground
Soon found out she was so real with it
One year, no love man who would deal with it
Me? I fell for it, romancin', financin'
A couple years back I would've told you there was no chance in hell
But oh well, here I was
That's how it be when you're falling in,
Uhm, I wouldn't say that
Well, maybe it was

You tried to tell her that I had a drip just to spite me

And we did a lot more than kiss, I can't deny it
I took her to the Hyatt, tied her to the terry
Took Tasha to the Hyatt, oh yeah I went there again
And starin' in my windows, it's just not hot
Always knew you were a freak, never knew you liked to watch
And I'mma call the cops next time you come to my job

When she take out them earrings, crunch time--punch time
Believe me, I know, let me tell you 'bout this one time
I came home late, didn't call, wait that's not the point

Leave her? You know the answer last time that came up

Why you keep stressin'? Just keep undressin'
This a headache, man I swear I never learn my lesson

End up gettin' a little too close to you
Close to who? Close to me?

But my kids need socks and shoes,
I'm walking through the office (boss yelling)
Who you talking to don't you know on the streets I would've
Never mind, the past is the past I gotta leave it behind
But man back on the block I was a bonafide hustler
Spot popping off until the police rushed us
Handcuffed us I though I was gone
Could've cried thinking now I'd miss my son being born
But I was blessed, beat the case now I'm trying to reform
But this white folks make it so hard to move on
You gotta jump through hoops, anger management groups
But the fact I'm still standin' here today is proof that

Yesterday I felt the most hated, I thought I couldn't take it, they said I couldn't make it

She was standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Eyes collard green lean thicker than a pork chop

You would think I'd understand, but I never understood
Why she rarely came around when my dough wasn't good

Now you can call it puppy love, cause I got dogged out
Now in all my notebooks, I got her name crossed out
But she lost out, I just lost profit
When she left me in the cold, heart broke like my pockets and

You know the days when you just got the blues
All stressed and depressed from just watching the news
No matter what good you do, it seems you always get screwed
Got you caught up in your feelings, now you off in a mood
Shake that attitude and do what you can
Set a couple goals, follow through with your plans
Time wait for no man, and tomorrows not promised
So if she's still alive shoot a call to your momma
Cause the fighting and the drama, its just not worth it
Nobodies perfect ain't none of us worthless
We all got a place and we all got a purpose
Now I'm not taking y?all to Sunday service
But you clap your hands as you stand up and work it
Like you grand momma used to do that fan down at worship
Spread it, pop it, and wave it in my face
Put your hands around your waist,
Let me rock it to the bass like

Yesterday I felt the most hated, I thought I couldn't take it, they said I couldn't make it
And today I feelin' brand new, I got nothing to lose, I'm bout to make moves
Yesterday I felt the most hated, I thought I couldn't take it, I fought until I made it
And today I feelin' brand new, I got nothing to lose, get out my way move",Yesterday & Today
Murs,"I wanna hear your voice but I don't want you to call
I wanna see you, girl, but not see you at all
I wanna make up, but I still want to fight
I wanted to break up but it just don't feel right
""Sitting here waiting on you""

I hate you, you hate me, but still can't escape ""we""
And all the bullshit we've been going through lately
Heart broke, lovestruck
Telling y'all, ""It ain't me.""
Life without you, girl, is something that I can't see
I ain't gon' lie, say, ""I don't get lonely""
But there's only so much, I could kick it with the homies
And somebody told me that you already moved on
I broke up with you, you ain't supposed to get your groove on
Not now, at least wait a couple weeks
Got me looking like a chump with my business in the streets
Been a couple weeks, but it feel like you still there
No matter how I clean, I'm still finding your hair
Or some shit you forgot, or I'm standing in that spot
Where you came so hard, I didn't think that you would stop
But, quiet as it's kept, I know you miss me just a little
Washed my sheets when you left but still smell you on my pillow

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

You ain't call me last night, what you trying to be? Strong?
You'll call yourself stupid when you finally hear this song
Cause I would've took you back, I was waiting to, in fact
All you had to do was holler, girl, I would've just collapsed
And fell into a trap and started to relapse
And your ass never called so it just never happened
Now I'm thinking Jasmine, Tanya, Cheraine
Some ex's I can call that'll probably ease the pain
I tried to follow through, but I wound up calling you
Hanging up before a ring, girl, it's really all on you
But you wanna get into it, make me mad, push my buttons
Got us tripping over little stuff that don't mean nothing
I'm sick of the suffering, the fighting, the fussing
What happened to the love in the late night discussions
'Bout children, and family, the future, the plan
And now it's all over cause you couldn't understand me

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

Started missing you again last night
'Til I remembered all the reasons that your ass love to fight
It's like, dude
I really wanted this to work
But you, had to get your shit together first
And what's worse
I really wanted you to stay
But I needed you to leave cause we was fighting everyday
All right, not everyday, I know that's a lot on it
We was supposed to be companions
We was more like opponents
Don't this song make you wanna do it one more time?
Could I still be the only dude that's on your mind?
I'm too proud to beg, but I'm hoping that you not
I would take you back quick, girl, without a second thought
But I'm caught up in my pride and I can't make the call
Didn't want to break up, just a break, that's all
It's been a long time, I know I probably shouldn't have left you
Cause your the only woman that I wanna sleep next to

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

And everything I do, it reminds me of you
And everything I see, it reminds me of ""we""
And every time I lust, it reminds me of us
Girl, I wanna stay together cause I hate breaking up

You say you're sick of me and I say I'm sick of you
But we crazy 'bout each other, girl, what we gon' do?
Said I needed you to leave, but I hate to see you go
Can't make up my mind, girl, I just don't know
I wanna make this work but I'm sick of the struggle
Girl, what I gotta do to make you realize I love you?
I ain't gon' lie, sometimes I just don't feel you
But find another man, and I just might kill you

Ain't talkin' bout beef
Ain't talkin' bout chains
I represent the streets from whence I came
Never been a loser
Don't need no gangs
Don't need no guns
I take these drums
And make the darkest day of your life seem fun
Lovin' life

From my supporters and my fans, man, I know y'all been waitin'
Now it's finally here and
Thank you for your patience
The world's gone crazy

Bloodshed and war
The absence of hope

The power of a pen
The power of a vote
The power of your words
The power of your voice
The power of America's the freedom of choice
We choose to do nothin'
We lose and we sufferin'

From the independent hip hop scene
Now they talkin' like
How I'm not a hip hop fiend
Needle in my arm, can't they see I'm O.D.'in
You'll never take the strife from this triple O.G. in
I blaze trails
Created festivals
Lost fifty G's on Paid Dues, is that acceptable
What? I'm not down for the cause
""Can it be"" (Hold on, Mike) I'm a need a few bars
I could've done the Nas and scream, ""Hip Hop Is Dead""
I got up off my ass and I did somethin' instead
Signed with the devil, brought the scene up a level
Killed the beast from within, I'm a born again rebel
Tryin' to save the youth
From the way of the gun
And if I only save one, then my job is done
So you can say what you will, but you should judge me none
""Can it be I stayed away too long""
From my God, from my faith, as I move place to place
Times I thought, ""If I could just die, it'd be great""
Drop on the spot, man, I didn't even care
I stopped talkin' to you, I stopped sayin' prayers
Numb from the liquor and the anti-depressants
Pressure from the label, studio stressin'
Almost lost my passion to persue this profession
""Can it be I stayed away too long""
From myself, from my soul, when I'm out on the road
I give so much shout to these kids, I don't know
I thought I lost you, with no one to talk to
But you're the one that open up these doors that I walk through
I can't fault you, only forgive you
I'm the only one that seen the pain that you been through
The drama, the struggle that built all your issues
""Can it be I stayed away too long""

The drama, the struggle, that built all these issues
Is all just to make sure they never forget you

Murs,"What up dog? It's Murson
It seems like nobody's trying man
There's kids dying in Sudan and nobody cares man
At least I'm trying, man
Look, don't ever let the fact that you can't be perfect
Stop you from doing your best 'Murs for President'

Unless we try the innocent'll die
You can't close your eyes, keep living in a lie
Look, we not helpless, we not hopeless
Said a prayer for the homie whose locked up and wrote this

He got to get out and change his ways
While I'm looking for a way to explain these days
It's trying time so I'm trying to rhyme
But so many fascinated with this life of crime, hah

Look, I'm dying to be different, down to die to make a difference
Music for the movement with a message, uplifting
Went from set trippin' to trips around the world
Opportunities are oysters, you might find a pearl

You can't be scared to take that chance
'cause if you rather knock twice then you're late for the dance
You gotta move with urgency, assert with certainty
Ask me if I'm set to serve, I say, certainly

Higher than the kite, I'm high off life
At the height of my career, a high priest on mikes
I'm anti thug and anti drugs
Brought peace to the party and got anti love

But haters so antiquated, I anticipated
Accepted it internally at night interpolated
He chopped it up and laid it in a session and then he played it
I wrote, recorded to it, now look what we created

A hot mess, I'm hot off the press
You yesterday's news, dude, you just not fresh
You cold coffee, you wet cigarettes
I'm a shot of Espresso and hot morning sex

Early to rise and the last to fall
The best thing for black youths is the basketball
Word to Kurtis Blow, you gotta know the breaks
And if you don't know your history, I know your fate

Uh, look, been here a minute, be around a while longer
Every rhyme invented, my style got stronger
Grayskull Powers when I spray soul showers
While you battle rap cats, just lay low cowards

Oh, you mad 'cause I'm stylin' on you
Love songs one minute, then I'm whilin' on you
That's the pain, you gotta love and appreciate
I'm a bad man, you silly girls need to get it straight

Hah, small guys, denying this is my world
Your girlfriend call herself a dark skinned, white girl
Got a nice beat, man, come on
He hear me in the sample before he even through the drum on

Run on sentence, I'm the best period
He pull the track out, I'll black out I'm not hearing it
Nada, nothing, the negative zone
And if you can't do better, you should let it alone, hah

I want it more than you, I want it, I want it right now
I'm wanted in 48 statees for this thou
It's sicker than a syringe that's streamlined with strychnine
Vegan diet, healthy heart and soul with a sick mind

Inclined to flip split minds when I spit rhymes
So go ahead kick yours and hope I don't kick mine
A 50 yard line against the wind through the uprights
While you just choke and can't win 'cause you uptight

Hah, he came to the game with two emcees
Back when people said you can't make beats on PCs
Internet haters, major labels be damned
Soon produced the full blown threat for the man

Now his phone blowin' up, he can't hold it in his hand
A few months back them fools didn't understand
I was Mary J and Erica, Jean Grey, etc
But the name's 9th Wonder and he crushing all competitors

I cross train, toss brain fuel on hot tracks
Burn in intelligent infernos, you got that?
I speak clear like the sample is in triplicates
Get every crooked cop in Los Angeles to handle this

Insane, inspired, insider street analyst
Questioning authority who don't know what the answer is
The voice is proof the choice of the youth
Forensic evidence say the boy is the truth

Buy some flowers, open up some doors.

But I'ma pick a girl anytime I gotta choose,
I like mad, but I love orgasms
And I'm not trying to have the same problems your having.
Cause your confused the scared little dude
Beatin' on your lady 'cause your in a bad mood,
Your insecure, a little unsure,
Don't know how to deal with the feelings so pure.
It's called love, it's joy and pain,
But you gotta take some risk to enjoy the game

What you need is some love and appreciation

We live and we die life is full of surprises 
And I cant get over the fact that your gone. 
I try to realize your not part of my life.
But I still try to fight but it just don't seem right. 

Cause your not here anymore.
I can still see you walking out the door.
Your just a memory of what used to be. 

(Yeah)Sitting with my head between my hands.
I know ill never get you back again.
I never meant to hurt you never meant to make you cry.
(Why am I surprised.) I am who I am because of you.
I'm sorry for the pain I put you though.
Maybe its all just a dream.
But your still a part of me.

I didn't think you do it. You really leave me.
If I did it would be different believe me.
Its easy to say baby I'm a change.
The very next day it was the back to the same.
Going though my phone finding new names.
I said it was business I was so lame.
You saw though it and held me down.
A real queen, you held that crown.
You made such an oppression on my life.
Natural progression was you to be my wife.
We talked family, we talked kids.
You thought I'd clam down, I never did.
I bought you home things from the rode before.
Malaysia, Australia silk form Singapore.
But what I give you this time you cant get rid of.
So you left me tired of this sick love.

I know ill never get you back again.

I miss our talks more then ya touch.
Such a fool to lose such a good thing.
You showed me parts of my city that I never seen.
Parts of myself that I never knew existed 
Then I got famous I got it twisted!
You needed me I didn't need you.
Find you a man that can do what I do for you.
I flew you to Rome I paid for this whole.
How you coming at me like you grown.
Forget what I didÃ¢?Â¦on tour
I said I loved you, you needed more
Why you trippin' you need to understand  
Sometimes a man's gotta be a man. 

Sitting with my head between my hands.
I know ill never get you back again.
I never meant to hurt you never meant to make you cry.
(Why am I surprised.) I am who I am because of you.
I'm sorry for the pain I put you though.
Maybe its all just a dream.
But your still a part of me.

Dam dam dam dam dam dam dam!
Walk in the house late, drunk, stumbling,
I pass out you would come tuck me in.
Where you at baby? I need you.
I never knew all the pain this would lead to
I'm sorry I lied, tried to deceive you
You said you'd leave but I didn't believe you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, girl 
I'm sorry I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 
Baby I'm sorry.",A Part of Me
Murs,"So I'm at the barbershop
And we talking about this new generation of hip-hop
And how, how lost you all are man
But y'all have no science
So here you go

The systematic knowledge of the physical world
Gained through observation and experimentation
Usually beginning with a hypothesis
Or what some may call an estimation
Record your results from a series of tests
And what your left with is a theory at best

Now let me give my hypothesis, an educated guess
On why my people on the whole seem to be such a mess

Genocide, the deliberate extermination of a race, culture, or an entire nation
Centuries ago they brought us here on a boat
Enslaved us, beat us til our spirit was broke
Then they gave us freedom and a little bit of hope
Then they killed our leaders and they gave us dope (crack)
From the C.I.A. by way of Nicaragua, shipped to Rick Ross, he’s the black godfather
Now Oscar Blandon was his known supplier, he snitched on Rick so he could retire
Ratted on Ricky so he got out quickly, now this is where the situation gets a little sticky

Not a citizen of the U.S.A. he got released and got hired by the D.E.A.
Then he got his green card by the I.N.S.
But that should’ve never happened due to previous arrests
See our government seems to think that there’s a difference
Between powdered cocaine and crack, for instance
You get five years for five grams of crack
But in the powdered form you have a hundred times that
Now who has the rock, and who has the powder?
Who’s the oppressed and who has the power?
They want you to fail so you wind up in jail
You know how much they make while you sitti'n in that cell?
Billions of dollars for inmate facilities
You sell yourself back into slavery willingly
It's not black and white, it’s so much more
It’s the rich stayin rich and the poor stayin poor
The poor white’s meth, the poor black’s crack
It’s not about race and once you realize that, we as a nation are free to move on
And become one people, a movement, strong

Now black people weren't the first to be enslaved
We were just the first to be treated this way
No education you were killed if you could read
So you hid your intellect if you wanted to succeed
And what happens to a lie when you livin' it
You lose sight of who you are and start forgettin' it
So many of us to this day act ignorant
A mere shadow of our former magnificence
Wellfare
No independence we become victims dependin' on the system
Looking for a handout waiting on some help
Toiling on the past feeling sorry for your self
But you do what you can to make it out the trap
And that right there is the origin of rap
It wasn't always played on every radio station
It was us makin the best out of a bad situation
Inner city schools stopped teaching us instruments
We took turntables and started flippin' it
Stole electricity from the street lights
Plugged it into a system and made the beat hype
There was a mic but MC's weren't rulin'
It was more 'bout what the DJ was doin'
He say a few words (GO GO) to keep the party movin'
The beat boys dancin' to the breaks and the grooves
An the break was the part where the record broke down
Where it was just a drum and a couple of sounds
You had two records you could go back and forth
To keep the groove goin' cause the break was so short

Now if that aint' science I don't know what is
The ingenuity of these young black kids
The Bronx New York Central Recita
Kool Herc earth hip-hop true believers
(Theory) Adversity produces opportunity
Anythings accomplished through strength and unity
The fate of the world is in the hip-hop commuity
The revolution is here and now with you and me",The Science

I'm an ex-con that's almost useless
I'm a felon, don't mean that I'm stupid
Got caught up, tried as an adult
Lost five years of my life as a result (real talk)
In the feds I prayed and I read
Anything to keep the system up out my head
I read Zinn, Young, Bukowski 
You really don't know a damn thing about me
I probably gotta higher IQ than you

I'm chicano,I'm not an illegal (I was born here)

But you keep judging me about how I wear my jeans

Murs,"One, two
She was only fifteen, in love with bad R&B
She had to have vision because she saw the star in me
Encouraged me to write about the drama in my life
To most it seemed strange like something wasn't right
I used to fall a victim to them lunch room comedians
Something like an Outkast, started smokin' weed and then
I sorta fell into my own
Kinda felt at home when behind a microphone
But on the bus ride home
That didn't mean a thang
Harassed by thugs, on the corners they would hang
I got banged on
I got beat down
Carrying a golf club, walking up the street now
They respect me
They call me crazy
At least I'm not gettin' punked out on the daily
And when I look back I wouldn't change a thing at all
Where do you think I found the strength to be speakin' to y'all?

I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly
Ooh, when I die

God is love then hatin' is Satan
Zen-type patience, got me sittin' here waitin'
On the day when it's okay to love
When black men won't pretend that they are thugs
When teachers and doctors are treated like celebrities
You can get a job even if you got a felony
Check out my melody, let's live in harmony
We in this together, no man has autonomy
No man is an island, immune to the violence
This rap race is no place to raise a child in
What's wrong with smilin'? What's wrong with peace?
What's wrong with squashin' beef before they label you deceased?
Swallow your pride before you choke on your issues
I know you got family and folks that'll miss you
So don't misuse this gift you've been given
This life's but a dream you are blessed to be livin'

I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly
Ooh, when I die

And basically man, I'm just a dude who tries to do right
You know I try to make my tomorrows better than my yesterdays
Without hurting anyone else in the process
Cause if you leave the world a better place than it was when you got here, then we all win

Now, there's birth and there's death but the space in between
Is where the journey takes place and you give it all meaning
There's waitin' on us all, there's no need to pretend
No feet are in the feeling where you fear in the end
All good things come to it, walk, don't run to it
At times you want to end it all yourself, don't do it
Be original, be different
Be the one that stand up and shocks this system

I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly

Murs,"The industry is dead, long live the king
Drop from a head shot, and it didn't feel a thing
Woke up this morning with the world in my hand
Money in my pocket, fly girl on your man
On the other hand, I could never waste time
I'm a everyday victim of a random hate crime
It's a scandalous game when you handle in vain
Every amateur and lame wanna slander your name
Fake love, fake hugs, fake thugs, fake blood
They turn around and sell it to the public like they answers
I'm just so appalled, especially now I got as much dough as y'all
And I ain't never had to kill nobody, never had to sell coke
Spend it while you can, 'cause we all go to hell broke
This morning had the world in my hands
So I gave it to the meek but y'all wouldn't understand

I got an army of the righteous to defend me
God on our side, so we pray for the enemy
316, 316, 316 ways to kill the industry
Got an army of the righteous to defend me
God on our side, so we pray for the enemy
316, 316, 316 ways to kill the industry

316 ways to kill a hater dead
Thou shall not kill, so I let 'em motivate instead
Two commandments, die and pay taxes
Fight to stay righteous while I'm living in this bracket
Crooks in the castles, profits in the projects
Black man president, still the world's a hot mess
So God bless everybody trying to do right
Shock G bless me, I'ma do what I like like
Walk on water, swag on holy
Microphone blessed by the based god homie
And Ski cooked up this heater
Rising to the top over all these bottom feeders
I don't follow, I'm the leader
I write that og, you could keep the retweeters
So the script's authentic
Hip-Hop needed love, so I put some God in it

[Chorus]

And I never fired one shot
Ain't no higher power than the one that I got
No napalm necessary, the rap game's now a cemetery
And I'm dancin' on your grave
You was born a free man, but died a industry slave
These 360 deals is craze
They call it 360 'cause you trapped in a maze
And I'm amazed by the ignorance
Money made y'all a bunch of million dollar idiots
You still spending money on jewels
I took my money out to Africa to build more schools
And still got enough to take a cruise with my lady friend
Pull up to your spot in a drop-top Mercedes Benz
You see you give then you get back
But I'ma be dead before you lames ever live that

Murs,"In a 67 Cutlass we was riding through the desert with the

I got a story y'all, from a bit ago
I was out in AZ chilling with my nigga Ro'
We was zoning out
Couple dirty jokes, had the music up
A little smokey smoke, he was getting blue as fuck
Stuff
Back in the day, you know, times was kinda rough
Way back, I was nowhere near my 30's
Rap wasn't paying the bills, we was riding dirty
Two pounds of brown weed, straight from [?]
We was riding slow, watching for the federals
Shoot, how can I forget, we had a half an ounce of shrooms

That's when the sheriff car came riding by
We wasn't speeding, he didn't have a reason
He still pulled us over, now I'm fearing for my freedom
""Oh shit! The shrooms! Hurry up and eat them""
He took half and I took half and threw the bag under the seat and uhm
""Hello officer, what will you be needing?
License, registration, I'm sure you wanna see em""
""Sir, we already know who you are
Mr. Carter could you please step out of the car?""

""Mr. Carter could you please open up the trunk?""
I said ""Huh? Are you sure that's what you what?""

I went to the trunk, and opened it up
And from the look on his face I could tell that we were fucked
Ronin jumped up
He said ""Officer, that is not his weed""

Knocked the cop off his feet and grabbed his two piece
I stood for a second, thinking ""Should I run with him?""
The cop stood up, I stuck my foot out and tripped him
He fell, and hit
Then he sunk to his knees and bled
He passed out, face covered in red
""Oh my God! Is he dead?""
And then he started he crying
No small feet, he wasn't a small guy
How he fit a pig in the trunk, hogtied

In a '67 cutlass we was riding through the desert
Looking for a place to bury this new treasure
Certified killers, small time drug traffickers
Won't be long till the helicopter's after us
We found a spot to dig us a ditch then
The chopper came out, and the shrooms kicked in
""Oh
Yo, Ro', you feel that shit man?""",67 Cutlass
Murs,"If you ain't dreamin', what you doing?

I dreamt of this day ever since I was a small child
And when it finally came the sky was filled with rain clouds
But when she came out, it all cleared up
That's when his boy became a man and put his fears up
I teared up as we started to say our vows
No more ""me"", it's all about ""us"" now
And the children we bring into this union
Never thought I'd live to see my dreams come true, man

Look, all I know is marriage, pops and moms did it
Grandparents did it, both stayed committed
At least I think so, but I can't go a day without dreaming
Of seeing myself married to Hip-Hop without a queen
And I refuse to be that old, lonely dude at home watching porn
Forty plus lurkin' around the college dorms
And uh, speaking of kids, I got a kid on the way
Nah I'm kidding but I dream to have 2 one day
Yeah

What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on
What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on

I've never been that dude that was dreamin' about the limelight
I just wanted to have fun and keep my rhymes tight
And then the fame came, now I'm a big name
I opened up my heart, and started spittin' game
So influential, helping you reach your potential
I hit the booth and touch truth to the instrumental
But really, what does it all mean
If you can't help others to fulfill their dreams

New Orleans is moated murder and mardi gra
Ima' show em'
Through the verses I'm flowin' through the seas that I'm sowing
Showin', provin' and doublin' to excel is just the beginning
Picture me rockin' stadiums, going platinum we winnin'
I lead an army of solders and beautiful, brilliant women
To dream as big as I do and expose the people pretending
Ha, they ain't real man
They're just real lost
It's hard times but these cowards still soft

What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on
What's a dream without a dreamchaser chasin' it
And what's a fear if you have no fear of facin' it
It's not a dream once reality replaces it
So dream on, dream on

Look, I dream I please God everyday that I'm alive
I dream that even when I'm gone my music never dies
I hate when I backslide, I pray I change that
My dreams and God's purpose
I hope they're on the same track
And I remember way back in '06
With that gun on my head, man I thought I was dead
Speaking of dead, a man's not alive just because he's breathin'
No purpose equals no freedom
Rise up

I had a dream that God looked like me
Clarence, 13 exit I was G-O-D
Can I admit, that kinda went to my head
But really who is God if he can't bring back the dead
With that said, in my dreams we live forever
No divisions of religion because we all in this together
Wake up, cause death is closer than it seems
And too many of us die before we try to live our dreams",Dream On

You had rappers, and then you had emcees

Over you? I snapped out of it and got on with my day 'cause
My life been a lot better since the break up

When I was with you my life was so stressful

I wanted no part of it I had to move on
Pack my bags headed straight to Tucson
And with you gone that is room for laughing
Smiling, things I need to do more

Do they know that you could never be true?
That they will never get to know the real you?

Do they know you still call me and text me

Child of the night
Counting 50 G's to himself every night
Racks on racks on racks
Hit the strip club, they show him straight to the back

Whenever in Miami he just live at live
Give it 3 years and he a Rico case
Ain't no telling how many years he gon' face

I picked her up and dropped back off at her door at 10
Now walking back to my car all cool
And I heard a voice say ""who the fuck are you?""
I said ""man, you just seen me drop Leti off""
He balled up his fist acting like he bout to set it off
His homie rolled up, looking just like him
And just when I thought I was about to fight them
(WHOOP)
That's when the cops rolled up
Smelling like some sausage and coffee and donuts
But I'm happy that they saved me because it could of got crazy

Never would I think I had the world in my hand
17 times, circumnavigate the globe
A traveler’s tradition, my religion is the road
Broke the mold, explored all the options
The quickest way to curate the cash, so I clocked in
On the job, no training wheels
Told my mama I'mma make it cause I say I will
Till the wheels fall off
Yes yes, y’all, 'till the beat it don’t stop
Between a rock and a hard place
Came up out the ghetto with my boys, no Scarface
But is my mind playing tricks?
If the world is really mine how I ain’t got shit?
Still they stop and they frisk
But it’s never gonna change till we stop and resist

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more
(Control, control, control, control)

Welcome to the world of drug dealers
Comic books, white girls, and real niggas
Skateboards, bandanas, and malt liquor
Japanese cartoons and straight killers
They tell us get out the ghetto and get rich
But when you really a rebel you don’t fit
We all tryna find our niche
Got to grab it by the throat and make the world your bitch
It’s the American way
Plug into the drive and let the narrative play
We obsessed with nothing but the best shit
Do it on your own or be a drone with a death wish
Defy definition, repress repetition
Get money, get high, get sex, the addiction
The depression, the stress, the affliction
Get ready, get set, go, we on a mission

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us
So listen, listen, and start letting go
If we’ve had enough, we don’t give a fuck
No more control, no no more

They had a rally for police brutality up at the park
But when we killing ourselves don’t nobody want to march
We got to start to take a look in the mirror
If we don’t respect ourselves then they always gone fear us
If black lives matter then black lives matter
And the color of the killer shouldn’t even be a factor
Most of these rappers ain’t equipped to lead
Cause most of these rappers illiterate, can’t read
This is educated street music for the educated street movement
It’s fucked up what the police is doing
But motherfucker look what we doing

Listen, listen, if you want it up
Till the sun is up, then you’re one of us

Murs,"Once upon a time there was a one man gang
Who never ran from anyone or sold cocaine
OGs in the city all knew his name
So here's a little story about the gang that he claimed

The hottest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog crip
When he get up out the pen better hope he don't trip
Teriyaki or pastrami, he was always in some beef
A legend to this day, they talk about him in the streets
It's not a real hood, it's something that he made up
To piss gang-bangers off cause he never gave a fuck
He wore white Pro Wings, with pink and green strings
And dare anybody on the shore to say a thing
Seen him knock a lot of dudes out with one swing
By his side he always kept the baddest bitch you ever seen
Made his first million by the age of seventeen
Running credit card scams, never touched a triple beam
He was the king, everybody tried to trip on him
They would get confused when he Okey Dog Crip on 'em
Most of the time they would just start laughing
But they all got knocked out quick just for asking

""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""
""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""

The hottest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog Crip
Once knocked a nigga out, and he broke his own fist like this
In L.A you get hit up every day
The homie had to come up with something different to say
He like ""no matter what I say they gon' always want to fight
I'd rather get in to it over something that I like
And the one thing I love in this world above all
Is the Teriyaki burger that they make at Okey Dog""
All he needed was a cause that he could get behind
He was always down to squad cause he won every time
Ever since we was little he could fight very well
Seen him whoop a grown man and we was only 12
Kept to himself unless they bothered him first
But like I was saying at the top of this verse
He busted up his hand on a bitch nigga's head
All because he walked up to my homeboy and said

""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""
""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""

The hottest nigga I know, he from Okey Dog Crip
He pulled out a chopper, told me focus in on this
This can make a man brave, this could make a man a slave
And once you pull it out ain't too many standing in your way
Trigger in your hand, you gotta understand
A lot of men use arms cause they ain't got hands
The shooter is respected much less than the gladiator
If you kill a nigga then his homies gon' get at you later
You square up, win some, lose some
I need to save the day like John Witherspoon, son
Homie's almost out after 8 to 10 years
But I'mma say something that he might hate to hear
Look, now that I'm a grown man
30 something years and I'm out here tryna throw hands
It's green light for me to blast a motherfucker
So you better think twice before you ask a motherfucker

""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (what?)
""Okey Dog Crip, and y'all don't want none""
""Where you from, homie? Where you, where you from?"" (whoop)

I love my job but I hate doing interviews
I'm luckier than most, but not as much as some
And since I moved up out the hood, I don't fuck with guns
Live in the 'burbs, I wake up and run
See the world but remember where the fuck you from

Love money, music, and my mama
Stay away from douchebags and the drama
Need a check with at least 3 commas
Gimme pussy and some pizza and there won't be no problems

Murs,"I always knew life could be super short
Ever since they busted out the super sport
Brevity, levity, bitter I could never be
Young for a nigga born in the late seventies
Heavenly, my wife cause she loves me in spite
Of all the crazy shit I be saying when we fight
Shout a kite to my nigga locked up, now Reece home
Making music for the kids, bitch we grown
Put your phone down, look me in the eye
Or you can talk that shit to another guy
I swear to God I would kick you in the button fly
And jump up and down on your skull 'til you fucking die
Y'all probably want to dance so ignore me
That club life ain't ever been for me
You basic bitches just bore me
If I got to buy you a drink you can't afford me

Gun shots on a good day
No ski masks, that's the hood way
Little kids wishing that they could play
Looking for a hook or something Jay-Z would say

I got two shots left in my twenty-two two step
Two shots left in my twenty-two two step

Deuce-deuce in my tennis shoe
Hood nigga brought a burner to the interview
Might catch a beef on the bus home
Tell them gang-bang bullies get the fuck gone
In my zone with a brand new playlist
Walked right past my ex, didn't say shit
Then I changed my mind like, ""Ay bitch!""
""Tell your new boyfriend he can't fake this!""
Spent my last check on some new kicks
The rest at the movies on my new chick
I got fired on some bullshit
Snitch, fuck-boy that I never should've fooled with
And I ain't ever wrote a résumé
But I had my cousin make me one yesterday
I need more hours and some better pay
Back when I was hustling that was something I would never say

Gun shots on a good day
No ski masks, that's the hood way
Little kids wishing that they could play
Looking for a hook or something Jay-Z would say

I got two shots left in my twenty-two two step
Two shots left in my twenty-two two step

Ten toes down nineteen seventy-nine
Southern California dummy repping heavy with mine
These motherfucking actors are not to a factor
Hilary Spunner is a cold black bastard
No master, no father, I raise me crazy
A nigga clean it up, when I had a couple babies
Well maybe, just maybe, you can oh thank me
Fresh out the county feeling crazy
No, eight months feeling turnt, don't pay me
I used to be a mess my nigga
Only thing could kill me was stress my nigga
Had to give that shit a rest my nigga
I just did a couple years, none left my nigga
I can't do another stretch my nigga
So it's either shut it down, or it's death my nigga

Gun shots on a good day

Murs,"Last night I had a dream that I woke up dead
A motherfucker put some money on my head
Cold sweat, wide awake in my bed
I guess I shoulda’ took my meds
I’m so sedated, self medicated
Hoping that the threats on my life are never predicated
If this is the price of fame, I should of hesitated
I don’t wanna die in the streets, I’m too educated
The type of shit you need a vest for
The type of shit that can’t be fixed with high test scores
Getting pressed more, as the fame builds
But my shrink keep prescribing me the same pills
Can’t kill a motherfucker just for lookin’ at me
Even though I know his ass is plottin’ when he lookin’ at me
Statute of limitations on a murder is
Non-existent, if I hit him, I’ll be serving years

This morning I woke up dead, comatose, two shots to the head
Finally got me, that’s what they said, this morning I woke up dead
This morning I woke up dead, comatose, two shots to the head
Finally got me, that’s what they said, this morning I woke up dead

For years I've been having dreams that I get shot
Then them niggas go runnin’ up the block
Me and Terry just chillin’ at the spot
They pull up in the cutlass, start bustin’, then I drop
Start running, I collapse on the corner
Neighbors start yellin’, somebody call the coroner
Standing over me, blood on my denim
Kinda like Omar did Snoop when he hit ‘em
Wreath wrapped up in blue ribbon
Nobody at the funeral, knew that I was crippin’
Well I’m not, but on the block, who isn’t?
If you kick it’ on the spot, then it don’t make a difference
You can get shot just because you with em’
And every cop thinkin’ that you fit the description
Gettin’ older as my life get’s shorter
Livin’ with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

This morning I woke up dead, comatose, two shots to the head
Finally got me, that’s what they said, this morning I woke up dead
This morning I woke up dead, comatose, two shots to the head
Finally got me, that’s what they said, this morning I woke up dead

I asked my Momma not to move up out the hood
She fucked around and she moved to Inglewood
And to her, everything is all good
‘Cause she doesn't understand, if she never understood
Niggas lookin’ at me all crazy
I’m standing on the corner with my baby
Ready for whatever, ‘cause that’s how the streets made me

Murs,"Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
On the side, but your main chick tried to hate
Let me tell you a story about my situation
I got caught up with this chick from a radio station
The thirteenth caller won a ticket to my show
At night is where I saw her there in the front row
She had big D cups and a very small waist
I looked into her eyes and wondered how did she taste
She came backstage to take a flick for the gram
She whispered in my ear and put my dick in her hand
She said, ""Do you have plans for later on tonight?""
I said, ""Yes ma'am, but I sort of have a wife""
She looked and said, ""I know""
I said, ""But what does that mean?""
She said, ""I know means I know how not to be seen""
My mind said no, but my body said yep
So I probably put my number in her phone before she left

You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger but
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger

Now she sliding in my DMs
AM and to PM
Delete, delete, delete
Because my girl don't need to see them
And every time I see her
It makes me want to leave her
Caught between these two chicks
I don't know which I prefer
I told her, ""You don't know how powerful you is
With just one text you destroy all of this
My kids, my wife, my life, my home
All of this is gone with just a message from your phone
I said, ""Think we should cut this off before it all goes sour
Because no side chick should have all this power""
I rolled out of my bed and hopped into the shower
And I was at her house in less than an hour
I was such a coward, I was so confused
I let it all continue because I didn't want to choose
And that's how you lose everything you ever dreamed of
Dudes out there takes this message here from me because

You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger but
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me

And we be goin' at it so hardcore

Saw my homies from my neighborhood comin' up the street
Dressed in all blue from the head to they feet
They didn't see me, but I seen them
I try to dip out that's when I hear the homie Demon he like
""What up Nick, cuz?""
I'm like ""Shit, fuck""
These motherfuckers Goddamn
I just don't understand
Gettin' caught up with these niggas wasn't part of the plan
I act like I'm happy to see 'em
I dap 'em up
And in the back of my mind I know they about to act up
""Haaa, what y'all niggas doin' up here?""
(Nothin' cuz, heard some enemies was up here)
(You wanna leave Nick?)
(You got a problem?)
(Guess you only kick it with us when you got a problem)
I just had them tools at my school last week
I told them fools they're trippin', then they came up there mad deep
A friend in need is a friend indeed
So I tried to distract 'em and I offered 'em some weed
It didn't work, they seen them dudes at the chicken spot
All them blood niggas standin' up on the rooftop
Didn't take long before they spotted us
And any other day they would've been done shotted us
Too many people in the street to bear witness
And they all hopped down from the roof with a quickness
I seen one of 'em try to reach in his waist
So Colossus threw a barbecue grill in his face
Sparks flyin' everywhere, people is screamin'
That's when two of 'em tried to hop on Demon
And I seen a fist comin' out of my periphery
And all of the sudden the asphalt got slippery
I got hit
My feet slipped out from under me
Now I'm goin' down, down, down, like a submarine
Knocked out cold in the middle of Crenshaw
A nigga named Grit got credit for the pinfall
I woke up, slightly concussed in handcuffs
Bleedin' from my head, I could barely even stand up
Police askin' me what transpired
When I said I didn't know they was callin' me a liar
A call on they radio said shots fired
So they had to let me go 'cause a priority was hired
They drove off, tires screechin', lights flashin'
Homies pulled up and told me get my ass in
I got to the crib and I got me a ice pack
These niggas wanna smoke right before they go strike back
Now they got jokes, laughin' cause I got knocked out
I'm happy that I'm home, I give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout
On the couch with a concussion, niggas clownin' me but well

It's like the nice guys always get the most disrespect

She saw the disrespect out the corner of her eye
That's when a homie grabbed him by the neck
I would be a snitch if I said what happened next

They moved out, but we moved in
Like fuck y'all niggas, no new friends
When they move back, we gotta move out

The fucked up thing is, this happens every other night
They see him comin', they like, ""wassup cuz?""
He in his uniform from Target so they sayin' he's a blood
They know he ain't bangin', they do it for entertainment
Let off a couple shots and they all start to chase him
Heart racin', 'round the corner then he trip
That's when he felt the chrome to his head and heard the click

And every day he puts his backpack on
His headphones in and he plays that song
And now he doesn't feel so alone
Walkin' out the door, he pray to God he make it home
And he just want to make it home
A young black man tryna make it on his own
All this craziness going on
He's just trying to survive but they saying that he's wrong

So God bless Kanye West
And every other brother of color that's under stress
They wanna make you feel like you are less
Even though you didn't make it, gotta deal with this mess
Hold your head, and always do your best
It's a long race, you gotta pace your steps
And remember that you are blessed
It's because God loves us that he puts us to the test

He's running for his life
The fucked up thing is this week it happened twice
This time the eses, bald head and tattoos
Mad 'cause he datin' they cousin and he a black dude
Hopped in they Regal, they chased him down Pico
He tried to hide in the crowd amongst the other people
High off sherm so they don't give a shit
They rolled down the window and emptied the whole clip

And every day he puts his backpack on
His headphones in and he plays that song
And now he doesn't feel so alone
Walkin' out the door, he pray to God he make it home
And he just want to make it home
A young black man tryna make it on his own
All this craziness going on
He's just trying to survive but they saying that he's wrong

We in the struggle where the strong kill the strong
Bodies dropping in the ghetto all night long
Can't seem to find a way for us all to get along
It's like they the new Marvin Gaye, what's goin' on?

So God bless Kanye West
And every other brother of color that's under stress

He's running for his life
The fucked up thing is tonight is the black and white
They rolled up and told him, ""freeze, don't run!""
And that might sound easy, but you see he's got a gun
You know he ain't tryna be on no tough shit
But every single night he was tired of gettin' fucked with
He dropped the gun and it let off a shot
So they returned fire as he ran down the block
This is a story with three different plots
In any of the three the hero could've been shot
Who really did the shooting don't matter a whole lot
Either way a young man was gunned down on his block
And now he laying in the hospital

I'm about to head to the crib
Then aww, shit
Look who it is!
I know this motherfucker ain't really gettin' tacos
I parked in the red, grabbed my shit and I walked slow
Right up behind him, I put my gun in his back
I said, ""yeah my nigga, what was up with all of that?""
""Fuck what you wanna do, this what you gonna do""
""Hands in your pocket, keep your eyeballs in front of you""
Then this lady came and kissed him on the cheek
He said ""hi, mom"", and then they both start to speak
I said, ""ah, shit, this young punk""

Muse,"""For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence: on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly-knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised.""",JFK

Find the one way destruct inside

Music For My Time,"There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years
Baby, baby, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)",Angel of the Morning

Music Instructor,"We started dancing and love put us into a groove
as soon as we started to move.
The music played while our bodies displayed through the dance
then love picked us out for romance.

I thought it was clear, the plan was we would share
this feeling just between ourselves.
But when the music changed the plan was rearranged.
He went to dance with someone else.

We started dancing and love put us into a groove.
But now he's with somebody new.
What does love want me to do?

Love said, ""Let the music play. He won't get away.
Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again.
Let the music play. He won't get away.
This groove he can't ignore and he won't leave you anymore.""

He tried pretending our dance was just a dance but I see
he's dancing his way back to me
Yes, he discovered we are truly lovers, magic from the very start.
'Cause love just can't be proven and he felt me movin'
even though we danced apart.

So we started dancing and love put us into a groove
as soon as we started to move.
As soon as we started to move.

Love said, ""Let the music play. He won't get away.
Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again.
Let the music play. He won't get away.
This groove he can't ignore and he won't leave you anymore.""

Let the music play. He won't get away
Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again.
Let the music play. He won't get away.
This groove he can't ignore and he won't leave you anymore.""

Let the music play. He won't get away.

You rolled it, I lit it, we hit it 
Instantly you effected my state of being to cloud nine 
I can tell that the hydro got you

Lord knows if we would have rolled another stogie 
You would've been holding like En Vogue 
I knew that you laced it 
Yes indeed 
Cause I can tell when I tasted it 
Yes indeed 
Got me breaking in sweats 
Feeling like something crawling all over my neck 
You got me drawn yes indeed 
I can't believe that you got this type of effect on me

And in this relationship you are the person I run to 
And I appreciate how you respect my space

You should never start to wonder where you stand 
'Cause everyday I want to show you that I'm your man

Oh no baby see no trouble

Five foot seven with light green eyes 
Body built like a woman over twenty-five 
Plus she push the whip that the average women couldn't get 
Less she worked about two nine to five's 
Girly played the game just a little too mature 
She damn near had everything I was looking for 
But things seemed shady 
When I asked my lady to meet at the club 
She had trouble at the door 
That's when I found out that 
(Ohh) 
She was only seventeen years old 
And I couldn't see her no more

I ain't tryin to see myself locked up 
For knockin up some young joan

How could I explain this situation to my family 
And all of my boys 
(Ohh) 
I'm sorry shorty 
But you've got to get gone 
Yeah

I tried to cut her off 
But she wasn't having it 
She kept telling me her age didn't mean sh-- 
And that's when she started to cry 
Baby I need you in my life 
And without you I just couldn't handle it 
So what's a brother to do 
(Ohh) 
Either way I lose

I could just say my piece

By now we would be so in love

Girl I'm so surprised to see
The young, fine woman that you grew up to be
Your body's banging like a 400SE
Even your attitude flows pleasantly

A girl that likes to play basketball
As far as I was concern, you were one of my boys
I never cared about my sex or yours but

That you're home from school
And I want to let you know that I'm proud of you
Even when we was younger I admired you
That's why I always used to pick fights with you
I remember when we used to call each other names
Mimic old TV shows and play those childish games
Like I was your Tarzan and you were my Jane
Can we do that nowadays?

'Cause if you just hold on
Be strong you
You'll be alright

People have a tendency
To think to themselves
That they're the only ones
Going through more things than anyone else

But oh, I bet you'll beg to differ
If you would just consider much bigger picture
'Cause then you would see that most people go through
The same things that you do in life

But you be alright

You surely can make it
You'll be alright

Just take a good look around
Look at the things and all the people that you see

It kinda hurt to make a young jawn cry
Now just yesterday I saw her around the way
And we sparked up a little conversation
She been diggin' on me like a gold miner
And since then she got a whole lot finer and

I'm caught up with her, I'm so caught up with her

She got book intelligence street common sense
Ain't down for the bull,
She can switch her mode from corporate to ghetto
Even when she gone represent
She's that keep it real type, speaks her mind
When she does and who's she gon' like
'Cause see she's very opinionated
You can take it how you want it
Either you love it or you hate it see but

I'm caught up with her, I'm so caught up with her

Now I'm older and I'm wiser
And I know that I want you
Now my mother and my father
Know all about you so it's cool

I'm caught up with her, I'm so caught up with her",Caughtup

If I still see you the same way

So let me reassure you darlin' that
My feelings are truly unconditional

See I'll love you when your hair turns gray, girl

And I'll make sure that I'll be everything you need, yeah
Girl the way we are is how its gonna be
Just as long as your love don't change

Cause I'm not impressed, more or less
By them girls in the T.V and magazines
Cause honestly I believe that your beauty
Is way more than skin deep
Cause everything about you makes me feel
I have the greatest gift in the world
And even when you get on my last nerve
I couldn't see myself being with another girl

See I'll love you when your hair turns gray, girl
I'll still want you if you gain a little weight, yeah
The way I feel for you will always be the same
Just as long as your love don't change, No

So don't waste your time worryin' bout
Small things that ain't relevant to me
Cause to my understanding your all I want and need
See what I'm tryin' to say is I'm here to stay
And as long as your love doesn't change, then

Baby darling I swear that I,
I swear I ain't going nowhere no.

I can say that I wouldn't change a thing

That I spent watching my days go by
Doing, doing, doing nothing
I probably never be penniless or hopeless.

Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused cuz for you, I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothings the same
And really I just want my friend back

And my mind's gone half crazy cuz I can't leave you alone
(Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I wonder if, if it's worth me holding on (holding on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy cuz I can't leave you alone

And I wonder if, if it's worth me holding on

I'd to hate walk away from you as if this never existed
Cause when we kissed, the moment after I looked at you different (yea)

Cause you take things personal nowadays
You used to laugh now you get mad

Sometimes I wonder why people, act like the way they do
All the drama and changes they, like to take you through
Now it's cool to think that you're cool with somebody but the bottom line reality
No matter how bad that you think you do, dawg you don't know me
When you see me in public don't you worry about it yo it's cool
I shake your hand give mad love I ain't got no beef with you
Just understand that sometimes I need my space to breathe
You probably feel the same as me, if these shoes were on your feet
I can't control how you feel about it
But all the drama I sure can do without it, yeah
So go on, and feel the way that you want bout how you think I am
But remember at the end of the day
I'm just a person like you trying to do the best that I can
And that's real

Mother-Father before I forget
Thank you for all that you have been to me
And just in case you are wondering I love you

I know that our difference caused
Us to waste so much of our time we could have used
Getting to know each and one another
But now that I've grown into my own
And learned some things about life
I now can see that it wasn't easy to raise someone like me

[Chorus]

I remember those days when you used to sit me down
And try to school me about the plenty opportunities in life
Hoping and wishing and praying that something would stick
And somehow click within this mind of mine
See you used to say, if you throw enough on the wall
Something is bound to rub off
And I'm here to tell you 
That you don't have to really worry about me at all

[Chorus]

Listen now
There was no limit to all the things that you've done
And would have for me my sisters and brothers
And I'll never understand how you would talk all day long
And just as you said, in one ear and out the other
Isn't it funny how things change when you get older?
Now I know that I'll never find another

Fine as the autumn sun with a heart of gold, yeah

What it is she feels or what's on her mind
When it comes to love 
She gets so afraid that someone will come 
And hurt her again someday

[Chorus]
All of her life she never had
Someone show her what it means
To have or be in real love

She never had a man who was kind to her
Never told her I love you without getting hurt, no
Some people say she's bitter some think she's scared
Some people say she thinks nobody cares

Now she walks around and protects her heart
Never looks for love
Lives behind a wall

And that is such a shame

And lose a love that took years to build

Pam Grier structure look at your body
Keep each other thirsty
Kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed
Cause we don't need the controversy
I say I'm in town, You say you want it in the worst way
You probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday
Meanwhile, its champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest stage you done in ya life?
We breakin' down like we grove dogs pulling a hike
You making sounds like a vive got you reaching your height
Prepare for flight, this is your captain
I'm getting strapped in
There's no denying the strength 
That its attraction girl
Workin' with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man and roll with the one 
Who's breaking you off

Baby, baby, baby, don't you worry bout
Nothing 'cause I'm coming to handle you
Whenever you want, that thing you need, I got it
I'm there and I aim to please
I'm coming over to give it to you
Baby, baby

Comin' to break you off(beat started, start-started)
Comin' to break you off(beat started, start-started)
Comin' to break you off(beat started, start-started)

Bad misses, throwin' raspberry kisses on me
You looking for directions girl?
I feel your vision on me
Just don't let him see you sweatin'
And we ain't spose to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, Girl I mean it off
Keeping you fiending 'til you taking it tossed
And when I'm breaking it off
Its no denying the fact it's wrong
Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason, Uh
Is it because he's superficial 
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it 'cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way the getting is on
The cost, dealing with this you only taking a loss
You need to leave him alone
And go with the one who breaking you off

[Chorus: x2]

Brother down the hall
The one you bound to call
Workaholics are really I'm rarely around at all
What we started got serious repercussions in court
We had a chance to turn back, but love that was all 
Late nights twistin' something
Listenin to Neicey sing
She got the beef for you telling me you deeply
Appreciate the company, time we spend
I feel the same, it's a shame you ain't my girlfriend
Cause listen, you need a brotha with the physical fix
Who come through in the mix
For you with no head tricks or fraud

You need a new position and who can get you open
Like eucalyptus and have ready to go for yours
Come on and work with me, you won't get hurt with me
Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainly

Dealing with this you won't be taking a loss
You need to leave him alone and roll
With the one who's breaking you off

My feelings are truly unconditional

I'll still want you if you gain a little weight, yeah

I was meant for you and you were meant for me, yeah
And I'll make sure that I'll be everything you need, yeah
Girl the way we are is how its gonna be 
Just as long as your love don't change

Cause I'm not impressed, more or less 
By them girls in the T.V and magazines
Cause honestly I believe that your beauty 
Is way more than skin deep
Cause everything about you makes me feel 
I have the greatest gift in the world
And even when you get on my last nerve 
I couldn't see myself being with another girl

So don't waste your time worryin' bout
Small things that ain't relevant to me
Cause to my understanding your all I want and need

Musiq (Soulchild),"The children need something
With more substance and more meaning
A message intended to leave them
With something much more to believe in

Now it’s cool for us to say, all the things we say and do
All the things we do to express ourselves
But we should try to find a way to bring balance to this hate
And leave a good impression on someone else
'Cause in our world

There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more
There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more

Now lovers of this music shouldn’t get so caught up
In all of the rumors and lies
We’re the same as you, we got feelings too
And you know we’re human, just trying to live our lives

There will come a day when the world is gonna change
And then, things will be much better than how they are
Where happiness is the way and joy out weighs the pain
And oh, how I prayed to God that day isn’t far
'Cause in this world

There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more
There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more

All we want in this world, we can have through love
All we need in this world, we can get with love
All we got in this world, we can keep through love
All we got to do is just, give a little more love in this world

There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more
There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more

There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more
There isn’t much love goin’ around
We should try to give a little bit more

Yo, you’ve reached Musiq’s cell phone
I’m sorry I can’t pick up right now
I’m kinda busy at the moment

But if you leave your name and your number
The whole routine, I’ll get back to you as soon as I can
And if I don’t, don’t get mad, yeah, you too, peace

I’m sorry that I’m not around to
Listen to what you have to say
I hope it wasn’t so important that I
Just had to hear 'cause it couldn’t wait

I wish I knew what it was you wanted
Just to see if there was something that I could do
Oh, I know you probably thinking the worse of me now
But understand that I’m not avoiding you, no, I'm not so

If I don’t call you or come over, it’s only just
'Cause I’ve got so much work to do
So sometime before this song is over
Leave a message and I promise I’ll get back to you

You know how things are some days
My time be moving just way to fast
While you may be thinking, I should put some aside for you
I’m just trying not to let it pass me by

Now I don’t want to take you for granted, no
And please believe that I’m not ignoring you
Well, I guess I can’t expect you to understand it all
But I pray, you don’t take it personal, 'coz it's not

If I don’t call you or come over, it’s only just
'Cause I’ve got so much work to do
So sometime before this song is over
Leave a message and I promise I’ll get back to you

So sometime before this song is over

I fear is going on with us right now
And the crazy thing is I don't really know how to feel about it

What went on with you and I
Was only planned for just a night
But it seems like something much more is made of it
(and oh girl) so whatever you decide is just whatever you decide
And I'm a have to be straight and just move with it

Now listen here baby
I don't mean to scare you but I
See I'm not really ready for a child
In my life right now
And lets keep it real girl
You don't really know and I 
I've only known you for a little while
So I guess we got a lot of things to figure out

I'm having mixed feelings bout it cause
The idea of it sounds kinda nice but
We both gotta be clear about what it was
Cause we cant say that it happened out of love
Now I know you really want to keep it baby
So I support you and I'm always gonna be there babe
For our baby to make sure that he or
She doesn't grow up and make the same mistake

Listen you know people are you know they gonna talk shit
So be prepared cause we doing this regardless
Of what my mother say or what your father say
We just gotta make sure we on the same page
Cause this is ours it involves nobody else
Don't get me wrong we always use a little help
But honestly all we got is each other
And the fact is I'm the father and you're the mother

Been waiting on your call

It all went as it should

And mama said that there was only one thing she could get us
When God must have been with us
'Cause it is heavenly joy
When you wake up Christmas morning to every toy
Then there's the birth of my boy
Here to inherit the rhythm
And when I see it in him I ask myself what more can I give him?
And I would love to but I can't spend every moment with him
It's just those big ole eyes that encourage me to keep living
Hey, ooh when I'm singing I'm sharing
Or rhyming I'm shining my light
And although the love is so blinding I still end up finding my wife
All I can do is reminisce 'cause there eyes no rewinding my life
But the future's so bright that it's almost blinding my sight

It's like all a sudden your life is so cool
'Cause everything in it is working for you

I met this girl on Baltic Ave.
And you can tell how she steps on boardwalk,
She was from Park Place
I asked what she was doing on this side of town
She said she had some taxes to pay
I figure I'd take a chance and advance to go
And find out more about
Cause there more to know than the way she ways
And the way that she wears her clothes,
Or the way she plays this game (so cold)
She said she came up rough 
And one income was not enough
There'd be nights she'd go to sleep hungry
Cause her mom was always short on food and money
See people used to joke a lot
Tease her bout her clothes not being in style
Dressed in dingy skirts and dirty sneakers
From the finest second hand down Oriental Ave.

But now look at her
She got this game on lock
Anything she ever wanted now she got it
And I've gotta say
And I'm proud to see
That someone like her is in central
Womanopoly

Once she graduated junior high she started working overtime
Scrubbing floors or working on assembly lines
Just so she could help her mother out and
After college they moved into Marvin Gardens
And she got a job working at the city water department
To raise enough cash
In move into community chest condos on Pennsylvania Ave
She fell in love with this dude named ray
Who was a small time hustler from St. Charles place

And he was known for always bein' in and out of trouble
But the problem was that he was never on her level
She argued with her mom about ray's work
Til he was sent upstate on the same day that she gave birth
But see the baby never made it, it drove her nearly crazy
And she couldn't take it

[Chorus]

(Listen) see where she came from
Many people find it hard just to hang on
You often find them in the same place complaining
Instead of finding a better way of maintain
She could have balled up and cry
Wished that she would die
And just gave up on tryin'
Instead she grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom now she's on top and she's flying

That works so well for how we are

And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Musiq (Soulchild),"Its kinda funny how we met back
When you waked down the hall where I worked at
A caramel shorty with a fat ass
I spoke, you spoke and that's that
Now ain't it funny how fate play
Cause I saw you at the club down on Market Street
And hollered like what's up girl
You said nothing man, and you smiled and went on your way
Like you didn't even notice me
And really like you didn't even want to speak
But that's cool, cause now its almost like everyday
I'm going off the things you do things you say
It seems like our lives have been syndicated
But my minds bout the music, we can both make it
Who would have thought we'd go from a straight up ignore
To talkin' bout who wants more
Just let me tell

Baby baby baby (I want you)
Baby baby baby
Do you really want me girl (do you want me)
Do you really want me
Like I really want you

Check it out how it transpired
We went from a spark to a raging fire
Down like a car with 4 flat tires
She my superstar, I'd be the shine behind her (ya mean)
She got a nigga wide open
Shook like a tree when the wind is blowin'
She my Missy, im her Timbaland
She rock my planet like
Zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh zuh
My mans and them said get it in
But my plans have been to get it in
Cause I do that, never been a rude cat
I play fair so we go tic for tack till the blackness bares
First reaction was weird but it still was nice
So good that we did it twice
I'm saying in the beginning
She as scared but it still was nice
So good we did it twice
I'm telling you

Baby baby baby (I want you)
Baby baby baby
Do you really want me girl (do you want me)
Do you really want me
Like I really want you

All that I want and need is you",Infatueighties

Of a beautiful day
And like a song
An angel passed my way
She was the embodiment of perfection
With skin like the sky
And her hair was as long as time
Then she turned to me (yeah)
With her big proud eyes
Her voice flowed like water
And it brought a tear to my eye
And she said to me

So far from where you started

The times that I shared with you
And there's something that I figured out,
Darling you must have been heaven sent
There isn't nothing better than
Things that you say and do
No, so why do I feel I'm being played for a fool
Cause whenever you call on me I come through for you but
When I need you, you can't seem to do the same for me
And I love that you pay your phone no mind
When we're alone but sometimes
When I try to reach you
I wonder if your just busy, or you don't know that it's me

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)
Cause of all the wonderful things that you put me through (me through)
I know you love me baby
Cause I love you to
So tell me why is it I'm having doubts about you

Now everyday when you're around
You always cater to my needs like
You seemed to be concerned
If I'm eating or sleeping properly (yeah)
Its has to be the greatest thing to know
The one you love loves you back
Or is the love you have for me really true or is it just an act
Cause when you're hard at work and when I'm hard at work
And we can't talk
We just page each other with our sexual wishes
But when we're spending quality time and your pager rings
I wonder
Who could be when you answer laughing at your reply
Or is it that I'm just being suspicious

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)
Cause of all the wonderful things that you put me through (me through)
I know you love me baby
Cause I love you to
So tell me why is it I'm having doubts about you

Now maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic
For these matters of the heart and so
I hope we can grow to raise a family
Nourished in trust and happiness and love

Cause you love me don't ya
I know you (I know you do)
Cause of all the wonderful things that you put me through (me through)
I know you love me baby
Cause I love you to

Musiq (Soulchild),"I got a real good woman now
Someone between a lover and a friend
It feels good when she's around
'Cause she's so far from all the others that I've been with

'Cause I thought I knew what love was 
But it wasn't until she came and changed my life
And now I realize that

All the love in this world
I wanna give to this girl because she makes me wanna be a better man
And all the games I've played are in the past
Because I know this one's gonna last
It's crazy how she makes me wanna be a better man for her

When I look into her eyes, I see
So much in her that reminds me of myself in awe
She's so beautiful, body, soul, and mind; and I
Just wanna be the one to make her feel good in a special way

I'm a hug and kiss her
And tell her how much I miss her when she's gone
'Cause I know that I will never find another one like her at all

When it's said and done, you wanna
Be with someone who's gonna
Be there for you when all your chips are down
And no one's around, and when
No matter how hard it gets, she will always be by your side
To comfort you like only a woman does, and that's why...

But it's funny how they may not recognize it when it finally comes
(Think it's) think it's at the mall
(Or it's) or it's sippin' at the bar
All these dates and phone conversations - we doing it all for what
When you're Mrs. Right, it's always Mrs. Wrong (Mrs. Wrong)
But I never stop to notice you were there all along (yeah)
Girl, you're everything I could ever want and need
Now it's all clear to me, and that's why...

[Chorus]
Today, I've made up my mind
I'm gonna take this chance, bet my life on this
'Cause this precious love I've found in you
My yesterdays are gone, and tomorrow's never promised to no one
I finally decided, girl, that my today is you

Now that I'm about to put myself (self) out on a limb for love 
That means (no more) no more at
The club (tryin' to) pick something up
No more late night creepin', hollerin', trying to see what's good for the night
I wanna be the best man for you (so)
If I gotta change my ways, then, baby, I'll do
(Whatever) whatever I got to keep you here by my side
And starting with today...

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It took me a while (said, it kinda took me a while)
To realize just how much (how much you really)
Really mean to me, though what we have is so clear anyone can see
But I was just (tryna keep it on the low)
But I wasn't ready for love (I wasn't sure, but now I know)
Now I believe that you and I were meant to be, and that's why...

[Chorus]",Today
Musiq (Soulchild),"How can I even think, after you made a scene
You and me, good again, like nothing happened
Oh, and it's kinda hard to forget what you said when you left out that door, 
Said you don't love me no more,

And now you wanna (sit and talk)
But you don't really(wanna talk)
You just wanna see if you and the things like the way they used to
You wanted change so you just (walked out)
But your new love didn't (work out)
So, now you think you can just come back and you won (No!)

[Chorus]
I thought it was over, but you come back again
(Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back)
I thought it was over, but you come back again
(Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back)

Thought that I had it all figured out,
Had it all planned out far,
There was gonna be a happy ending,
But you chose to let go, don't you know,
Once you leave, there ain't no baby please,
Can we just go somewhere and be alone (and talk)
But I don't really (wanna talk)
Cause you just wanna see if you
Can get things like the way they used to,
You wanted change so you just (walked out)
But your new love didn't (work out)
So now you think you can just come back when you want
[Chorus]

It's nice to know that,
You been thinking about the love we once had,
But getting over you was hard,
Cause I thought, there was nothing left for us,
Now you say you having second thoughts

[Chorus: x2]",Back Again
Musiq (Soulchild),"This just might be the hardest thing I ever have to do
I never thought I'd see the day I'd be living without you
Now I cant even look you in the eyes
Cause I know what it does when I see you cry
And that's not what I wanna do

So hear is my Dear John
Don't waste your time
When you respond ill be gone
Before I change my mind
I'll just stop now and say goodbye

I realize all the promises I've made
To you through the years
And all the times you forgave me
Even when I caused you tears
But I just cant do it cant hurt you again
You might say that I'm less than a man
But this is what I need to do

[Chorus]
So here is my dear John
Don't waste your time
When you respond
Ill be long gone
Before I change my mind
Ill just stop now and say goodbye

[Bridge]
I know your probably reading this
Saying this ain't happening
Maybe one day we can start all over
We can try again
But right now I just gotta go
Not coming back until I'm sure
That I ain't gonna hurt you no more

Oh oh oh

[Chorus]

I'll just stop now and say goodbye girl
I'll just stop now and say good bye
Yeah Yeah Yeah
I'll just stop now and say goodbye
Yeah Yeah Yeah",Dear John
Musiq (Soulchild),"Who, tell who baby knows you better than I do
Said it out your own mouth
I ain't even got to say it
You ain't got to make an issue
I ain't trying to play the victim
I'm just trying to make this thing right

How could you think that I could ever be better without you
I mean, I could go a few months
But everyday girl I'd be missing you
For me to send you off to another dude
The thought of it is so depressing
You and I both know that we needs this that why

I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
So stop subscribing to those crazy thoughts
Cause there's no one who deserves you more
Who gave you love?
Don't change on me, don't change baby
I'll go half crazy if you choose to leave
That's why I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
Deserves you more

We don't often talk about it baby but we know it's true
It's true, that you were insecure once
Cause someone really did you dirty
But I encouraged you to make it through
Showed you special was apart of you
You did the same for me too

So girl I thank you and I'm so thankful
For the times where we rise and we fall
Nights when we laugh and we talk
Lt's not break up, lets be grateful
That the strain of our arguments only brought us closer spite of it all

I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
So stop subscribing to those crazy thoughts
Cause there's no one who deserves you more
Who gave you love?
Don't change on me, don't change baby
I'll go half crazy if you choose to leave
That's why I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
Deserves you more

We spend more time on our problems
Instead of trying to work them out to get better
However, lets turn this negative into a positive baby
You believe in you and I
I feel there's a need to try
If I don't fight, I'll regret it for the rest of my life

I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
So stop subscribing to those crazy thoughts
Cause there's no one who deserves you more
Who gave you love?
Don't change on me, don't change baby
I'll go half crazy if you choose to leave
That's why I'm explaining, what I'm fighting for
Girl, there's no one who deserves you more
Deserves you more",Deserve U More

You just don't know when to let up Baby
I think you're so arrogant, arrogant
That you think you're so much better baby
That I think It ain't healthy for me to judge you by your flaws and that's why I
Know I could criticize, but I put that aside

But I guess I didn't understand 
That (I thought I was making a living for us)

And that's why she's gone

What I should do to get her back cause I

Musiq (Soulchild),"I never wanted a woman that wanted
Me for my name or material things
See
I always hope for a woman that's so sure, emotionally secure
With spiritual faith
A woman that I can trust with all of my secrets
And even listen to all of my issues
A woman who never judge
Me or how I was
She deals with me strictly through love

Someone who will put up with the things
Loving me can bring
But still be there to see us through
Someone who would put up
With the strange and complicated things
Cause I would do the same for her too
Someone who I can be real with
Ain't gotta be perfect
Because loving one another is all that matters
It's not hard to explain
So believe me when I say
That I found all of that in you

All that I hope for a friendship that's so pure
A girl I can talk to bout whatever is on my heart
A woman that needs me
That trust and believes me
That wont take my kindness as some kind of weakness
A woman who bares her soul who is willing to let go
That wants me to lead her but knows how to take control
And when I am feeling down
Cause things are going wrong
She fills me up and makes me feel strong

Someone who will put up with the things
Loving me can bring
But still be there to see us through
Someone who would put up
With the strange and complicated things
Cause I would do the same for her too
Someone who I can be real with
Ain't gotta be perfect
Because loving one another is all that matters
It's not hard to explain
So believe me when I say
That I found all of that in you

You are that someone who loves me
Through all my imperfections
You know my heart is filled with nothing but good intentions
You are the one that told me
Long as we got us
Nothing matters
You are the one that sees the joy through the pain
You are my light through the rain
Here and now

It's you
You're my heart
It's you
Your that someone I can truly say that I'll never find another love like you",Someone

Thinking bout what we do
What do you mean to me?
What do I mean to you?

Felt the necessity
To be together girl
Except for it never works
You're like the rib I need
Something like Adam and Eve
I was meant for you
You were meant for me
How you feel 'bout me girl
Do I light up your world?
Cause you're the reason why
Loving is on my mind

Am I too fast or offensive?
But if you could please just pardon my inquiring mind cause I just know
You and me go good together
Me and you got something special
Chemistry don't get no better
You and me got something special

What do you do when you
Know that you're being pursued
Would you play innocent?
Would you just let me in?
Just let me show you more
Cause there's so much more in store
I was just wondering right
Why not go out tonight
Eat where the prices are high
Order whatever you like
Or we could take a ride
Or count the stars in the sky
Maybe just stay in the crib
Spend a whole day in the bed
Maybe I should start
By saying hello instead

Got far yet you're so (extraordinary you're)
One among second to none (girl it's just that serious)

And the seas talk back to you girl, I'll still be there, be there

I believe they'd dream the dream of the love between me and you
And even though we'll fight and may not get along sometimes
It's cool cause I know that if I fight with you and cry with you
I can make it up all night with you so

If love ever fades away
We'll still find some to make us

You got me wondering
Why is it I ain't getting through
Every time that we have an argument.
Always tryin' to win.

See you just start the drama
'Cause you think it makes us real
All that do is cause us problems
It only keeps me from showing you how I feel

So, do we have to fight all night (I just wanna love you)
I'll just agree
You're acting your right, alright
I just wanna love you (I just wanna be)
I just wanna be with the girl I fell in love with
I just wanna be with the girl I fell in love with
I just wanna be with my girl, If you let me I wanna be with you

All the questioning
Call or text me when ever, I don't respond any time that's good for you
All the guessing, all these questions all messing with
All of that love we used to make and all the things we used to do
Tell me why we got to suffer, because you can't just chill.
You're so worried about them others,
That you never really know how I feel.

So, do we have to fight all night (I just wanna love you)

I just wanna be with my girl (If you can't be her)

I just knew we would be that way forever babe (and I never)
But I guess I never saw it coming, when people change
I know you wanna fight for love, but being in love is hard enough

So, do we have to fight all night (I just wanna love you)
You're acting your right, alright
I just wanna love you (I just wanna be)

We did some things
Got some food and now I'm on my way to work
Got into my car started up drove off now I'm on the road that's when
I pulled up to this gas station and got into this conversation
With this girl, I could tell she wanted me but oh

We probably could have been something more

That I found my girl
And I know I love her so

And I sympathize cause every man she had was never any good

Like how I see me and her in my mind

Wasn't nothing you could tell
Family wasn't slowing down
Wasn't thinking about tomorrow
We was living for the now
We had time to chat a phantom bet
And you would settle but look at us now

It's who you are (be true to who you are)

I thought that we were so (close, how did we) get so far
It's only now, it's all (over, I see) what went wrong
I guess this is what it means when something ain't meant to be
We should just let it go
And I know you still wanna hold on
