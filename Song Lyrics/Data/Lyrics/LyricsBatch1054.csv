Nat King Cole,"I'm walkin' out the door with you on my mind
I'm walkin' out the door with you on my mind
But every step away from you, I feel like cryin'

I walked into the street, talkin' to myself
I walked into the street, talkin' to myself
No matter what my conscience says, I'm thinkin' 'bout nobody else

I met a brand new chick, phone to make a date
I met a brand new chick, phone to make a date
But when her I rang her number up but I got your number by mistake

You say you love me, baby, don't know what to do
You say you love me, baby, don't know what to do
I'm sure of one thing, I'm in love with you",Walkin'
Nat King Cole,"(irving berlin)


What'll I do when you
Are far away
And I'm so blue,
What'll I do?


What'll I do when I
Am wondering who
Is kissing you,
What'll I do?


What'll I do with just
A photograph
To tell my troubles to?


When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true,
What'll I do?


~interlude~


When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true,
What'll I do?

Nat King Cole,"I still see Elisa
She keeps on returning
As breathless, young as ever

I still see Elisa
And still feel the yearning
To hold her against me again

Her heart was made of holidays
Her smile was made of dawn
Her laughter was an April song
That echoes on and on

Since I saw Elisa
The shadows are falling
And winter is calling above
But I still see Elisa

Whenever I dream of love",I Still See Elisa
Nat King Cole,"I've been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you
And at the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Baby but what good dose it do
I've been consulted by Franklin D.
Even Gabel had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
But what good does it do

Even Basic had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you",I Can't Get Started
Nat King Cole,"Any old time, you want to come back home
Drop me a line, and say no more you'll roam
You had your chance to play the game fair
When you left me, sweetheart
You only left a load of care

Now that you're down
I'm going to stick by you
If you will only say
Your roamin' days are through

Well, now, you'll find me here
Like the day you left me alone
Any old time
You want to come back home",Any Old Time
Nat King Cole,"Come, oh, songs! come, oh, dreams! 
Soft the gates of day close, 
Sleep, my birds, sleep, streams! 
Sleep, my wild rose! 

Pool and bud, hill and deep, 
You who wore my robes, sleep! 
Droop, East! die, West! 
Let my land rest. 

Woods, I woke your boughs! 
Hills, I woke your elf-throngs! 
Land, All thy hopes and woes 
Rang from me in songs! 

Come, oh, songs! come, oh,dreams!
In our house is deep rest, 
Through the pines gleams, gleams, 
Bright the gold West, 

There the flutes shall cry, 
There the viols weep, 
Laugh, my dreams, and sigh! 
Sing, and vigil keep, 
Awake, wild rose.",To a Wild Rose
Nat King Cole,"A Cradle In Bethlehem 

Sing sweet and low your lullaby
till angels say, ""Amen.""
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem
while wise men follow through the dark a star that beckons them.
A mother tonight is rocking a cradle in Bethlehem.
""A little child shall lead them,"" the prophets said of old.
In storm and tempest keep 'em until the bells is tolled.

Nat King Cole,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! 

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Born is the King of Israel!",The First Noel

Nat King Cole,"I've found a way a way to make you smile
I've found a way
A way to make you smile
I read bad poetry
Into your machine.
I save your messages
Just to hear your voice.
You always listen carefully
To awkward rhymes.
You always say your name,
Like I wouldn't know it's you,
At your most beautiful.
I've found a way a way to make you smile
I've found a way
A way to make you smile
At my most beautiful
I count your eyelashes, secretly.
With everyone whisper I love you.

Nat King Cole,"I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love!
I've got a song that I sing

I can make the rain go, anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go

Nat King Cole,"The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart!
How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart!
There's a line between love and fascination,
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they give the very same sensation.
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!
But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start.
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart,
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart!",My Foolish Heart

You're acting so strange
Hey! Jealous lover
What is making you change

Hey! Jealous lover 
How wrong can you be
I'm yours ever faithful
Just be faithful to me

I am just as steady, as that clock on the shelf
Maybe you're accusing me of, what you're doing yourself

Hey! Jealous lover
I'm telling you true
I know that you're jealous 
But there's no one but you

Could have cheated lots of times, but just couldn't do
I was much to busy baby, being faithful to you

One who'd love to raise my chillun, namely me. 
Comin' home when the work is over at the close of day. 
I'd be with you all the way, to love, honor, and obey. 

'Cause you deserve two arms to hold you, namely mine. 
There to comfort and enfold you, Rain or shine. 
I deserve someone sweet and tender, bashful and shy and true. 
And I know just the one who'll do, namely you.

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you.

Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood

My first and last love
We'll make this love last forever

We'll prove a love as
Young as spring keeps growing
Even though the chill
November winds keep blowing

On blueberry hill when I found you

Were never to be

Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill",Blueberry Hill
Nat King Cole,"Old Man Sunshine, listen, you,
Never tell me dreams come true,
Just try it, and I'll start a riot,
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare,
Ever tell me she will care,
I'm certain, It's the final curtain.

Don't want to hear from and cheerful Pollyannas,
Who tell me love will find a way, it's all bananas.

They're writing songs of love, but not for me,
A lucky star's above, but not for me,
With love to lead the way,
I found more clouds of gray,
Than any Russian play could guarantee.

I was a fool to fall, and get that way,
Hi ho! Alas! And also Lack a day!
Although I can't dismiss,
The memory of her kiss,
I guess she's not for me.

It all began so well, but what an end,
This is the time a fella needs a friend,
When every happy plot,
Ends in a marriage knot,
And there's no knot for me.",But Not for Me
Nat King Cole,"Hear me, why you keep fooling
Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Now, maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets,
Now, you know, my little coquette, I love you.",Coquette
Nat King Cole,"Lovers depend on moonlight for a love affair
Babies depend on mothers for their tender care
Flowers depend on sunshine, and the morning dew

I can be good, I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you

I can save money, or spend it
Go right on living, or end it
You're to blame, baby, for what I do
I know that I can be beggar, I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

Isn't it sweet to know, dear, you can help me on?
Wouldn't it hurt, to know, dear, all my hopes were gone?
Wouldn't it make you proud, dear, if I made a name?
But if I failed to win, dear, would you want all the blame?",It All Depends on You

You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable

Are you smart?

Nat King Cole,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best
Instead of getting 'em off my chest
To let 'em rest unexpressed
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are

You're the top
You're the Coliseum

You're a Bendel bonnet

You're the Tower of Pisa
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, you're the top

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, babe, you shine
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add

You're the top
You're Mahatma Gandhi
You're the top
You're Napoleon Brandy

You're cellophane
You're sublime
You're turkey dinner

You're the top

You're the top
You're an arrow collar

You're an O'Neill drama
You're Whistler's mama
You're Camembert
You're a rose
You're Inferno's Dante
You're the nose 
On the great Durante
I'm just in a way

Simply too, too, too divine
You're a Botticelli
You're Keats
You're Shelly

You're Oval-tine
You're a boom

On the sleepy Zuider Zee
You're an old Dutch master

You're Lady Astor
You're broccoli
You're romance
You're the steppes of Russia

Nat King Cole,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Folks are crooning songs soft and low,
Needn't tell me so, because I know,

When the twilight brings the evening breeze,
It's sleepy time down south.

Splashing the night away,
Hear those banjos ringin', the folks are all a-singin',

I committed crime, Lord, I needed
Crime of being hungry and poor
I left the grocery store man bleeding
When they caught me robbing his store

On chain-gang you gonna go
I heard the judge say five years labor
I heard my old man scream ""Lordy, no!""

Gonna break this chain off to run
Gonna lay down somewhere shady

Owls go by and they give me the eye

And snuggles her head on my chest
We start in to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest

After I kinda straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
Once kiss then I continue again
Walkin' my baby back home

She's afraid of the dark so I have to park
Outside of her door till it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
I dry her tears all through the night

Right from her doorway we roam
Eats and then it's a pleasure again

Nat King Cole,"Who has trouble? Who has woe? I have
Who bought trouble? Who brought woe? You did
Friends don't want me around anymore
'Cause I'm not the guy I was before

Once I didn't have a kid
And no despair ever came to me
Now I'm blue and the trouble with me is you

Yes, I know I was alone and on my own
Still my heart was green and blue
And the trouble with me is you

You took a heart, took it apart
You took a dream, threw out the scene
You took a fool, acted so cruel
You took the sun away, leavin' me a cloudy day

But I don't suppose you care
Our love affair wasn't meant to be
So I'm blue and the trouble with me is you

You took a heart, took it apart
You took a dream, threw out the scene
You took a fool, acted so cruel
You took the sun away, leavin' me a cloudy day

But I don't suppose you care
Our love affair wasn't meant to be
So I'm blue and the trouble with me is you

Once I had a man and he was right for me
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
That you couldn't help but care
When he looked at you
He called me baby
Baby all the time

He said, ""Baby can't you see?""
""Baby understand?""
""Baby you're for me""
""Oh won't you take my hand?""
But I push him away
Wouldn't let him near
Pushed him far away
And now I'm wishing I could hear him
Call me baby, baby all the time

It's so lonely through the day
Lonely through the night
Lonely, lonely hours without that

Keep him close to you so he'll come back to me
And call me baby, baby all the time

You cannot keep it long, it seems.

For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.
Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.

Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,
Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.

And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.
Are the apple trees, sunlit memories, where the hammock swung,
On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young.","(Ah, the Apple Trees) When the World Was Young"

Nat King Cole,"You can take the moon, gather up the stars
And the robins that sing merrily
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

You can take the flowers, down in lovers lane
And that sentimental poetry
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

Not for me, all that stuff
The dreams that ruin your sleep
Not for me, had enough
Love is one thing you can keep

You can take the plans and the wedding bells
And whoever sings, ""Oh, promise me""
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea
'Cause love and I we don't agree

Hansoms through the park, kisses in the dark
All the promises made faithfully
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

And you won't go wrong if you take a song
Sung by Frankie Boy or Mr. C
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

Not for me, all that stuff
Not for me, had enough

You know what to do with good old tea for two
And the girl for you, the boy for me

Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

Nat King Cole,"I feel so smoochie
When I hold your hand and look in your eye.
I feel so smoochie
When I touch your lips, then I realize
That to hold you near
Make rainbows appear,
And life is just one long kiss,
While the moon look down
And the stars kind of frown,
And say, ""Golly, look what we miss!"".

I feel so smoochie,
When the night is cool it's always warm here with you.
I feel so smoochie,
And a seat for one becomes a love seat for two!
And I know my career
Starts and ends right here,
Right in your lovin' arms!
Smoochie little girl me,
Smoochie old gal to you!

I feel so smoochie
When you hold me tight and muss up my hair.
I feel so smoochie,
A romantic song becomes our love affair,
And a ride in our jeep
While the kiddie's asleep
Ends with parking at some dark kerb,
Then a sleepy old bird
Whispers 'round the word,
And says, ""Quiet!  Please don't disturb!"".

I feel so smoochie
When I dream all day of lovin' you at night.
I feel so smoochie,
Both my feet are wrong but I feel so right!
Then I know my career
Starts and ends right here,
Right in your lovin' arms!
Smoochie little girl me,
Smoochie old gal to you!",I Feel So Smoochie

모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어

아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼

Just a penny's worth of
Happiness (happiness)?

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?

Nat King Cole,"We're gonna have a supper
We'll eat some food that's rare

We'll laugh and talk and eat
But we'll save the bones for Henry Jones

Buy up a lotta fish

He don't need a napkin

It really was a bake

Then finished off with steak

Brother Henry just kept his seat

Right down to demitasse
From soup to lox and bagels
And pheasant under glass ' class!

Along the avenue
Our hearts were carefree and gay
How could I know I'd lose you
Somewhere along the way?

The friends we used to know
Would always smile ""Hello""
No love like our love they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way

But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

That some day soon I'll find you

Caressed the trees, tenderly
The trembling trees
Embraced the breeze, tenderly

Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

The shore was kissed
By sea and mist, tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met, breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love so tenderly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love so tenderly
You took my lips
You took my love so tenderly

Or I'll never fall
In love

Nat King Cole,"I used to visit all the very gay places 
Those come what may places 
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life 
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces 
With distant gay traces 
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away 
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren of song 
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness 
Of a great love for me

Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong 

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A thoughtful of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will 
While yet you are still burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive

And there I'll be, while I rot 
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too",Lush Life
Nat King Cole,"I search for phrases
To sing your praises
But there aren't any magic adjectives

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean, they just aren't swell enough

And if I have proved to you everything I say is true

My mother will start to worry (beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (listen to the fireplace roar)

So really I'd better scurry (beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (baby, it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (no cabs to be had out there)

I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)

I ought to say, no, no, no sir (mind if I move in closer?)

My brother will be there at the door (waves upon the tropical shore)

My maiden aunts mind is vicious (gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before)

I've gotta get home(but baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat(it's up to your knees out there)

You've really been grand (i thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (how can you do this thing to me?)

And candle lights on little corner tables,

The ile-de-france with all the gulls around it,
The beauty that is springs...

Nat King Cole,"I walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams

You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered schemes
And gigolo and gigolette, wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams.

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town

The joy you find here, you borrow
You cannot keep it long, it seems
But gigolo and gigolette still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down

Let there be cuckoos, a lark and a dove

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation 
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside the garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

The memory of love's refrain",Stardust [DVD]

Carefree and romancing
Happy with my someone new

Having such a gay time
They don't know what I go through

I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry

Nat King Cole,"Con este tango que es burlon why compadrito
Se ato dos alas la ambision de mi suburbio
Con este tango nacio el cielo why con un grito
Salio del sordido barrial buscando el cielo
Conjuro extraño de un amor hecho carencia
Que abrio caminos sin mas ley que su esperanza
Mesclas de rabia, de dolor, de fe, de ausencia
Llorando en la inocencia de un ritmo jugueton
Por tu milagro de notas agoreras
Nacieron sin pensarlo las paicas why las grelas
Luna en los charcos, canyengue en las caderas
Why un ansia fiera en la manera de querer
Al evocarte, tango querido
Siento que tiembran las baldosas de un bailongo
Why oigo el resongo de mi pasado
Hoy que no tengo
Mas que a mi madre
Siento que llega en punta e' pie para besarme
Cuando tu canto nace al son de un bandoneon....

Sometimes they would catch something, then again they didn't

In their homes and they would know that
Joe Turner had been there and left food for them

And they would start cryin' and singin' this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone

And stuff to make a fire
And they would look in their yards, and they would find axes, wood

If I find peace of mind in the sand and the sea
There's a hope in my heart that you'll soon be with me
There's a prayer that I share with the sand and the sea
And it cries ""come to me, come to me.""

As my eyes search the skies from the edge of the shore
You are here in my arms for a moment or more
Then a tear rushes down to the sand and the sea
And it cries ""come to me, come to me.""

But as long as there's sand, as long as there's sea
As long as there's time I'll wait hopefully
As long as there's heaven up above
Let the sand and the sea bring my love to me

But as long as there's sand, as long as there's sea
As long as there's time I'll wait hopefully
As long as there's heaven up above
Let the sand and the sea bring my love to me

Something's wrong with you I fear
It's getting harder to please you
Harder and harder each year
I don't want to make you blue

Here's what's wrong with you

After you get what you want, you don't want it
If I gave you the moon, you'd grow tired of it soon

You want what you want when you want it

With what you want, you're discontented

You're always wishing and wanting for something
When you get what you want
You don't want what you get

And tho' I sit upon your knee
You'll grow tired of me
'Cause after you get what you want
You don't want what you wanted at all

Don't you say that I'm unkind
Think it over and you'll find
You've got a changeable nature
You're always changing your mind
There's a longing in your eye
That is hard to satisfy
You're unhappy most of the time

Owls go by and they give me the eye

And snuggles her head on my chest
We start in to pet and that's when I get

She has to borrow my comb
Once kiss then I continue again

Outside of her door till it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry

Me feet hurt from shoes.

Need a natty dred to be the new care taker, lord!

These Yankee girl give me big scare,
Is black de root, is blond de hair.
Her eyelash false, her face is paint,
And pads are where de girl she ain't!

She jitterbugs when she should waltz,
I even think her name is false.
But calypso girl is good a lot,

Nat King Cole,"This is a song was sung back in 18 and 92
There was a terrible flood that year
People lost everything they had

Their crops, their live stock
That means their horses, their mules, cows
Goats and everything they had on their farm

And they would start cryin' and singin' this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe turner been here and gone

Then they would go out hunting rabbits, 'coons and 'possoms
Anything they could catch
Sometimes they would catch something, then again they didn't

And when they would come home, they would find
Flour meat and molasses
In their homes and they would know that
Joe Turner had been there and left food for them

And they would start cryin' and singin' this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, that Joe turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone

Then they would start out lookin' for wood
And stuff to make a fire
And they would look in their yards, and they would find axes, wood
That Joe Turner had brought there for them

Then they would get happy
And start singin' and cryin' this song
They would get happy and do a little boogie-woogie too",Joe Turner Blues
Nat King Cole,"Folks I've just been down, down to Memphis town, 
That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
Hospitality, they were good to me.
I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.

I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear, 
They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
Oh yes, them Blues.

They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
And folks he sure do pull some bow.
And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.

Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.

Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray, 
I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
That blue refrain.

There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
Oh play them Blues.
That melancholy strain, that ever haunting refrain
Is like a sweet old sorrow song.
Here comes the very part that wraps a spell around my heart.
It sets me wild to hear that loving tune a gain,

Then on to Paris

I found I couldn`t leave my memories behind.

Tried seeing Singapore, 
But that wouldn`t do.
Went to Vienna, 
But I found you there, too.
Even in Switzerland, your memory came through.
Where can I go without you?

I wanted travel, I wanted romance,
I chased that rainbow across the sea.
I`m tired of faces, and quaint old places
If you can`t be there with me.

Back on the boat again 
And farewell to France,
Farewell to Londontown, 
They haven`t a chance.
I`ll trade the sights I`ve seen
For just one loving glance.

Help to make the season bright,
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow,
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh,
And ev'ry mother's child is gonna spy,
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two,
Although it's been said
Many times, Many ways

Nat Simpkins,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Nat Simpkins,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way

Nat Simpkins,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Nat Simpkins,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

Nat Simpkins,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Nat Simpkins,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polkadots and Moonbeams
Nat Stuckey,"She looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles
That weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way?

She picks up her apron in little girl-fashion
As something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age

She closes her eyes and
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

I didn't have a dime for coffee or to call me up someone to talk me to
And then I read a wanted ad that said I need the gardener right away
So I rushed down the five or nine the little pink house was mighty fine
I ran all the way
I remember knocking twice and waiting for the moment till she came
And then I saw a rose in her the kind of rose that you can throw in summer rain
She smiled that little smile she has and asked me if I could start right away
And that was ten short years ago
Neither of us could have known that I'd come to stay
Now I'm the gardener for her roses I love and care for her tender roses
Now I'm the gardener for her roses that bloom today out where our children play
[ choir ]
I can still remember when a park bench was the only home I had
And it's much better being here she can call me dear and children call me dad
She smiles that little smile because I just repair the scream door that was bad
And all around I see white roses looking back at me oh how I could be sad
Yes I'm the gardener for her roses I fix the scream door now it closes
And opens quite like right red roses that bloom today out where our children play

Then it went on to say if I didn't act right they could dig up a little bit more

I keep lookin' for the words to best explain the way I feel
I know you will agree with me this feeling that we have's not real
But you look at me and cry Lord I hate to say goodbye so I keep lookin' for a way
For there's so much love between our hearts
Maybe we can find the way to start lovin' again
Maybe there's a piece of love
That somewhere in the shadows and we could make it live again
So now I'm lookin' for a way to bring back our all yesterdays
And the sunshine in our lives when everything for you and me was right

Natacha Atlas,"(James Brown sample) ""This is a Man's World!""

Verse 1:
Lies and rumors, money and hoes
it's the World that I'm attached to, the World that I know
influential, never stable in the mental
but clever, spittin' that same shit niggas is into
I'll bleed for the craft if I have to, think rational
lovin' money and weed, pussy and fast food
tatoo a dead Man's name on my arm
I'm a thug in the street that's still afraid of his Moms
everyday I watch a player get robbed, player get popped
I try to drink the pain away and pray that it stops
in the mornin' head straight to the spot, the juice bar
niggas tried all that other shit and what's the use God?
for the paper Nature takes it too far, perfectionist
rep the bridge, where everything's foul except the kids
we get it on, and contradict livin' long
though the clock will still tic when you gone.

Chorus
(This is a Man's World!)
Now if you a Man be a Man (you need a plan)
if you fall (I'ma put you on your feet again)
when you starve (I'ma show you how to eat again)
and through it all (I'll show you how to be a friend)
now when you in charge be in charge (you need a squad)
if you bored (I'ma show you how to be involved)
I give 'em more (niggas know they can't see the God)
I can't believe it God (I gotta eat or starve)

Verse 2:
Keep the livest image, high percentage
Four in the mornin', 
niggas blitzin' on corners like the line of scrimmage
convicts turnin' confident
enter the phase of niggas and they feminine ways
love my Timberlands, cinnamon suede
bottles mo' proof
for all the problems that a nigga go through
it's forever real 
'cause some scars can never heal
I'd rather throw the cards in and pray I get a better deal
guns excite me, keep atleast a hundred Wifey's
my duns up in the pens ya'll need to write me
street cadets, alias names and re-arrests
it doesn't take much to know that wrieffer helps relieve the stress
we make moves or get caught for the loot
wild niggas on the block look for more to recruit
gettin' chips from an alternate route 
but the same breed
It's been Twenty-somethin' years now,
I'm still lookin' for the same dream.

Chorus

Verse 3:
In my World police recognize names
know us niggas by the walk or the size of their chain
you know the motto
we live for today, there's no tomorrow
we're only makin' time for the hoes that swallow
fuck a role model, I need therapy
seven nights out the week I jump out my sleep breathin' heavily
keep my head up, only the strong survive
livin' in a Man's World, still belongs to a tribe
took the family along for the ride
watch 'em eat
now I'm movin' with the same cats that'll rock me to sleep
never close your eyes, learn to roll with the wise
'cause some niggas 'll talk shit and play close to the sides
while I call the shots 
and stay supportin' the block
we livin' above the law until all of it stops
I still open doors, a thug nigga overall
and if you ain't know then black Man go for yours.

Chorus 'till fade...",Man's World
Natacha Atlas,"This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a women or a girl

You see, man made the car
To take us over the road
Man made the train 
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electrolight
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat full of water
Like Noah made the arc

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a women or a girl

Man thinks about little bit of baby girls and a baby boys
Man make them happy
Cos man make them toys
And after man make everything
Everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Not one little thing
Without a women or a girl

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness",(It's a Man's Man's) Man's World
Natacha Atlas,"You only live twice, or so it seems
One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice",You Only Live Twice
Natali Rene,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Me arrancaste la vida

Eso no impide que este amor sea eterno
Que sin hablar digamos tantas cosas

Movie star hair and that black eye,
I can’t even notice it when you smile so hard through a heart felt lie,
Go kiss the liquor off his laugh,
Another suitcase full of cash,
Shiny apologies in a velvet box,
What a real good man.

We drive brand new cars and we light fine cigars,
We shine like small town stars through the best days of our lives,

We will walk right down the pavement,
I know we’re gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.

Another fist, another wall,
We lose ourselves we lose it all,
I wrote him a hundred times,
Can you hear my heart through the prison bars?
The boys I kiss don’t know my name,
The tears I cry all taste of blame,
Bad luck and dirty cops,
I’m a fucking teenage tragedy,

I walk lonely streets and I talk big time dreams,
So hold on before you see that you’re better off without me,

Cause when I look up from the pavement,
I know I’m gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.

There’s a rainbow on the bathroom door again,
Where the lipstick slides and the pearls all fly oh.
I’m gone and I ain’t coming back this time,
I’m gonna find my home underneath the city lights oh.

Pills fall like diamonds from my purse,
Right out the hole in my fur coat,
Straight down the gutter goes my antidote to a broken girl,
I promise I’ll be the one you want,
Don’t tell me I’m unfixable,
You don’t know what it’s like to be seventeen with no place to go,

But give me just one night and I’ll be almost fine,
Remind me one more time it’s the best days of my life,

Yesterday you where in front of me,
Woke up this morning,
All of a sudden you're a memory.
Oh, if life is as short as they say it is, 
I guess we'll meet again sooner than we think we will.

I thought if I looked around you'd always be there,
And before I fall you'd pick me up and tell me keep believing.
My heart stopped beating soon as you stopped breathing,
I got on my knees and I don't care who sees me,
Heaven's gotta wait because I need you.

They say a picture says a thousand words,
But I would trade a thousand pictures to hear one of yours.
I'm not done saying prayers, 
Like I was writing your letters,
'Cause if heaven's far like I think it is,
You wouldn't get 'em.
So yeah, so this is just making it harder,
I can't just call you up and laugh with you, 
The way we used to.
Oh, this world isn't good enough, 
It don't deserve you.
'Cause you was an angel all along,
And now God returned you. 

And heaven must be beautiful right now,

'Cause they got you babe.

'Cause they got you baby.

They say that god is full of mysteries,
Sometimes I wonder if you tell him that you're missing me.
'Cause I miss you everyday,
Like they took someone away,
Like they took color away and it's grey,
Needs to get the hell away from me.

So much life loss, unnecessary, 
Street wars, world war,
Earth is only temporary.
Anger's only momentary.
Words replaces by weaponry,
We need to save the humans,
Save the future,
Stop our history becoming.

And I'm sorry.
Did I take you for granted?
But did I ever thank you?
I meant to every day.
Please don't say it's too late to pay homage.
Never called yourself a hero,
But you never disappointed me.

You think you're so in control, 
But boy we don't even know what's coming round.
I should be counting down my blessings,
Like I'm counting down seconds.
'Cause I can only say goodbye for now, for now.

I know heaven must be beautiful right now,

'Cause they got you babe. 
I know heaven must be beautiful right now,

I want to love you through the night, we'll be a sweet disaster

Lick me down like you were

'Cause I got nowhere, no one, without you boy I'm done

When everyone that holds my hand
Gets cut from all the thorns
I used to put my ear against the wall
To hear the screams, to hear the fall
More reasons to escape it all

And it's not the answer but I can't carry on
I give my best smile, my last dime
But I'm always getting wrong
It's not 'cause I'm young or from a broken home

And I lie here on the bedroom floor
Where your feet walked out and your daggers fall
And I, I get a little bit better

Say you'll forget me
Say you'll erase me from your mind
Right from the day of our doomed beauty
I saw my future in your eyes
Save the words you've rehearsed
We both know I won't be fine
You know the fate don't take my bribes
And I only want what's never mine
So you break the door, you break my heart
You ruined me again

And loaded guns

When love is made so renegade
You know you're going down in flames
And if our hearts must share a grave
At least can we be friends
You shoot your words,
They knock me down
Like rubber bullets raining out...
They bounce right off and I got up again
But if no one understands me
At least you could pretend
I never knew when love was true
But I know it's the end

But I'll be here 'til chaos calls
And God ain't listening anymore

And I'll stay here
To defy our fears

And it's 5 am, got your curtains drawn,
Been 25 times that I called…
But, I know that you love me.
Now I'm all dressed up and I know that you're here
Boy it's just a little rain, no these ain't no tears
Every moment passed is a thousand years
Since you loved me…

And out of all the stupid boys I knew
I had to fall for you
And out of all the pretty lies you told
Can't one of them be true?

When you wake up, I'll still believe you're mine…
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you
Sleep all night with a stranger on my side…
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you.
No no no, this was not the plan,
If I can't have you then no one can.
When you wake up, I'll still be here outside
Oooh oooh, I'm watching you.

Happy Hour ain't so happy when you got no friends
And who knew I'd find an angel at the gates of Hell?
Your glass was always empty, but your bed was full
When you loved me…
You gave me back my key, but you still have my heart
Are all the dreams of you and me in broken frames in your garbage?
The other guys with their honest eyes
Just can't love me…

Natalia Kills,"Momma you’re beautiful tonight,
Movie star hair and that black eye,
I can’t even notice it when you smile so hard through a heart felt lie,
Go kiss the liquor off his laugh,
Another suitcase full of cash,
Shiny apologies in a velvet box,
What a real good man.

We drive brand new cars and we light fine cigars,
We shine like small town stars through the best days of our lives,

We will walk right down the pavement,
I know we’re gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.

Another fist, another wall,
We lose ourselves we lose it all,
I wrote him a hundred times,
Can you hear my heart through the prison bars?
The boys I kiss don’t know my name,
The tears I cry all taste of blame,
Bad luck and dirty cops,
I’m a fucking teenage tragedy,

I walk lonely streets and I talk big time dreams,
So hold on before you see that you’re better off without me,

Cause when I look up from the pavement,
I know I’m gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh.

There’s a rainbow on the bathroom door again,
Where the lipstick slides and the pearls all fly oh.
I’m gone and I ain’t coming back this time,
I’m gonna find my home underneath the city lights oh.

Pills fall like diamonds from my purse,
Right out the hole in my fur coat,
Straight down the gutter goes my antidote to a broken girl,
I promise I’ll be the one you want,
Don’t tell me I’m unfixable,
You don’t know what it’s like to be seventeen with no place to go,

But give me just one night and I’ll be almost fine,
Remind me one more time it’s the best days of my life,

Cause when I look up from the pavement,
I know I'm gonna be just fine,
And I’ll put on my dancing shoes real tight,
‘Cause it’s just another Saturday night

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night,
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
Cause it's just another Saturday night,

No quiero levantarme

En la calle 
Y los niños juegan con burbujas 
De repente 
Se desaparecen 
Y mi corazón se pone débil 
Por tu culpa

De lo profundo del corazón
En la noche sigo encendiendo sueños
Para limpiar con el humo sagrado cada recuerdo

En la arena blanca con fondo azul
Cuando mire el cielo en la forma cruel de una nube gris
Aparezcas tú
Una tarde suba una alta loma
Mire el pasado
Sabrás que no te he olvidado

Y por más que crezca, vas a estar aquí
Aunque yo me oculte tras la montaña
Y encuentre un campo lleno de caña
No habrá manera, mi rayo de luna
Que tú te vayas

Y cada segundo de incertidumbre
Cada momento de no saber
Son la clave exacta de este tejido
Que ando cargando bajo la piel

Natalia Lafourcade,"Esta historia termino, no existe
Lo que un día construimos se ha esfumado
Pareciera que es más fácil dejarnos
Pero eres un fantasma conmigo caminando

No creas que no valió la pena
No creas que no eres importante
Al contrario, yo te ame con toda el alma

No creas que no valió la pena
No creas que lo perdimos
Ésto que nos duele, aunque nos duele es sólo nuestro

Lo que construimos se acabó
Fue sólo nuestro

Lo que construimos se acabó
Se lo lleva el viento

Esta historia termino, no existe
Lo que un día construimos se ha esfumado
Pareciera que es más fácil dejarnos
Pero eres un fantasma conmigo caminando

Yo no aprendí a dejarte ir

Natalia Lafourcade,"Hoy dejo entrar el sol por la ventana
Y me pierdo en tu mirada de amanecer
Hoy dejo que mi cuerpo se despierte
Lo llevo, lo traigo, lo muevo y lo dejo ser
Hoy dejo que mis manos te conozcan
Que mi alma se escape de noche para ir por ti
Hoy dejo que mi mente se detenga
Direcciones mi corazón para correr a ti
Tu me haces sentir bien

Es un baile incontrolable
Es absurdo intentar
Comprender lo que siento
Solo se que es honesto

Es increíble que lo que es así de fácil vivir solo
Es que no requiere de esfuerzos
Para endulzar los momentos
Es increíble que si no es te pone triste
Pero no lo es solo consume tu tiempo
Te va apagando por dentro
Tu me haces sentir bien
En un mar tan misterioso
Es absurdo intentar comprender lo que siento

Solo se que es honesto
Eres mi lugar favorito en este mundo
Tu me llevas tan lejos
Eres mi lugar favorito en este mundo
Porque matas mis miedos
Y ya no tengo miedo

Que ahora son secretos

Natalia Lafourcade,"Cuando amanece saludo al sol
Saludo al tiempo y saludo al viento
Tengo que aceptar donde camino
Y no recordar que te encuentras lejos

Respiro hondo, respiro profundo
De un clavado al agua me limpio los restos
Que mi piel recuerda de ti

Cuando amanece saludo al sol
Saludo al campo y me voy corriendo
Tengo que ser fuerte aunque no den mis piernas
Caminar sin miedo en la maleza que hay

Respiro hondo, respiro profundo
Canto para limpiar en mi alma
Aquello que de ti ando cargando en mi espalda
Ando cargando en mi espalda

No más llorar
Sé que ya lo nuestro no tiene remedio
Pero no más llorar

No más llorar
Sé que ya lo nuestro no tiene remedio
Pero no más llorar

Cuanta libertad que miro
En las aves que amanecen
En sus cantos sus sonidos
Cómo alegran mis oídos

Escucho una orquesta de hojas en el cielo
Aplausos de piedras en el suelo
Y miro la tarde que me saluda
En mi luto de amor y nacimiento de luna

No más llorar
Sé que ya lo nuestro no tiene remedio
Pero no más llorar

No más llorar

Porque siempre quiero más de ti
Yo quisiera hacerte más feliz
Hoy mañana siempre hasta el fin
Mi corazón estalla por tu amor
Y tú qué crees que esto es muy normal
Acostumbrado estas tanto al amor
Que no lo ves, yo nunca he estado así
Si de casualidad
Me ves llorando un poco
Es porque yo te quiero a ti

Y tú te vas, jugando a enamorar
Todas las ilusiones vagabundas que se dejan alcanzar
Y no verás, que lo que yo te ofrezco
Es algo incondicional

Y tú te vas, jugando a enamorar
Te enredas por las noches entre historias que nunca tienen final
Te perderás, dentro de mis recuerdos
Por haberme hecho llorar

Aunque me haces mal te quiero aquí

Que nunca se acabe nada de lo nuestro

Te pido que no se mueran las rosas y los suspiros
Que trajes y la elegancia sea siempre de vida un rito
Que el oro que voy cargando no mate ningún zumbido
Que eso que ando persiguiendo no apague de mi un sentido

Que el fuego que hay en su aliento no dejen mi fe un momento
Que el suelo que siempre tiembla renueve un sueño dormido
Que aquel que al seguir buscando, despierte un amor cantando

¿Para qué ser fríos si el mundo nos hace sentir en casa?
¿Para qué dejar que todo muera?
Si aquello entre tú y yo nos hizo ver tan bello todo

Nunca imaginé que me casaría sin papeles
Nunca imaginé que después de un tiempo acabaría sin paredes
La casa que vimos nacer, los peces que dijeron adiós
Las noches llenas de comer, grabando esas canciones hasta el amanecer

¿Para qué sufrir si no hace falta?
¿Para qué tirar nuestras cartas y fotografías?
¿Para qué olvidar que antes de todos nuestros besos?
Fuimos como hermanos, fuimos como amigos con derechos

Nunca imagine que me casaría sin papeles
Nunca supe cómo hacer que fueras más feliz, te lo juro
Tenías que buscarte tú, tenía que salvarme yo
Teníamos que dejarlo ser e invento esta canción en el atardecer

Dueños de la noche fuimos
Dueños sin saber cómo nos perdimos
Cómo dividimos lazos sin saber por qué
Dueños de la noche fuimos, la quisimos bien
Todo se lo dimos como lo vivimos
Fuimos locos sin poder volver
Locos sin poder volver

Te extraño en las tardes

Y tú no puedes
Este amor es enloquecer
Te quiero ver y tú no puedes

Tú crees que eres fácil (yo creo que soy fácil)
Y yo me pregunto (y tú te preguntas)
¿Cómo fue posible enamorarme en tan pocos segundos?
Siempre que estoy lejos (siempre que estás lejos)

Un aroma de alegría
En las olas se acobija
Toda su melancolía

Paso a paso y despacito
Llévame hasta donde quieras
Que yo tengo tanta historia
Que soltar como palomas

Llévame hasta donde quieras

Que la luna está mirando
Y las nubes nos esperan
Este mar está llamando
Y la arena ríe sin pena
Que este amor está naciendo
Como un río que va fluyendo
Que este amor está brotando
Como florecer del campo

En mi tierra se suspira
El color de su belleza
En la sierra se acobijan
Los que cuidan su riqueza
Y en su sabiduría
Y su luz de noche y día

Esperando que llegaras tú
Ya no querías más
No podías más
Venir, a mis brazos tú
Mi encanto, tú
Tú

Estaba sola en nuestro altar
Rezando con una canción
Pidiendo que te quedes
Que al menos no me dejes ir de tus brazos
Ir, tu mundo, ir

Estaba sola en la ciudad
Buscándote en cada rincón
Que extraño ese silencio, extraño que no llegues tú
Que no llegues tú, aunque ya amaneció
Aunque ya amaneció

Los cuervos vienen otra vez
De luto está mi corazón
Y lo que hablamos ahora ya no es el mismo idioma ni razón

Ya no te puedo querer
Ya no te puedo volver a construir
Es imposible borrar
Las cicatrices de mar y no saber soltar

Ya no te puedo querer
Ya no te puedo volver a construir
Es imposible borrar
Las cicatrices de mar y no saber soltar
Oh

La primavera llega a mí
Después de un largo invernal
De lágrimas se aprende
Y lo que fallamos perdonar

Ya no te puedo volver a construir

Cuanta miseria desnuda para entender

Por el camino de su triste realidad

Natalia Zukerman,"They say that bad things happen in three
I guess that means you and me
Are happening still

Once just for the thrill
Two times to make sure we get our fill
And a third despite our best intentions

If youth is wasted on the young
Then you and I have just begun 
To be wasted

Poetry looking for clarity 
Or clarity looking for poetry
Despite our better judgement

You are taking me
Out of my reality
And I’m not sure
If I like it

You can't stop the morning rain
Form banging against my window pane
And bathing everything in a grey light

Like a moth to a flame
I just find myself

And left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same
Oh baby no
When I looked into your eyes
The moment that I let you go I just broke down (down)

Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice
'Cause the feelin that I feel within no other man
Would ever make me feel so right

It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me
Right next to me
And I miss the way you hold me in your tight

I've got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I've gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world for you
I'd do anything

That's right baby
I'm goin' crazy
I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you (baby)

I need to be your lady
I've been thinking lately

Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you (baby)

Break it down now I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met you it's been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat every time we speak
Can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me
And you want me
And you miss me
And you love me
I'm your lady
I'll be around waiting for you
Put it down be the woman for you
I'm falling so deep for you
Crazy over you I'm calling
Callin' out to you
What am I gonna do?
It's true no frontin'
It's you ain't no other
I can no longer go on without you

This emptiness that I feel, is going to be here a while.
Feeling kinda strange, now that you're away baby.
This emptiness that I feel, really just ain't my style.
Even though it hurts, gotta make it work baby.

It's hard to believe, you're not here with me.
Where will I go, where will I be
Lost without you, you are my dreams
Better move on, as hard as it seems
I try to tell myself forget the past
I think that I'm losing my mind
Because you ain't coming back
I gotta play it right, keep it cool, keep control
I'm trying all this time to let you go

I miss you and I want you
I really gotta have you
One more time
Boy I love you
And I need you
I really gotta have you
One more time.

[Chorus: x2]

I miss you and I want you
I really gotta have you
One more time

The harder I try, the deeper I sink
Your love has me blind, I can't even think
It's in me a while, then it will leave
And then I will move on, this really ain't me
Whatever am I going to do?
You got me stressing over losing you
I gotta keep it right, keep it cool, keep control
I'm trying all this time to let you go

I miss you and I want you
I really gotta have you
One more time

[Chorus]

This emptyness and the way you makin' me feel
Is it real? Do I want to continue loving you still?
Here's the deal, do I hang on to something that's been killed
Or move on, stay strong and continue to walk up heel
But I will, always on memories in my mind
But until, that's going to take all of me over time
To unwind, to forget about what we had in our lives
I was blind before, but now you're gone I'll be fine

All of my life


Can somebody tell me why
These chicks keep falling for the same guy
It's been going on for a while now
I'm feeling so much more
I'm trying really hard
But I can't stop from crying
What do I do
I'm falling in love
If I'm not I'd be lying
Why am I hanging on
To such a memory
Too strong that I can't let go even though I'm trying
With the happiness
You're telling me when we will ever be what we used to be again

All of my life
I've waited for someone like you
I feel it when I look at you
In your eyes I see the truth
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I'm missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

All of my life
I'll give you everything you'll ever need
Always be a part of me
You're the reason that I breathe
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I keep missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

Now tell me what am I gonna do
Can't escape right 'cause I think of you
I close my eyes, I see your face, makes me alone
Just make me wanna take a breath and take it
It's a rush
Flashbacks dreaming about the both of us
Do I really wanna wake up
Oh no 'cause when I do you're not with me
That's when reality hits me
I get weak in the knees, can't function me
No, can't breathe
My friends see changes in me
Always be dremaing if once be
If still today be a part of a heart, always will be
Your beautiful soul and smile is all I need

All of my life
I've waited for someone like you
I feel it when I look at you
In your eyes I see the truth
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I'm missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

All of my life
I'll give you everything you'll ever need
Always be a part of me
You're the reason that I breathe
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I keep missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

My mind has been so tired
I have no words to say (no words to say)
I'm feelin' so frustrated
I wish I could walk away (I should walk away)
So now what am I supposed to do
Without you here with me
I'm going in and out
I'm feelin up and down
So baby hear when I say

All of my life
I've waited for someone like you
I feel it when I look at you
In your eyes I see the truth
All of my life
I've spent day and day just loving you
And when you're away, I'm missing you
Now tell me what am I gonna do

All of my life
I'll give you everything you'll ever need
Always be a part of me

It called to me, it dawned to me 
The heart of me was telling me to sing with harmonies 
Now let me tell you what it'd be like 
Easier said than behind the mic 
Many times I had to get right 
Countless days, sleepless nights 
Now I kinda wanna break away, get away to the money made 
And maybe come back another day with a whole new focus man 
Cause been through it, proved it in time 
At the time, I was testin' glory

So strange, the other day 
I was thinkin' maybe givin' up on some things 
Not a quitter, but a single rider, dancer slash undercover spitter 
Now I got a few rides, dating new guys, and my house much bigger 
All I gotta do is stay on track, never lookin' back on all of that 
Not gonna hold me back to where I used to be at 
Now with white on wax, they wanna see me back

Now you wanna come back in my life 
But I told you not once 
I told you more than twice 
That you would realize that I am everything you're gonna need 
New girl out there, will never ever love you more than me 
And I did the sacrifices so why put up with 
Like we never met 
Cause I can't continue to go on hurting like this

I know I deserve better 
I just wanna earn cheddar 
I wish I'd learn never trust what I say when I burn letters of love 
You used to write me telling how much you like me and like me 
I could see you as my wifey 
You show a dark sign like the night the moon covers 
Guess you'd never known 'til they show the true colors 
A few of us pay no attention and let it flow 
But not me, baby, I'm sorry you gotta go 
It's taking us toll 
You kinda breakin' my soul 
It's like I'm sitting in a desert and I'm waitin' for it to snow 
Hit the road 
I'd rather be wrong than mistreated 
Now beat it, leave me here 
I'll get to pickin' up the pieces of my life 

I've got to pick up the pieces

Baby I can barely speak, this is what you do to me
Shivers send me wild, dancing down my spine, every part of me is sensitized
I've been here before, knew there could be more, baby you are what I've waited for

Tonight, we are incredible, natural
How did I get so incurable, breakable, weak inside
You make me feel supersensual

Oo oo oo oah, oo oo oo oah

Senses working overtime, your love is such a crazy ride
I feel the rush in every drop, sweeter than a cherry pop
Baby can't you tell, you've got me overwhelmed, and I don't even recognize myself
I opened my eyes to a world I never knew and I know I found it all with you

Tonight, we are incredible, natural
How did I get so incurable, breakable, weak inside
You make me feel supersensual

And you was never worth it, I'm taking it all back, settling my score, covering all traces
Walking with you no more, no more

I don't need, no seriously, I don't need
For you to give your reasons up for leaving me, keep your lies
And you can say you're wasting your breath, but baby you can say 
That this is my decision, but you chose your way, and so will I

And I have never felt more ashamed of you than I do right now

I feel a challenge in my soul today
Questioning things I believed in so firmly yesterday
How can I have faith in myself and what I feel to be true
When the next day I feel my heart and mind telling me something new
I feel the twisting of my soul today
Something is challenging my perceptions
And what I`m going through is hard
And I admit, right now I`m not O.K. So...

Right now, I don`t exactly know what to choose

I feel a burden in my spirit today
Feels like everything that I`ve ever trusted in
Has been washed away
I feel like I`m grappling for the truth
Don`t understand decisions that I made while in my youth
In my mind I know I gotta live with what I`ve chosen
But in my heart I struggle
'Cuz I can`t live with a heart that`s frozen
Inside my heart and soul just want to fly

I waited by the phone for you to call today
But it didn't ring, I guess you don`t think of me when you're away

You make me feel
The way that a woman should feel

So complete, it's right
And I wanna love you for life
Yes, you make me feel

From the first day that we met
I knew we were meant for each other
And now I can't imagine
Being with any other
You came into my world, so unexpectedly
I never thought I'd find someone
Who I could love for eternity
You put your hand in mine
I love that you can read my mind
Anticipate my every need
With you I wanna be

It wasn't so long ago
That I felt unloved and alone
You walked into my life
A bright star to give me light
You give the respect that I need
Baby, I feel like your queen
Seems when we're together
Time is still, we are in heaven
The things you do for me
So precious and so sweet
Ecstasy is what I feel
When it's you and me

Bridge:
Yes, when you're with me
I feel that I can do anything
Baby, when you kiss me
I feel the way that a woman should feel

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Natalie Choquette,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings

Just waiting for you to come walkin' through that door
And even tho you've made a fool of me so many times before

To make me realize that I'll always love you darlin'
And I can see that you got some more tears to shed
I can see it baby, because your eyes, your eyes are getting red

Natalie Cole,"Picture yourself in boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalde skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And she's gone. Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And you're gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

I shake all over, but I feel alright

I never thought it could happen to me
My heart was heavy when in misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me
