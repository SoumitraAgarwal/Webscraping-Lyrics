Lloyd,"I wish I had time to get to know you but I don’t
I wish I could be here in the morning but I won’t
So let's get it in girl
So let's get it in girl

I bet to you it may feel like I’m in a rush
Give it to you how you want it until you’ve had enough
Bottles of champagne, I’ll have us all in this position
Grown ass man now I’m needing intervention
We can make tonight the night baby if you just listen
Started out slow, yeah we could get to kissing
'cause all I need is, just a touch of your love
(A little bit)

The spotlight on us ain't bright enough baby
Thinking bout you is driving me crazy

I do what I gotta do to get it
I admit it, the way you move it is making me lose it
Let's get into it

So take my hand don’t fight that feelin’
It’s alright to roll with me we just chillin’
The wildest dreams is ’bout to leave the building
Don’t you wanna roll with me

I wish I had time to get to know you but I don’t
I wish I could be here in the morning but I won’t
So let's get it in girl
So let's get it in girl

Hey girl I’m picking you like let’s go
You gotta be the baddest in the club that’s all I know
Tell your friends I see you tomorrow
And tell em that young Lloyd taught you the backstroke
Now wait a minute there’s something you must know
I’mma blow it up but in the morning you must go
Come as fine as you are, fine as you are I can’t make you my girl

So take my hand don’t fight that feelin’
It’s alright to roll with me we just chillin’
The wildest dreams is ’bout to leave the building
Don’t you wanna roll with me

I wish I had time to get to know you but I don’t
I wish I could be here in the morning but I won’t
So let's get it in girl
So let's get it in girl

Hey hey I said let's get it in girl
Let's get it in
Let's get it in
Let's get it in
Let's get it in

I wish I had time to get to know you but I don’t
I wish I could be here in the morning but I won’t
So let's get it in girl
So let's get it in girl

I gotta go baby
So what's up baby, what you tryin'a do
I mean take a chance for once in your life
Yeah, zone 4, young Lloyd, 50 Cent",Let's Get It In
Lloyd,"When you're in love
Everything feels like it goes your way
And when you're in love
Everyday feels like the perfect day
And I hope that I feel this way forever
Hope that it's me and you together
And I don't wanna waste another moment
It's just me and you girl
And cupid has done it again.

Got my head spinning around and around and around
And again here we go
Got my head spinning around and around and around.

I don't know
Where I would be if it wasn't for you
But one thing's for sure
I'm so glad that I don't have to be without you
So I hope that I feel this way forever
And I hope that it's me and you together yeah
And I don't wanna waste another moment
It's just me and you girl
And cupid has done it again.

Got my head spinning around and around and around
And again here we go
Got my head spinning around and around and around.

It's just me and you girl
And cupid has done it again
Got my head spinning around and around and around
And again here we go
Got my head spinning around and around and around.",Cupid

Lloyd,"Heaven put an Angel at my side
With wings like shelter from the night
Just hold me close for a little bit longer
Stay with me 'til the morning flight

Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angels
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angels
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angels
'Cause they always fly away

Fly on angel go be free
Wont you come back home and fuck with me
Hold me close for a little bit longer
'Til heaven calls you away from me

Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angels
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angels
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angels

Give me wings to fly away
Like Icarus I'm having a bad day
See your shadow on the sun
As you're flying far away

Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angels
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angels
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angels
'Cause they always fly away

I tell God, Heaven can wait",Angel
Lloyd,"Two chains!
Bang bang switch lanes like a drive-by

Every time you own a liquor all you do is damn lick up
Pick of the litter man I'm doggin' that
Kiddin' darlin' hey are you hittin' that
Like a hero it's gonna get a heroific
Got like my whispers, specific thats petite
With a big purse and some tattoos and a hairdo

Eat her up like dessert

A lil' sunshine open my eyes
Wake up in the morning, she on my mind
Get fresh, get dressed
Yeah world, it's my time
So you can put your watch on slow
Focused cause you know we on
So baby turn off that phone
We ain't gotta stop we grown
And I don't really give a fuck who's calling
I don't really give a fuck who's ballin'
Call me A. Keys, who's ""Fallin'""
You's fallin', that's dude's problem
So hop in this bed
Forget what he said
Wanna taste my favorite spread
With my lips between your legs

The night I call
When I phone

You better be prepared
Pu-pullin' on your hair
No kiddin', no trippin'
My dog in your kitten
My head in your mitten
If you take it than I'm gon' give it
If you throw it, then I'm gon' hit it
Guaranteed that I ain't gon 'miss it,

Yeah, Young be the boss
Everyday of the week I floss
Look off white rocks, no denim
Look off white drop, no rental
Yeah, top down in the winter
Say I ball too hard, Sportscenter
I'm in the club with my ice out
Something start blowing up my iPhone
Like where ya at? where ya been?
What ya doing tonight, can you hit it again
From the back, while I'm on the sink
While you smoke your blunt while ya drinking drinks
While them other broads blowing up ya phone
While ya pulling my hair with ya Nike's on

We can pull up then hop out and walk in and roll up 
Now hold up say my name before I pull out 

Game, it'll never be the same unless I'm fucking with Lloyd 
And he got his own, lane

Wonderin' why I canceled my plans with you on my day off, 
Searchin' in my pocket for my phone or check my call log

And I thought that you was sleepin', 
But you've been watchin' and your tongue ain't sayin' nothing.

So sick of being lonely
I'm so proud to be able to say that she's all mine
My one and only this is for

The one when I was young
I carved our name in a stone
She'd had me sick to my stomach
If she never came home
But sometimes she can be real demanding
But we've got an understanding
She knows if ever I'm down
Her smile will keep me happy
Never found another that would heal my pain 
That's why I know it's impossible to break the chain
Cause she's giving me the toughest love
Talking about thicker than blood
I know that she'll defend me for whatevers beating me up

When situations all of a sudden turn shady
Want to love, sticks and stones they don't faze me
Long as I got her by my side
She'll be down to ride
She ain't taking nothing from anybody

One that said that she will always stand by her man
Giving him someone to count on to be there in advance
And when the earth starts to quake, damn it vibrates
We'll be going out together if it all falls down
Even the times when my head feels like it's about to explode
Knowing that I can count on her to carry the load
I'll be like oh what a feeling
Cause she's the realest
I wouldn't trade her cause I love my baby

When situations all of a sudden turn shady

So they generate a lie
To distract us from the times hey
There's a hood in every city, yeah
From Compton to Bombay, hey, hey
When nobody likes to be there
The system found a way
That made 'em wanna stay

And I say, ah, 
Da ri rap da ra ra, da ri rap da ra ra
Da ri rap da, yeah
I hate to see the whole world cry,
I hate to see the whole world cry
If it was up to me, 
I would wipe them from your eyes
I hate to see the world cry

We need a plan, anybody please

So sick of this god damn Earth
That I wish that I could hitch hike to heaven
And go to God's studio and put in work
Praying down my melodies,
Give the whole world one song to sing
This hatred's got us in a pickle
A love costs five cents less than a nickel
I'm talking about one voice, one love, one color
And nobody's rich, nobody's poor
Nobody's less, nobody's more
And nobody's winning, nobody's loosing
No categories, we all music
If we can't come to see
If the whole world needs peace
And if we can't touch and agree
Than we are the true enemies

And it makes me wanna say
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 
I hate to see the whole world cry,
I hate to see the whole world cry
And if it was up to me, 
I would wipe tears from your eyes
'Cause I hate to see the world cry

Looking in the mirror, 
Seeking in the peace
Every day's a constant battle
Between what's wrong and right
I just wanna live my life

I pray for the future
Is that we learn from our mistakes, oh yeah
Halfway into destruction
But it's not too late
Too late to make a change
So I'll say
Da da da da da da 
Da da da da da da 
Da da da da 
And I hate to see the whole world cry

Hate to see the world cry
Hate to see the whole world cry

If it was up to me, 
I would wipe them from your eyes
I hate to see the world cry

I don't wanna see them cry
Somebody help me understand
Anybody got a plan, oh
I hate to see the whole world cry

Streets on fire, burning
Every herd every city is hurting
I will wipe every tear, you sheddin'
'Cause I hate to see the whole world cry
I hate to see the whole world cry
Hate to see the whole world cry.",World Cry

Hey Mama Patti,
I think I need some advice.
See my girl talkin' bout how
I don't love her right.
See I give her everything if she a good girl,
But I need her to stay down like a hood girl.
See I don't wanna run the streets all my life,
But the problem is she's never satisfied.

But son do you tell her
I love you,
Or I
Need you?
Tell her I want you,
Or do you just sit down there and tell your girl

Lay your head on my pillow
Lay your head on my pillow
Lay it down,
Lay it down,
Lay it down,
Oh lay it down.
Lay your head on my pillow.

So I'm lookin' at the problem son,
And I have some advice.
(Tell me mama)
She, she told me how your more in the club
Than in the bed at night.
(But she be lyin' on a nigga, mama)
Now if you really wanna keep a good girl,
Then why you run the streets with a hood girl?
If you wanna keep this girl in your life,
You better straighten up
And treat this girl right and tell her I,
Love you,
I, need you.
Honey I, want you,
I do
Instead of tellin' your girl to

Lay your head on my pillow.
Lay your head on my pillow.
Lay it down,
Lay it down,
Lay it down,
Oh lay it down.
Lay your head on my pillow.

This what I'll do for you baby.
I'ma change
I'ma change
I'ma tell my girl how much I love her I'ma do right girl
I'ma stay up out the club 'cause I know that you right

You don't have to change,
Stay the same
Just switch it up a little
Let her see that you try
She's gonna love you more if you do

Lay your head on my pillow.
Lay your head on my pillow.
Lay it down,

Oh lay it down.

While I'm stumbling out the telly

And the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete,
Way my pencil move is deadly
Platinum band platinum bezzie
Make a straight girl out of lezzie

Keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button than I'm stuntin'

Meter go two hundred something
And my trunk do wonders bumpin'

But she fuck me like she stupid
And she always ready
To give me that Becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club, order bottles see them sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch lookin' like the fourth of July
But if you pussy's get to frontin' and the pushing lead to shoving

But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see

Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can't see

Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimping know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

Squeeze me and its bye bye gone

I put a ring on every finger but the rats still askin'
'Cause there's one on all of mine, I'm the rap Phil Jackson
I built the rep for murder on every Who Kid
Kay Slay, and Big Mike, admit it the kid tight
And you ain't' even put up a fight, so its back to the amateurs
Wrappin' ya' sandwiches, I'm hot now so the rats want to stand wit' us
They hop in the van wit us and clap on cameras
I hit the clubs, now I'm back tourin' Canada's
Amongst weed smokers and crap floor gamblers

And I'll be damn if I cosign a old snitch
That was gangbangin' when Jaws was a Goldfish
I've been named New York's screamin' on the street
For bullying the baseline and leanin' on the beat
I'm well known now so you see me on the creep
Schemin' on a freak, fan base leanin' on the jeep
They walkin' wit the fire
So if you say banks in ya verse, Then you better be talkin bout Tyra

Bounce like ass in my video

Don't speak ma if ya neck don't swallow
'Cause 50 push Bentley's and Dre push Diablo's
That Eminem money got cash in my Escrow
Screws ???? swimmin' in my Castro
Yay' rap is crack, and I got the best blow, best flow

Drag my family with me 'cause that's how real niggaz get down
If it wasn't for 50 I probably wouldn't be around
Caught up in the temptations, sitting in jail or underground
And for that if you snap a finger I'll lay a nigga down
Its fucked up when your only facial expression is a frown
A hood rat a put a future in a fools pants
Till she find out you can't buy furniture with food stamps
A year ago I made a decision before I shut my eyelids
Pray to God I get shot tomorrow 'cause I don't like surprises
When you hot as a oven, they embrace you with open arms
When you cold as a freezer, niggaz treat you like they don't need ya'
Some people call it they vapors, me I call it amnesia
Live my life principle driven, never bite the hand that feeds ya'
Never mind all the haters, fuck them all, let them die slow
All I need is my niggaz, money, liquor, and hydro
I know!

Everybody gon' die one day
Whether its natural causes or gun play
But fucking with me you sliding down a one way
I keep it gangsta from Monday to Sunday

Don't blame me, blame my mom and pop for breeding this
The game needed this
Lloyd Banks, a.k.a. Mr. I don't feed a bitch
Or need a bitch, I state it when I meet a bitch
If you want to trick you need a switch
'Cause I don't trick Adidas bitch
This is all I got, I have to blow
So whether its fast or slow
Platinum flow is making it easy to kidnap a hoe
Pop the bag, pass the dro'
Blow about a half a O
Legit citizenship, my pimp is international
You gotta agree, these motherfuckers a probably have me Latin
Before they find a nigga hotter than me
We on top as far as I can see
And since the hood watching me
My regular trip to the mall is a shopping spree
I'm the number one draft pick, none of y'all topping me
I move around with the plastic, you ain't dropping me
The show me love in my city
They fucking with me and I'm fucking with them
Nigga G-Unit till the end


Your six inches from a coffin
So I suggest you stop talking
And make me resort to violence
And You'll no longer be walking
Your six inches from a coffin
So I suggest you stop talking
And make me resort to violence, nigga

Yeah!
You gotta love it!",Die One Day
Lloyd Banks,"I know I ain't supposed to smoke in here 
But Mr. Bouncer man don't put your motherfuckin' hands on me
Can I get high without you botherin' me?
Everybody you see in here tonight 
Doin' the same thing so why you keep playa hatin' on me
Can I get high without you botherin' me?

[Chorus: x2]
La la la la. I be smokin'
It hitten me right I'll be loakin'
Them bullshit trees you be rollin'
Barely give you a buzz, me I get high

I admit I got a problem, I keep comin' back for these
Dodo bags there not your yak or your sack o' seeds
I chill sit back on the sofa and relax my knees
And roll one up loose enough to make the backwards breathe
I blow a heavy load, you kids attract some G's.
Cause I'm a smoker, too much o' this would choke ya'
I don't mean to provoke ya, but I'm a bad influence
The musician can't operate without his instruments
My recent success gradually got your bitch convinced
Haters mad they can't look inside cause I pitched the tints
I enter the club with baggies of that chocolate
Second-hand smoke will make a nigga wanna start shit.
Sometimes I wonder where the niggas from the start went
Raise up a lighter and fuck up the whole apartment.
It's just one of the things I do in my spare time
My bad habits ain't private so I'm gon' share mine.

[Chorus: x2]

See they put their hands out cause of the way shit been
I say you niggas ain't smokin' if you don't chip in.
Listen. I waited long for these rocks to glisten
From that one-room pad without a pot to piss in
Although betrayal is not forgiven
I do this for my niggas locked up that's comin' home to lobster livin'
Hopin' the cops forbiddin'
I'm bout to buy momma her own mansion
Just so I could see her pop the ribbon.
That Cali bud's special, so special I held the blunt so long
Snoop had to tell me ""Pass the weed, Nephew""
Fuck rap I'm the wrong one to get pissed off
Cause the pope'll make you jump like criss cross.
My nigga dead and it's hard to let go,
So I'm blowin' on that wet dough, same color as Gecko
Follow hood codes and everybody in the Sentinel
We gas 'em Fuck 'em and Pass 'em what you expect hoe?

[Chorus: x2]

Said you want to blow with the best of them
Yes yes I bested them
Blazed up the purple palm tree
I told you don't mess with them
I warned them new testament
Do you wanna smoke with me? (do you wanna)

Weed rollin', G-strollin', bad-mouthin', mofucker
Law breakin' Pimp, slappin niggas for the fuck of it
Hip-hop an zip lock an rip rockin' gang banger
Thought you was an actor, thought I was a singer
Thought about ridin' but you say you wanna hang tough
D-P-G-Unit sounds like danger
You might wanna manage your anger
Hang with us and stop smokin' on the same stuff
Now lay back on the loft
This new weed that I got I call it face-off
Cause it'll blow your face off and that's a figure of speech,
My niggas a beast, on me from the west to the east, preach

[Chorus: x2]

Lloyd Banks," 

[Intro - Lloyd Banks]
Yeah!
Aye yo 50
They don't do it like us nigga
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I'm so fly, I got money
So that's good enough reason to buy the things I buy
I'm so high, I'm on point
And I could tell that your jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year
Nigga I'm so fly, I got money
So that's good enough reason to buy the things I buy

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
Uh, Banks is fresh out the gutter
Too smooth to stutter
The cig a melt a brother like two scoops of butter
Before I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her
Grab the burner
But she ain't concerned 'cause he's a earner
My bitch lays it out real nice for me to murder
We fight, wake up and fuck like Ike and Tina Turner
Its a privilege to ride with a celeb'
'Cause them girls over here don't got a problem giving head
Paranoia is on ya', that's why ya' llama's in ya' bed
Fuck some real Chinchilla, buy some Llama for ya' head
Where the block I'm from
Niggaz be damn near forty and still tucking
And niggaz baby mama's is pregnant and still fucking
It's either 'cause they boyfriends a scrub like Brillo
'Cause Banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow
The chronic is blown
For my niggaz that got locked up and deported
And now they gotta go back home

[Chorus]

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
Don't confuse me with the suckers
'Cause when I spit, You'll hear more ?Oh's?
Then a Skip-to my-Lou move at the Rucker
Thank God for giving Banks the gift
You think that bandana makes you look gangsta
But all I see is a handkerchief
Nigga there's no one out the click that freezes
Believe that, 'cause I ain't scared a shit but Jesus
Look dog, I don't run with the poodles
Difference is, I'm eating in Rome and you eating Roman Noodles
Ya' boy is corrupt kid
Banks a send a bitch to the store
Just for a piece of cheesecake like Puff did
You chumps can't afford these homes
Look around I got forty clones
Now look down, that's forty stones
And that's only in the necklace
I'm bony and I'm wreck lace
It's Tony in a Lexus
I'm fresh out the gutter, scrap what ya' man thought
I'm in the hood with more straps than a Jan sport

[Chorus]

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
When I travel I know I'm gon' get stuck
'Cause they harass us in the airport
Like I'm the one that's blowing shit up
I got the patience of a High School teacher
And a bright future
Why the fuck would I have a bum on my sneaker?
All the goodie girls back off us
My hearts colder then Jack Frost's
We pack shows and attract bosses
Black clothes with my black Forces
A black rose for a rats coffin
I'm blowing O's of that black coughing
Blow on the road then I'm back flossing
No one knows how much that's costing
Fuck ass, only the green moves me
I got a clean Uzi
A pair of gloves and a mask from the Scream movie
So if you plotting on popping off, then scheme smoothly
Or get a little red splatter on ya' cream Coogi
My name ring each state
So you ain't gotta go all the way to L.A. to get ya MC ate

[Chorus]",I'm So Fly
Lloyd Banks,"[Lloyd Banks]
Around here them boys, them don't play
You can hear the sound of gunspray e'ryday
I give two fucks bout what a bird say
Playboy Don do t'ings er' way
I'm rap's LeBron, Teflon Don
Baguettes on arm, the next Sean, John
By any means I protect my charm
Blade'll bubble you up, like Moet, Chandon
I'm only calm, when I'm blowin that chron'
Gettin them flashbacks like baby hold onnnnn
I never thought I'd sweat so long
And re-enact the scene of my ghetto song
Eyes wanderin off, breath all gone
Stomach all swoll up, neck all warm
Head still spinnin off that Seagram and vodka
And you know who shot ya, bitch get the doctor!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
(If you so gangsta)
Then why you tuck your chain in when you walk in the club
(And if you so gangsta)
Why you a grown man, still gettin your pockets dug
(If you so gangsta)
Then how come everytime you get into beef you tell
(And if you so gangsta)
Why niggaz know you for that in the street so well

[Lloyd Banks]
Now every now and then, a new kid gotta win
Yeah - but unfortunately for you, I'm him (I'm sorry!)
In my new tan trucks with the blue dot end
Hoppin out that big truck with the new wide rim
While you cramped up, on your Jet Blue ride in
We air the G-4, let the crew dive in
Before Lloyd Banks tail pop on sale
I feed a nigga a shell like Taco Bell
I'm flyin out to Japan to attract new fans
Let 'em get to know the man with the tattooed hands
Them gem stars'll leave your face all fat
So learn to stash yours in your baseball cap
I'm either gettin money out of state or off rap
So I'm tryin to figure out what made Ma$e fall back
And them niggaz in New York know the man is a monster
And I ain't from Atlanta but I A-Town stomp ya muh'fucker

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
It's like everywhere I look and, everywhere I go
It's a bitch sayin somethin slick, but you can suck my dick
I'm grade A nigga, you don't know who you fuckin with
They run up on your ass, you'll think you drunk your lip
Now I got money bags as big as a pumpkin get
And pistol as long as the hand Shaq dunkin with
I ain't the type that's desperate
I'm modelin diamonds now, you can call me +Icin+ Beckford (ow!)
My down bitch holds the metal, she got a Coke bottle figure
And a ass that's shaped like a bowl of Jell-o
You ain't even almost rich
They fuckin yo' ass, like the models in my porno flicks
Therefore you can't afford no 6
So before you hop your ass on camera get your wardrobe fixed
Banks don't house, want no bitch, so if there's five of her
Then she probably gon' suck 4 more dicks

[Chorus]",If You So Gangsta
Lloyd Banks,"[Chorus]
I am the one you denied
Brushed me off every time tried
But I'm alright
I'm able to swallow my pride
And put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride
I'm down for a one night stand
I'll accept it any way that I can
'cause I ain't yo man
I'll try for whatever its worth
Just remember who played who first

I can't keep my eyes off ya
I can tell why them other guys lost ya
The kinds red an a flying saucer 
That's what I can offer
Similarities and characters
Haven't ya heard the word around town 
How I get down?
They all whistle
Everybody part official
An that ass was you
Got my dick hard as a missile
Don't hop on top 
'cause I ride around with a pistol
N if they pull us over ill be out of town wit an issue
If you was mine id introduce you to momma girl
Your styling your moves n your nirvana
I'm so used to you're Prada
Taking trips to Houston its hotta
Throwing that Al Green n using that impala
Lay my jewels on my collar
Ya had me feeling like a fool when I holla'd
Trying to squeeze in but you wouldn't bother
But I ain't either
Soon as I realize that I ain't either
She in a rush to get close to me but I ain't eager 

[Chorus]

Like I don't mean to bother you
But your sex appeal is remarkable
You make a G wanna walk around in a park with you
There ain't no telling what kinda things that I'm a start to do
If I get wrapped up on your ass to fast
I can tell you feel the same 'cause when I ask you laugh
So I'm a leave it at that n hint n put it in my math
I imagine your prolly twice as good in a bath
But I'm buggin' 
'cause I can see you right in the hood when I pass 
I'm never stapled 'cause business is on my ass
But you can be the one I visit before I dash
An I admit I been the type to hit n split
But you can blame me for the females that I been getting with
'cause most of these broads have there eyes on my grits
Till they're in deeper shit n they learn how to be satisfied with the dick an'
N if you ain't worth it then that's all you get
I ain't gonna blame you I'm gonna blame them tricks
'cause

[Chorus]

You seem like your attitude
Only appears when I'm mad at you
In several situations n that includes
When I'm gone to long ridin' through them avenues
As soon as I get home this room is a scattered boos
You know my fantasies and my feeling things at camera speed
N you're girlfriends trying to sandwich me
My hearts colder then ya sandwich meat
'cause I come from the hood where the hammers be
I move fast but at a switch pace
N I pop in a Listerine strip before you get all up on a bitch face
Moving your body like this
Gonna make me blow like a bottle of cris
I don't know no one hotter then twis
You got my temperature risin' from your hips to you're thighs an
That glare in your eyes that brighten up her horizon
It comes naturally I don't bribe em
Its easy as, 1, 2, 3 n I slide em

[Chorus]",Karma
Lloyd Banks,"Nobody there knew they would die before they woke
They probably started off a beautiful day with weed smoke
Out of last night's pussy, the murder that she wrote
Cold sweatin' from a nightmare, mind on a see-note
You leave the door with intentions of fulfillin' your visions
Constantly sidetracked, thinkin' 'bout who's your man or who isn't
Maybe it's necessary - maybe you're overreactin
Maybe your actual downfall is that ho that you're clappin'
Maybe your pillow conversations been controllin' the actions
Maybe your homey overheard and never told you what happened
You look behind you when you turn the corner, cause death is promised
You done seen some niggaz go before ya, the threats are honest
And with that lingerin' in the back of your head
You know it's possible that you won't make it back in your bed
The confusion and jealousy and dishonor'll spin ya
But then none come worse than when that gunpowder's in ya

[Chorus]
If you my nigga, you my nigga til the end
Fuck a bill, fuck a bitch, fuck a Benz
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky la da da
If you my nigga, you my nigga til we go
One of the few I would take a bullet fo'
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky la da da

The smell of marijuana wreaks often
I raise hell 'fore I speak softly, quotin the Knicks
Put at least a hungred grand on one hand, bought him a 6
Acknowledged the weaknesses that his man taught him to fix
We ain't never left the hood, so we camcorded the trips
I done watched the nigga go from BET to the Bricks, shit
The slanted eyes what the chocolate thai gave me
I'm a bachelor, nigga you ain't knockin' my lady
A lot of these niggaz been jockin' mine lately
And I hope you catch the long and that rock-a-bye baby
We two brothers, pitched outta different mommas
Close enough to conflict and put the shit behind us
Your baby boy meet the daytime
Oldest watchin' and these niggaz tryin to get mine
Remember back then the lines in your flat top
Hopin' your moms ain't the momma on crack rock

[Chorus]

Keep my, mind on my money, and my head to the sky
I never really smile much, if you was here you'd know why
There's frustration and fire if you look in my eye
The media fuckin' me up, right hookin' my high
Niggaz hated on us 'fore the game took us inside
Then they opened they arms wide, took the whoopin' and cried
I got a platinum plaque hangin' on the wall of my crib
And handsome's one of the things they been callin' the kid
They watch you close when you coppin' all the VS stones
If you ain't tryin to get it poppin', leave the BS home
I got a saditty broad that gives the best dome
And I'm blowin' on some of the finest weed that's grown, homes
You won't know when they gon' dump a slug
But you can tell I'm gettin' money from the line out in front the club
My whole click caked up, you can't compare the dough
And if it's only one bitch, then we gon' share the ho

[Chorus]

(If you my nigga you my nigga til the end my friend)
 La da da
(If you my nigga you my nigga til we go my niggarole)

My grandmama' daughter ain't raised no sucker
Heart full of pride and a head full of anger
Attitude of a winner infared for the danger
Even the paranoya of a female'll change ya
Waking up every morning laying next to a stranger
I'm on the move, smooth, with one eye out for the snakes
Who can't stand hearin your name all throughout the states
Tune into BET and watchin your video
Pretending to be your friends but the smart ones really no, so
If that's your man warn him
'Cause there's enough bullets in here to hit every NBA patch on him
Nigga ride 'til I die the song I sing
You ain't ready for the war I bring
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing

The wrong punchline'll have niggaz inside of your house
Nigga I'm doing good I made it out of the hood
I own Beverly Hills no more bottles or wood
That's a zipper that's sticky
California should whip me

But it ain't that easy
To get mine
You get ya ass laid down

Down,
The paint is peelin'
Now,
When the chips are down
Down,
You gotta lose all feelin
Now,
Your head goes round n' round

Funny how the world revolves around my click
'cause just a year ago a nigga ain't have shit (damn)
Me and my right hand share the same outfit
Which fueled the fire that I air the game out with (whoo)
It's amazing the way that boy came out quick
For that platinum niggas'll blows ya brains out, shit (bap)
I'm the new nigga the others can't stand
The rubber band man be god damned if I can (oh)
Let another nigga fill my spot
If a niggas steal from me it's the steel I pop
I'm on my grind so if you thought I chill, I'm not
Gon' stop lettin' that steering peel on the block, why not?

[Chorus: x2]

Banks they think I'm yayos replacement, nah
I borrowed his gunits to walk through the matrix
I'm signed to the Doctor I ain't got no patience
So he put me with 50 Cent now I got a face lift
Magazines wanna know where they fuck L.A. been
It almost died in the same car Suge got grazed in
2001 I was playin' my PlayStation
I heard 9 shots , I'm face down with my heart pacing
All I could think about as hidin' my gun and my drugs in the basement
It was either that or the state pen
I woke up out of that coma
Police waitin' for a statement, (heart monitor beeps to flat line)

Pass the weed and let a nigga get into a zone
Papa left me all alone in the world to roam
But now I'm grown, millionaires on my cell phone
A year past now, caw dead and L gone
And I'm sick, bought chopper with a long click
So think about that before you make your songs dick (dick)
Or lose a limb, please don't get me confused with him (uh uh)
Cause I'm down to go a whole round, lose or win
If I should die, ride a G through the hood with pride (ride)
Every strip, block, and projects is on my side
I'm ghetto calm by the 100 grand on my arms (arms)
Sick watching of a 100 grand on my charm (whoo), broke nigga

You betta' guard yo grill homey
And stand yo ground
These bullets burn
They hit who evers standin' around
I never learn even after I took a couple shots
I just got me some band-aids and bought a couple glocks
Had to go on a rampage and hit a couple blocks
Once they hear that 12-gauge that's when the trouble stops

If its beef then I'm ready to ride
Just come to casheville you can find me on the south side

'Til I go, put a slug in my enemy's head
The Tahoe's, bulletproof so you can't get through
Then follow, your ass and whoever ran with you
And you about as assed-out as two jammed pistols
Bleedin' around a bunch of niggas who can't fix you
So bring yours, cause you know I got mine with me kid
The 8'll make you lose weight like Missy did
The O.G.'s tryin' to hide they phony smilin'
Reputation always arise in Coney Island
I'm at your local newsstand jerk
While the only X-X-L you been in as a shirt
And, speakin' of shirts, get a new white T
God damn it feels good to be me, nigga!

I'm growin', knockin' international broads down
They know him, they're not gonna even pat the star down
I'm holdin', a glock so don't even act that hard now
You might bust your gun but your gat's in the car clown
So break your lil' weed up and crack your cigars down
Cause I ain't tryin' to start my visits, with the fuckin' judge
Givin' niggas life like it's parkin' tickets
Now I get to go to bed with a model
And the crib is bout as big as it is on the Belvedere bottle
I got all kind of ex' I could ram in they faces
Red and blue pills like the man in The Matrix
You might have spent some paper on your lil' charm but
My piece is bout as heavy as Lil' Jon cup
But, it's never tucked, nigga I don't give a fuck
I'll get bucked 'fore I give somethin' up, yup!

[Chorus]",Just Another Day [*]
Lloyd Banks,"Yeah, this something special ya know, something epic 
Lloyd Banks, you know 
Cause a nigga thugging don't mean he don't 
Don't wanna see you smile baby 

I wanna be the reason you smile 
I wanna be the reason you smile 
I wanna be the reason you smile 
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes 

I'm getting the feeling you wanna take revenge 
From the conversations we have and the way it ends 
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends 
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz 
It all depends, maybe if we make amends 
We can start from scratch 
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact 
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact 
So every time we separate, somebody's marching back 
You're amazing in the sack 
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black 
God Bless whoever gave you alla that 
If you seen her from the back 
You'd understand why dis feel like that 
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows 
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows 
And I ain't gotta say nothing, she just knows 
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes 
Up and down 

[Chorus]
Whenever I'm not around, and you feeling down 
Let the thought of me be (I be the reason you smile) 
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown 
I wanna bring you joy and be (I be the reason you smile) 
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down 
I provide by any means to be (I be the reason you smile) 
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while 
I'm just happy I'm around to be (I be the reason you smile) 

The main reason I been looking at you pitiful 
What about the half of this shit I done did to you 
Violated and tip toed into a crib or two 
I've come clean to be a bigger individual 
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you 
Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggas 
when you tease 'em with your physical 
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left 
Wild drama, section 8 princess 
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed 
Cause it's hard to communicate 
Cause she don't speak-a no English 
I been around the world from state to state 
But now I'm back busting in your bathroom 
Got you laughing in your shower cap, let's get it on 
Cause I'm leaving in a hour, fly-through, don't matter she's mad 
Even when I holla back 
All I really need your attention for a while 
And, I bet you I can make you smile

Lloyd Banks,"[Verse One]
Guess who's the man this winter, straight out the land of sinners
The Range is tan with spinners, check out the white mirrors
Blow with the damn winners while you and your man's finished
Two in your Rams fitteds, turn off your lightswitch
Holdin my torch down, even when the force 'round
You let your wife roam, she want a divorce now
You niggaz ain't this gully, play it I paint your skully
You never take this from me the riders and all the gangsters love me
You shouldn't be a problem, I ain't be a problem
See you later I'll red your head, you'll be a Rodman
I know your type, hoppin all over beat screamin
You call it hypin yourself up, I call it street dreamin
I do it for all the haters, the players roll with the gators
They lookin forward to favors, gossip is all they gave us
You niggaz wasn't quiet, meet the whales and the fishes
You leak the precinct up, play tattletale with the snitches
Even my momma knows, I got all kind of hoes
They wait outside of shows strict after the diner close
I'll get designer clothes, without the wine or rose
Take off my baby blue mink, and Carolina vogues
come here, take a look inside a entertainer's closet
I never trust a bitch, I blame Lorena Bobbitt
Niggaz stay in pocket, I know you're mad at me
But shit ain't all peaches and cream, and I ain't Sara Lee
Bitch!

[Chorus]
Don't ice me, you starin at the wrong one
It's a lot of girls here, go and get a grown one
We at the bar poppin bottles 'til they all gone
If you ain't leavin here with us, you can walk home
Cause someone else will, they know how we ride
If you a playboy, you got one on the Eastside
Keep your mouth closed, we don't let the beef ride

.. (what) right .. (what) right .. (what) right .. (right, damn!)
(Let's go)

[Verse Two]
I do this for the hood, niggaz stuck in the slammer
I smile cause I'm good, you act tough for the camera
Run from the lil' kids, they fuckin with Santa
Cause they like 2Pac more - word?  Word to my grandma
I figure I might as well leave here with my glock drawn
Cause they'll take to jail, even when you're not wrong
Dawg you're not this flashy, jux you got to blast me
Every rock is classy nobody on your block can match me
You shouldn't want a fight, unless you want to fight
for your life in the hospital a hundred nights
I know your type, run behind your girl rushin
You call it quality time, I call it handcuffin
I'm on a beach in Miami, so you ain't reachin my family
All weekend with panties from Puetro Rican Cammie
You niggaz wasn't tough, I shoulda snapped two flicks
You wore your pants tight, played pitty-pat with the chicks
Even my father knows, where the revolver goes
I bring the beef to your front door like dominoes
And my diamonds froze, that mean my time is froze
Me in the club from when it's poppin 'til the time it close
Half of these so-called real niggaz'll probably sing
Nah I ain't pullin over, learned that from Rodney King
So tell your homey chill, you know I hold the steel
Everything be jabs and hooks, and you ain't Holyfield
Nigga!

[Chorus]

Everybody on the left get yo' hands up
Everybody on the right get yo' hands up
Everybody up front get yo' hands up
And everybody out back get yo' hands up
And if you in here with a strap get yo' hands up
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
... man fuck what he said man, put 'em up!
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)

Lloyd Banks," 

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I done learned from mistakes like who's my men, and who's not
Like who's gone run, but who's not
Like who's gone shoot if you shot
Who gone hold it and who's not
Who gone change spots

[Chorus]
In the streets of New York, you can't trust nobody
Niggaz'll run up on you with a 12-gauge shotty
Loyalty comes free, smokin' weed is my hobby
You want to rob me, you gotta leave here with a body
In the streets of New York, You can't trust nobody
Niggaz'll run up on you with a 12-gauge shotty
Loyalty comes free, smokin' weed is my hobby
You want to rob me, you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 1]
When I was ten years old, I seen a nigga take three in the head
Probably around the same time he used to pee in the bed
I stayed awake, cause my nightmares was seein' 'em dead
Smelled the burnt tires peelin' after leavin' him lead
The killer fled, with a fuckin' laugh
My heart pumpin' on blast
I just started at him, slumped in the grass
Arms movin', fingers shakin', spittin' up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
There I stood, stiffer than wood
See homey used to buy me candy
Now he's gone, who gone provide his family?
My earring, shoulda been runnin'
I never thought I'd be that sick
Damn, I wasn't 'posed to see that shit
That's when I thought
It was more than three shots
He coulda been waitin for me, maybe he circled around the block
I turned around at my pops, he like ""what happened?""
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin'
I can still hear him laughin'
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It was a regular day in South Side, sprinklers and kids runnin'
All of a sudden, head's turnin', somebody did somethin'
This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it, he lived around the block
Regular gettin' money nigga, but loved to clown a lot
Walked across the park, stuntin', frontin'
Diamonds in his ear, diamond watch on
Eatin' a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty, grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away, so he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected, shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy, told him she'd be back in a second
But he din't pay her no mind
Called her a bitch about four times
Stayed in the park, wit' no niggaz wit' em and no nine
And them in no time, older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat, left his face all crack
Told him ""take all that""
Hit him again, popped his chain wit' a frown
And left the clown, with a stain on the ground

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All my days go by blowin' that sticky, icky
California made me picky
Chicken head tried to stick me wit' a hickey
If we, blow up quickly, stickly, somewhere tipsy
The location don't matter, I'm South Side until' they hit me
I'll be DEAD
If looks can kill, I'm from the ghetto boys
But I don't know Scarface, I push wit' bill
My heart spills
For the kids that ain't got nothin' ain't got it still
And for my, cousin I lost
Humped over the steerin' wheel

[Chorus]",South Side Story
Lloyd Banks,"Remix, Lloyd banks, ha ha

It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It's like a joke, he's like a king, but he don't rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold, don't want the jewelery

He don't want the fame, don't want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Runnin' circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin' for it
And you can love it, you can hate it but you can't ignore it

You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin' then you better come confront me for it

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain, yeah
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Your stomach's ache while he's loungin' at the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand with a nigga's skate

House's with just a bigger gate, houndin' him is a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'd rather give up a rib to break
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
So he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan

Created a buzz so that you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G Unit records ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit you're corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's no magician man, he can't make sometin' outta nuttin'
So now niggaz from his hood act like he owe 'em somethin'
They talk crazy 'til he send niggaz to where they buck 'em
Ask 'em if it's a problem and he'll say na it's nothin'

He's was gonna help 'em out, but since they fronted, fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate 'em or love 'em
He hold his own on his own the kid is really thuggin'
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggaz think he buggin'

He bulletproof everything 'cuz niggaz try to buck him
Keep two pistols on his hip, I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch 'em slippin', they creepin' and start bustin'

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

I can give you niggaz somethin' you can talk about
I can turn you're smile upside down
You ain't no G, you're a fuckin' clown
I can take your girl a turn and turn her out

Don't hold it in, let it all out
I can give you fuckas somethin' to be mad about
Invite her in, send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth

I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas ice grill but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces they just see the chains
Like Oh when you get 'em they don't know you with me

And you bound to hear it clap
You won't have another birthday cake after that
'cause yayo got a temper and he don't know how to act
And I've been gone for the winter
But now a nigga back
To get the money the money the money the money the cake
And you motherfuckers looking like steak
Food on the plate for the wolves
Follow wolves
Don't get moved by the tools
Battle wounds on you shoes wait
Control you hate
You ain't riding in them 6's
(why?) 'cause you spending all your cake on them bitches
I need the bread lil' niggas need Christmas
Banks don't rap with a back pack
I'm in it for the money the money the money the money the cake

You heard banks said so I know I got the mag
I pull up pull out spray hollows at your back
I don't give a fuck
It's going down like that
I done been through every hood
Dead niggas gone rap
In the heart of a victim murder is monumental
I don't complicate shit, yea I keep it simple
My bullet wounds will tell you a story bout what I been through
South side trauma drama with gallamas
I conversate with killers it's usually about life
Politic with lawness it's usually about white

Beam to you temple

There's a body every week
Now I don't hear the sirens
But they probably gonna creep
Plotting to pull me over
Plant the cake in my jeep
So I'll be skipping cities 7 states in a week
Can't a muthafucker breathing tell me I can't eat
Show me the money the money the money the money the cake
Niggas slow down pump you breaks

No mistakes
Cause the jakes
Run the plates
Then you headed up state
For rolling round with a steak
Niggas start up the beef
And run straight to the cops

Round here niggas get found upside down

Hey, watch how you speak
'Cause I don't slip or squeak I got the heat
If you get outta line, you'll be in the street
Ambulance man tryin' to cover up the leak

And nobody to care if they get you in a week
I rather go there split a swisher with a freak
And get a lap dance while I listen to the beat
She's a beauty and petite, I can lift her off her feet

If she gets in a spur, we don't fuck in here
I'm iced out, so she don't see nothin' but a blur
Be careful where you rub, don't get nothin' on the fur
You know we got them things, so the drama don't occur

You front 'cause you drunk, yo' ass gettin' jumped
I'm high off the funk, dro, hash and the skunk
Don't make them niggaz dump yo' ass in the trunk
They remembers a black mask and a pump
Them niggaz should have told you

This is my house, you 'gon do what I tell you to do
When your in my house, under my roof, you follow my rules
This is my house
(Put ya hands up, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya, put ya hands up)
This is my house

Lloyd Banks,"Nah Nah, I don't do all that talking man
Its one way or the either
You comin or you gonna watch another bitch leave wit me
The way this shit go, ima fuckin rap star

[Verse]
Fresh off of the plane I jets off in the Range
First class seat but this west coast ain't the same
The rap game will put stress, fortune, and fame
A slow drive-by when they aired out Kane
S55 all cleared out chain
They body me, you body them, support there out prayin
My only wish is to find ya catcher
Lay ya ass on a stretcher, betcha, getcha, ass out the hood
All I got is rap for that, I spazz out for good
That's my income, it keeps me in Paz and Hollywood
I'm hardly home, when I leave the club the party gone
And I'm pissy off patrone, tryna get ma home
My name Banks baby, I'm top rank lady
I gotta go, grab ya coat, bitch you ain't crazy
I speed off, gainin and rushin, and bend her over somethin
And I'm pumpin, devyin till the macs and I'm frontin
All of a sudden she down on the humble for a feel
And I'm driftin in and out of lane, fumblin the wheel
A couple of miles later I be cummin on her grill
Then its back to the hotel and chill

[Chorus]
Ma I give you the rush
Damn ma, ya lil outfit got my third hand high
And I need ya to understand I
Ain't really got a lot of time, bitch out ya mind its me
Damn blood, don't you wanna get up out them handcuffs
I ain't gonna love you like ya man does
I ain't got a lot of time, bitch out ya mind
",The Rush
Lloyd Banks,"This here is a little more than a mix tape so maybe I'll perform it
Uh, the whip shine like there's baby oil on it
I honk the air horn at them bitches in the street
Ay, remember me, the on you called a creep
Now my weed so sweet, I hit it and fall asleep
Wake up, roll up again, I get it and bought it cheap
Now you showin' off jewelry and couldn't afford to keep
And he won't show his face so i'm a hook him on the beat
I'm a animal too, I put the hammer a do
Make you feel like you need one so I ran with it too
In blue, now all of a sudden I'm back and my shit buzzin'
The broads the kids the bloods and the crips love em
'cause in, we got the city on smash
When I'm at the stop like they put titties on the glass
I'm the leader of the class, the heat is in the stash
I don't read up on a pass, I dictate the future
Millennium boy, you just can't get rid of ya boy
I chuck em the deuce and get a new toy
These niggas better start actin' right, I ain't rap too tight
I'll leave ya head red and white like a apple bite
Come nigga , I got a fat niggas appetite
Pass through the traffic light, smash on the coppers light (voom)
The punchline kid is back nigga, look what my punchlines did for rap
Inspired the new jacks that's why they sound like that
Where they chained down ear to the ground like that
The games in now, shot me 'cause he's the punk
2 niggas in one like shot g and humpty hump
Its on now, you got to pop me to shut me up
Slugs missed ya, we ain't mad at ya, boy he ducked
We can go hole for hole or cut for cut
It won't be the first time y'all better toughen up
Radio is all messed up now what the fuck is that
It gave em all of the spins and got nothin back
Save ya self studio time and pump it back
I punch a car, you scream help when you see the sarg.
I'll go upside ya head, you'll see a bunch of stars
And yellow moons, I'm ballin' with a plus garage
I'm Hugh Heffner all over when it come to broads
Even the ones that don't fit in hump the cars(yeah)

I'm back, I can't wait to see you niggas in the street
I can't wait to see you niggas go to sleep
I can't wait to see you niggas 6 feet, underground

Uh, ha ha
Uh, ooh

Yeah yeah, they know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
I ain't your friend boy, I'll fuck your wife man
Look at my left, now look at my right hand
Every time I move it looks like a strike of lightning
My name is Banks, but you can call me Igloo
There's white rocks on my neck, and my wrist's blue
So don't trip, cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

Yeah, Louie introduced me to jewelry, now I'm lovin' it
Tell Jacob the shinin's so good, them hoes love the shit
Diamond after diamond, and I climbed up out the bottom
So holla if it's a problem, I got 'em just like you got 'em
I'm stylin' they grillin' cause my whip can buy a skyscraper
Roll down the windows stick my hand out, ""Hi hater!""
I'm on my way to L.A., I'll see you guys later
You'll be here when I get back, ain't got no time to drink that
Now all I do is sit back, hop on the plane and sip 'gnac
Hop in the Range and whip that, came in the game with this crap
You say my name you get smacked, right on your brain with the gat
Know who you playin with Black, then holla back

[Chorus]

My name is Buck, but you can call me Icey
I keep spillin' Cristal on my white T
Don't give a fuck, bitch you ain't gotta like me
I pop my trunk and have you runnin' in your Nike's
Look what I just bought, this white mink I got it in New York
And this bright link I put it on and walk right out the store
Where's my car keys? What am I gon' drive?
My Phantom got the steering wheel on the wrong side
Pocket full of cash, Ferrari with the drive-out tags
Them hoes followin' us, let me stop and get some gas
Liberace, the cops watch me
I'm ice skatin' like a nigga playin' hockey ? holla back

[Chorus]

Canary yellow princess cut, rocks when I smile
Fat boy kept it gritty since I was a chubby child
Look at me now, hat cocked up, wristwatch rocked up
When I put my hand up to my mouth and hit that sticky stuff
The light, hit the ice, on my eight-ways piece
In the streets, I'm a G; on the mic, I'm a beast
Keep a bitch, on her knees, nigga please, I'm a pimp
Purge first, ask last, I'm a shark, you a shrimp
Check a deuce, Chevrolet, rims taller than my son
Gun, on the seat with a extra clip cause I ain't fin' to run
In my brand new, shell toe, three stripe, all white
In other words, come my way with that shit you gon' lose your life

[Chorus]

What the fuck are they yellin'
Dope man, anybody killa in the hood, fuck the homeboy sellin'
I've got a problem with him - if I can't touch it
Then he can't slang it, and these streets get dangerous
Corny niggas pull up in cargo vans
Palms sweaty, icky's out with they masks all mad
I gave 'em the order, and that's all bad
Born into flossin' flashin' got his mark-ass, smashed
The Iceman is in the buildin' chillin'
Big game huntin' and this lame's, stuntin'
Got an addiction that's deeper than a prescription
He's sleepin' I'm on a mission to beat him in my position
It's fucked

[Chorus]

They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
Watch out
They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
Watch out, I'll fuck yo' wife man

I think I gotta have it

Its like crack to an addict
It ain't to hard for me to grab it
Going with this kinda music puts me right back on the block, block

Uh man I think I'm addicted to the life that I had
So I risk it runnin' the street with the heat boy
Three deep in the S-U-V the bigger you blow the less you see
The more you hear a real nigga lost his life right there
Its hard to believe a flippers the reason he's not here
Damn and still get killed over somethin' that ain't his
And jeapordize the well bein of him and his kids
That's how it is cigs in old cribs dudes that tote pigs
Live with broke ribs or went under the dirt with the worms
The results of the colds pack funeral homes
You know the names cause we tatooin' 'em on

Right that's why they watchin' me
As far as I can see its all mockery
And I'm tryna be all I can be
Now that my foots in the door there's no stoppin' me
Pure poetry I got a little pac in me
Now internationally they jockin' me
Cause my money green n blue like monopoly
Yea I left a name all around the globe
Yet still south side I was brought up by the code (south side)
N I was told everything ain't gold its cause the glitter
And had to drown the pain with the liquer
The world don't turn unless the money move
The early bird get the worm and the dummy's lose
True you hear the struggle and the grind when I talk
I breathe and I bleed new york

Enough to make a shopper run out of the column
Enough to make a weak nigga go mano why mano

God bless you when he made me
I mean he blessed me when he made you I got a little game to
They know me everywhere I go that's what fame do

My favorite girl outside of my Impala
I ain't gon' say you a dream I don't gotta
You could walk around in the street with no problems

I pick up all the G that he speaks so don't bother
The innocent role ain't workin' work harder
I ain't tryin' to lock you down I'm no father
But maybe we can go for it if you just listen

It's hard as hell for a man in my position

Out in timbaland tearing the coup, my wrist chunky like Campbells soup
Niggas shoot, I done been around the world
And I'm right here you won't hurt me
I'll put your ass on ice yeah, cold turkey

One weed will bring you from the bottom the trunk
From the trunk to the dump

Like a rib shot
That's what the customers want
Don't cha, this ain't the typical story
Therefore I don't fall in the category

I'm cool calm and collective
You con'in a Lexus
Blew chronic for breakfast
It match with the necklace

Nines only down til' the rats wanna check this
Reckless, born treacherous warn specialist
Especially if you rest next to me
N**** come testin' me, you get the gun recipe

These old n****z want the new born sound
Actin' like they don't know who holdin' New York down
Yeah, I used to buy Nick's, ten years later now
I'm super-fly slick without a roof on my whip, s***

I sip a hundred proof til' I'm ripped
And wave at the haters who got a root canal sick
Tell n****z 'Like to make a scene' so the llama's close
That kind of s*** don't fly like mumma jokes

So they got 'em long-short, Old kinda toast
More out of left s***, trailers all around the coast
To places you get around by boat, I get a pound I smoke
I put 'em down them dope

I'm real scope when I pass the block, I make traffic stop
A prodigal wave thing that make the apple rot
This apple jacks, be long before the platinum plaques
The Pro Tools and the wax

Take a step back 'fore you catch a contact
The flows like an M-16 with an arm-strap
I'ma bomb on n****z until they can't bomb back
The Hiroshima demeanor, microphone crack

A lot came 'round here, f***in' up the game
Therefore I ain't servin' nothin' but the pain
You playin', I'm hungry than a mahf***er' mayn'

Rob a store 'fore you walk around poor
'Cause you ain't gettin' nothin' from me, you grown more
You fuelin' up the fire when you hate
So I'ma lean on ya' til' you make a mistake, I can't wait

Until the curtains close
It's just me and Tony, in them purple O's
Indoor overload, drive like I own the roads
These n****z is p*** that's why my shoulders cold

M by the toted bow, I'm ridin' filthy in the Beamer
'Cause I can have Lamina Calina bring to a mister meaner
You drown in deep water, any n**** around come
From the street corner, where you need your heat on ya

I'm on the climb while my next CD climbs South side
Greedy Dine, red wine, DB9, NYPD grind
Why? It ain't an easy grind
A n**** try to get mine, I'ma feed him nine

And it's graffiti time, n****az sprayin' ya mural
For try'na by a motherf***in' hero
I'm fresh, fly and flashy, best guy if you ask me
Jet by on the nasty, n**** you in a taxi

So I pack the A******** for the sideline static, yeah

We ain't got s*** to live for
You either headed for the pen
Or you're on your way to Gilmore
In the middle of the real war
'Cause a five dollar bill is the s*** n****s kill for

I make a million out, yeah
I don't care about a muthaf***a out there
My heart cold and my wrist rock
And I f*** around and die over Hip Hop

My name is Banks, but you can call me Igloo
There's white rocks on my neck and my wrist's blue
So don't trip 'cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

Yeah, Louie introduced me to jewelry, now I'm lovin' it
Tell Jacob the shinin's so good, them h*** love the s***
Diamond after diamond and I climbed up out the bottom
So holla if it's a problem, I got 'em just like you got 'em

I'm stylin', they grillin' 'cause my whip can buy a skyscraper
Roll down the windows stick my hand out, ""Hi hater""
I'm on my way to L.A., I'll see you guys later
You'll be here when I get back, ain't got no time to drink that

Now all I do is sit back, hop on the plane and sip 'gnac
Hop in the Range and whip that, came in the game with this crap
You say my name you get smacked, right on your brain with the gat

Don't give a f***, b**** you ain't gotta like me
I pop my trunk and have you runnin' in your Nike's

Look what I just bought, this white mink I got it in New York
And this bright link I put it on and walk right out the store
Where's my car keys? What am I gon' drive?
My Phantom got the steering wheel on the wrong side

Pocket full of cash, Ferrari with the drive-out tags
Them h*** followin' us, let me stop and get some gas

Canary yellow princess cut, rocks when I smile
Fat boy kept it gritty since I was a chubby child
Look at me now, hat cocked up, wristwatch rocked up
When I put my hand up to my mouth and hit that sticky stuff

The light, hit the ice, on my eight-ways piece
In the streets, I'm a G, on the mic, I'm a beast
Keep a b**** on her knees, n**** please, I'm a pimp
Purge first, ask last, I'm a shark, you a shrimp

Check a deuce, Chevrolet, rims taller than my son
Gun, on the seat with a extra clip 'cause I ain't fin' to run
In my brand new, shell toe, three stripe, all white
In other words, come my way with that s*** you gon' lose your life

What the f*** are they yellin'?
Dope man, anybody killa in the hood, f*** the homeboy sellin'
I've got a problem with him, if I can't touch it
Then he can't slang it and these streets get dangerous

Corny n****z pull up in cargo vans
Palms sweaty, icky's out with they masks all mad
I gave 'em the order and that's all bad
Born into flossin' flashin' got his mark-a**, smashed

The Iceman is in the buildin' chillin', big game huntin'
And this lame's, stuntin', got an addiction
That's deeper than a prescription, he's sleepin'
I'm on a mission to beat him in my position, it's f***ed

I'm a G-Unit nigga, that means I don't play by the rules
But I could make you move
Buy a quarter mil on jewels so I ride around wit the ooze
And that'll make 'em move

Ma, is you staying or coming? Make up your mind
My lifestyles to fast to take my time
I got to get in position to make her mind
'Cause I ain't leaving the club with out my nine

You know I got my nine
Think twice 'fore you cross that line
You needed must've lost your mind
Thinking you can off my shine

Shorty got it shaking, I'm waiting to take her home
It's hot as hell in here and I'm thinking of patron
I know a couple different ways I can make her moan
When I'm done wit her, she'll want to take a nigga to Rome

Give me a hour, I'll have her blowing up my phone
Like a stem to a stone and she won't leave me alone
Million dollar nigga, I get it and show off
Hit the dolga give me a minute wit your boss

I'll fold you, New York fitted and gold cross
To the Rover, holster, over the shoulder
I'm the sickest thing spitting in a while
Your plane ain't the same, it's different when I fly

South side playa, play around and get popped
24 hour stake out on your nigga block
Don't get your views confused wit hip hop
'Fore you wind up on the news, now watch the hook drop

4 figure ring, that boy doing his thing
VVS bling, my chain long as a swing
Boulevard King, but known in Beijing
Fully prepared for whatever the drama may bring

69 scrapper wit the up and down pumps
Murder is forever, don't fuck around once
Bottle after bottle, I down 'em until I'm drunk
If you ain't chipped in, don't come round my blunt

Grimy and gritty, New York City's top gun
First nigga act up, gets a hot one
BPV, the bottom to top dun
I get there, I gets it, I'm done, one

Wood brand new, size 22 shoe
Use your money, don't let your money use you
I got crews view, you know the usual

My life's beautiful, my pockets full of bread
Get out of pocket, I'll play soccer wit your head
And that girl ain't your girl, know the difference boy
Pussy kill more niggaz than a liquor store

I left something on her when I seen her
She was rubbing it in like Noxzema
She real cute, big titties and hips
And she pretty convincing a video vixen

If you looking for a mack, I fit the description
Chicks see him, take pictures and kiss him
Back block nigga, I get it and I'm good
I'm hood, living life like you should

I got to get it got to get it",Rotten Apple
Lloyd Banks,"Uh, I'm doin' my thang, G-Unit's my gang
Ma, I gotta get mine, all the day all the time
N****, you know how we roll, twenty three's twenty four's
I'm holdin' my ground in case somethin' goes down

Uh, yeah don't fall for a big butt and a smile
They set ya up you f*** around have to buck in the crowd
Around my way, ain't sunshine ev'ryday
N****s'll cross ya, you should hear the slang they say

In a land of attitudes **'s and accidents
Where n****s split blunts eight ways and pack the b****
Mama spit me out with a spindle and I been mackin' since
And I'm stubborn, so I don't lean back and flinch

You're perpetratin', embarrasin' the crooks
Plus your frontin' they only seen Paris in the books
Whenever you leave the bricks watch the n****s you roll with
Before you know it n****s be shootin' up yo' s***

The clubs a fashion show, so n****s go get
And rev up all the broke n****s rockin' they old s***
Before the night is done they be another murder
So put your money to the side for another burner

Stranger, don't bring 'em 'round if I don't know 'em like that
I feel like it's targets all over my back
Because of these broads that's layin' over my lap
A n**** that young ain't 'sposed to live like that

I just saw the dealer and I'm goin' right back
Stashin' my g*** 'cause I know they might rat
I'm doin my thang, G-Unit's my gang

Uh, I'm frontin' in my G62's the yellow and royal blues
I'm better than all you dudes hot metal for all you fools
The one that n****s admire many study all my moves
And I'm focused 'cause I'm a end up bloody if I snooze

You a sucker for love or maybe I'm a bit different
If you ask me, is your baby mama's a pigeon?
I just bought the mansion and ma dukes pop the ribbon
And I'm out poppin' Cris b**** I'll show you how I'm livin'

I keep havin' them dreams 'bout n****s gettin' the drop on me
Lettin' them things fly up and down the block for me
True fear n****s don't feel ya they triflin'
But I adapt 'cause I used to think just like 'em

As soon as I hit the top I noticed the sudden change
It's probably the Maserati Ferrari, yeah the Range
This is South side street talk the hood slang
And my product, a open your nose like good Caine

Stranger, don't bring 'em 'round if I don't know 'em like that
I feel like it's targets all over my back
Because of these broads that's layin' over my lap
A n**** that young ain't 'sposed to live like that

I just saw the dealer and I'm goin' right back
Stashin' my g*** 'cause I know they might rat

Lloyd Banks,"So you say you a gangsta, right?
Are you really a rider, yeah?
You don't take shit from no one, no
And got your mind on your muthafuckin' dough, let's go

I'll be a South Side nigga till I rot
Even though I got the yacht in the million dollar bot
Superman armor on the 69 drop
Out of every 70 rappers 69 flop

I blowed a buck in the corner just to get the feel
So my head light smooth when I move the steering wheel
I ain't clubbing from nothing, its top dollar to chill
I pop bottles for real with pop artists that kill

I move to mill, my backyard is a field
I ain't tough for the tube, I'll smack y'all for real
Go head hate on me now, you'll miss a nigga later
I'm hood like butter holes and pissy elevators

I went from playing the same block to Bangkok
So I can get money between raindrops
And my piece so heavy I pop a chain a week
And get so much pussy I can't sleep

Poppa was a rollin' stone
Never came back home now I'm on my own
So I had to learn a few things 'bout survival
Like the ice pick done off the bottom

If you scared don't come around here
Guns ammunition don't run out here
As soon you get the paper to try it
A nigga try me, he won't see tomorrow

I ain't even got a license yet and got 7 cars, yep
TV the same size as Kevin Garnett
A brand new buzz, Mac 10 and a chopper
White fan base 'cause Eminem is my partner

I'm a Ferrari and Jag copper, you a glass shopper
I blow marijuana the color of grass hopper
I ain't a regular nigga, all the promoters pay 100 more
To bring your boy to Singapore

My dress code got the best hoes jumping on 'em
Elvis's and Red Monkey with the monkey on 'em
Shelves'll leave a niggaz food stamps blue
Like a full tube of acid in your shampoo

We don't tolerate the cock blocking out the bricks
We got fif's with the cop stoppers in the clips
Watch your mouth bitch there's rocks popping out the wrists
And my outfits, a eye stopper for the chicks

Poppa was a rollin' stone
Never came back home now I'm on my own
So I had to learn a few things 'bout survival
Like the ice pick done off the bottom

If you scared don't come 'round here
Guns ammunition don't run out here
As soon you get the paper to try it
A nigga try me, he won't see tomorrow

A nigga throw his hands up at me, I send a dummy harmed
And had money wrong shoot him in his underarm
Then pick up a shell, that'll be his lucky charm
I got a chunky arm, I'm a fucking Don

I burn big everyday, nothing but the bong
I don't cuddle, as soon as I get the nut I'm gone
I'm in a class all by myself
I'll whoop your ass all by myself

I got white gold, rose gold, yellow gold, platinum
Young hoes, old hoes, yellow ones and black ones
I've been patiently waiting to get on my shit again
So this is for the corner they cornered a nigga in

I wish you would try jump me, I'll wave the gat by you
And burn your eyelashes off like a crack lighter
Nigga you stupid riding by trying to blast me
'Cause my window got the glass from a taxi

Poppa was a rollin' stone
Never came back home now I'm on my own
So I had to learn a few things 'bout survival
Like the ice pick done off the bottom

If you scared don't come 'round here
Guns ammunition don't run out here
As soon you get the paper to try it
A nigga try me, he won't see tomorrow

Lloyd Banks,"Man I'm gonna do my thang, get up!
It's crazy in the club when I'm in there man, get up!
Trust me homie I'm not playin', get up!
Now get on the dance floor off the chain
I say get up!

I came to bring you that California love
And a lil' New York hatin' it's all of the above
I'm not playin' I'm sayin' I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow the instructions
I said get up!

I ball till I fall
I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor
Not the used car lot
You buy a bottle
I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras

When I get in to it
I get in to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, rain
Till the sun come out
A nigga playin', playin'
We make the guns come out

Now, my question is
Who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain

I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah it's just music, man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said get up!

Girl, you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When I'm inside

I'ma take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn

While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see
What that bitch bout

I found out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up' get cha some
I know how to get you sprung
Tune you up' use your tongue
Under the hood it's so good
She said it's so good
Goddamn I'm so hood
Nigga wattup?

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands in the air
I said get up!

And get into it
You are now rocking with the Unit
I said get up!
And get into it
We gonna show you just how we do it
I said get up!

My heart so freezy, 3d birdie to the click you claim
Victories my valentine, I'm in a different lane
Strong as cocaine
Long as I'm sane I won't be took for games
I can guarantee when it's over you won't look the same
Drownin' in shame, callin' my name's like callin' Candy Man
Suicide on a platter, splatter your brain, he banned
Understand, this ain't a obstacle it's comical

Everyone knows what I'ma do
Everyone knows I'm lava, fool

Leave him bleedin', we'll be even
Even through coppin' and pleading
He be talkin' bout the weight he push
Use to punch the clock in jail, drove his mama car 'round
Now he got whatchu want for sale
See it, I bought it; it's official if I flaunt it
If ya diamonds really real then put the diamond tester on it
He don't want it
I'll run up on his shadow hit him proper
He bout real as a 4 dollar bill, Carol City Copper
Chop 'em down, one by one, two by two this what I do
If you knew what I knew then you'll be cool, you'll be through
He makin' money? Well we makin' money too, whoopee doo
We'll be here long after he disappear, this is proof
151 in the booth, so slippery...son is the truth
Come get me, I'm in the coupe
4-fizzy, I'm in the loop wit Biggie, piece of fruit CAKE
They don't want no problems watch they boots SHAKE
Tremble, terrified, now it's too LATE
There's no stoppin' till I see empires crumble beside me
Entire families divided, dickin' ya hoe is my hobby
Ya sorry, probably the weakest shit to try me
I be everywhere the guap be, and ya fat, musty and sloppy
Freeway ""Ricky Ross"" copy, and the real one's comin' home
Peace to him, fuck-you
Click, Pop pop pop, I'm gone
I'm too strong, you been warned
Quiet storm when I perform

Still ballin', poppin' bottles, my wrist is white

My sound system knock and in pound Tupac
6-4 jumping like the ground too hot
They spot me, they chase a nigga down two blocks
Two shots in the air for niggas that ain't here

Till the fire Marshall's come shut

I guess you should just shut the fuck up
And stop fucking around and duck
I ain't playing this time, I told you I'm not down for blunts
To say I keep it 100 would probably sound redundant
Like calling a bitch a hoe, or asking a gal to suck
And blowing your dick cock
Is she up to screw and down to fuck
It's a man's World and I'm trapped in a land of smut
With a thousand sluts wrapped with muzzles
Running through a house of mutts
Other words I'm shutting up everyone one of you bitches mouth's up
And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt
And ain't shit changed, my shit still don't stink player
My farts may have become staler ever since I became a trailer park celebrity
Maybe my complexion became a little paler
Poster job for white trash, I'm a garbage pale kid sailor
Yeah, see me up all in your bitch means I'ma rape her,

So bitch you better look for table scraps to scrape her

Forget where I'm at now I passed em around the 6th grade
Passion for my profession outlast anyone you could name
Hood fame got me ridin' in wood grain
Look lame Stanten, Harlem to Brooklyn
They know I'm cooked Cain
Took aim rappin' would bang
I could change
But this sport ain't a good game
I'm strappin' sir
Back seat in the passenger

Shoppin' while I laugh at ya

Play me like I'm something sweet

That's what they shout it
I'm on top now, there's nothing they can do about it
Ya'll better have ya'll guns out
Cause where I'm from, there ain't no way around it
Home sweet home

I'm a fucking rap til you blue in the face
You'll probably turn into smurfs with the time that you waste
Throughout history they throwing shots at the greats
But I shoot back, the Lord ain't designed me for hate
I've never understood Martin Luther with the speech
With the whole World watching me, turn the other cheek?
Never, so there's one left to die in the streets
Cause his long arms happens to connect with his reach
Try to kill you then, them near misses was God's kisses
True Hollywood story, ghetto tie bridges
Different strokes that niggas broke the [?] reach
You only read about the cars that I paddle shift
You only dream about the [?] that I dabble with
Balcony views, postcard, imagine this
White stones, black steel cold chrome
This city's my doormat, them home sweet home

See me where you see me
Always seen
Off the Queens magazines, pissy hallway scenes
Paying crowds, hunger screams, pressure crumbles teams
Fuck being humble in the jungle where they fumble dreams
Drugs for the living, Henny [?] for the body
Crosses for the power, ghetto for the smiley
Pitbull, I bit my way out the cage, what's happening
Competition got me on the Rampage, Jackson
Part of my reaction to they corny ass raps
Keep flirting with death and get your horny ass clapped
Back for more me, rat tat, kiss the ring, beat respect out them
Bloody heads, turn Timbalands to red bottoms
Fifty bottles just a start now that's how they do it
Carbon fiber through the Spyder playin' rider music
Ain't no question of my resume, I gotta prove it

Dress kills, chronic helps
Pussy just for the moment
Ballin' like a Hornet
See I get it, I want it
Everybody knows, heat hurts you got to show me first
Magician, but I can turn them to a Holy Ghost
You can bring two, three, four of them, the wars won
Tick tock boom, make 'em all run, come on son
Big talks just talk, I let my money bark
Put my Ferrari in park, give them a running start
Go, cause I don't feel a single drop of pressure

Got a body like a spur do, and I wanna cruise,
Hit gears to make this whole move,

Make my own rules, baby I'ma finna rap in old school

Hell fucking yeah, now come here, let me bless you,
Hit yea no air hit you in the pretzel,
And I don't remember how I met you, so forgetful.

Drivin home still drunk hope they don't pull me,

And we got a thing for the light, ball out, fall out,
Do the same thing tonight, flash backs, ass claps,

Never should've gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, eh?

There must've been a gust of wind
‘Cause you change your mind everytime it blows
And you just changed it a-motherfucking-gain

It’s my fucking life, let her find a way to stay out

An ashtray heart on my sleeve, wounded knees
And my one love song was a tattoo upon my palm
You wrote upon me when you took my hand

Drop me and I'll fall to pieces too easily

Lloyd Cole,"Life begins at thirty
So I have been told
I can easily believe it
The way I'm getting on
Yeh I'm getting on
You hang around backstreet bars
For what you wish you knew
You say give me something cheap
Something I won't want to keep
Love's not everything
I was just hoping you might stay
Hell it's hard to say
I was hoping you might stick around
Until the morning
You've heard it all before kid
I'll say it all again
And I'm going to live a lush life
An ask for nothing much life
Love's not everything
I was just hoping you might stay
Hell it's hard to say
I was hoping you might stick around
If you were doing nothing
Fool for love...
I was just hoping you might stay
But it's not easy to say
Hey...you doing nothing?
Fool for love
And it's not only the lonely
Not only the lonely
Fall for love",29

Through a 20 storey non stop snow storm
Pirrelli calendar girls wrestling in body lotion
My head's swimming with poetry and prose
Excuse me one moment whilst I powder my nose
Me and my good thing are just about as close as can be
We gave up sleep at the age of 17
My world's getting bigger as my eyesight gets worse
I can't see the lines on my idiot board
What about love?
I don't let that stuff in my house
This is the glamorous life there's no time for fooling around
Lord have mercy I know what I'm doing
I don't need an alibi I need a fire escape and an open window
It's my problem it's nothing I can't deal with
I'm not chasing anything just jogging baby
What's your bag?
Hundred million dollar jam
Got some traffic yessir in my nose
Motorcycle speed cops burning up my dust roads
My baby left me heck ain`t that a shame
She's over in the corner with my new best friend
I'm doing fine with my whisky and wine
And meet me in the john john meet me in the john john
Lord have mercy
...What's your bag?
Spin spin whisky and gin I suffer for my art

Fix me a quart of petrol clams on the half shell

I'm too focused all around
Most of the time
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path
I can read the sign
I can stay right with it
As the road unwinds
I can handle whatever
I stumble upon
I don't even notice that she's gone
Most of the time

Most of the time
It's well understood
Most of the time
I wouldn't change it if I could
I could make it all match up
I can hold my own?
I could deal with the situation
Right down to the bone
I could survive
I can endure
And I don't even think
'bout her
Most of the time

Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
I'm strong enough not to hate
I don't build up illusion until it makes me sick
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
I don't even remember how her lips felt on mine
Most of the time

Most of the time
She ain't even in my mind
Would I know her if I saw her
She's that far behind
Most of the time I can't even be sure
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her
Most of the time I'm halfways content
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went
I would cheat on myself
I don't run and hide
I won't hide from the feelings
That I buried inside
I don't compromise
And I don't pretend
And I don't even care
If I ever see her again

How much love can one man need?

Don't change your mind
Because true love is hard to find
But I'll find another...lover...

She says it isn't wrong or right
And me, I'm emotionally colourblind
She's waking me at half past four
I'm sleeping on the bathroom floor again

She's fallen for his new age verse
I'm holding back a level of consciousness
I know it isn't wrong or right

Lloyd Cole,"Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit. 
It was now Mid-August which meant he had
Been separated from Marsha for more than two months. 
Two months, and all he had to show was three dog-eared letters 
And two very expensive long-distance phone calls. 
True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, 
And he to Locust, Pennsylvania, she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity. 
She would date occasionally, but merely as amusement. 
She would remain faithful.

But lately Waldo had begun to worry. 
He had trouble sleeping at night and when
He did, he had horrible dreams. 
He lay awake at night, tossing and turning
Underneath his pleated quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes as he
Pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothing of
Some neanderthal, finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.
It was more than the human mind could bear.

Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him. 
Daytime fantasies of sexual
Abandon permeated his thoughts. 
And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how she really was. 
He, Waldo, alone understood this. 
He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche. 
He had made her smile. She needed him, and he wasn't there (Aw)

The idea came to him on the Thursday 
Before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled to appear. 
He'd just finished mowing and etching the Edelsons lawn for a dollar
Fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from Marsha. 
There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company
Of America inquiring into his awing needs. 
At least they cared enough to write.

It was a New York company. 
You could go anywhere in the mails. 
Then it struck him. 
He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,
True, but why not mail himself? 
It was absurdly simple. 
He would ship himself parcel post, special delivery.
The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to
Purchase the necessary equipment. 
He bought masking tape, a staple gun and a medium sized cardboard box 
Just right for a person of his build. 
He judged that with a minimum of jostling 
He could ride quite comfortably. A few airholes,
Some water, perhaps some midnight snacks, 
And it would probably be as good as going tourist.

By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. 
He was thoroughly packed and the post
Office had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock. 
He'd marked the package
""Fragile"", and as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber
Cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, 
He tried to picture the look of awe 
And happiness on Marshas face as she opened her door, 
Saw the package, tipped the deliverer, 
And then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person. 
She would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie. 
If he'd only thought of this before. 
Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne up. 
He landed with a thud in a truck and was off.

Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. 
It had been a very rough weekend. 
She had to remember not to drink like that. 
Bill had been nice about it though. 
After it was over he'd said he still respected her and, after all,
It was certainly the way of nature, 
And even though, no he didn't love her, 
He did feel an affection for her. 
And after all, they were grown adults. 
Oh, what Bill could teach Waldo, but that seemed many years ago.

Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen
Door and into the kitchen. ""Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside."" ""Ach, I
Know what you mean, I feel all icky!"" Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton
Robe with the silk outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on
The kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. ""I'm supposed to be
Taking these salt pills, but,"" she wrinkled her nose, ""they make me feel like
Throwing up."" Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd
Seen on television. ""God, don't even talk about that."" She got up from the
Table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue
Vitamins. ""Want one? Supposed to be better than steak,"" and then attempted to
Touch her knees. ""I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again.""

She gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that supported the
Telephone. ""Maybe Bill'll call,"" she said to Sheila's glance. Sheila nibbled on
A cuticle. ""After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him."" ""I
Know what you mean. My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place.""
She gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense. ""The thing is, after a
While, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't
Really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know
What I mean."" She started to scratch. Sheila was giggling with her hand over
Her mouth. ""I'll tell you, I felt the same way, and even after a while,"" here
She bent forward in a whisper, ""I wanted to!"" Now she was laughing very loudly.

It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang
The doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson
Opened the door, he helped her carry the package in. He had his yellow and his
Green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had
Gotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den. ""What do you
Think it is?"" Sheila asked. Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back.
She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living
Room. ""I dunno.""

Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the
Muffled voices. Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down
The center of the carton. ""Why don't you look at the return address and see who
It's from?"" Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the

Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. ""Ah, god,
It's from Waldo!"" ""That schmuck!"" said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation.
""Well, you might as well open it,"" said Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the
Staple flap. ""Ah sst,"" said Marsha, groaning, ""he must have nailed it shut.""
They tugged on the flap again. ""My God, you need a power drill to get this
Thing open!"" They pulled again. ""You can't get a grip."" They both stood still,
Breathing heavily.

""Why don't you get a scissor,"" said Sheila. Marsha ran into the kitchen, but
All she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her
Father kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when
She came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter
In her hand. ""This is the best I could find."" She was very out of breath.
""Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die."" She sank into a large fluffy couch and
Exhaled noisily. Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the
End of the cardboard flap, but the blade was too big and there wasn't enough
Room. ""God damn this thing!"" she said feeling very exasperated. Then smiling,
""I got an idea."" ""What?"" said Marsha. ""Just watch,"" said Sheila, touching her
Finger to her head.

Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could
Barely breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his
Heart beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila stood quite upright and
Walked around to the other side of the package. Then she sank down to her
Knees, grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath, and plunged the
Long blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through
The cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the center of
Waldo Jeffers head, which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red
To pulsate gently in the morning sun.",A Gift

To find your room swimming in blue and green
Should you awake to feel like you'd never slept

And should you find yourself lost but in no need of sympathy

I dream the ocean was in my house
I feel the surf against my skin
But I just can't keep the waves from dragging me down

Lloyd Green,"She looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles
That weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way?

She picks up her apron in little girl-fashion
As something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age

She closes her eyes and
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Lloyd Price,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing

Scream my name, scream my name

In the club doin' my thing,
At the bar just sippin' a drink,
You walked by in those tight ass jeans,
Gave me a moment to wink
When I see that booty poppin' out
It was so strange to me
Like a full boned wear wolf,
Just tell 'em a three A to Z,
Now I can tell by your attitude
That you know you're by yourself
The way you walk the way you talk
It's like you got some goods yourself,
I respect your hustle girl, but don't try
To hustle me
'Cause I'm a show you a pimp and where a gangsta' live
And it runs in the family

And the way you're shaking it at the club
Trying to make a brother fall in love
Be dirty dancing me all night long,
Then you leave me hanging girl you're wrong

Every time it's the same old thing,
You bring me out like a beauty queen
I don't mind if you play your game
'Cause I know I'll make you scream my name
Scream my name, scream my name
Scream my name, scream my name

Girl you're hot, your body's on fuego
We fit together like if we were two Legos
We on the floor and we grind to the beat
I love the way your body's moving when it's grindin' on me
We got the drinks by the dozen and nobody's coming
I don't care all I want is your lovin' I'm a sex machine,
And girl you turn me on
I get you on till the break of dawn.

And the way you're shaking it at the club
Trying to make a brother fall in love.
Be dirty dancing me all night long,
Then you leave me hanging girl you're wrong.

Every time it's the same old thing,
You bring me out like a beauty queen.
I don't mind if you play your game.
'Cause I know I'll make you
I'm gonna make you
I said I'm gonna make you scream my name

You know I want your body, your body wants me too
You say I'm acting naughty but girl you're naughty too
Your girls, they wanna leave I hear them calling you
And see the Melony girl who you wanna do
Girl cover me, let's play the scene
We can have your fantasy
Cover me let's play the scene
You can have your fantasy with me

You know I want your body, your body wants me too
You say I'm acting naughty but girl you're naughty too

Being greeted by two naked models with suds on their booties

They give me hugs and lots of kisses
And they ask me what my wish is
I say go and call your bitches cause there's gonna be a party
Then they wash my body as a team
And they say ""Fool, your royal penis is clean!""

Look out the window and wave at my next door neighbor Oprah

And the stars find her striking
You try to play it off 'cause you see a sign of frightening

T-pain is winking at her

We dance close, and then she pulled my hands low

About where I was, and where I'm at today

I'm getting everything I ask for,
In the club, always keep my glass full

Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want, but you
I might get you one day, I might get you one day
House on a hill, Hollywood view, got everything I want but you
I might get you one day, I might get you one day

I love it when the DJ, plays all my favorite songs
And everybody sings along, I see the pretty babies in the pool
But all I can think about is you

Every place that we walk in is the place to go
Popping bottles up for free, with the models every week

When I do that, she screams all festive
When you do that, she screams, I'm molested

Put some of my diamond shit on, you know who the boss is
Either way I style on them all day make way
A little smile for the women, less they know I don't play
Keep it moving, on my way to get possession of that shit
Always the first to do it, introducing the next shit
Some talk and they ain't even put they neck out yet
To tell the truth a lot of niggas need a background check
Don't give a fuck about your keepers
I return in case you ain't know who the truth was
And why you on the soundtrack and you ain't sayin nothing
I'm in the club, bottle sippin' and the bitches is jumpin'
When we step up in the building and you see how we get it
And watch all of the niggas (brap) so you know how we did it
Throw it all up in the street just see the kid on a roll
And let me bang on you short when I take it to the hole

But tonight is our night

You know that church type, I grew up with them scriptures 
You mind your Ps and Qs, I sip that Jesus juice

We both get a lot of attention in the press
You sellin' books and wanna be the president 
We fell in hooks and the flow is heaven sent
We both hustlin' so why we tusslin'

Oh I cant stop dreaming cause

Yo, it was only dreams,
I used to play chess at the coffee bean.
And as my coffee steamed
I thought about my life and my lofty dreams.
It's so sick and I'm startin' to mix thanks to Anne
Rest in piece banana split
Was the place we all went Sundays,
To make people feel this way we would one day
And I remember when you gave me a secret,
Popped in the DVD and peeped it
And if you dreamin' you achivin',
After that it was a wrap
And now I walk in the club like a million times,
Spit on the mic like a million rhymes,
We party rock to a billion drops
And this shot makes one zillion shots
Yes I'm feelin' good, and we the best I'm feelin' good
And in your breast I'm feelin' good, haha lmfao
Ima pro with this party thang
I love cherry cheap cola and bacardi mang
Hey, I've been the same before it started, fame
You and I and the crew that I roll with,
It's gonna be the the same crew I roll old with
Memories fade like old leather
But the music that we make gonna last forever

On top of my game and I ain't even tryin'
Nowadays I'm stylin'
And when she make it I feel like cryin'
It's better than I hoped it'd be
I walk down the street and people notice me
No body was as broke as me
They say you never get nowhere smokin' weed
So I roll one up I stepped on a landmine blowin' up
And I ain't never growin' up
And if the party rocks and you know it's us
Me and foo in the club straight posted up
Back when I wasn't old enough
Now bottles all nice when you rollin' up
Cheers and toasts to us
Oh, we winnin' now
A whole lots changed since then and now
Fans show love and women shout
Make me feel like I'm the man
All of my friends n' my fans don't let em change you
Been from London to Japan and I'm still the same dude
And he's still the same Foo
Struggles we came threw
Stuck with our team and our dream and look how it came true

And he kick flip and grind 
One of a kind be obedient 
Radiant flow around LMNO conditions met 
I think a helical get frolic without a wallet
Can't call it 
It's disconnect brah so just stall it
The patriotial blood he bleed so slow
Take L from his flow now we have another foe
Keep lyrics like gamblers with money to blow
I don't collect dust cause LMNO is always on the go
With Associates stay up Memo
Marty you know we shot the party no problemo

They got all the answers yet they still don't know
People ask me all the time how to spell LMNO

I don't get bitter bitter it's all refundable    (x2)

Divide water like Jetties
I said these here without the man 
Proof of prophecies script in sand
So when the tide comes, foiled plan
New brand put it in stone it will withstand
Bix be known bandstand showcase
Embrace love and hate low rate hello mate
Bumpin' J-Rocc and tape
Schedule date is tentative as of late
Ja Ja create and also devastate
Grateful misshape right frame of mind
Keep 'em in orbit and keep out of any bind
I'm raining on the tennis match bust their parade 
Construction goes on look at what man made
Expert mediocre thought provoker
Gave a donation from my loafer
Hip hop's underground I'm a surface

I cross over flood controls set goals 
On the account of ajusted souls

The revolution is capitolized
Can't beat you over the head besides
What would that accomplish
Let's see who lives the longest
Neither of us know

Discombobulatin' with jesus
I'm stopping satan
No racial barrier can stop the holy ghost
And here we are intrigued by visible gains
Millions of dollars for millions of pains
We don't have the same type of blood in our veins
But we do have the same soul locked in chains
We like to cry not far live not die
Knowing all the answers without asking why
Personal pursuit pass our loved ones by
Frustrated with god with our hands in the sky
We load those guns, pipes, records with lies
Standing stupid right behind foolish pride
Your faction looks militant; weekend souldier
Couldn't get a gun permit
Didn't pass the written test
Don't got the hook up
Oh you have the movie
In Iraq with our crime from
All good to groovy

Clear the fog when the head is cloudy
Get my point across without speaking loudly
I didn't audition for this role
Type that spend his last option on his friend's parole
Word herb stays rolled through Los Angeles soft batch
Can't match the rambunctious
It's hideous as a city bus
In a hundred and three degree heat
Magnify this Hi-Fi
Down to earth Sci-Fi
Beat for it's publishing royalties

I'm about as holy as ??Jeff Spicoli??
Fight aginst the devil boldly

The patient's best intentions have sadly faltered 
Despite his newly installed, varnished brain, and being
Force-fed gallons of viscous demented liquor, he is 
Determined to obtain the new drone spiders' trophy
He dreams of becoming the scorpion who never sweats
Quite frankly I'm sickened to have this individual infiltrate
My head space

He talks of lascivious laughs haunting his every second
As the clock spits, clicks, and time speeds by in the 
Form of a neon snake
Massive delusions? 
Very probably
I fear for my safety 
He is as weak as his fellow man 
I am now surrounded by hypocrites, liars, drunks

Certain death, one last breath
It's taking you so suddenly
Wise is that, believe me

In fact you've doubled on a pain
But it's plain to see you're not to blame
I feel the sensation of love when you're near me, dee

Where do the pieces go
Will I get out of jail, well I just gotta know

Your voice haunts me at twice the normal speed
Who knows where this might lead
I said goodbye today, I know it's not for good
Full steam ahead I'll see you on the other side

You'll shoot me down, you'll hold my hand
And welcome me to your new land

Del frequentiamoci ma senza impegno
Stiamo insieme ma non vediamoci che poi ho paura
Anzi vediamoci quanto ci pare
Ma vediamoci in compagnia
Mi sono rotto il cazzo dei codardi
Con l'amore degli altri

Mi sono rotto il cazzo perché poi non si dorme più
Si sta svegli finché non muore la speranza
Maledetta stronza
Che non muore mai mentre io vorrei dormire

Mi sono rotto il cazzo di questa città
Degli aperitivi a dieci euro,
Del clima di terrore a gratis
Dei giovani di sinistra, arrivisti,
Bugiardi, senza lode Gente
Che in una gara di idiozia riuscirebbe
Ad arrivare secondo

Mi sono rotto il cazzo di quelli
Che vogliono andare un anno all'estero
Ma prima tre mesi da cameriere,
Così guadagno qualche soldo
Svegliati stronzo che sono trent'anni che mamma ti mantiene
E le dispiace pure che vai a fare il cameriere

Mi sono rotto il cazzo delle signorine
Che vogliono fare un sacco di cose
Ma non ne sono in grado e se ne accorgono tardi
E allora 800 euro per la reflex,
200 Per yoga e 300 per I peli del culo e 600 d'affitto
Per emanciparsi

Mi sono rotto il cazzo della puzza di piscio delle zone industriali
Della puzza di industria dei giardini pubblici
Di tutti a lavoro in auto,
Una persona per auto per finanziare meglio l'Eni

Non siete Carlo Emilio Gadda,

Avete dei gusti di merda
C'avete rotto il cazzo

Con 400 euro ti registro il disco in casa,
Suona bene, lo metti su Vimeo, fai girare la voce
Tra un anno Acocella
E tra due anni a fare il benzinaio

Mi sono rotto il cazzo
Che se vince la sinistra vince la droga
E mai che mi invitino a un festino
Mi sono rotto il cazzo del più grande
Partito riformista d'Europa
Del facciamo quadrato nel grande
Centro nei girotondi
Del partito dell'amore
Del governo ombra
Di chi si difende dai processi e non nei processi
Dei militari nei giardini pubblici
A fare la guardia a chi piscia il cane

Mi sono rotto il cazzo della sicurezza
Come fiera della forca
E del fascino della divisa
Sarebbe bello bruciassero meno fabbriche
E crollassero meno scuole
E scippassero più vecchiette

Mi sono rotto il cazzo
Di c'è la crisi c'è la crisi
Da domani acquisto solo cacciabombardieri
È un po' di tempo ormai
Che vendiamo solo sangue e compriamo solo merda

Mi sono rotto il cazzo
Che bisogna essere lavoratori flessibili
Come ergastolani in turnee ma molti più sorridenti
Dei fascisti col culto del corpo
Che diventano campioni di greco-romana
E poi fanno gli agguati ai ragazzini di notte
In cinque contro uno
Mi sono rotto il cazzo che non sono d'accordo con te
Ma morirei affinché tu possa dire la tua stronzata
Che poi I nazisti sono giovani che amano la politica
I comunisti prendono a modello Cristo
Mentre I preti contestualizzano bestemmie
E nella guerra per la pace vince da sempre
Il voto moderato

Fate una cosa bella ma bella davvero
La prossima volta che dite una stronzata
Ammazzatevi da soli

Che mi conosco fin troppo bene
E ho ancora tutta la vita davanti
Che cazzo faccio da qui fino alla pensione
Che poi mica me la danno

Sono due turni molto adatti a chi, come il babbo, 
Preferisce alzarsi presto, lavorare e staccare presto. 
Dice che così ha la giornata libera anche se poi alle 10 di sera si addormenta. 

L'azienda, chiamata così senza mai davvero nominarla, 
È uno di quei posti dove lavorare è quasi un piacere. 
Sicuramente quasi un titolo per gente che, 
Sicuramente di titoli non ne ha. 

Durante tutti gli anni 70 I dipendenti 
Dei servizi dei trasporti pubblici bolognesi 
Sono stati vestiti con uno stile invidiabile
Camicie azzurre, pantaloni a zampa, mocassini e libertà di barba, 
Baffi e capelli tipo George Harrison e Gianni Rivera

Il babbo di storie sulla guida te ne potrebbe raccontare per ore. 
Per 30 anni ha portato a spasso l'unità più varia con 
Il solo obbiettivo di finire il turno puntuale
Perché se sei puntuale finisci il turno in orario. 

L'Azienda era una roba fresca, giovane. 
Gli autisti avevano fatto un bel ricambio 
E non c'erano più quelli del Tramvai
Malgrado le rotaie di via Rizzoli 
Ti facciano ricordare di un'urbanistica di tempi andati

La linea 30 tagliava Bologna in direzione Nord-Sud, 
Da San Michele in Bosco alla Bolognina. 
Portava in centro gli impiegati degli uffici 
E gli operai della Casaralta alla Casaralta. 

Non è un caso che la squadra del quartiere si chiamasse Bo.CA 
Con il puntino fra Bo e Ca. 
Lo leggi come Bocajuniors, ma in realtà significa Bolognina Casaralta. 

Un giorno in via Marconi il babbo fa fermata, 
Dalla porta anteriore si affaccia uno tutto di corsa e chiede, questo va in stazione?
Scoprì poi di aver imbarcato un giornalista dell'odiatissimo Resto del Carlino. 
Il babbo è sempre stato uno di molte parole e buoni sentimenti, 
Ma con una freddezza che in molti punti 
Della mia vita ho scambiato per menefreghismo. 

Anche quel giorno aveva il solito obbiettivo di staccare il turno in orario, 
Andare a prendere mio fratello all'asilo e ritornare a casa da mia mamma. 
Il 2 Agosto 1980 la Linea 30, come al solito,
Scendeva da via Marconi verso Piazza dei Martiri, 
Dritto in via Amendola e poi a destra, 
Davanti alla stazione dei treni. 

Sembra distantissimo, ma se la fai a piedi in 5 minuti sei arrivato. 
Il tipo di corsa dice, è scoppiata una bomba

Uno, due, tre, 10, 20, 50, 76 alla prima conta e 85 al definitivo. 
Centinaia I feriti. 
Eppure la Linea 30 alle 10 e mezza passò per viale 
Pietramellara non sospettando nulla del genere. 

La stazione dei treni non era più una stazione dei treni. 
Era una cosa, una roba senza senso o forma. 
Polvere e macerie, gente ferita e grida. 
L'ambulanze per prime, la polizia. 

Una bomba in stazione il 2 di Agosto. 
Chi ci avrebbe mai pensato? 
Chi è stato? 

La B2, sicuramente lo Stato lo sa. 
Non lo sanno gli autisti degli autobus fra cui il babbo. 
Non lo sanno gli autisti dei taxi, 
I dipendenti della ferrovia, I lavoratori della CIGAR, 
Chi passava per caso, chi andava via, tornava, 
Se ne stava nella sala d'aspetto della seconda classe. 

Non lo so io nato nel 1985. 
Non lo sai tu. 
Nono lo sanno I vigili del fuoco, I medici. 
Non lo sa ancora nemmeno l'autobus 37 con Agide Melloni 
Che per 16 ore prestò servizio come soccorritore. 

La linea 30 oggi passa ancora dalla stazione dei treni di Bologna. 
Fa ancora quel percorso. 
In verità chiunque passi dalla stazione fa ancora quel percorso",Linea 30

fuori bruciano le strade e i fumogeni negli occhi, 
la pancia delle camionette, 
le tue caviglie così strette, 
il buio in fondo alle tue cosce, 
il collo sbavato delle sigarette. 

Sbirri al telefono che brindano alla morte delle zecche, 
bottegai piangono nei calici delle loro tasche, 
ma anche tu eri ubriaca quando mi dicevi quella volta
Se non la posso ballare allora no, non è la rivolta

Tra una pantera insanguinata e una gazzella morta, 
tu portami a ballare tutto il resto è la rivolta. 

Non t'amerei senza perdere i denti, 
senza asfalti roventi o meritevoli agenti vivi ancora per poco, 
se l'isteria dei collocamenti, 
gli spari sugli studenti, 
per te non fossero altro che un gioco. 
Non t'amerei senza macchine che vadano a fuoco. 

Il re ha sempre voglia di scappare prima che rotoli la testa della sua regina 
che bruci nella fica ogni sua puttana 
che il suo esercito venga sommerso da una marea umana. 
Per questo la storia la si insegna con i piedi 
che loro di ballare san qual'è la buona volta, 
come quando con una bottiglia in fiamma mi dicevi
Non sono io ad essere ubriaca è lei, è lei, è lei che la rivolta

soltanto fiumi che vanno da sole
che non so afferrare
che è facile dirle senza pensare e guardare altrove
le luci del palco mi fanno sudore
il tuo sguardo vergognare forte
conosci un altro modo per fregare la morte a parte le brutte canzoni da parafrasare
Ho le gambe imbranate, il fumo alle tempie come un toro ubriaco 
di cocktail da tonici se ti avessi sfuggito non l'avrei fatto
sembrava ieri
sembrava adesso
sembrava lo stesso di quando bambino aggrappato 
alle nuvole chiedevo un passaggio per un mondo fragile
invece rimango inchiodato ai tuoi occhi, inediti,
infilzati nei miei come banderillas
come corde di rame che portano di ritorno la corrente

e una carovana di equilibristi sloveni ubriachi brinda al nostro incontro, 
sbagliandosi lungo le corde tesissime elettriche
chiudi che c'è corrente
che io giuro che smetto di bere
che tua madre ti vorrebbe dal parrucchiere
che tu dici che hai solo i capelli crespi
che tanto lo sai di avere il potere di essere qualsiasi ma non lo usi
e ritorni a guardare ogni volta che mi tiri un baffo con il pensiero
e sei un maledetto chirurgo
e io un malato di sudore dai fari che mi tornano a scaldare 
in mancanza della tua mancanza
che gli altri tornano a guardare me che non so più che cosa cantare, davvero

Mi porti lontano
mi porti a guardare il cielo cadere
a bruciare un contratto
a fumare la vertigine sui pali della luce
mi dici mi piace sentirti parlare d dire le cose 
che sono vere anche se sono dei luoghi comuni
e allora capisco che non sono nei buoni
per nulla migliori di una serie televisiva adolescenziale
che il punto non è dire la verità ma dirla male
e allora te lo voglio dire
senza dirla per luogo comune

Che la violenza sulla violenza è una buona ragione
che più volte ho pensato di voler sparare
che il coraggio non ce l'ho altrimenti non sarei bravo a parole
che si scrive per non leggere e si parla per non ascoltare
e la democrazia è questa cosa qui, non un'altra ideale, 
e ha rotto i coglioni e odio cantare
e odio i cantanti che fingono di piangere e gli attori che fingono di arrossire

e se canti a squarciagola una mia canzonetta sospetto
che tu non abbia di meglio da dire, o da scopare
odio la musica balcanica ai capodanni
e quella giacchetta la odierei se avessi un po' di gusto, 
un po' di interesse per il vestire
ma forse sono solo stanco delle persone, dei cani, 
delle puttane che piangono sui giornali, dei giornalisti che ne fanno eroine,
dei referendum a ricatto nelle fabbriche dei padroni che esistono ancora

e pure gli operai, i proletari, i tiranni, le guerre, le stragi di stato, 
l'amianto, la repressione, lo squadrismo della nostra polizia statale
l'avresti mai detto per luogo comune che avresti 
vissuto nella stessa sbilenca mezza stagione

che ti ha portato in coda con altre persone 
a firmare un assegno di disoccupazione in mezzo al trionfo di un grande 
paese industriale

Ma tu torna a ballare bella come non esistesse alcuna speranza
come la luce di una bottiglia di notte nel mare, 
nuova stella polare per un battello etilico nella grazia tentennante e perduta
che mai giuro ci avevo pensato
che mai giuro mi sarebbe capitato
di avere paura del mare al punto da scegliere di annegarci
per togliermi il pensiero
che poi, la scelta la fai tu
tirandomi un baffo 
con un pensiero non sempre intelligente 
ma profondo come il relitto che 
è il mio ottimismo in alta stagione balneare

Ti ho toccato il culo e abbiamo riso
il tuo culo frega la morte al tavolo in trattative con la felicità
vorrei fosse il mio sindacato
vorrei non averti mai baciato
vorrei non aver detto questa cosa
vorrei averlo sempre fatto
tu vendi la droga
io neanche bevo il caffè
un matrimonio consumato tra un silografo e la principessa ballerina
e mi lasci contro il muro
come un arrampicatore sociale qualsiasi

Sì, ti ho sognato
sì, l'ho rifatto
lo rifarò che lo so
come sia capitato lo giuro
ma ti amo lo giuro che davvero
che lo so che sono un bugiardo davvero

Ma non questa, un’altra 
Non me la ricordo più
Era bella c’era uno che sapeva cantare e l’ha cantata 
Era bella perché 
Quasi solo immaginata e adesso, 
Adesso non c’è più 

Ho scritto una canzone per te ma eri distratta 
Pensavi solo alle sigarette, alla droga,
Ai consigli della mamma sui capelli 
Che poi sono belli uguali come tutte le altre cose 
Che quando te lo dico dici sempre 
Ma va là

Andiamo fuori a prendere qualcosa?
C’è sempre questa cosa di andare fuori a mangiare assieme
Io con te non mangerei nulla perdo l’appetito
E pure il fiato
E rimango sospeso, appeso ad un lampione
Come un angelo, un coglione
A canticchiare una canzone piena di rime stupide
Ma più bella di questa perchè un po’ come te
L’ho quasi
Solo pensata

Ricordo un freddo improvviso e pochissime parole 
Dov’è che avrò parcheggiato il tuo nome?

Non è semplice 
Farsi ricordare 
Con un bicchiere già vuoto 
Ed una canzone ancora da dimenticare

Che di sicuro stavi guardando un film
Che non mi piacciono I film
E poi mi faccio I film
Su te che guardi I film
Che non mi piacciono
E vabè 

Ho scritto una canzone per te 
Hai bucato le tasche, son cadute le parole 
Per prenderle su ho camminato 
All’indietro nei versi 
Fino a tornare dov’eri tu 
Che non c’eri già da un po’ 
Te per canzone una scritto ho

They put up quit a fuss
The neighborhood had gone to pot
And they had worked so hard
So I sneaked out back

Peeked through the fence
And watched them do the yard

Lobo,"Late one night the midnight ghost rolled out of San Jose
We could hear the echo of the whistle across the bay
Gypsy said that he could hear
The freedom he couldn't see
I smiled and rubbed old Rex's head
I think he understood me
From the Hills of California
To the North Carolina coast
Gypsy saw the skies looking through my eyes
Riding on the midnight ghost.

Gypsy would grab my arm and ask what we were passing by
I'd describe the Rio Grande and the redwood In the sky
Now we never talked about the time my mistake took away his sight
Gypsy had accepted that he said Rex makes it alright.

We made friends in every state that's real important to me
Gypsy and Rex would have a home if something should happen to me
But I know the only thing that would bring old Gypsy down
Is having to miss the midnight ghost and all of those moving sounds.",Gypsy and the Midnight Ghost

Let me down slow

If you're gonna go
Bring me down slowly
Then let me off low

You had me way up in the air
But you were there to see me through
You had me way above the trees
Now you're leaving me
But I ask of you
I could do without you here

I saw her walking up the track

When she comes home again
This is what they'll all say.

Recycle Sally coming round again
Recycle Sally we all know where you've been
Recycle Sally why can't the fools see

Lobo,"I promised you if you'd love me
That I'd never ever go

So this is Running Deer running
To the home I left behind
This is running deer running
Before I run out of my mind.

I told you bout the reservation
And the way that I was raised
How my family never had much

Lobo,"Where do butterflies go when it rains?
Who goes around & tucks in the trains?
What makes a teddy bear like to sleep?
Why do we all make promises that we can't keep?

Where do puppy dogs go when their sad?
And what do elephants say when their mad?
Who do you tell if you don't have a friend?
Why do we open our mouths and stick our foot in?

These are the things that bother me,
Not a lot of things across some sea,
I don't even have a master plan,
I guess that I am just a simple man.

Where do robins sleep on the road?
And how can a little ant carry that load?
Why write words that we have to erase?
Why does everyone have more than one face?

Lobo,"The dirty rain is falling
I hear the wind a calling me away
The motel sign is flashing
And in my mind I'm crashing what to say.

What to say
The words they started flowing
And passions started growing like years ago
The wine made my mind crazy

But now I'm not so hazy I gotta go
I gotta go
The love we made today
It was just a foolish way

To try to bring back yesterday there ain't no way.

That you feel our race is run
And you're old brass bed's the only
thing that we share
If you think our ships come in
Let's just break it off my friend
Cause nothings worse than playing like you care.

There's nothing that's so final about leaving
Even though I know that's what you've heard
Just like forgive, forget and try again
Goodbye is just another word.

If you feel the time is right
And you sneak off in the night
And live out all those stories in your head
When your shiny knight goes home
And you're left there all alone

And I stayed out late at night.

I can't give any more of my soul away
And still look myself in the mirror everyday
I can't change any more
Of what makes me be myself

Not to be somebody else

I know what you're feeling in your heart
Don't go jiving me with all your crying
I got loving you down to an art.

You can't take the stars out of the night sky
You can't wear love off a wedding ring
I can't separate your love from life now

Lobo,"I've seen a lot of things change in many ways
Since I was a boy back in the rock and roll days
Back when a bust was a six-pack of cold beer.
Marciano, he was champ the band all played through one amp
And the biggest thing was getting rubber in second gear

I love the rock and roll days
And I love all the good old ways
We used to do things in our crowd
I love the rock and roll days
And I love all the good old ways
We used to do the same things that we do now.

The only bikes back there were Schwinns
The only pigs were the bad wolf's friend

But one of these nights you're going
Home with me, I'm gonna see to that.

Well I'm just waiting out my time
Standing at the end of the line
I got a lot of loving I'm saving inside for you
Yes I'm just waiting out my time
Standing at the end of the line

Been loved when I get through loving you.

You look right at me and smiled

She was happy just to play

J'ai jamais su mais chut! une chose ch'u sûr
Quand je vais vers toi j'verdoie
Comme Priape priant pris en flagrant délice
En guise de prémisse à la défloraison de ton jardin des délices
Flairant ta fragrance, j'acte avec jactance des oraisons éjaculatoires
Où le lyrisme me fait entrevoir les horizons de ma déraison péremptoire
En caractère virilique, je franchis ton Rubicon au seuil critique
J'entre cambré en ton antre
et j'entraperçois un concentré d'éternité, j'éternue une nuée d'abeilles
Si je r'garde le soleil de trop près
Comme Alice et Lewis au pays des groseilles
J'entends des Christmas Carol j'ris car j'me sens comme Icare,
C'est bizarre j'entends comme mon père qui m'crie garde
Oups ! Y' est trop tard la cire vermeille me coule le long des ailes
J'appelle, j'épelle, j'pèle tous les maudits mots dits à mon secours
Y'a pas d'recours j'cours à mon tour, à ma perte
Me tue, me perpétue dans l'pertuis d'la perpétuité
Effaré par l'effroyable pérennité de l'éphémère
Dire qu'on cherche l'effet bœuf alors que tout tient dans un oeuf
Là j'ai une volée d'oies blanches
Qui veut s'envoler en V du bout de mon Cap aux oies
Mes hanches flanchent, mon cœur clenche, j'sens qu'j'pus étanche,

Les interminables palabres autour de la feuille d'érable
Me rendent malade moi j'avais voté Bloc pour que ça débloque
Mais c'était sans compter le choc de la ligne dure, qui dure
et qu'on endure depuis cette époque
C'est-tu moi qui capote - hystérique -
Pour quelques bad lucks historiques
Mais dans ta terre anglaise sur fond de ROC
Mes racines latines déshydratent et suffoquent
Dès lors, faut-il encore clore le débat ?

J'ouvre les vannes en amont, gare à l'inondation lyrique !
J'active ma salive, je me LOCOmotive

Loco Locass,"Nous sommes issus d’un sol immense
Qui nous a tissé, métissé
Rebuts de brins de laine tressés très serrés
Sans couture au sein d’une ceinture fléchée
Comme quelque queue clinquante de comète effilochée

Et si l’on suit le fil de notre texte
Il mène à la sortie du labyrinthe de pan
Qui nous éreinte depuis qu’ils ont mis nos torts dedans
Ils ont conquis notre territoire
Pillé notre histoire et volé notre mémoire

Avec leurs thèses de fous ils ont dit “taisez-vous”
Vous ne valez pas dix sous, vous n’êtes pas vous
Vous êtes nous, vous êtes dissous
Notre substrat vous subsume
Mais la comparaison vous consume

Faux! Nous venons d’avant
Nous sommes antérieurs, nous sommes des créateurs
Pas des créatures, pas des caricatures

Notre maison n’a pas de cloison mais quatre saisons
Acclimatés au climat et faisant fi du frimas
Nous avons parcouru par ses artères tout un continent titan
Notre espèce aspire à l’espace et son empreinte est partout

Tapie dans la toponymie, gravée dans le granit
Égrainée sur la grêve, arcboutée dans les arches
De nos dingues digues dignes de la muraille de Chine

Dans les champs essouchés sous la lune
Et les racines d’un hêtre qui ne peut plus plier
C’est une histoire riche qui n’est sur aucune affiche
Et qu’on a laissée en friche
Dans nos caboches, ce n’est que roches et fardoches

Cosmogonie à l’agonie
Dans le tome fantôme du grimoire d’une mémoire moisie
Sur nos épaules on porte pourtant le pack-sac d’un passé épatant
Mais allons-nous mourir en nains quand nous sommes nés géants?

Sitôt venus au Nouveau Monde
On a dompté les hivers et fabriqué de la terre
On avait la tête à la fête et le coeur au labeur
Opiniâtres, on n’a jamais laissé mourir le feu dans l’âtre

Car nous avons la tête à Papineau
La longue langue agile de Da Costa
Le cœur-corsaire de d’Iberville
Qui envoie en nos veines
Le pur-sang mêlé-mêlé de Riel et des Premières Nations
Nous avons l’aviron de Radisson, la vigueur de la Vérendrye
Les jarrets de Jolliet et tous les talents de l’intendant Talon
En somme, nous sommes des surhommes uniques
Générés par le génie génétique de l’Europe et de l’Amérique
Inéluctablement, nous voguons vers le néant
Mais allons-nous mourir en nains quand nous sommes nés géants?

Opaque, il faut qu’enfin notre épopée éclate
C’est sans équivoque, cette Histoire est pleine et craque
Loco Locass la provoque de son verbe épique: les eaux sont crevées
Et tombent en trombes et forment une flaque, que dis-je, une flaque

C’est comme un lac à nos pieds
Le col se dilate
Le sol s’écarquille
Pour laisser monter un corps en forme d’ogive

C’est le chaos qui «paaaaaasse» dans le chas d’une aiguille
C’est un cri qu’on pousse, un cœur qui pulse
Celui d’un peuple qu’on accueille ou qui frappe un écueil
Dans l’oeil du cyclone, chaque seconde en vaut quatre
Nous rapproche d’un miracle

C’est un spectacle sans entracte
Mais gare à l’arrêt cardiaque
Entre la mort et la vie
L’arrivée d’un homme comme lors d’un référendum

Un peuple oscille entre le rien et tout ce qui brille
Je pose des mots garrots gare au flot hémorragique
Ô ma rage gicle par tous les pores de mon cœur spongieux
Sur ce son long jeu conjure ma mortelle nature

Et nous disons que la parole est une sage-femme
Qui tire des limbes un monde à naître
Fort de cette maïeutique aux forceps

Reaching out for those who follow,
hunkering on far too many lies,

Something about your smile

And mothers in tears for their sons
And sweethearts and wives
Alone with their memories
And golden ribbon's those fortunes of war
Thousands and thousands
Shall gather together
To seek and find the Way we all need
And the son will bring (backhanded glory) us together

Under branches lit up by the moon.
Posing our questions to owl and eeyore
As our days disappeared all too soon.
But I've wandered much further today than I should
And I can't seeem to find my way back to the wood.
So, help me if you can I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one.
You;d be surprised there's so much to be done,
Count all the bees in the hive,
Chase all the clouds from the sky.
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh.
Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do,

Got a honey jar stuck on his nose.
He came to me asking help and advice
And from here no one knows where he goes.
So I sent him to ask of te Owl if he's there,
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear
So, help me if you can I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one

Loggins & Messina,"I'm thinking about when I was a sailor
Spent my time on the open seas
When we'd stay off the coast of Santa Barbara

I'd secretly steal ashore
The natives were waiting for
The boy with the lazy soul
To sing with the sailor

Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Every evening I'd be gone
Back on board by break of dawn

I'm thinking about the nights in Jamaica
Pretty girls dancin' here and there
Stole a keg and now I'm drunk as a sailor

The captain he don't know
Where Billy he done go
Singing with native girls
The songs of a sailor

Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Every single, single way
Gotta be back on board by break of day

Every night in Jamaica
I'd sing with the lady
And drink with the men till the morning appear

Healthy sunshine
Is fresh on my face
As the songs of the night puts
The ring in my ear

And stashed behind your couch

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines

By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads

Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man

I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug
Basedheads coming through looking for the plug

where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting
It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355

Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it Imma lay it out

What I pray about, check it uh yeah

I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -in the dead of night

If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up

Take the chance cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck

Hit you with the Beretta you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground

Only ones that know

Selling weed to my homies, and a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school

What to do, what would you
When will I lose my anonymity and become one with the enemy?
Tell me would I be the enemy, feel like nobody in front of me

Bobby what are you thinking?
What are you dreaming about?
Bobby, what’s inside?
What are you thinking right now?
What are you thinking?
Go to sleep

I guess that I was just thinking things would be different now
Cause when I wake up my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes
I wish that I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen, maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know
But tell me why
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons
Maybe not
All I know is this life I live I can’t live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive

Better believe and think down and leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass, I kill him, I kill him, I motherfucking kill him
I said I really want to kill him, but I can't
Cause if I do po po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it, I grip the mic and then kill it
Okay, I'm gone, as memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin’, sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little bobby, just a youngin’, skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can’t take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day I pay homage to the Gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I’m from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking out your colon
Catch me rollin’ with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I’m De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, another illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like Thriller
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don’t do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does

Hip Hop

I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be
Bitch, I said I bet I be
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me how is they gonna remember me
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love
And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove
Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop, and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending one must understand the prequel

I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

Spit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em then we gone",Soul Food
Logic,"It's the type of shit they read about
Like chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But def jam, said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with kid cudi and big
Conversations with no i.d
Who made hits with ye, got hits with jay
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant for me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again cause I love this shit
Write it down and they publish it
I went 5 years without a publicist, cause the word of mouth, they in love with this
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming
Went away a while but I've been fiending
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal
Been that way before the deal
Now the music got mass appeal
My main girl got ass appeal
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing
Little fish, that went mainstream
Now I'm big as fuck
My whole city, they know what's up
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit
I don't give a fuck
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt
When I'm talking business, I might erupt
If you're at the show, put your lighter up
Fuck with me if you're really bout it
Outsiders, I could do without it
I crept in, got slept on
Sold out shows, no one knew about it
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it
Your cosign, I could do without it

Laaa daaaa
Laaa daaaa la da da da daa da da da da da daaa

Okay, last verse I gotta make it count
Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I'd have to pause and I can't afford to just waste the bars
Every day boy I thank the lord, I got a lot of problems but could have more
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less
I been hungry like budapest
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck I just know I'm blessed
Love life even though I'm stressed
This business boy, I swear a test
Tell def jam if they don't cut the check, I'll send chris to go cut their neck
I love the building, no disrespect
But yall better ride when I'm in effect
That's radio, that's tv, but visionary got the internet
If yall fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist, imma intercept
It's my time, put half a mill of my own money in this album
That's my dime
No rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine
From the basement to the stadium
From the roxy to palladium
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor, half naked playing connect four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind and then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like go ahead
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme
So I gotta go, it's logic
The one nobody would vouch for, how's that shit for an outro

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
This is my story, til the end
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
This is my story, til the end
Yeah yeah

Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them
They may be misinformed about the truth
They may be misguided
Somebody has led them on the wrong path
A path of corruption and destruction
But yet god's mercy every day that they live
Is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved

Yeah yeah",Till the End

With a senorita and she sippin' liquor by the liter

He know we be in the casino lightin' Cubans with a C-note
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito whenever I step on the beat, ho

Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with the sawed off
Blowin' up like a molotov
This is war everybody ain’t no reason I'ma call it off

They tryna take my blessins away
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday
And I'm blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got champagne problems, and I order more my wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up
Hype nigga back-back-back it up
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop
That's the type of shit I boycott
Yellin' fuck the 5.0, state troops
Any nigga with a badge, I don't even trust the boy scouts
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me what the fuck you know about
Bein' that nigga that these niggas don't know a bout
Then they throw you in the game then you mothafuckin' blow it out
Now everything is alright

Hold up, let me get my mind right
Let me get my mind right
You know everything is alright
You know everything is all

Whippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off ‘em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain but I be killin' cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela
Hit you with a Beretta get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me

Now take a trip with me and vibe
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive
I'm gonna take this moment right now here and school them people
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people
Truly wish that I could, check it
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world
I see like different light, this music shit just ain't the world
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters
All different colors and creed all come together for me
Boy, I'm blessed to be free

This is our time
Still I'm looking back
Let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith
Let me rewind

Doing 70 on this highway
On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit
It's been like 3 months since I've been home
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it
Let me bring 'em back
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever
My endeavor like a feature film
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?
I'm in it, my limit the chillest
Let me bring 'em back, yo
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing
But I'm testing, reminiscing when I would listen to my intuition
And now I made it, resurrecting, Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated
It seem like everyone's somehow related
Letters back and forth from my homie that's locked up in prison
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in
What if the tables was turned and I was the one that been in, damn
He said he's seen me in the magazine
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel
That's been my dog from the kennel
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
Skipping class with all of my homies, on a constant search for who I was
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
I never graduated but I made it to the summit
Don't get me wrong, so many times I thought that I would plummet
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem to stomach
All of the beef around my way
I mean, I never wanted to live a life where all you're truly living is a lie
I knew I always wanted more and so they wonder why
I said they wonder why

This is our time
Still I'm looking back
Let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith
Let me rewind",Innermission
Logic,"Okay now this how I'm feeling
Lately I'm like the villain
'Cause while they on that other shit I been posted, out here chillin'
Lord willin', I'll survive, but not like that 9 to 5
You know this that shit that you bumpin' in your whip while you drive
I've been living life, and I hope that you do the same
Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game
By that time they know the name
Numb it down for the pain
This music my novacaine
Lord Willin' we over came
It's time to get over man
I've been around the world and back and I swear it's all the same
And what I learned, A profit don't do it for the profit gone get off
Check the topic watch me drop it, can you stop it
I don't know I've been at it on the low
Never did it like this here before
But I'm still here and I just hope I'll make a difference make a killin'

Lord willin'
Make a difference, lord willin'
Uh, lord willin'
I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand whats happening
And So I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand whats happening
So I tell em

I guess I'm back at it
I ain't done I ain't had it
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic
For this rap shit I'm an addict
But can't fuck with that dramatic
I've been busting my ass
They probably think it's automatic
Yes sir I've done this shit before like your baby momma momma
Imma tell 'em like it is, Imma tell 'em like it is
Life isn't picture perfect
We use the negatives to develop
I'm well up I'm way up
Nothing but ? fuck the layup, I'm way up
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions
Can't fuck with they delusions
I'm on that 101 cruisin'
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way
But no not quite like this live it like that
In a way yes you could say
Made me wanna write like this
Not quite like this on my level
I'm unique and I'm a rebel
Are you listening
I hope that you're listening
This feel like it's summertime
Waiting for the bus number nine
Through the city all alone
Not a worry, not your phone
We just vibing maybe flying 'round the world
Man, I hope you see the world
And all your dreams will unfurl
Just don't never cash your pearl
Go out there and make a living
Take this advice that I'm giving
Make a difference make a killin' make a killin'

Lord willin'
Make a difference, lord willin'
Uh, lord willin'
I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand whats happening

Logic,"I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams, I know I'mma do it, get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money, don't make me mention
That it'll cost you nothin' but time for you to pay attention
Now don't get me wrong, I know there's people out there hatin' on ya
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative
Talk all you want about me homie, I'mma let it live
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive
Hatin' in your blood, you was born to be negative

Never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

This is dedicated to everyone that never made it
And the people that persevered even though they was hated
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion
But on the real the road to success is prone to collision
And every now and then something happens that's unexpected
Like that newborn in your life because you fuckin' unprotected
And I swear nobody perfect, hell I know I ain't
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow, teach 'em everything I know
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one

I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right you

Logic,"Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious
I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born in a wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't tought me good
No one greedy inside my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it
Hold up now wait, take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that ""My Way""
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
With the fuckin' habits of a the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep
'Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker wide awake on the creep
Tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed
Watch 'em grown and then watch 'em lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC

Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise

I remember my life long ago in my adolescence
I could feel the presence in my residence
Hesitant even thought it was evident
I should get the fuck
I know something is wrong
Yeah, I know something is wrong
Feel like my mind gone
I know I play along, I might drown in this song
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed
Shot made me been unnoticed, huh, but maybe not
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
Walking to work and I go blind
Sippin' on that Koolaid, gettin' big wig money, that [?]
Look around and see people with no class, like snow on a school day
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu
Livin' life how I do is crazy
This shit never amaze me
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why
All I know is my mind racing
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it yeah I be pacing
Bitch I'm back again
Been here since way back when, now let that shit begin

This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise

This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming ""I knew it!""
This is real, so real
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
Most of these people will never hit fruition
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
All alone with no one to dial
I'm just a man, I got problems, understand
This is all I ever wanted, yes I do it for the fans
And I ain't perfect
I've questioned if this life was even worth it
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now

This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise",Paradise
Logic,"Me and my team gotta intervene
What's the point of livin' if you ain't livin' a dream?
We live in a era where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna feel ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming ""Money ain't a thing"", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew livin' out a dream meant livin' out a suitcase
I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get money
Run it

What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason why I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition
I let em listen, boy this been my house
This is merely an addiction, fuck 'em and their permission
They was killin' the game, who the one that gave 'em remission?
You know the name
Who else you know wanna come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your scull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget
Second time around shit is different cuh
They know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating, they can suck my dick
Run it

I'ma do somethin' different for the last one
I'ma go in

Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey on a Interstellar
Mission in Chicago at the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I got a berretta for people but I take care of the
People when I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done, had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No we ain't never aquainted
On the rise, look at defending
Now we trial for possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision, God damn
Can you feel it? Uh
I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot, just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation
Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people
Would have a song like mine in their rotation
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em, I'm too tied up
This a ransom
Fist full of money then we had back to the mansion
30 Thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
All the grass off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan
And anything you wanna do you can
You go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it 'less you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact you should take a step back
Cause I run it",Run It
Logic,"Motherfuckers wanna get famous
Bust guns and get dangerous (dangerous)
Daddy graduated from Cambridge
Money talks in every language
Real recognize that stainless
Silver spoon what my aim is
Y'all don't know what that game is
Y'all don't know what that uh
Y'all about that fraternity life
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come
Baby girl gon' be about that maternity life
If you do like my daddy then she gonna be single and
Alone that maternity life for eternity life
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life
'Cause we do what we do
But hold up let me get it right
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems
But not everyone need a .45 to solve them
Revolve them
Take care of all of them like this
I might just go crazy
All the way
Y'all live that live where your safety is only a call away
But not us
Momma and daddy never bought us
Not a god damn thing but they brought us
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust
Outside run around with a gun to bust
Police looking for every one of us
Back then yeah all of that was fun to us
Had a little bit of money in the middle
Let me hit 'em with a riddle
If I never had a dark night I might not not not not be the same
(Might not be the)

I know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, its sober
I Know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, its sober
And I want it ?

Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average
They cutthroat yeah they savage
They riding round with the baddest bitch
One day, I woke up, and said I'm bout to do for the rest of my life
No question it's right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light looking
At the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies
Where the truth dies and hatred multiplies, mu-mu-mu-multiplies
I said I can't take it
I remember if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around until the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate
And when the situation's delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no
I can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen
Stop spending money on things that glisten

I know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, its sober
I Know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, its sober
And I want it ?",Stainless

""Did he just say that?"" Yes, I did

Before I created this universe, I had to fly to the Bermuda first
6 on the beat then we queue the verse
Now I'm in another world when the flow emerge
Feel like I'm in a 5th element
I'm on my element lost in paradise
It's me, you and Leeloo Korben Dallas
And lost in paradise
Never by chance like a pair of dice
I don't give a fuck about their advice
I'm under the planet, no I'm not manic, bitch I'm decompressed
Know they can't stand it cause I pilot it and manned it the best

Causing mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smoking weed and getting higher then a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that’s in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a college park tenant
Still can’t believe I didn’t get a shorty pregnant
Man, that’s the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
'Cause I couldn’t keep it in my briefs, man that’s pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain’t a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can’t prevent it
I'm, forever alone in my mind
See I’m a self diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
Yeah, I know that I’m livin' like I got it okay, yeah
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah

Over here, over here
Over here, over here

Stackin’ money and playing the field man like Regis

Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval

Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden
The Return of the Jedi, bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do

Overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through
The B-I-G-L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio

To hold a brother down like the white man

Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of cuffs know we always keep it real

I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love

We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight

Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding an Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me
Different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest, man
It's kinda bittersweet, besides the shows and meet and greets y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare, I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, ""Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride""
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, ""Talk that shit""
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album
I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I've played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now
Just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' that by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age
They buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong
But back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I would've sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask

So what now?
What advice can you give me?
What advice can I give humanity?
I suppose so
Live your life
Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others
Remember that you’re not your salary
You’re not your house you’re not your car
And no matter how big your bank account is
Your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s
So enjoy the days you have
Worry not bout the days that came before you
Nor the ones that will follow you in death
Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed
And the fact that you are living is what life is all about
So live your life to the fullest
According to your happiness and the betterment of all

Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Oh no, man
I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, accept Him",AfricAryaN

It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one’s body
I’m not here
I’m not me
I’m not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can’t be anxiety
It can’t
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
I’m so in control of my mind and my body
But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Because now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant filling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are and we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxiety",Anziety

Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 am. Where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there, addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist
Which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make sense
But it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers
He was kidnapped, there was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said, said, said ""you wouldn’t be shit!""
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’mma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody, was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
Because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters
That were uneducated and that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant, they cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight, and kill, and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message
Of equality, for every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and
All this, because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home to about 8 or 9 hours of sleep
But spend 4, 5, 6 hours of that working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No no!
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah
Now I also want you to imagine people telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy.” “You ain’t never experienced that shit.”
“You from Gaithersburg, Maryland. Nothing happens there.”
“Oh no, no, we no, we weren’t there, we didn’t live with you, in your Section 8 household. 
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household. 
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside.” 
“And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
And this young man persevered, in spite of what people told him he was, wasn’t, would and would never be
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We're not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine

But if there's others like you, how can you be god?

Atom, I said you wouldn’t understand!

So what's the point of doing all this?

Really?

What?

A little cliche don’t you think?
Essentially asking Me the meaning of life

Well I figured I would ask before you send me back and I can’t remember none of this

Atom come here. The meaning of life
The reason I created this place, is so that you can grow, and mature

Like the human race?
Like this is how the human race is supposed to grow and mature?
Mature into what? We can’t even get along

No Atom, you! It’s for you, YOU to mature

I don't understand

I created this place for you, Atom
This entire place was made for you
Every time I send you back, every life you live, you grow
And mature and understand the grand meaning behind all of this
Just a little more each time

Just me? Wait, what about everybody else?

Atom, there is no one else

I don't understand

Atom, you are every human being who has ever existed since the dawn of your kind on earth

Wait, I'm everyone?

Aaahhhhh yes, now you are beginning to see it

So I’m like, everyone that ever existed on earth, ever?

Earth? Ha, that’s cute
Earth was just your birthplace
Let us not forget all the stars humanity will colonize over the millennia

Wait, that is so much
Too much to take in!
I’m every human being that ever lived?

Or ever will live, yes!

I’m Jesus?

And all of his disciples

I’m Hitler?

And the millions he murdered

That's deep

You see Atom, every act of hatred and violence you committed against another
You were committing against yourself
And every act of love and hand of kindness
You also extended unto yourself

God, why do all this?

Someday, long from now, you will become like me
You will mature to become what I am

I’m a god?

No, not yet. You see, I was once where you stand right now
It is not until you have lived every human life inside of your universe
That I may take you from this place
Once you have walked in the shoes of every race, religion, gender, sexual orientation
Loving and hateful person
It is only then that you will understand how precious life truly is",Waiting Room

White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black

Not accepted by the black or the white

Loïc Nottet,"My mother told me not to go near mirrors
For it seems that one day
A young boy died through looking at himself for too long

People say that they are ravenous
That they hunger for perfect reflections
That their insatiable appetites can even kill

Many are those among us who lose themselves in mirrors
Too many who only live for appearances
Aware that he is not the fairest of all, man is jealous and evil
And aware that he is not the ugliest of all, man is boastful and arrogant

The mirrors distort us, they hatch outsized egos inside us
Selfish. Self-centered
This is what they are reflecting from mankind
Why help someone if his misfortune allows us to advance?

Because it would seem that the more we look in them
The more our ears stop listening and our eyes stop seeing

And research your topics like you was some nerd
Push back, stand strong, use the beat as a shield
Then cut them all to pieces with the blade that you wield
Cause in a war like this, the mic is so much more
Leavin every punk bitch with they jaw on the floor
Another underground sucka getting up in the fight
Y'all be dissin while I'm spittin and im like

No motherfucker, I am not tech nine
But I'm going out of my way to take whats mine
Slappin marshal mathers with some grown up rhyme
This is loktavous, scarring music for all time

It goes
One for the bass
Two for the trouble
Three for the babes
And four for the hustle
This one is for the homies who died in the street
This is the siren song, everybody move to the beat,it goes
One for the bass
Two for the trouble
Three for the babes
And four for the hustle
This one is for the homies who died in the street
This is my intro, everybody move to the beat",Intro
Loktavious,"[Chorus x2]
If you tryna make a name, original is denied
You better have a dope chain, and be ready to ride
If you tryna make it famous, get money supplied
If you wanna be heard, it'd be best if you lied

[Verse 1: Loktavious]

Tell em you woke up in a new Bugatti
Took some shots with Miley
Bought a boat and took it all and that's why you feelin smiley
Oblige me
Tell me all the things I wanna hear
Deny me
Individuality of my peers
Control me
Until I'm lost in the years
Guide me
Right into my deepest fears
I don't wanna think, I wanna dance and party
I want deep bass so you can hear me hardly
I wanna get drunk, high, thizzled, zoned, gnarly
Stuck, fucked up, heaping up wheat and barley
Scar me
Direct me to your ego bubble
Harm me
Tell me that I cause no trouble
Make me give ya

[Chorus x2]

If you tryna make a name, original is denied
You better have a dope chain, and be ready to ride
If you tryna make it famous, get money supplied
If you wanna be heard, it'd be best if you lied

[Verse 2: Black Pegasus]
Dope chain, cocaine
Everybody say that spit propane
Fuckin all of these bitches with no name
I call em chinese food, they gettin lo mein
Ha, and who cares if it's identical?
Bite your style and say that it's original
Rap about money, we live in poverty
But who cares, lets throw out all the honesty
Cause i'm in the game now
I'm rocking 4chainz now
And it's still feeling like the slave ship
But fuck it man, i ain't gonna say shit...
I want

Spittin' out Thunderbolts, because fire's cliché
Even if you had a genie, couldn't wish me away
I am Loktavious, Bitch slap 'em for days
With my lyrical laceration, lobotomize 'em to slaves
Y'all look lost, confused
You must have not heard the news
I am gathering an Army built from the abused
Now anti-po assemble, it is you who i choose
(you who i choose)
So now i need you to feast, upon these so called 'beasts'
Tie em down, slice em up, from they head to they feets
One thousand little cuts, drag they ass down the street
Burn off all they clothes and fuck they corpse to the beat
Write my name in blood, scream 'here's your defeat'
Walk away with a grin, first mission complete
Return to the darkness, don't run just retreat
You'll be called again, pioneeers of the street

[Chorus: Loktavious]

Teeth are wreck, and I'm scrawny as fuck
Do not be fooled, I can destroy any blunt
Chicks always struggle when they gobble my nuts
One of many, but the only LOKTAVIOUS
Teeth are wreck, and I'm scrawny as fuck
Do not be fooled, I can destroy any blunt
Chicks always struggle when they gobble my nuts
One of many, but the only LOKTAVIOUS

My words bend the elements, call me Avatar Roku
Want beef with me son? I'll Pass on it like tofu
Too late for your defenses, I have already broke through
Bitch, you are Superman, AND I AM GOKU
If you on the hating train, best hop off that choo choo
Drop the act and the motive, y'all be see through
Come against my ancient magic, chakra morphing, word voodoo?
Please, there's not another, that can kill it like I do
1 up! 1 up! 1 up! 1 up!
It's a me, I got the fire flower
Here to fuck tonight up
Now let me see your signs. now let me see your hands
Rock the Dead, Hallelujah, where's a Dead Body Man?
Let me feel your aura, let me catch the vibe
Shall we stay in order? Or shall we kill Jedi?
Hope not to confuse with this diatribe
A spirit would be wise to avoid my kind

Se que tendrás que llorar

Era rodar y rodar

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

And we can sing it together, so I don't cry all alone

It's the one that reminds me of much better days

If I relive the laughter, then it won't feel like she's gone
I can't remember when I smiled, since she went away
I keep reaching behind me, today's so hard to face
And the silence reminds me of much better days
And it's too long to morning, since she's not in my sights

It's what's up front that counts

Let me tell you something
I don't play around girls like that
You know I don't really like to socialize with them
Because I feel like this.
What's mine is mine
What's yours is yours
You see I don't want nothing that's yours
I don't want nothing that looks at you
You see I know I got mine
I know I got him
I got every part of him
I got him from his hair to the tip of his toe
I know what I got
But let me tell you this
You see when you got somebody that loves you
You know they love
You can stand up here like me and tell the whole wide world
That I got my man (repeat)

London After Midnight,"Twilight the leaves fall,
The ground is oh so cold
Sing about God,
Sing on his death
Sing about love
And sing about sex
Your great mystery's a lie
Hypocrisy's the rule
Sing on
The Death of God

Of darkness and light,
Of heaven and hell,
Of sinful delights.
Beneath our feet lie shattered wings,
Our screams bring the awakening of God

So say goodbye to torture and lies,
And if there's a God pray he opens his eyes
His angels aren't the master race,
We'll tell him when we're face to face with God",[Untitled]
London After Midnight,"Oh the witching time,
Like a blackened pearl.
Oh how useless seem
The offers of this world.
A shroud is wrapped and bound,
To Gallows led away
Though innocence is mine.
The dog will have his day.

All the Love turned to Hate,
The blade is in too deep and your repentance comes too late.

Oh wits misery,
The madness of your stay.
The best revenge,
A price which you must pay.

The children hide behind,
Behind their little masks.
They are, at their games,
The only ones who laugh.

All the Love turned to Hate,
The blade is in too deep and your repentance comes too late.

So did I deserve,
Your lies and treachery.
The curtain closes now.
The bell, it tolls for thee.

All your lies, all your shame.
And it drives you even madder that you've got yourself to blame.

Your passion and your hate,
You promised more than bliss,
With your God and with your kiss,

I'm on my knees,
I beg your mercy,
My soul is my loss,
I'm well hung from your cross.

Take me,
Take me in your arms my love and rape me,
Don't hide behind your rage
I know you love me,
And always will,

You're my possession,
Of that my love there really is no question,
Don't hide behind your rage

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""

And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me

In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...

If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me

So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.

Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.

A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.

No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.

Cause you know I've got so much that I want to do,
When I dream I'm alone with you.
It's magic!
You wanted to leave me there, afraid of a love affair,
But I think you know, that I can't let go.

If you change your mind, I'm the first in line.
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.
If you need me, let me know, and I'll be around.
If you've got no place to go, when you're feeling down.
(take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown.
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie.
If you put me to the test, if you let me try.

Take a chance on me. (that's all I ask of you honey)
Take a chance on me.

Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry,
I know I'm gonna get ya. (get ya)
You don't want to hurt me, baby don't worry,
I ain't gonna let ya. (let ya)

Let me tell you now: my love is strong enough
To last when things are rough.
It's magic!
You say that I waste my time, but I can't get you off my mind,
No I can't let go, ''cause I love you so.

Hopping in...
If you like what you're seeing take a chance with me, ya!
You won't be grabbed, if you're feeling horny.
Well, you've passes so you got to know this precious property.
I don't know the lads, so call me MC K
Nobody sits, understand me clearly.
However hard he try, could he never own me.
We all fit nice and just move freely.
Special k, what he says all said carefully.
Me not sit all along and just wait by phone.
Not call me 'cause me never, never home ya.
Machine gun as we get the wrong one.
Master mark, master Paul, Mister Luke and John,
If we like what we see we chance a situation.
Nothing don't pay nothing, maybe see what follow on.
What a Jill may do if the right man come?
Hey reagge boat, come we just have a little fun!
Go now!

Pabbabbabba ba, pabbabbabbabba ba ba
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie.
If you put me to the test, if you let me try.
(take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown.
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie.
If you put me to the test, if you let me try.
(take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
