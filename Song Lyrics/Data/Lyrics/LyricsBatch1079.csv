Paul Holmes,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You
Paul Holmes,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Paul Holmes,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Paul Holmes,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow
Paul Holmes,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Paul Hopkins,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling
Paul Horn,"Sunday, Monday or Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday
I want you near
Every day in the year

Oh, won't you tell me when
We will meet again
Sunday, Monday or always

If you're satisfied
I'll be at your side
Sunday, Monday or always

No need to tell me now
What makes the world go 'round

My heart begins to pound and pound

And what am I to do
Can't I be with you

Always and forever I must be with you
Beginning Sunday and Monday and then forever

Paul Horn,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on

",On Green Dolphin Street
Paul Horn,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong a man ain't got a friend
Without a song
That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no how
Without a song        
I got my trouble and woe but, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll        
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song
I've-a got my trouble and woe and, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
I'll-a never know what makes that rain to fall
I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song",Without a Song
Paul Horn,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Paul Horn,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day [Live]
Paul Howards,"This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet another guy
Understand me won't you try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye",Kiss and Say Goodbye
Paul Howards,"Now, I'm craving your body,
Is this real
Temperatures rising, I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
Woahh and I'm; longing to love you
Just for a night,
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you 
With all my might 
Reasons, the reasons that we hear,
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings a-won't disappear
Oooh! And- after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade 

LA-LA-LA
After all our reasons why
All the reasons were a why
After all the reasons lo-ove was left aside 
And, longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might, baaaaby
Oooohhh, baby! 
Reasons, the reasons that we hear,
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings a-won't disappear 
Oooh! And after the love games have been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade 
And, in the morning when I rise,
No longer feeling hynotized
For no reasons, our reasons, our reasons
Have no pri-ii-de

After all the reasons why
All of the reasons were a lie
After all the reasons why lo-ove was left aside 
Heeehhhhh, ooooh, yeaahhh, oohhh Baby,
I can't find the reasons
That my love won't disappear
Can't find the reasons
Why I love you ,my baby, my dear
Can't find the reasons

Paul Humphrey,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Now ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes",Ain't That Peculiar
Paul Humphrey,"Just one more mornin'
I had to wake up with the blues
Pulled myself outta bed, yeah
Put on my walkin' shoes
Went up on the mountain
To see what I could see
The whole world was fallin'
Right down in front of me

'Cause I'm hung up on dreams
I'll never see, yeah baby
Ah, help me baby
Or this will surely be the end of me, yeah

Pull myself together
Put on a new face
Climb down off the hilltop, baby
Get back in the race

'Cause I'm hung up on dreams
I'll never see, yeah baby
Ah, help me baby
Or this will surely be the end of me, yeah

Pull myself together

Paul Jabara,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you

Keeping us apart
And in return
I'm left with just my broken heart
I close my eyes

Ah-huh
And have we got news for you
You better listen!
Get ready,  all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home.
Alright!

Humidity is rising, barometer's getting low
According to all sources, the street's the place to go
Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men.

It's raining men! Hallelujah! It's raining men! amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amennnn!

Moving in about to begin
Hear the thunder
Don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy

Paul Jacobsen,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?

Paul Jacobsen,"Beware or someday you might regret you ever cared 
For someone who know me I'm at the end of running scared, 
Planning parachutes, escape routes in midair. 
Hoping that you catch yourself back at square one, 
These days we'll both be fine.
Every, everybody says it just takes time 
And all the clocks are crawling now, 
It feels like days since the sun cracked out.

I'm sorry that it didn't work, you must think I'm just a jerk, 
For singing this today, but I never meant to make you feel this way.

My cousin Anne, said I'm a real sorry excuse for a man. 
And I take it personally except I am, still wondering how she hurt.
Fly on the wall a little bird 
Walls that talk telephone and scream how everyone knows everything.

I'm sorry that it had to hurt you must think that I'm the worst, 
For singing this today but I never meant to make you feel this way

There were days, when the first thought that came with the rising sun, 
Were how many hours until the day was done, 
And I hoped that I would only cry just once.

So hearts, should come with disclaimers warnings from the start, 
Before I could fall or we could grow apart, 
And me still thinks I'm wrong though I know I feel much better moving on 
Still the time keeps slowing down and sometimes can I still come around

I'm sorry that it didn't work, you must think that I'm a jerk",Sorry

I'm a diamond changing
I want to get lost in your cool invasion
I'm not lookin'

For luck or money
Just pour like sugar
Stick like honey
Girl can't you tell that I'm

[Chorus]

Your roll me in
And you wrap me up
You rock my heart
In the cradle
The cradle of love

Paul Janz,"Every little word you say
Every little breath you steal
Every one just drives me crazy
Baby, it's the way I feel
I'll do anything you ask me
Everything I'll do for you
'Cause darlin' you're my main attraction
You give me such tenderness
I think I love you
Spend my nights just dreamin' of you
Don't you want me
Say you need me baby
Take my hand
1st chorus
Every little tear you cry
Every little heartache in the night
You know I'll be there for you baby
I can't stop wanting you
Every little hurt you're hiding
Every single one you hold
Every little tear you're crying
Resting in your eyes like gold
Everything's a stimulation
Every little thing you touch
Ooh, you're so intoxicating
You give me such tenderness
I think I love you
Spend my nights just dreamin' of you
Don't you want me
Say you need me baby
Take my hand
2nd chorus
Every little tear you cry
Every little heartache in the night
You know I'll be there for you baby
I can't stop wanting you
Every little tear you cry
Every little heartache in the night
You know I love you too much baby
And I'd rather be there with you
Think about it
You could have everything
Think about it
Can't you see what love can bring
Think about it
Turn around don't walk away
Think about it
I can't stop wanting you

Paul Jeffrey,"Ben, the two of us need look no more,
We both found what we were looking for.
With a friend to call my own,
I'll never be alone, and you, my friend, will see,
You've got a friend in me.
Ben, you're always running here and there,
You feel you're not wanted anywhere.
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
Ben most people would turn you away;
I don't listen to a word they say.
They don't see you as I do;
I wish they would try to'
I'm sure they'd think again if they had a friend like Ben,
A friend like Ben

She made a ride that caused a scene
In the town

Her long blonde hair

Prayin' for a little breeze
Her long blonde hair
Falling down across her arms
Hiding all the lady's charms

She found fame and made her name
A hollywood director came into town
And said to her
""How'd you like to be a star?""
""You're a girl that could go far""
""'specially dressed the way you are""
She smiled at him
Gave her pretty head a shake

And people now are craning their necks
To see her

I swear I won't give in
Then my baby starts to smile at me

I see those big bright eyes
And then I realize
That girl is gonna get her way

When my little girl is smiling
I can't stay mad at her for long
Why should I want to fight

Paul Jones," took my little Jenny to a party last night 
At ten o'clock it ended in a heckuva fight 
When someone hit my Jenny she went out like a light 
Poor Jenny 

And then some joker went and called the cops on the phone 
So everybody scattered out for places unknown 
I couldn't carry Jenny so I left her alone 
Poor Jenny 

Well Jenny had her picture in the paper this mornin' 
She made it with a bang 
Accordin' to the story in the paper this mornin' 
Jenny is the leader of a teenage gang 

Jenny has a brother and he's hot on my trail 
Her daddy wants to ride me out of town on a rail 
I hope I'll be around when Jenny gets out of jail 
Poor Jenny 

I went downtown to see her, she was locked in a cell 
She wasn't very glad to see me, that I could tell 
In fact, to tell the truth, she wasn't lookin' too well 
Poor Jenny 

Her eye was black, her face was red, her hair was a fright 
She looked as though she'd been a'cryin' half of the night 
I told her I was sorry, she said ""Get out of sight"" 
Poor Jenny 

It seems a shame that Jenny had to go get apprehended, a heckuva fate 
This party was the first one she ever had attended 
It had to happen on our very first date 

Jenny has a brother and he's hot on my trail 
Her daddy wants to ride me out of town on a rail 
I hope I'll be around when Jenny gets out of jail

Paul Jones,"Once I believed that when love came to me
It would come with rockets, bells and poetry
But with me and you it just started quietly and grew
And believe it or not
Now there's something groovy and good
Bout whatever we got
And it's getting better
Growing stronger warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
I don't feel all turned on and starry eyed
I just feel a sweet contentment deep inside
Holding you at night just seems kind of natural and right
And it's not hard to see
That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be
Cause it's getting better
Growing stronger, warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
And just like a flower that takes time to bloom
This love of ours is taking time to grow
Ba da da da da da da da da da da da
And I don't mind waitin', don't mind waitin'
Cause no matter how long it takes

That it's getting better

And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me)

Paul Joseph,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

On my own, apart from You

This only serves to confirm my suspicions
That I'm still a man in need of a Savior

I want to be in the Light
As You are in the Light
I want to shine like the stars in the heavens
Oh, Lord be my Light and be my salvation
Cause all I want is to be in the Light
All I want is to be in the Light 

The disease of self runs through my blood
It's a cancer fatal to my soul
Every attempt on my behalf has failed
To bring this sickness under control 

Tell me, what's going on inside of me?
I despise my own behavior
This only serves to confirm my suspicions
That I'm still a man in need of a Savior

Honesty becomes me
[There's nothing left to lose]
The secrets that did run me
[In Your presence are defused]
Pride has no position
[And riches have no worth]
The fame that once did cover me
[Has been sentenced to this Earth]
Has been sentenced to this Earth

This only serves to confirm my suspicions
That I'm still a man in need of a Savior

Yeah you gotta watch out if you sneeze
For swingin' up there in the breeze
You`re liable to cough
You might very well fall off
And tumble down flop on your knees-knees
Tumble down flop on your knees

And when the stormy winds wail
And the breezes blow high in a gale
There's a curious dropping and flopping and plopping
And fat little babies just hail-hail
Fat little babies just hail

And the babies lie there in a pile
And the adults they come after awhile
And they always pass by

And take only babies that smile-smile
They take only babies that smile...

",Let's Go Together
Paul Kantner,"Hide witch hide the good folks come to burn thee
Their keen enjoyment hid behind a gothic mask of duty

Put your old ladies back into bed
Put your old men into their graves
Cover their ears so they can't hear us sing
Cover their eyes so they can't see us play
Get out of the way
Let the people play
We're gonna get down on you
Come alive all over you
Dancin' down into your town

You know tyrannosaurus rex was destroyed before
By a furry little ball that crawled along
The primeval jungle floor
He stole the eggs of the dinosaur
Close your eyes & create the sound
Open your hands & rebuild the ground
We are egg snatchers -
Flashin' sunshine children
Bunch of diamond thieves

You unleash the dogs
Of a grade-b movie star governor's war
While you sit in the dark -
Insane with the fear of dying
We'll ball in your parks
Insane with the flash of living

I'm alive
I am human
I will be alive again
So drop your fuckin' bombs
Burn your demon babies
I will be again
Rabid lover-feelin' the starch in your grin
Callin' for acid cocaine and grass
And receiving your homemade gin
Push the button
Pull the switch
Cut the beam
C'mon make it march
Sign me up as a diplomat, my only office is the park

You need to be out before you come in
After you come you go
In the midst of yang is a smaller part of yin
And when it happens you know 
The dawn comes

Hey dick
Whatever you think of us is totally irrelevant
Both to us now and to you
We are the present
We are the future
You are the past
Pay your dues and get outta the way
'Cause we're not the way you used to be
When you were very young
We're something new
We don't quite know what it is
Or particularly care
We just do it - you gotta do it
Let the music do it, take you there
Do it, do it, do it gotta do it
Something new, something new, something new
New, new

Open your eyes there's a new world a-comin'
Open your eyes there's a new world today
Open your hearts people are lovin'
Open it all we've come to stay
I said, open it all we've come to stay
I said, open it all we've come to stay
People, hey you people, everybody
Us young people come to stay
I said, people, on relief
We've all come to stay
Open your eyes there's a new world a-comin'
Open it all we've come to stay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, open it all
Open it, open it, baby,
Now open that door",Mau Mau (Amerikon)

What you gonna do when you feel your lady rollin'
How you gonna feel when you see your lady strollin'
On the deck of the starship
With her head hooked into andromeda
C'mon hijack
Gotta get back and ahead to the things that matter
Amerika hates her crazies
And you gotta let go you know
Gotta let go you know
Gotta let go you know
Gotta let go you know or else you stay
Spillin' out of the steel glass
Gravity gone from the cage
A million pounds gone from your heavy mass
All the years gone from your age
Hydroponic gardens and forests
Glistening with lakes in the jupiter starlite
Room for babies and byzantine dancing astronauts of renown
The magician and the pantechnicon
Take along the farmer and the physician
We gotta get out and down
Back into the future
Beyond our own time again
Reachin' for tomorrow
It's so fine starshine
The melting acid fever streakin' through my mind
Makes it oh so difficult to see you
And oh so easy to touch you
I melt with you
Feel with you
Make love for you
At you
Around you
I love you

Dear brumus, the ship'll be ours and you got to roll with it
Though your master's head's blown off you got to go with it
Roll with the natural flow
Like water off a spinning ball
Out - the one remaining way to go
Free - the only way to fall
The light in the night is the sun
And it can carry you around the planetary ground
And the planetary whip of the sun
Will carry you well past gideon
And the people you see will leave you be
More than the ones you've known before
Hey - rollin' on
We come and go like a comet
We are wanderers
Are you anymore? 
The land is green and you make it grow
And you gotta let go you know
You gotta let go you know
You gotta let go you know
Or else you stay
Mankind gone from the cage
All the years gone from your age
At first
I was irridescent
Then
I became transparent
Finally
I was essence",Starship

I want my food!

What if you were
Starving to death and
They only food you had
Was me - what would
You say to the cannibal
Question? Would your
Answer be perfectly
Free?

Your mama told you never
To eat your friends
With your fingers and
Hands, but I say you
Ought to eat what
You will - shove it
In your mouth any way

You think that I will come
To your mouth, looking for
A home. But I get stuck
Sideways in your throat

Bone.

He just got back from the open

Family feast - let all the
Hungry drool roll down
Your chin. Hide the human
And bring out the beast.
Let all the animal games begin!

Where are the bodies for dinner?
I want my food!
You could leave to dine on
Your friends - pour their
Bones into a cannibal soup
Muscles like steak
Blood like wine - save
The brains to feed to troops

Your mama told you never
To eat your friends
With your fingers and
Hands, but I say you
Ought to eat what
You will - shove it
In your mouth any way
That your can.

Scarlet juices ozing
Slow - boiling in a
Human sea.
Is it human dinner
You're talking about?
Then slice me tender
Raw and lean
Where are the bodies
For dinner?
I want my food!

Oily fingers can hardly
Wait - bodies slumped
Face in plate
Wake up the drunks
The coffers on
The fourteenth course
Has come and gone.

Your candy has
Come and gone
And its left you
With your mouth
Wide open.

Cannibal songs.",Silver Spoon
Paul Kantner,"What would it gain me
If I was to go?
Like Jacob of old
To the well of the world

To wax halls where candles
Burn on through the day
To light you a path
So you'd never lose your way

I was down in the valley
Where the shadows are long
The birds in the harp tree
Were singing this song

There is time to deliver
Time to receive
All that you're lacking
Of whatever you need

Turn around, by the by
You'll still see the sea
As it was in the dawning
As it always will be

Raise up your bottles
And drink down the blood
You planted the vine here
In spite of the flood

Turn an ear to the harp tree
An eye to the wall
The songs in the singing
Or nowhere at all

No where to come from
No place to retire
No shelter nowhere
Except in the fire

The birds in the harp tree
Can finish their song
Then rest in its branches
Which is where they belong

But where can a man go
That's sweet to his soul
When his time is not ready
But he's still turning old

Here's a dream for the piper
And a tune for his lady
Outside the thin wall
The waves are still raging

Here's one for the harp tree
And one for his song
One for the morning
When the night was too long

Here's one for the candle
That lights you to bed
And one for the sword
That hangs over your head
",Harp Tree Lament

Walkin' on the ocean water
Walkin' down the road to glorytown
Lookin' for the Pharaoh's daughter
I'm goin' down and if I don't come back
Tie all my dope on a wire wheel track
Give it to the man who'll have them back
From my life, from my life

Oh... Honey have a time on me
Oh... Baby getcha high on me
Oh... Won't you try a dance on me

Take off your tie, but don't leave the dance

How lost I feel without you
Miles away I really can't believe I'm near
And how I still care about you
 
Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
 
Is everything the same do you ever think of me
And how we loved one another
Will you change your mind will you wander back
Again or have you found yourself a new love
 
Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
 
Is everything okay I just thought I'd write a song
To tell the world   how I miss you
Cause each and every day I think of all the words
I never said and all the chances that I had you

We'd get by.
If only you believe in miracles, so would I. 
If only you believe in miracles, so would I. 

I might have to move heaven and earth to prove it to you, baby.

So we're making love, you feel the power and I feel the power.
And there's really nothing we can('t) do
(You know we could, you know we could)
If we wanted to
(You know we could, you know we could)
We could exist on the stars, it was so easy.

(Oh Baby)
All we got to do is get a little faith in you.

Woah, I've been so many places I've seen some things (yes I have)

I know that love is the answer (yes it is)

Keeps holding this world together (oh yeah)

Ain't nothing better? Ain't nothing better?(Nothing's better!)

And all the answers to our prayers,
Hell, it's the same everywhere. (just the same now)

Nothing ever breaks up the heart(love's a game now)
only your tears give you away (Ain't it a shame now).

When you're right where I found you(oh baby)
with my arms  around you. (oh baby)

Baby, baby.
Love is a magic word if you ever find inner life

But from that very first look in your eyes 
I see you and I have but one
heart.

Only our bodies were apart (it's making me crazy)
That was so easy, so easy.

I had a taste of the real world (Just a drop of it)
When I went down on you, girl, oh.

I can hear windmills and rainbows whenever you talkin' to me

(Never say never)

I feel like swirling and dancing whenever you walk in with me

You ripple like the river when I touch you (let me touch you)
Then I pluck your body like a string (show you what I mean)
Then I start dancing inside you (oh baby, a love song)

Oh baby in a love song, aw baby
Oh yeah, yeah, alright
Baby we're sure doin' it tonight

Every time you come by let me try (come on by)
Pretty please, with sugar on it, that's how I like it, ugh.

I can't even believe it with you

It's like having every dream I ever wanted 
(Dream of a lifetime) come true.

I picked up your vibes, you know (I'm having a fine time)
It opened my mind but I'm still dreaming.

Yeah (sarcastic Grace mini-orgasm)
And you're right where I found you, with my arms around you! (oh baby).",Miracles

We said we'd be together till the day we died
How could something so good turn so bad?
I'd do it all again 'coz you're the best I've ever had

Darling it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight

See that man with the glad hands
I want to kill him but it wouldn't be right
Now here comes another man with the gladbags
I want to break him but it's not my fight
In one hand and out the other
Baby I don't even know why you bother

Loudly at your door
And you know it must be bad news

What you already know
Lay not a finger on him
Beat not oh bruise not

No don't ever harm the messenger 

Understand he came a long way
Only on a lonely road
Multiplying were his trials
Heavy was his load
Understand his heart was breaking
Never once did he sleep
And no hollow log kept him warm
No council did he keep
Give him food, give him a bed
Touch not one single hair on his head

Paul Kelly,"Paul Kelly (Mushroom Music)
Late on a Friday my husband went up to the mountains with three friends
They took provisions and bottles of bourbon to last them all through the weekend
One hundred miles they drove just to fish in a stream
And there's so much water so close to home
When they arrived it was cold and dark; they set up their camp quickly
Warmed up with whisky they walked to the river where the water flowed past
Darkly
In the moonlight they saw the body of a young girl floating face down
And there's so much water so close to home
When he hold me now I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white
It was too hard to tell how long she'd been dead, the river was that close
To freezing
But one thing for sure, the girl hadn't died very well to judge from the
Bruising
They stood there above her all thinking the same thoughts at the same time
There's so much water so close to home
They carried her downstream from their fishing; between two rocks they
Gently wedged her
After all they'd come so far, it was late
And the girl would keep; she was going nowhere
They stayed up there fishing for two days
They reported it on Sunday when they came back down
There's so much water so close to home
When he holds me now I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white
The newspapers said that the girl had been strangled to death and also molested
On the day of the funeral the radio reported that a young man had been arrested
I went to the service a stranger; I drove past the lake out of town
There's so much water so close to home
When he holds me now I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white

Paul Kelly,"I woke up with all my clothes on,
Cigarette smoke in my hair,
Unglued my eyes and saw a dirty room,
Spilling ashtray by my bed
Empty bottle on the chair

No one else was there

I was ready in two minutes flat
Just washed my face and combed my hair
I had an eight-twenty-five train to catch
I was out there,
Flying thought the front door
Then I hit the air!

No you! No you! No you! No you!
No you, no you, no you!

I was sucked into the subway
Like an ant into a hole
I stood in the crowded carriage
Shoulder to shoulder
The wheels began to roll
A tattoo in my soul

I do not lack good companions
To pick a man up when he's down
We go to the track on Saturdays
Spread our money 'round
I go up and down
And every single sound says
No you! No you! No you! No you!
No you, no you, no you!",No You

Many lives I could have lived, many trails taken
It always seems that way at twenty-three
You walk into a room sometime and then a window opens
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
A morning train I had to catch, I just lay there sleeping
There was nothing in that town to hold me
By the time the clock had done another day of creeping
My life had changed forever in the south of Germany
Oh I'm sorry that today I have to go away
Seven children I have raised, I love some more than others
The hardest thing to do is to set them free
So I learned my lesson hard seven times all over
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
I never was the kind of girl for acting sentimental
I never called our meeting destiny
I just call it good luck to meet a man so gentle
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
Oh I'm so sorry that today I have to go away
Sometimes when I wake at night I'm dreaming of another
Then I turn and touch him next to me
And I know where I belong; still I sometimes wonder
My life changed forever in the south of Germany
Oh I'm so sorry that today I have to go away

Paul Kelly,"In the morning we wreck the bed
You bring me coffee black and boiling
Then we start up again and the coffee goes cold

Kisses warm and tender
And I'd give up the word just to see you smile
One thing I will never understand (It's become my problem)
And it's something that's right out of my hands (My hands are clean)
What makes such a sweet guy turn so mean?
I went to town with a moody man, a handsome Dr. Jekyll
He was right by my side turning into Mr. Hyde
I ran for cover but I ran too slow; I was stitched by strangers
And they shook their heads that someone could do the things you did
One thing I will never understand (It's become my problem)
And it's something that's right out of my hands (My hands are clean)
What makes such a sweet guy turn so mean?
I must be mad, I must be crazy, everyone tells me so
Everyday I see it coming, now I'm facing the wall, waiting for the blow
In the morning you kiss my head
You say it was another
Now you're down on your knees
Begging me to forgive you please
I wake up aching from your touch
Every muscle tender
Then I look in your eyes, the way you smile
And I'm hypnotized

Paul Kelly,"Sydney, 1926, this is the story of a man
Just a kid in from the sticks, just a kid with a plan
St George took a gamble, played him in first grade
Pretty soon that young man showed them how to flash the blade
And at the age of nineteen he was playing for the State
From Adelaide to Brisbane the runs did not abate
He hit 'em hard, he hit 'em straight 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

A team came out from England
Wally Hammond wore his felt hat like a chief
All through the summer of '28, '29 they gave the greencaps no relief
Some reputations came to grief
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
And in the hour of greatest slaughter the great avenger is being born
But who then could have seen the shape of things to come
In Bradman's first test he went for eighteen and for one
They dropped him like a gun
Now big Maurice Tate was the trickiest of them all
And a man with a wisecracking habit
But there's one crack that won't stop ringing in his ears
""Hey Whitey, that's my rabbit""
Bradman never forgot it 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

England 1930 and the seed burst into flower
All of Jackson's grace failed him, it was Bradman was the power
He murdered them in Yorkshire,he danced for them in Kent
He laughed at them in Leicestershire, Leeds was an event
Three hundred runs he took and rewrote all the books
That really knocked those gents
The critics could not comprehend hsi nonchalant phenomenon
""Why this man is a machine,"" they said. ""Even his friends say he isn't human""
Even friends have to cut something 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand 

Summer 1932 and Captain Douglas had a plan
When Larwood bowled to Bradman it was more than man to man
And staid Adelaide nearly boiled over as rage ruled over sense
When Oldfield hit the ground they nearly jumped the fence
Now Bill Woodill was as fine a man as ever went to wicket
And the bruises on his body that day showed that he could stick it
But to this day he's still quoted and only he could wear it
""There's two teams out there today and only one of them's playing cricket."" 

He was longer than a memory, bigger than a town
He feet they used to sparkle and he always kept them on the ground
Fathers took their sons who never lost the sound of the roar of the grandstand 

Now shadows they grow longer and there's so mush more yet to be told
But we're not getting any younger, so let the part tell the whole
Now the players all wear colours, the circus is in town
I can no longer go down there, down to that sacred ground 

He was more than just a batsman
He was something like a tide
He was more than just one man
He could take on any side
They always came for Bradman 'cause fortune used to hide in the palm of his hand",Bradman
Paul Kelly,"From St Kilda to Kings Cross is thirteen hours on a bus
I pressed my face against the glass and watched the white lines rushing past
And all around me felt like all inside me
And my body left me and my soul went running 
Have you ever seen Kings Cross when the rain is falling soft?
I came in on the evening bus, from Oxford Street I cut across
And if the rain don't fall too hard everything shines just like a postcard
Everything goes on just the same
Fair-weather friends are the hungriest friends
I keep my mouth well shut, I cross their open hands 
I want to see the sun go down from St Kilda Esplanade
Where the beach needs reconstruction, where the palm trees have it hard
I'd give you all of Sydney Harbour (all that land, all that water)
For that one sweet promenade",From St. Kilda to Kings Cross
Paul Kelly,"His mother always let him stay up late on Fridays. 
They would lie in her room together watching TV. 
Sometimes she fell asleep before he did and he'd be watching a talk show - one person talking, then another, then all this laughter coming from nowhere. 
Next thing he knew she would be shaking hime gently. 
'Wake up little one, wake up'. 
Saturday morning. So he'd get up, dress himself, put his shoes on and leave the house without breakfast. 
Breakfast always came later in other people's houses.
They had to catch two buses to reach their destination and the trip seemed to take forever unless he fell asleep along the way. When they got off at their stop they were in a bigger, brighter neighbourhood. 
The houses were a long was back from the street and some of them were hidden from view by big hedges. 
Looking down the street was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope. 
His mother guided him through this country. 
She knew exactly where to go. 
She carried in her bag a big, heavy ring full of keys - all keys to other people's houses.
She would turn one of the keys in the lock. 
Some of the doors needed two keys. 
Then presto, they were in. 
The houses had so many things in them yet still so much space. 
He like to rub his feet quickly on the thick pile then touch a door knob with one finger and give himself a small electric shock. 
In the first house they always went straight to the refrigerator. 
There were things in there he couldn't imagine anyone ever eating - strange looking pastes in jars and horrible concoctions in plastic. His mother would sit him down with a jam sandwich and a glass of milk, then set to work cleaning other people's houses.
And so they would go all day long from one house to another, his mother scrubbing, mopping, vacuuming, cleaning, tidying up, leaving him to his own devices. Often if no-one was home, she would play music on the stereo. There was one record she always put on and sang along to. 
It had two men and two women on the cover and they all looked sort of blonde except for one of the women had dark hair. 
The stereo flickered like the controls of a spaceship. 
Other houses were full of books and sometimes he was allowed to take one of the books down from the shelves and open it up. There were books on war and cricket and movie stars. 
He liked to look at the pictures and pick out big words that he knew. 
He was very careful with the books. 
He was very careful with everything in other people's houses.
Many of the houses had other children in them. 
They would rush right past him into the yard. 
He'd follow them out back where the backyard was as big as the house, sometimes even bigger. 
He'd play with them for a while then sit on the steps watching them. 
He felt slower than the others. 
There was a girl about his age who lived in a house they went to every second Saturday. 
Her name was Stephanie. 
She used to take him everywhere with her, wherever she went, all around the house, even into her room. 
He'd never see his mother until it was time to leave. 
One Saturday his mother told him Stephanie and her family had moved away. 
Just like that. He still thinks of her now, twenty years later, moving, laughing, sitting down to dinner, making conversation, making love in other people's houses.",Other People's Houses

I was playing in a bar
She walked in with my girlfriend
My foolish girlfriend brought her there

She looked so pretty and dangerous
As she brushed back her hair
And I was not the only one
Taking notice in that bar

When I first kissed your mother
I was single once again
We walked through Fitzroy Gardens

There she took my hand
We could not stop our kissing
Then she whispered in my ear
'Soon you'll get to know me,

So let's not go too far'

Inside her father's house
We tired so to be quiet

Then her dad came pounding and kicked me out of there

With your glass of sorrow you seem so far from home

Little boy you look so clear around the eyes
And what they've got in store for you
You may not realise
So be careful when you hear the voices call
Watch out little boy don't lose your balls
'Cause you never know the rules until you play
First they stroke you then they screw you,
Try to take your balls away
And once they've gone they're way beyond recall
Watch out little boy don't lose your balls
Balls run wild
Balls may get way out of line
You may not even know you've
Left your balls way behind
You know money only buys you what you want
And you can't buy your balls back
Like you buy a pair of pants
And once they're gone you've really got fuck all
Watch out little boy don't lose your balls

You just can't push it through

Just wants to eat and then run
She says ""Baby what's your hurry

To get this over and done?""

Paul Kelly,"How many cabs in New York City, how many angels on a pin?
How many notes in a saxophone, how many tears in a bottle of gin?
How many times did you call my name, knock at the door but you couldn't get in?

I know I've been careless

I've been wrapped up in a shell, nothing could get through to me
Acted like I didn't know I had friends and family
I saw worry in their eyes, it didn't look like fear to me

I know I've been careless
I lost my tenderness
I've been careless
I took bad care of this

Like a mixture in a bottle, like a frozen over lake
Like a long-time, painted smile I got so hard I had to crack
You were there, you held the line, you're the one that brought me back

Paul Kelly,"Welcome, strangers, to the show
I'm the one who should be lying low
Saw the knives out, turned my back
Heard the train coming, stayed out on the track
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

Caught the fever, heard the tune
Thought I loved her, hung my heart on the moon
Started howling, made no sense
Thought my friends would rush to my defence
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things

And I get all your good advice
It doesn't stop me from going through these things twice
I see the knives out, I turn my back
I hear the train coming, I stay right on that track
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things
I melted wax to fix my wings

I threw my hat into the ring

Paul Kelly,"Gather round people let me tell you're a story
An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri
Were opposite men on opposite sides

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Vestey man said I'll double your wages
Seven quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said uh-huh we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land
Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow
Vince said if we fall others are rising

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Then Vincent Lingiarri boarded an aeroplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
This affair they told him is a matter of state
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry
Vincent said no thanks, we know how to wait

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

That was the story of Vincent Lingairri
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege can not move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Paul Kelly,"We dance in the kitchen on Boxing Day
I held you swaying in my arms to Marvin Gaye
Our Christmas ham turned green by New Year's Eve
We weren't hungry anyway

Now sometimes we see eacdh other on the street
Maybe at a hotel or some party
We say hello then we have to go
I can't believe we were married

That we were wed 
Our houses were a shambles, our love conspiracy
Your hand was always down my pants
before our guests could leave

They didn't like our drugs, our children or our dogs
The way we made it up each day
Now the kids have grown, we talk on the phone
If one of them is sick or needs some money

Our words are dry, so measured and polite
I can't believe we were married
That we were wed 
Now maybe if I'm with someone you come into my mind

The one I knew with your certain little cries
You're not the only one to come rushing in
It's like a party line
Yeah sometimes we see each other on the street

Maybe at a concert or some party
We say hello talk about the show
I can't believe we were married

He looks a lot like me
They say that man is going down

I heard somebody talking

Paul Kelly,"They got married early, never had no money
Then when he got laid off they really hit the skids
He started up his drinking, then they started fighting
He took it pretty badly, she took both the kids
She said: ""I'm not standing by, to watch you slowly die
So watch me walking, out the door""
She said, ""Shove it, Jack, I'm walking out the fucking door""

She went to her brother's, got a little bar work
He went to the Buttery, stayed about a year
Then he wrote a letter, said I want to see you
She thought he sounded better, she sent him up the fare
He was riding through the cane in the pouring rain
On Olympic to her door

He came in on a Sunday, every muscle aching
Walking in slow motion like he'd just been hit
Did they have a future? Would he know his children?
Could he make a picture and get them all to fit?
He was shaking in his seat riding through the streets
In a silvertop to her door",To Her Door

Walking through cold city streets like lovers do
Stopped inside a market
Kissed behind a stall

Someone said you'd better move on
If you're not buying at all
Then I saw the winter coat hanging on the rack
I thought about that winter coat

Hanging on my back
So you helped me try it on
It was just my size
Then you bought that coat for me

After haggling over the price
Now when it's chilly Up in these cold cold hills
I just put on my winter coat

Keeps me warm

Years have gone
Some friends have risen

Some have moved on

Hangs by my front door
Holding all the stories

We don't have to hide away
We can walk along Broadway

Our secret's out

You're the one I'm proud to have by my side
You're the one I care for
You're the one that breaks me open wide

It's such a beautiful feeling with you

I have to pinch myself to feel
If what is going on is real
From the gods themselves we steal
Night and day

A jug of wine, a loaf of bread and thee
Lying on a blanket underneath that big old spreading tree
I'm ready as a man can be
Come what may

You're the one I tell my stories to
You're the one I sing my songs for
You're the one that's really getting through

Paul Kelly,"I got a long-legged girl
We go all around the world
No one knows the shape we're in
In a first floor yellow room
In the middle of the afternoon
We breathe out and we breathe in

We're giving it all away
We're giving it all away
These are the days, these are the days

She don't believe in God
Or Jesus Christ our Lord
But she likes to call their names
She wants a little baby child
And she's running out of time
She needs a man who wants the same

We're giving it all away
These are the days, these are the days

Days of aching sunshine, days of sweetest rain
Days we know will never come again

With a laugh like a-ringing a bell
She sets my heart aflame

Paul Kelly,"Young lovers, young lovers, young lovers
I see them everywhere I go
Holding hands in the park
As the sky grows dark
Young lovers don't want to go home

Young lovers, young lovers, young lovers
They drive me right out of my mind
Lying down by the river
Whispering 'forever'
Young lovers, they don't have very long

Everybody was a young lover once
See that old man coming down the road, shuffling on a stick
Once he pressed a girl against a fence and drank her kiss
And never knew such tenderness
And holds still in his head that bliss
Now he has to sit down to take a piss

Young lovers, young lovers, young lovers
They seem to get younger every year

Raise some kids 'til they're grown
Young lovers, they don't have very long

Paul Kelly,"Queenie was born on the banks
Of the great Ord River, 1930, maybe
Her mother was black, her daddy white
Papa was a fine horse-breaker
Mama sang the songs of the old lawmakers

She used to hide young Queenie in the bush
And rub black charcoal all over her hair and her face
Every time the police came around
Looking for any blond haired, brown skinned children
To round 'em up and take 'em on down town

Shine on, shine on, immortal one, aha
Shine on, shine on, immortal one, aha

Rover was born in the desert, he lived out there 'til his mother died
Then he moved around a lot from place to place
Bedford Downs, Bow River, Lissadell, Wyndham
Building fences, working as a stock man

Then he had a series of dreams
He started painting what he'd heard and he'd seen
Rainbow serpent, Krill Krill, Cyclone Tracy, the killing fields
Everything that lives and breathes

Ride on, ride on, immortal one, aha
Ride on, ride on, immortal one, aha
Your story will always run

When Rover and Queenie were young
They met out on New Texas Down station
She worked as a cook there for a long, long time
She said, ""Hey, Cowboy"" later on she said
""Nice boy, good worker, top rider, lucky one, that one""

One day a mean horse ripped the scalp from his head
She stitched him up with a boiled needle and thread
Good as any doctor, they were friends ever after
She said, ""I want to paint,"" he said, ""I'll teach ya""
They died within months of each other

Ride on, ride on, immortal ones, aha
Shine on, shine on, immortal ones
Ride on, ride on, immortal ones, aha

Paul Kelly,"Green the foggy fields of France today I journey through
Green the singer, Al, who sings the way I feel for you
Green our love so tender yet, a gift each day made new
Green would be the whole wide world if they our secret knew

Blue the little patch of sky peeping through the gray
Blue the color of your dress the day I went away
Blue the mighty ocean deep keeping us apart
Blue the melody I strum on this old guitar

I carry you with me wrapped up in my heart
We are the wonder that keeps the stars apart
The root of the root and the bud of the bud
The deepest of the deepest, the singing in the blood, oh

Gold the feeling that I get as the plane comes in to land
Gold the sinking western sun making its fiery bands
Gold the color of your curls as at the gate you stand
Gold the ring I bring for you to slip on your left hand

I carry you with me wrapped up in my heart
This is the wonder that keeps the stars apart

There's a hanging moon

So keep, keep on driving, keep on driving

Well, I loved a girl
From spring to fall
It's over now, I really don't mind at all

Such a beautiful catastrophe
There ain't no doubt she sure is glad to see the back of me

Paul Kelly,"Some people like watching a lamb in a lion?s den
They want me to bow down my head and give in to the end
They keep on singing the same old song
They got the tune right but the words are all wrong
Imagine their surprise when they see how I shed my skin

I run with the pack but my kicks I get on my own
In the cold blooded old time the seeds to the blooms were sown
I nursed every sting, every prick and I know every dirty little trick
From the downtown alley all the way to the hilltop home

Nobody, I'd say, nobody, nobody's gonna touch me now
Nobody's gonna touch me now

One of these days the lion will lie down with the lamb
They say milk and honey will flow all through the land
The blood covered butcher will lay down his knife
And take to the streets with the drum and the fife
But between you and me don't count on it anytime soon

Paul Kelly,"We argued on the channel train to Paris
The vin rouge helped us make it sweet again
But by the time that we got down to Lyon
Everything I said was wrong and you cursed me in the rain

We split up for a while in Barcelona
We met up six days later in Madrid
I was hoping that the break would make things go a little better
And for a little while it almost did

Now I'm in a bar in Copenhagen
Trying hard to forget your name
And I'm staring at the label on a bottle of cerveza
And every fucking city feels the same

You said to call you when I got to London
A French girl told me that you'd left a note
I said to her ""I like your accent"" and she thought I sounded funny
So we ended up drinking in Soho

Foolishly I followed you to Dublin
Like a ghost I walked the streets of Temple Bar
And all the bright young things were throwing up their Guinness in the gutters
And once I thought I saw you from afar

Now I'm in a disco/nightclub in Helsinki
And they're playing La Vida Loca once again
And I can't believe I'm dancing to this crap but I'm a chance here
Yeah, every fucking city sounds the same

At a cafe in the port of Amsterdam
An E-mail from you said you'd gone to Rome
For a minute I thought maybe but my funds were getting/running low
And anyway it sounded like you weren't alone

So I headed north and ended up in/until I got to Hamburg
A chilly city suits a troubled soul
And on the Reeperbahn I paid a woman far too much
To kick me out before I'd even reached my goal

Now I'm in a restaurant in Stockholm
And the waiter here wants me to know his name
And I can order sandwiches in seven different languages
But every fucking city looks the same

And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away
It's human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Bright before me the signs implore me
To help the needy and show them the way
It's human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

No, I think it's going to rain today",The Man Behind the Piano
Paul King,"The sun was low, and the shadow was cold
On the pale drawn face, that was wrinkled and old
A newspaper coat, hanging loose 'round his throat
And the shoes on his feet, strips of leather tied up with rope
His uncombed hair, and eyes that would stare
At the people passing by, who didn't know or didn't care

[Chorus:]
This poor old man he's all alone
He's got no money or no home of his own
The back street's his kitchen
The footpath's his hall
And the chalk on the brick work
Are the pictures on his wall
He lays down his head
On the pavement that's his bed
And when he sleeps, his dreams fade away

He walks down the street, with his hands in his coat
Looking down at his feet, for a dog-end he could smoke
He thinks about food, good drinking and good fun
As he searches through the dustbins, his life almost done

[Chorus:]",Tramp
Paul Kossoff,"Catch a train to my place
Call me when you get into town
I'm gonna meet you at the station, oh yeah
You can tell me why you're feeling down

Is it you mother, though she tends to shout a bit
But she's got her problems too
And I don't doubt it
Baby your father
I know he's always drinking
Most of the time
He don't even know what he's doing

Now baby
Catch a train to my place
Call me when you get into town
Gonna meet you at the station
You can tell me why you're feeling down

Why don't you catch a train

Paul Kossoff,"It makes me sad to think of you
Because I understand the things you do
There is no one else can take your place
In my life alone I hide my face

Come together in the morning
I can understand your mind
Come together in the morning
See the world the same as me

There was a time, it's in the past
I thought our love was born to last
But now you say you are torn in two
That's what my love has done for you

Come together in the morning
I can understand your mind
Come together in the morning
See the world the same as me

Come together in the morning

Come together in the morning
See the world the same as me

Slightly used cigars.

You're busy keeping far away from work.

The weather' s getting fine.
The coffee tastes like wine.
You happy hobo, sing,

Why work away for wealth
When you can travel for your health?
It' s spring, you hobo, sing,

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Paul Kuhn,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Paul Kuhn,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Walking down to the place I lived a world and a half ago
Searching for that part of me to soothe my aching soul
Streets look the same, and the people come and go
The wind calls my name, oh it's good to be back home, yes sir

Memories of times I spent come flooding through my mind
Loved ones I'll never see again until I reach the other side
Am I still the same? Or maybe I've lost touch?
I guess we all change, but how much is too much?

And I have lived this day before
I do not want it anymore
If I could dream I'd kill some time
And yet today is mine 

I'm okay. 
It's alright. 

Yesterday there was nothing that could burn my great desires
Raised from the ashes I was walking barefoot on the wire
Am I who I was but different than I'll be?
Letting go is tougher than hanging on my friend you'll see

I have lived this day before
It’s just one more revolving door

And you know that it's best for you start moving on
It gets hard with one foot stuck in the dark
Reconnect to the energy and then start a new
Don't look back, it's just you, just you

So I take the good and the bad and the sometimes in between
Tired of just treading water now I'm swimming up your stream
That's the chance you take, throwing caution to the wind
Life is just a game, roll the dice and you may win

Voilà le portrait sans retouche
De l'homme auquel j'appartiens

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose

Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça me fait quelque chose

Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause

C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie

Et dès que je l'aperçois
Alors je sens en moi
Mon cœur qui bat

Des nuits d'amour à ne plus en finir
Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place
Des ennuis, des chagrins, s'effacent
Heureux, heureux à en mourir

Paul Mauriat,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Midn

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

Paul Mauriat,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine","Begin the beguine, song (from ""Jubilee"")"
Paul Mauriat,"Aux jeunes loups

1. Ils sor-tent de l'en-fance
Comme s'ils sor-taient d'un bois
Plus trem-blant d'ar-ro-gan-ce
Que de peur ou de froid
Les jeu-nes loups, les jeu-nes loups
Ils a-bor-dent la vie
Avec la même foi
Cha-cun guet-tant sa proie
D'un é-gal ap-pé-tit
De jeu-ne loup, les jeunes loups
Si vous ten-tez de les sé-dui-i-re
Ils vous mon-trent les dents
Mais quand ils sou-rient leur sou-ri-i-re
Est ce-lui d'un en-fant
Il ne faut pas les flat-ter
De la main
Ce ne sont pas des chiens
Ils gar-dent tou-jours leur fier-té
Mêm' s'ils n'ont pour man-ger
Qu'un seul os à ron-ger
Pour que jeu-ness' se passe
Ou sans rai-son du tout
On leur dit tout à coup
D'al-ler fai-re la chasse
Aux au-tres loups les jeu-nes loups
A-vec ou sans lau-riers
Ils re-vien-nent meur-tris
Et peu-vent ré-ci-ter
Même sans l'avoir ap-pris
La mort du loup les jeu-nes loups
A-lors ils ar-rê-tent leurs fra-as-ques
Et s'ar-ra-chent sou-dain
Le loup qui leur ser-vait de ma-as-que
Et par un beau ma-tin
Se re-trouvent à la croi-sée
Des che-mins
Seuls de-vant leur des-tin
Et pren-nent la voie de leur choix
Qu'ils pour-sui-vent tout droit
Sans re-cu-ler d'un pas
Même si beau-coup d'entre eux
Vi-vent sans foi ni loi

Et qu'un jour par-mi eux
Il s'en trou-ve-ra deux
Pour al-ler fon-der
Ro-me

2. Ils aiment s'amuser
Mais ne savent pas qu'ils jouent
Quand entre chien et loup
On les voit déguisés
En loups-garous,
Les jeunes loups
Parfois leurs yeux s'allument
Quand passe une ingénue
Aux longs cheveux de lune
Qu'ils suivent dans la rue
À pas de loup,
Les jeunes loups

Et bientôt dans leur c?ur tout bouge
Quand ils se voient tremblant
Au bras d'un p'tit chaperon rouge
Qu'ils habillent de blanc
Ils se croient apprivoisés
Installés
Dans un conte de fée
Mais rien n'est fini pour autant
Car la vie les attend
Pour leur faire les dents

Coda
Pour que jeuness' se passe
Ou sans raison du tout
On leur dit tout à coup
D'aller faire la chasse
Aux autres loups les jeunes loups
Avec ou sans lauriers
Ils reviennent meurtris
Et peuvent réciter
Même sans l'avoir appris
La mort du loup
Les jeunes loups

Alors ils arrêtent leurs frasques
Et s'arrachent soudain
Le loup qui leur servait de masque
Et par un beau matin
Sa retrouvent à la croisée
Des chemins
Seuls devant leur destin
Et prennent la voie de leur choix
Qu'ils poursuivent tout droit
Sans reculer d'un pas
Même si beaucoup d'entre eux
Vivent sans foi ni loi
Cela importe peu
Ce qui compte pour moi
C'est qu'ils sont devenus des hommes
Et qu'un jour parmi eux
Il s'en trouvera deux
Pour aller fonder Rome.",Aux Jeunes Loups

But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

And it won't be the first time I've been caught.
It's the game that matters.
Brother, I am proud to know you.
This is one of the greatest moments I have ever experienced.
I think I sense the situation when we can all esteem it, and honour,
To breathe the rather inferior atmosphere in this station
Here along with our little friend.

I guess we should all go home and treasure the memory of his face
As the whitest thing in our museum of recollection.
And, perhaps, this good woman will also go home
And wash the face of our little brother here.

A sure enough saint only one a halo to be transferred.

You're bundled up now, wait till you get older

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

Sailing down the Nile in china cup
With the recipe for a lovely day

And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit
On a carpet ride to a foreign land

But you don't seem to have inherited many of his mannerisms

And spend it with you
You've got the power of love
And love has the power, to make it come true
We can go through our love
We can do things that they said were impossible
Through our love
We can do all that we want to do
We can go through our love
We can go through our love

Whenever you will be mine
Whenever you will be mine
I want to be with you
Just want to do whatever feels right
You've got the power of love
And love has the power to turn on the light

Here we go through our love
We can see things that they said were invisible
Through our love
We can see where we are going to
We're going through our love
Through our love we can learn to do things that they said were 
Impossible
Through our love
We can be blessed with a better view
We can go through our love [Repeat x 3]",Through Our Love

Paul McCartney,"You day breaks, your mind aches
 You find that all her words
 of kindness linger on
 When she no longer needs you
 She wakes up, she makes up
 She takes her time and doesn't
 feel she has to hurry
 She no longer needs you

 And in her eyes, you see nothing
 No sign of live behind the tears
 Cried for no one
 A love that should have lasted years

 You want her, you need her
 And yet you don't believe her
 When she says her love is dead
 You think she needs you

 And in her eyes, you see nothing
 No sign of live behind the tears
 Cried for no one
 A love that should have lasted years

 You stay home, she goes out
 She says that long ago she knew someone
 but now he's gone
 She doesn't need him
 your day breaks, your mind aches
 There will be times when all the things
 she said will fill your head
 You won't forget her

 And in her eyes, you see nothing
 No sign of live behind the tears
 Cried for no one
 A love that should have lasted years",For No One

I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more

I followed the leader
Into her tent
But nobody told me that she owed some rent
She wanted to love me, I wanted to go
But she taught me things that I needed to know

Paul McCartney,"It's beautiful outside, an old hand gathers wood, 
Can he see me sitting here? his mind is somewhere else. 

His friend have flown away, he's left out in the cold. 
He won't sit by my fire, he says he likes it in the snow. 
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow. 

It's getting dark outside, the old hand's going home, 
Has he someone waiting there? or is he living on his own? 
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow... 

White blanket, hiding the traces of tears she didn't see, 
Oh white blanket covers the memory 
Of all that used to be. all that used to be. 
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way, 
He can't help feeling that she might come back someday. 

It's beautiful outside, a magpie looks for food. 
The old hand throws a crumb, 
Do you think he's found a friend? 
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow... 

White blanket, hiding the traces of paths he didn't take 
Oh white blanket covers the memory 
Of moves he didn't make 
Oh white blanket, hiding the traces of tears she didn't see 

Snow white blanket simply covers the memory 
Of all that used to be. 
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way 
He can't help feeling that she might come back someday.",Footprints

Breaking eggs in a dish. 
Do not mock me when I say

Living dreams with mouths ajar, 
Wide awake, we go to sleep. 

However absurd, however absurd
It may seem. 
However absurd, however absurd

Something special between us, 
When we made love the game was over. 
I couldn't say the words, 
Words wouldn't get my feelings through, 
So I keep talking to you 

However absurd, however absurd

Paul McCartney,"Well the rest of my life lay in front of me, 
I was pedaling down the road, 
When I saw Nell Gwynne and her oranges 
And I'll have one of those. 
She said move over busker, don't bang your drum 
Move over busker, your time will come. 

Well I was hanging around for a miracle, 
Struggling with a rhyme, 
When I saw Mae west in a sweaty vest, 
And I said I'll come up and see you sometime. 
She said move over busker, don't bang your drum 
Move over busker, your time will come. 

You've got it coming, come on come on, 
You've got it coming, coming to you. 
You've got it coming, come on come on, 
You've got it coming, coming to you. 

Well I've been waiting, but I'm impatient, 
No-one can hold me back, I want to stay with the action. 
But I won't get it, my great illusion 
Will vanish anyhow if I don't grab it now. 

Well I was hacking my way throughout the undergrowth, 
Juggling with my pride, 
When I saw Errol Flynn in a tiger skin, 
And I said you look satisfied!
Well he looked down at me from his motor home, 
And he gave me a dirty smile, 
He said well yes I am but she's calling me, 
Would you excuse us for a while 

Move over busker, your day is done. 
Move over busker, my time has come.",Move over Busker
Paul McCartney,"And if you take your love away from me, 
I'm only going to want it back. 
I'll probably pretend I didn't see, 
But knowing me, I'll want you back again, and again 
'Til the word has lost it's meaning, 
And love is all that stays. only love remains. 

If you should ever feel that something's wrong, 
I'm going to want to put it right, 
To bring a happy ending to our song, 
I'll carry on believing in a love. 
If your love was to trickle through my fingers, 
What would it leave me with? 
Only love remains. 
Only love 

Old enough and strong enough to stretch across the world. 
Taking the sand inside an oyster, changing it into a pearl. 
Making another magic transformation, 
Find the right boy for the right girl. 

When all our friends have gone away and we're alone, 
There's nothing left to show about, 
Together we'll explore the great unknown. 
I'd say we won't be going out tonight, 
Let tonight be the one that we remember, 
When love is all that stays, 
Only love remains
Only love remains",Only Love Remains
Paul McCartney,"Darling, I love you very, very, very much, 
And I really am relying on your touch. 
But with all these people listening in, 
I don't know where I ought to begin. 
Maybe we could hit upon a word, 
Something that the others haven't heard, 
When you want me to love you, 
Just tell me to press. 

Right there, that's it. Yes. When you feel the stress 
Don't just stand there, tell me to press. 

You can give me what I want I must confess, 
My body needs attention my mind is in a mess, 
Oklahoma was never like this. 
Never like this, it was never like this, 
Ever like this, say was it ever like this? 
Oklahoma was never like this. 
It was never like this 

Darling, I know it really wouldn't be a crime, 
If I say I want to love you all the time. 
But with all these people listening in, 
I don't know where I ought to begin. 
Maybe we should have a secret code, 
Before we both get ready to explode.

You got to give the other fella hell

Paul McCartney,"Mull of Kintyre, oh mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh Mull of Kintyre

Far have I traveled and much have I seen
Darkest of mountains with valleys of green
Past painted deserts the sun sets on fire
As he carries me home to the Mull of Kintyre

Mull of Kintyre, oh mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh Mull of Kintyre

Sweep through the heather like deer in the glen
Carry me back to the days I knew then
Nights when we sang like a heavenly choir
Of the life and the times of the Mull of Kintyre

Mull of Kintyre, oh mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh Mull of Kintyre

Smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain
Still take me back where my memories remain
Flickering embers go higher and higher
As they carry me back to the Mull of Kintyre

Mull of Kintyre, oh mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh Mull of Kintyre

No more lonely nights

You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill of being near you
And if takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right

Paul McCartney,"Ooh, well, I got a girl with a record machine,
When it comes to rockin', she's a queen.
Went to a dance on a Saturday night,
All alone where I could hold her tight.
She lives on the twentieth floor uptown.
The elevator's broken down.

So I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more,
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag.
Get to the top and I'm too tired to rock.

Well, she, she called me up on the telephone,
Said, ""come on over, baby, I'm all alone.""
I said, ""baby, you're mighty sweet,
But I'm in bed with a aching feet.""
This went on for a couple of days,
But I couldn't stay away.

So I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more,
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag.
Get to the top and I'm too tired to rock.

Well, sent to chicago for repairs,
Till it's fixed I'm usin' the stairs.
I hope they hurry, before it's too late,
You know, I love my baby too much to wait.
All this climbing is getting me down,
They'll find my corpse draped over the rail.

But I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more,
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,

Ooh, well, I got a girl with a record machine,

Went to a dance on a Saturday night,
All alone where I could hold her tight.

Time away from you?
If you can answer this you can have the moon.
This is the place to be, anyway you can see
There's a lovely view.
Why are there always so many other things to do?
Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head,
When I'm alone I think of you
And the life we'd lead if we could only be free
From these distractions.

While the telephone rings on the kitchen wall,
Pretend we're not at home and they'll disappear.
I want to be with you, tell me what I can do,
Nothing is too small
Away from all this jazz we could do anything at all.
Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head.
When I'm alone I think of you
And the things we'd do if we could only be through
With these distractions.
I'll fond the peaceful place far a way from the noise of a busy
Day
Where we can spend our nights counting shooting stars,
Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head.
When I'm alone I think of you
And the things we'd do if we could only be through

Don't be careless love, 
Don't be careless love, 
Don't be, don't be careless. 

In my dream you're running nowhere 
Every step you've taken turns to glue, 
Walking down a spiral staircase 
Failing through, failing through, 

Don't be careless love, 
Be careless love. 

The lamp burns down and out 
I'm getting pretty tired of this, 
I feel so bad something might be going amiss, 

I won't be there so look out for yourself 
You're getting in deep whatever you do, 
Don't let me go back to sleep, 

Don't be careless love, 
Don't be careless love, 
Don't be, don't be careless. 

Saw your face in the morning paper, 
Saw your body rolled up in a rug 
Chopped up into two little pieces 
By some thug, 

Don't be careless love, 
Be careless love. 
But in the morning light 
When I wake up again 
You're by my side and that's the way it's always been, 
But in the dark your mind plays funny tricks on you, 
Your mind plays funny tricks on you, 
Your mind plays funny tricks on you,

Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late.
Round and round the ring I go,
I want to know, I want to know,
Why can't we travel a continuous line?
Make love reliable covenant all the time.
Up and down the hills I go, I got to know, I got to know.
Is is better to love another
Than to go go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow,
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight.

I've been living in style,
Unaccustomed as I am
To the luxury life,
I've been hitting the town
And it didn't hit back

I've been doing the rounds
Unaccustomed as I am
To the time on my hands,
Now I don't have to tell anybody
When I'm going to get back

Ever since you went away
I've had this sentimental inclination
Not to change a single thing
As I pull the sheet back on the bed,
I want to go bury my head
In your pillow

Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
And take me to that place

Where I can't find my brave face,
Where I can't find my brave face,
My brave, my brave, my brave face
My brave face

I've been living a lie
Unaccustomed as I am
To the work of a housewife,
I've been breaking up
Dirty dishes and throwing them away

Ever since you left I have been trying to
Compose a 'baby will you please come home' note
Meant for you
As I clear away another
Untouched t.v. dinner
From the table, I laid for two

Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again

I thought at once my heart would burst
Still, every time is like the first

There was applause when she stepped up
I wished that I could interrupt
I made no sign, I made no sound 
I know I must stay underground

That's why she walks, or so they say
She always knew just what I needed 
Now, if she would just look my way

She sprinkles flowers in the dirt

I know I'll never see her face

She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Projected on a wall of stone.

I looked into eternal gardens, 
Lay on the shores of distant islands, 
Listening to the sea birds song of joy. 

Oh, I owe it all to you, 
You make me happy, 
Oh, I owe it all to you. 

Late last night, we were right 
Into some exotic scene. 
Everywhere, images 
Appearing on a giant screen. 
I stood inside a glass cathedral, 
I looked into the golden canyon, 
Lay by the lakes of holy water 
Glistening like a diamond in the light.

Paul McCartney,"There was a girl who loved a biker 
She used to follow him across America 
But the biker didn't like her. 

She didn't care, she still persisted 
Though her brother said she was twisted 
And the family said they wouldn't miss her 
Anyway. 

She loved the biker like an icon 
Gazing at his picture everyday. 
She loved the biker like an icon 
Slowly watching precious water drip away. 

She did her best to fix a meeting 
She pulled it off one night in Hollywood 
When he met her he couldn't let her get away. 

He didn't ask for her permission 
He took advantage of her position 
But he was always her ambition 
Anyway. 

She loved the biker like an icon 
Gazing at his picture everyday.

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mack

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in

Paul McCartney,"I saw you sitting at the center of a circle
Everybody
Everybody wanted something from you

I saw you swaying to the rhythm of the music
Caught you playing
Caught you praying to the voice inside you
I saw you swaying there

You were hoping that the ground would swallow you

Paul McCartney,"How many days will the wet weather last? 
I want know will the clouds 
When they roll back 
Reveal a man in an old mac 
Living on a park bench 
Sitting on his own? 

Cut the rain as it runs down the glass 
Eventually through the lightning and thunder 
We see a man going under 
This is how it happens 
This is what he said 

I don`t need love 
Though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 
`Til I`m back on me feet 
You`re always telling me about my misery 
I`ve seen things you will never see 
Don`t pity me 

Focus in on the breath of a man 
Who takes a brown paper bag 
From his knapsack 
Between his whispers and wise cracks 
He`s looking for permission 
Screaming at the sky 

I don`t need love 
though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 
`Til I`m back on me feet 
You`re always telling me about my misery 
I`ve seen things you will never see 
Don`t pity me 

I`ll be right again 
Be upright without you 
I`ll stand up again 
Kick up a fuss again too 

Cut back again to a girl walking by 
Until the feet that are all shoes and no socks 
Climb an invisible soap box 
Laughing at the traffic 
Shouting at the world 

I don`t need love 
though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 
`Til I`m back on me feet 
You`re always telling me about my misery 
I`ve seen things you will never see 
Don`t pity me 

I`ll stand up again 
Kick up a fuss again too 
I`ll be right again 
Be upright without you 

We see a life through the eyes of a man 
As he live and he dies 
By a simple tattoo 

I`ll be back again 
When I land on my feet 
I`ll stand up again 
Kick up a fuss again, wouldn`t you 

Well there you go, though we tried hard to know him 
It`s there on his face 
He`s a case where there`s clearly no hope 

Give me your hand again 
`Til I land again 

His face starts to fade 
As we pull down the shade 
And the picture we made 
Is in glorious cinema scope 

I`ll be back...",Back on My Feet

Paul McCartney,"You had your own way one too many times and now 
You`re going to find out what it`s like
Just what it`s like, now you`re a mess
You wanted something you could never possess

You went your own way one too many nights
You treated her like some small oversight
What in the world makes her think that she can
Turn you from a playboy into a man

[Chorus]
She`s going to make you suffer tonight
To turn you from a playboy into a man
And when you`re worthy of her then she might
Turn you from a playboy into a man

You thought you were the answer to her prayers
The perfect gift that every girl prefers
But that`s the trouble `cos every girl still thinks you`re hers
So there you are with your gold chains jangling
Your lucky charms and jewelry dangling
But when she saw you she turned and ran
To turn you from a playboy into a man

[Chorus]
You couldn't see that the juvenile things you do
Would drag you down and now that the joke`s on you
You`re pretty cold you end as you start
When your facade isn't falling apart
So now you`re standing in your underwear
Well now you know just how it feels for her
You`re halfway there you know that she can turn you from a
Playboy into a man

[Chorus]",Playboy to a Man
Paul McCartney,"Here lies the powder and perfume
The pretty clothes are scattered 'round the room
And it's so like Candy

Here lies the lipstick and the face
The colored tablets keep it all in place
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy

[Chorus:]
What did I do to make her go
Why must she be the one
That I have to love
So like Candy

Here lies a picture of a girl
Her arms are tight around that lucky guy
And it's so like Candy

And in her eyes a certain look
I thought I'd seen the last of long ago
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy

[Chorus]

I remember the day that picture was taken
We were so happy then
But that's so like Candy
She seemed so sweet to me I was mistaken
Oh no not that again
But that's so like Candy
She just can't face the day
So she turns and melts away

Here lie the records that she scratched
And on the sleeve I find a note attached
And it's so like Candy
""My Darling Dear it's such a waste""
She couldn't say ""goodbye"", but ""I admire your taste""
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy",So Like Candy

It never was much a kind of a bode
Glasgow town never brought me down
When I was heading out on the road
Carlisle city never looked so pretty
And the Kendal freeway's fast
Slow down driver want to stay alive
I want to make this journey last

Helen, hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen, hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

M six south down to Liverpool
Where they play the west coast sound
Sailor Sam he came from Birmingham
But he never will be found
Doing fine when a London sign
Greets me like a long lost friend
Mister Motor won't you check her out
She's got to take me back again

Helen, hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen, hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

Got no time for a rum and lime
I want to get my right foot down
Shake some dust off of this old bus
I gotta get her out of town
Spend the day up on the motorway
Where the carburetors blast
Slow down driver want to stay alive
I want to make this journey last

Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels

And they never gonna take her away

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more

Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our baby's gone.

How could she do this to me

Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)

Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

I'll tell you what I'm going to do

The definition of friendship 
Apparently ought to be 
Showing support for the one that you love 
And I was open to friendship 
But you didn't seem to have any to spare 
While you were riding to Vanity Fair 

There was a time 
When every day was young 
The sun would always shine 
We sang along 
When all the songs were sung 
Believing every line 

That's the trouble with friendship 
For someone to feel it 
It has to be real or it wouldn't be right 
And I keep hoping for friendship 
But I wouldn't dare to presume it was there 
While you were riding to Vanity Fair",Riding to Vanity Fair

Paul McCartney,"Well, I was found in the transit lounge
Of a dirty airport town
What was I doing on the road to ruin
Well my mama laid me down
My mama laid me down

Around my hand was a plastic band
With a picture of my face
I was crying, left to die
In this godforsaken place
This godforsaken place

[Chorus:]
Only Mama knows
What she laid me down
In this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from
I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows

I'm passing through
I'm on my way
On the road, no ETA
I'm passing through
No fixed abode
And that is why...
I need to try
To hold on
I've got to hold on
To hold on
I've got to hold on

Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she leave in disgrace
Well, I never
Will I ever
See my father's face
See my father's face

That gets to walk off with the girl

Paul McCartney,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",A Day in the Life/Give Peace a Chance

Skies of blue begin to grey,

Evening ever brings to me
Dreams of days that used to be,
Memories of those I love the best.

When shadows fall
And trees whisper, ""Day is ending"",
My thoughts are ever wending home.
When crickets call,
My heart is forever yearning
Once more to be returning home.

When the hills conceal the setting sun,
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one.
Night covers all,
And though fortune may forsake me,
Sweet dreams will ever take me home.

Lighting undiscovered places

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Oh girl, I’d be in trouble if you left me now
’Cos I don’t know where to look for love, I just don’t know how
Oh girl, how I depend on you to give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be there

All my friends call me a fool
They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now

Oh girl tell me, tell me what am I gonna do?
And I know I've got a guilty face
Girl I feel so out of place

Yeah girl, what am I gonna do? Do
What am I gonna do?
If you leave me baby what am I gonna do?
I don’t know where to go, who to see yeah

Oh girl, I guess I’ll never know
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl I’ve gotta get away from here
Oh girl, girl, girl pain will double if you leave me now

I don't know how, oh no

Oh girl, girl, why do I love you so?
I really wanna know, I really wanna know

To be lost and free, and invincible

Su pequeña huella
No vuelve más
Un sendero solo
De pena y silencio llegó
Hasta el agua profunda
Un sendero solo
De penas mudas llegó
Hasta la espuma

Sabe Dios qué angustia
Te acompañó
Qué dolores viejos
Calló tu voz
Para recostarte
Arrullada en el canto
De las caracolas marinas
La canción que canta
En el fondo oscuro del mar
La caracola

Te vas Alfonsina
Con tu soledad
Qué poemas nuevos
Fuíste a buscar?
Una voz antigüa
De viento y de sal
Te requiebra el alma
Y la está llevando
Y te vas hacia allá
Como en sueños
Dormida, Alfonsina
Vestida de mar

Cinco sirenitas
Te llevarán
Por caminos de algas
Y de coral
Y fosforescentes
Caballos marinos harán
Una ronda a tu lado
Y los habitantes
Del agua van a jugar
Pronto a tu lado

Bájame la lámpara
Un poco más
Déjame que duerma
Nodriza, en paz
Y si llama él
No le digas que estoy
Dile que Alfonsina no vuelve
Y si llama él
No le digas nunca que estoy
Di que me he ido

Te vas Alfonsina
Con tu soledad
¿Qué poemas nuevos
Fueste a buscar?

De viento y de sal

Paul Motian,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye
Paul Motian,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns
Paul Motian,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Paul Motian,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Paul Motian,"I'm up in the world,
but I'd give the world to be where I used to be,
A heavenly nest,
where I rest the best,
means more than the world to me.

It's only a shanty
in old Shanty Town
the roof is so slanty it touches the ground.
But my tumbled down shack by an old railroad track,
like a millionaire's mansion is calling me back.

I'd give up a palace if I were a king.
It's more than a palace, it's my everything.
There's a queen waiting there with a silvery crown
in a shanty in old Shanty Town.",In a Shanty in Old Shanty Town

Seems to act just like a drug
You're getting to be a habit with me
Let me stay in your arms

I used to think your love was something that I could take or leave alone
But now I couldn't do without my supply
I need you for my own
Oh, I can't break away
I must have you every day
As regularly as coffee or tea
You've got me in your clutches
And I can't get free
You're getting to be a habit with me
Can't break it

Paul Oakenfold,"'I believe with the advent of acid. We discovered new ways to think and it has to do with piecing together new thoughts of mind. Why is it that people are so afraid of it? What is it about it that scares people so deeply? Because they are afraid that there is more to reality than they have ever confronted. That there are doors that they are afraid to go in and they don't want us to go in there either because if we go in, there we might learn something that they don't know. And that makes us a little out of their control.'",LSD

I'm wondering where
Selfish love inspires
Are you there to hold my hand
Saving me who I spy

Maybe you are the rain
Who makes my eyes closed
Ocean's grey and grey
Feeling my despair
Your happy smile is broken
I'm wondering there
Selfish love has spoken

Are you here to hold
Are you there to hold my hand
Selfish love has spoken
Saving me who I spy
Are you here to hold
Are you there to hold my hand
Selfish love has spoken
Saving me who I spy
Are you here to hold
Are you there to hold my hand
Selfish love has spoken

Paul Oakenfold,"""This is a message for Paul Oakenfold, how are you? 
Its Anita Baymont Hunter Thompson's assistant, 
I'm going through the messages, 
Just getting back to you to let you know that Hunter did get the CD's, 
I've listened to them and I'm excited and Hunter has listened to them and 
He is interested. So eh we'll give you call back in a couple of days, 
Yeah so um great stuff we'll talk soon thanks bye.""

""Nixon's spirit will be with us for the rest of our lives 
Whether your are me or Bill Clinton or you 
Or Kurt Cobain or Bishop Tutu or Keith Richards 
Or Aimee Fisher or Boris Yeltsin's daughter 
Or her finance's sixteen year old beer drunk brother 
With his braided goatee with his whole like a thunder cloud right in front of him.""

""This is not a generational thing you don't even have to know 
Who Richard Nixon was to be a victim of his ugly Nazi experiments.""

""He has poisoned our water for ever. 
Nixon will be remembered as a classic case 
Of a smart man shitting in his own nest, 
But he also shit in our nest 
And that was the crime that history will burn on his memory as a brand. 
By disgracing and degrading the presidency of the United States, 
By fleeing the White House like a diseased cure, 
Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream""",Nixon's Spirit

Dancing the night away, it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop, coz tonight's the night it goes sweat box
Laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in Stars and stripes
Eclectic, electric, ladies of the evening, drinking booze and mingling
Mashing to the music, I can do anything
Freaky Dicky star speckles and pink butterflies and life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise, I'm seeing stars, I can't believe my eyes

Paul Oakenfold,"When you're up against a struggle that shatters all your dreams
And your hopes have been cruelly crushed by Satan's manifested schemes
And you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fears
Don't let the faith you're standing in seem to disappear

Praise the Lord, He can work through those who praise Him
Praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise
Praise the Lord, for the chains that seems to bind you
Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you
When you praise Him

Now Satan is a liar and he wants to make us think
That we are paupers when he knows himself we're children of the King
So lift up the mighty shield of faith for the battle must be won
We know that Jesus Christ has risen so the work's already done

Sometimes missing just one word
Something really shaken loose
Look around to the see the cities burn

We're lost without the meanin'
The love has disappeared without a trace

It's just the way I'm feelin'
You're gone and now I'm leavin'
I'm holding back the tears
Look at my face
It's just the way I'm feelin'

You were never forced to choose
I tried to keep you safe from harm
And now there's nothing left to lose
You've gone and torn my world apart
All that's left for me is you
I'm a shadow of my former self

Set me free",Southern Sun [Exclusive New Oakenfold 2008 Remix]
Paul Oakenfold,"Everybody comes to Hollywood 
They wanna make it in the neighborhood 
They like the smell of it in Hollywood 
How could it hurt you when it looks so good 

Shine your light now 
This time it's gotta be good 
You get it right now 
Yeah 
'Cause you're in Hollywood 

There's something in the air in Hollywood 
The sun is shining like you knew it would 
You're riding in your car in Hollywood 
You got the top down and it feels so good 

Everybody comes to Hollywood 
They wanna make it in the neighborhood 
They like the smell of it in Hollywood 
How could it hurt you when it looks so good 

I lost my memory in Hollywood 
I've had a million visions 
Bad and good 
There's something in the air in Hollywood 
I tried to leave it but I never could 

Shine your light now 
This time it's gotta be good 
You get it right now 
Yeah 
'Cause you're in Hollywood 

There's something in the air in Hollywood 
I've lost my reputation 
Bad and good 
You're riding in your car in Hollywood 
You got the top down and it feels so good 

Music stations always play the same songs 
I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong 

Everybody comes to Hollywood 
They wanna make it in the neighborhood 
They like the smell of it in Hollywood 
How could it hurt you when it looks so good 

Shine your light now 
This time it's gotta be good

Paul Orta,"You don't love me no more
Get out my life woman
You don't love me no more

Get out my eyes teardrops
I got to see my way around
Get out my eyes teardrops
I got to see my way around

Paul Oscher,"Well I'm drifting and drifting,
Like a ship out on the sea.
Well I'm drifting and drifting,
Like a ship out on the sea.
Well I ain't got nobody
In this world to care for me.

If my baby would only take me back again
If my baby would only take me back again.
Well you know I ain't good for nothin' baby

Well I haven't got no friends.  

I give you all of my money,
Tell me what more can I do.
I give you all my money,
Tell me what more can I do.
Well you just a good little girl
But you just won't be true.

Bye-bye baby, baby bye-bye bye-bye, 
It's gonna be too late baby
I'll be so far away.",Driftin' Blues
Paul Oscher,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Paul Overstreet,"To me she is a beauty queen 
I love to watch her on the screen 
In our home movies 
And when she sings around the house 
She's got a voice that knocks me out 
She is my favorite singer 

But you won't see her on T.V. 
Or hear her on the radio 
Worldly fame is not her aim 
And she's the first to let you know 

CHORUS: She wants to be a homemaker 
It's her dream to raise a family 
And give her love to just one man 
And I thank God it's me 
I'll never underestimate her 
'Cause she could take this word and turn it on 
But she takes her love 
And makes our house of home 

She can't afford to spend her day 
In a old soap opera haze 
She's much too busy 
At night she puts the kids to bed 
She's makin' sure their prayers get said 
Before she lays down with me 

It's plain to see 
That she's not seeking glory on this earth 
'Cause she believes in honesty 
And the joy of giving birth 

(REPEAT CHORUS)",Homemaker
Paul Overstreet,"I guess we must have met somewhere
That you were not around
I can't remember why I fell
Why I did not turn her down

But then I thought about you
And my heart began to cry
Because I knew how it would hurt you
And your trust in me would die

And somewhere through the darkness
Came a Little stream of light
That opened up my eyes
And washed away the night
Then I saw it was you
Who had been holding me tight

I'm so glad I was dreaming
I'm so glad it didn't happen
I'm so glad that when I woke up
That it all went away

I was dreading to tell you
That your man had been unfaithful
I was so glad that I was dreaming
When I went astray

I told you all about it
And you helped me understand
Sometimes we learn from dreaming
And thank God that we can

'Cause that's one lesson
I don't want to have to learn again

I'm so glad I was dreaming
I'm so glad it didn't happen
I'm so glad that when I woke up
That it all went away

I was dreading to tell you
That your man had been unfaithful
I was so glad that I was dreaming
When I went astray

I'm so glad I was dreaming
I'm so glad it didn't happen
I'm so glad that when I woke up
That it all went away

I was dreading to tell you
That your man had been unfaithful
I was so glad that I was dreaming
When I went astray",I'm So Glad I Was Dreaming
Paul Overstreet,"Looking back I clearly see
Where I was better off
One wrong turn, then before I knew it,
I was lost.

Some say I was lead astray
But I'm the one to blame
I'm just glad I found my way
Back to this little road again.

I gotta keep walking
Down the straight and narrow
Those winding roads are hard
On your heart and hard up on your shoes

Well you can take if from a veteran of the shadows
The straight and narrow is the road to choose

There's temptation on the left
There's temptation on the right
If you need a little help,
Keep your eyes upon the light

Keep on walking
Down the straight and narrow;
Any other road you take
Will lead you toward the blues
If you want to save yourself a world of sorrow
The straight and narrow is the road to choose.

Well I know you've heard of greener pastures
Just beyond the hill
Once you've turned the corner
You'll find its a package deal
There may be good times now and then
But the truth be known
Just a trick to keep you lff the path that leads you home

Better keep on walking
Down the straight and narrow.
Those winding roads are hard
Upon your heart and hard up on your shoes.
Well you can take if from a veteran of the shadows
The straight and narrow is the road to choose.

There's frustration on the left,
And aggravation on the right.
And it will worry you to death
So if you value your life
You better keep on walking down
The straight and narrow;
Any other road you take
Will lead you toward the blues

If you want to save yourself
A world of sorrow
The straight and narrow
Is the road to choose.

The straight and narrow is the only road you should use.",Straight and Narrow
Paul Overstreet,"We broke each other's heart last night 
We both were losers in a fight 
Did we finally cross that borderline 
And go a little bit too far this time 

I know I said some things that really hurt 
But you made me feel like I was dirt 
I can't hardly make things any worse 
And I'm already late for work 
So I'll leave you with my final words 

[CHORUS:]
I'm still head over heals in love with you 
Just like the first time that we met 
I know I never will forget 
I knew right then that it was real 
I still get a thrill when I think about you 
Don't ever doubt the way I feel 
I love you now and always will 
I'm still head over heals 

Maybe I should just stay home all day 
And take time to let love have its way 
My job won't need me while I'm gone 
Not the way I'm needed here at home 

I take back all the things I said 
Sometimes I talk out of my head 
You're the best friend I have ever had 
I love you even when we're mad 
When times are good or they're bad 

(REPEAT CHORUS) 
I'm stil head over heals 
I'm stil head over heals",Head over Heels
Paul Overstreet,"I've heard tell of millionaires 
And billionaires and such 
Who gathered all their treasures 
And still did not have enough 

If money could buy peace of mind 
I guess they'd have it all 
But all the money in the world 
Wouldn't hold you when you fall 

[CHORUS:]
We've got a roof over our head 
And the kids have all been fed 
And the women I love most 
Lies close beside me in our bead 
Lord, give me the eyes to see 
Exactly what it's worth 
And I will be the richest man on earth 

Lord, when I wish I had the things 
That you gave someone else 
I pray that you'll forgive me 
For just thinkin' of myself 

I haven't been as thankful 
As I know I ought to be 
I should be more then satisfied 
With all you've given me 

(REPEAT CHORUS) 
Bridge: One thing is for certain 
It don't matter when you die 
If you had a million 
Or if you just got by 

(REPEAT CHORUS) 
Yes, I will be the richest man on earth",Richest Man on Earth
Paul Overstreet,"I use to love to walk behind my daddy
As he plowed our garden every spring
Our little bare feet in the dirt would make me happy
As we talked about what harvest time would bring

He'd say son this whole world is like a garden
And what you sow your surely gonna reap
Where bitter seeds are planted hearts will harden
But a caring hand will make the harvest sweet

And he was sowin' love for the family
Yeah, he was sowin' love, he took a little extra time
Lookin' forward to a bountiful harvest
Like a good father does he was sowin' love

How I use to love and sit and watch my momma
Workin' with her needle and her thread
So patiently she'd listen to our problems
And we knew she heard every word we said

She'd say, ""Children this old world is full of scratches
And in your life your bound to have a few""
I guess that's why the good Lord gave us patches
So we could start each day out feelin' new

Yes, she was sowin' love for the family
She was sowin' love, she took a little extra time
Lookin' forward to a bountiful harvest
Like a good momma does she was sowin' love

Yeah, they were sowin' love for the family
They were sowin' love, they took a little extra time
Lookin' forward to a bountiful harvest
They took good care of us they were sowin' love
Yeah, they did it all for us they were sowin' love",Sowin' Love
Paul Overstreet,"We started out to walk through life hand in hand together 
We ran into some trouble on the highway to forever 
Took a turn that turned out wrong, woke to find the feeling gone 
But I know that we'll recover, if we hold on to each other 

[Chorus:]
Let's take another run at it, baby 
Take another run at our love 
Let's have a little fun with it, darlin' 
It don't have to be so serious 
Don't tell me that it's over 
We can pick the pieces up 
Let's take another run 
Take another run at our love 

Sometimes the mountain looks so high 
When you're standing at the bottom 
But once we've made it to the top 
You can't see the problem 
Right now it hurts a little bit 
But we've never been the kind to quit 
And I'll know we'll make it over 
We'll be rollin' in the clover 

[Chorus:]
 
If we walk away and say we tried 
We'll never know what's on the other side 

[Chorus:]",Take Another Run
Paul Overstreet,"Last night I dug your picture out from our old dresser drawer.
I set it on the table and I talked to it till four.
I read some old love letters right up to the break of dawn.
Yeah, I've been sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.

Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings.
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home.
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,
Exhuming things that's better left alone.
And I'm resurrecting mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone.
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.

And I went through the closet and I found some things in there,
Like that pretty lingerie that I bought you to wear.
And I recalled how good you looked each time you had it on.
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones,
Exhuming things that's better left alone.
And I'm resurrecting mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone.
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones.
",Diggin' up Bones
Paul Overstreet,"You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be
But you're not just time that I'm killin'
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die

Oh, baby, I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen

They say time take its toll on a body
Makes a young girl's brown hair turn gray
Well, honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say time can play tricks on a mem'ry
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happenin' to me
I've already forgotten ev'ry woman but you
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen

As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Well, just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen","Forever and Ever, Amen"
Paul Overstreet,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.
Without saying a word you can light up the dark.
Try as I may I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing.
 
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.
 
All day long I can hear people talking out loud, 
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd.
Old Mister Webster could never define 
what's being said between your heart and mine.
 
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.
 
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.

Let my heart be changed renewed
Flowing from the grace that I found in you
And lord I've come to know

Hold me close, let your love surround me

Paul Parrish,"Sugar pie honey bunch you know that I love you
I can't help myself I love you and nobody else

Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do

Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside

When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause

Here, where the sea shines
And the wind howls
On the old terrace
Beside the gulf of Sorrento
A man embraces a girl
After the tears
Then clears his throat
And continues the song:

I love you very much
Very, very much you know
It is a chain by now
That heats the blood inside the veins
You know

He saw the lights out on the sea
Thought of the nights there in America
But they were only the fisherman's lamps
And the white wash astern
He felt the pain in the music
And stood up from the piano
But when he saw the moon
Emerging from a cloud
Death also seemed sweeter to him
He looked the girl in the eyes
Those eyes as green as the sea
Then suddenly a tear fell
And he believed he was drowning

I love you very much
Very, very much, you know
It is a chain by now
That heats the blood inside the veins
You know

The power of opera
Where every drama is a hoax
With a little make-up and with mine
You can become someone else
But two eyes that look at you
So close and real
Make you forget the words
Confuse your thoughts
So everything becomes small
Also the nights there in America
You turn and see your life
Through the white wash astern
But, yes, it is life that ends
And he did not think much about it
On the contrary, he already felt happy
And continued his song

I love you very much
Very, very much, you know
It is a chain by now
That heats the blood inside the veins

Beautiful to my eyes.
From the moment I saw him,
The sun filled the sky.

Beautiful just to hold.
In my dreams he was spring time
Winter was cold.

How could I tell him
What I so clearly could see
Though I longed for him
I never trusted me completely
So I never could be free.

Oh, but it was beautiful
Knowing now that he cared
I will always remember

Paul Potts,"Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close you eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly posses you
Open up your mind,
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be!
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

Help me make the music of the night",Music of the Night

They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish Upon a Star
Paul Preston,"You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love
Never my love

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you (on you)

Never my love
Never my love

You say you fear I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life
With me (with me, with me)",Never My Love
Paul Quinichette,"I'd know you anywhere, I'd know that grin,
I'd know you anywhere when you walked in,
I would tingle with a single glance in your eye,
Watching the starlight dance in your eye.

You saw my vacant stare, you understood,
I'd love you anywhere, honest I would,
I was certain this would happen, strange as it seems,
I'd know you anywhere from my dreams.",I'd Know You Anywhere
Paul Quinichette,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love
Paul Quinichette,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You
Paul Quinichette,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Paul Quinichette,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap

simply rotten to something worse

We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile

What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

For the sake of havin' you near

Paul Quinton,"Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven
Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven

Paul Raymond,"Well, I rush out blazin'
My pulse is racin'
As the rain streams down my face

There's no turning back now
To fight with fate
Outnumbered an' out of place

They said,""Go west young man, that's best
It's there you'll feel no pain""
Bel-Air's okay if you dig the grave
But I want to live again

Can't let go
There's a madness in my soul tonight
Can't let go
Must stop ridin' like the storm

Can't let go
Will I run out of control tonight?
Can't let go
Until every trace is gone

It's a winding road from Cuesta way
Down sunset to the beach
Though Canoga Park is a straight safe drive
It's too far outta reach

But now the headlights are flashin' by so fast
All directions seems the same
And the windscreen wipers keep a beat repeatin'
You can't let go again

What's in a name on the street tonight
I'm only a face in the crowd
I'm all in the dark and afraid tonight
There's nowhere to run or to hide

But I can't let go, no, no, no

Sometimes the world outside'll take you in
With just a smile
And you're so blinded with desire

A hundred sleepless nights have left me
Wasted and so cold
But I can take it I'm hangin' on

Can't let go
There's a madness in my soul tonight
Can't let go
Must stop ridin' it like the storm

Can't let go
Will I run out of control tonight?
Can't let go
Until every trace is gone

And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?

Paul Revere,"I remember back a long time ago,
In the days of my childhood.
In the evening when the sun was sinking low,
Walking in the wildwood.
Skippin' and flippin' through the flowers,
We'd go hand in hand.
Looking back on all the happy hours,
Anyone could understand.

[Chorus]
You and me, babe.
Sure 'nuff got to be, babe,
Birds of a feather.
We should be together
Like birds of a feather.
Got to be together
Like birds of a feather.

You and I didn't have a lot of friends,
Didn't have too much to say.
So they never would let us join in,
All the games they used to play.
Seems like it was only yesterday,
Down at Lincoln Junior High.
I remember what the kids used to say,
As we'd go strolling by.

[Chorus]

Time goes rolling by.
They say that you and I must go our separate ways.
But birds of a feather will always be together.

Your folks didn't want me hanging 'round.
Said that I was bad for you.
So we'd meet on the other side of town,
Down a long dark avenue.
But they can't keep the two of us apart,
As long as you really love me,
I got a feeling way down in my heart,
That's the way it's gonna be.

[Chorus]",2 Birds of a Feather

Is you'll come home

Well, I guess my good lovin' done lost its appeal 
Because when I called back I heard a-bad bad news 
They say our big romance has been gettin' abuse 
Now tell the truth, don't lie to me 
Have you been step, step, step, step, step, step, steppin' out on me? 
I've got ways of findin' out if you've been steppin' out on me 
It's my turn, let me give you a piece of my mind 

I told you once, I told you twice 
You're kind of rowdy after walkin' on ice 
Turn your loop in, do what I want you to do 
Stop your messin' now or I'm gonna step out on you 
Hey! Hey! Hey hey hey hey! 

If I can't be your one & only man 
I'm gonna call your daddy to give him back your hand 
I'm gonna call the preacher, tell the choir stay home

Now tell me true, don't lie to me 
Have you been step, step, step, step, step, step, steppin' out on me? 
Tell the truth, child; you've been steppin' out on me 
I gotta know in my heart if you've been steppin' out on me 
I'll be checkin' with all your friends if you've been steppin' out on me

You and me, babe.
Sure 'nuff got to be, babe,
Birds of a feather.
We should be together
Like birds of a feather.
Got to be together
Like birds of a feather.

You and I didn't have a lot of friends,
Didn't have too much to say.
So they never would let us join in,
All the games they used to play.
Seems like it was only yesterday,
Down at Lincoln Junior High.
I remember what the kids used to say,
As we'd go strolling by.

[Chorus]

Time goes rolling by.
They say that you and I must go our separate ways.
But birds of a feather will always be together.

Your folks didn't want me hanging 'round.
Said that I was bad for you.
So we'd meet on the other side of town,
Down a long dark avenue.
But they can't keep the two of us apart,
As long as you really love me,
I got a feeling way down in my heart,
That's the way it's gonna be.

My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
""Candy""
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine

Paul Robeson,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid

And see

Wagon wheels, wagon wheels
Keep on a turnin' wagon wheels
Roll along, sing your song
Carry me over the hill

Go on mule, there's a steamer at the landin'
Waiting for this cotton to load
Go on mule, the boss is understandin'

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Paul Robeson,"In seventy-six the sky was red
thunder rumbling overhead
Bad King George couldn't sleep in his bed
And on that stormy morn, Ol' Uncle Sam was born.
Some birthday! 

Ol' Sam put on a three cornered hat
And in a Richmond church he sat
And Patrick Henry told him that while America drew breath
It was ""Liberty or death."" 

What kind of hat is a three-cornered hat?
Did they all believe in liberty in those days? 

Nobody who was anybody believed it.
Ev'rybody who was anybody they doubted it.
Nobody had faith.
Nobody but Washington, Tom Paine, Benjamin Franklin,
Chaim Solomon, Crispus Attucks, Lafayette. Nobodies.
The nobodies ran a trea party at Boston. Betsy Ross
organized a sewing circle. Paul Revere had a horse race. 

And a little ragged group believed it.
And some gentlemen and ladies believed it.
And some wise men and some fools, and I believed it too.
And you know who I am.
No. Who are you mister? Yeah, how come all this?
Well, I'll tell you. It's like this... No let us tell you.
Mister Tom Jefferson, a mighty fine man. 
He wrote it down in a mighty fine plan.
And the rest all signed it with a mighty fine hand
As they crossed thier T's and dotted their I's
A bran' new country did arise. 

And a mighty fine idea. ""Adopted unanimously in Congress July 4, 1776,
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created 
equal.
That they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable 
rights.
That among these rights are Life, Yes sir!, Liberty, That's right!
And the pursuit of happiness."" 
Is that what they said? The very words.
That does sound mighty fine. 

Buildiing a nation is awful tough.
The people found the going rough.
Still nobody who was anybody believed it.
Everybody who anybody they stayed at home.
But Lewis and Clarke and the pioneers,
Driven by hunger, haunted by fears,
The Klondike miners and the forty niners,
Some wanted freedom and some wanted riches,
Some liked to loaf while others dug ditches.
But they believed it. And I believed it too,
And you know who I am.
No, who are you anyway, Mister? 

Well, you see it's like this. I started to tell you.
I represent the whole... Why that's it!
Let my people go. That's the idea!
Old Abe Lincoln was thin and long,
His heart was high and his faith was strong.
But he hated oppression, he hated wrong,
And he went down to his grave to free the slave. 

A man in white skin can never be free while his black brother is in 
slavery,
""And we here highly resolve that these dead shall not haave died in 
vain.
And this government of the people, by the people and for the people
Shall not perish from the Earth.""
Abraham Lincoln said that on November 19, 1863 at Gettysburg, 
Pennsylvania.
And he was right. I believe that too. 

Say, we still don't know who you are, mister.
Well, I started to tell you...
The machine age came with a great big roar,
As America grew in peace and war.
And a million wheels went around and 'round.
The cities reached into the sky,
And dug down deep into the ground.
And some got rich and some got poor.
But the people carried through,
So our country grew.

Still nobody who was anybody believed it.
Everybody who was anybody they doubted it.
And they are doubting still,
And I guess they always will,
But who cares what they say whem I am on my way 

Say, will you please tell us who you are?
What's your name, Buddy? Where you goin'? Who are you?
Well, I'm the everybody who's nobody, 
I'm the nobody who's everybody.
What's your racket? What do you do for a living? 

Well, I'm an
Engineer, musician, street cleaner, carpenter, teacher,
How about a farmer? Also. Office clerk? Yes sir!
That's right. Certainly!
Factory worker? You said it. Yes ma'am.
Absotively! Posolutely!
Truck driver? Definitely!
Miner, seamstress, ditchdigger, all of them.
I am the ""etceteras"" and the ""and so forths"" that do the work.
Now hold on here, what are you trying to give us?
Are you an American? 
Am I an American?
I'm just an Irish, Jewish, Italian, 
French and English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Polish, 
Scotch, Hungarian, Swedish, Finnish, Greek and Turk and Czech 

And that ain't all.
I was baptized Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, Luthern, 
Atheist, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Presbyterian, Seventh Day Adventist,
Mormon, Quaker, Christian Scientist and lots more.
You sure are something. 

Our country's strong, our country's young, 
And her greatest songs are still unsung.
From her plains and mountains we have sprung,
To keep the faith with those who went before. 

We nobodies who are anybody believe it.
We anybodies who are everybody have no doubts.
Out of the cheating, out of the shouting.

Deep as our valleys,
High as our mountains,
Strong as the people who made it.
For I have always believed it, and I believe it now,
And now you know who I am.
Who are you?
America! America!",Ballad for Americans
Paul Robeson,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no,

Paul Robeson,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me. 
 I once was lost but now I'm found, 
 Was blind but now I see. 
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fear relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear, 
 The hour I first believed. 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares 
 We have already come 
 T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
 And grace will lead us home.

 We've no less days to sing God's praise

Chose a gun and threw away the sun
Now these towns
They all know our name 6-gun sound is our claim to fame
I can hear them say bad company
And I won't deny
Bad bad company
Till the day I die
Till the day I die
Solo bad
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad company
Till the day I die
And I say it's
Bad company oh yeah---yeah
Bad company
Till the day I die oh yeah tell me that you are not a thief
Oh but I am
Bad company
It's the way I play
Dirty for dirty
Oh somebody double-crossed me
Double-cross
Double-cross
Yeah
We're bad company
Kill in cold blood",Bad Company
Paul Rodgers,"Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

She lives in a luxury apartment
In the heart of town
I live in the country
And my house is tumbling down

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

I met her in her neighborhood
I was just passing through
One look was all it took
Yeah, one look or two

Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love

You got my name
You got my number
You got my number
You got my name
Have mercy

Now I'm gonna settle down
Get myself a wife or two
No more of this running around
Like I used to do

Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love

Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love, baby
Call me if you need my love

Paul Rodgers,"I like to sit here in the sunshine
Trees in the fields are green sublime
Suspended in time
And don't it make you feel small?

I like to sit here by the fire's light
The trees in the fields lie bare to the night
The stars burn bright
And don't it make you feel small?

Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime

I like to sit here in the autumn time
The trees in the fields, they rustle in the wind
The church bells gently chime
Gentle on your mind, suspended in time
And don't it make you feel small?

Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone need to find peace sublime
Oh, peace of mind

Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone

Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away, find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime
Oh, peace of mind
