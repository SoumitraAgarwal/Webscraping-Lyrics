Coal Chamber,"Living a lie, let's not pretend -
That you like me, or we are friends
We can call it for the few that are listening tonight
We'll divide the dream, cut the loss
Feel no pain - You can f*** the fame 
You can f*** the fame!
For the ones that are listening...
(chorus)
All this time that I called you FRIEND! 
I won't be there for you again
All this time that I called you FRIEND!
I won't be there for you again
You're future's bleak, you better save your skin
It's that flesh you smell - It's that skin you're in
You're soul is rotting as well as your inners -
Your mind and teeth, they're getting thinner
Selfish, Self-sustaining 
Regrets, Unmistaking 
F*** the fame, you can f*** the fame
For the ones who are listening...
All this time that I called you FRIEND! 
I won't be there for you again
All this time that I called you FRIEND!
I won't be there for you again
SLEEP WELL, SLEEP TIGHT
You know this song is about you, don't you?
All this time that I called you FRIEND! 
I won't be there for you again
All this time that I called you FRIEND!
I won't be there for you again",Friend?
Coal Chamber,"Never again!
 
All my life it's been much the same game
Altogether now who pass the blame game
I'm not the one so don't put your shame on
You're not the one that I put the blame on
 
There is nothing I would rather do then
Get up and explain life to you friend
There is nothing I would rather do then
Get up and explain life to you
 
One step forward
Two steps back
Three steps forward, go!
 
People want to come and take from me everything
People want to come and leave me with nothing
I'm not the one so don't put your shame on
You're not the one that I put the blame on
 
There is nothing I would rather do then
Get up and explain life to you friend
There is nothing I would rather do then
Get up and explain life to you
 
One step forward
Two steps back
Three steps forward, go!
 
Why do you hide
So afraid of what you'll leave behind
Why do you hide
So afraid of what you'll leave behind

Three steps forward, go!

Where four people lived?
That house, it took it's toll

And they shall know no good or peace

Coal Chamber,"Let down through the breakthrough
I travel as I hunger for the darkness below me
When I'm praying for the light above
To save this soul inside me

Should I? Would I? Could I?

Outcast from my own kind never knowing
Soaring through my own mind never knowing
How could they live with what their doing
Twist of my spine

Oh god, fuck

I don't get it, breathe with me
Just breathe with me

It's up to me as I hunger
Lay slow and still as I wonder
Pray for darkness down in this hollow
But I try to grope

It's up to me as I sleep again
My body lays down as I holler
It's all inside but I confess in me
I like me

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.

Coalesce,"So shallow, not even an infant
Could drown within this compassion
But I feel as if I've drowned just the same
But rather from my ignorance
That unconditional love might exist

I forgot the numbness, I forgot the frustration
That makes up my daily routine of just getting by
I am just barely getting by emotionally
Judgment, disappointment, a lack of patience for me
This is not security but such a pretty package

The guise is broken as the truth rears it's ugly head unto me
A drunken soul, I'm conscious again, I've weakened from my stupor
For the last time, so content caressed in rejection
For it's all that love has ever led to once again

The dying man lays down the law for this peon
It's his last grasp at control, a control that he lost
In infidelity from today, to you I'm dead
As an order accepting son, your searching and searching
But your family isn't at the bottom of any bottle

You're smoking us away, you're choking on your own
No place to hide other than my tears, they still give me away
Do all things end like this? Must all things end like this?

Burn
These fields of corn, that surround. My harvest
Gone at the price of
Maturity. But these remains
I've left to rot will be resurrected again and
Again
By the next generation of children who want to change
Minds with the
Stain on hand. But, it's deeper than
This, I'm not the only one who sees, it
Lies in
Diversity; acceptance to a degree, only to a degree.
The fire that
Once occupied my eyes has spread to
Destroy this world I have grown. You have
Nothing
New to scream beyond your fields and not a second of
Patience to
Learn from me the same. This time I
Harvest the crops of my past. As far as
The demigods
Are concerned, I've sold myself out just the same.
I've burned

of
cowardice, but the birth of a saviour. Acceptance
of a martyr's role.
Extricate these demons from

foundation of tolerance at any extreme. Even the price
of suicide. Even a
price so high as this. The seas

while

change. Off the hook
for feigned insanity, but not
off the hook from the public. In the media and

Amongst this tabloid filth over kill, an embarrassing
Lack of responsibility, a vicious cycle of soap opera

Concern allowed between each sports update. You cried

Must taste the pain. Remind me of our system
Atrocities. Don't let me forget. Don't let me forget.

I want to lay down, but I got no home
Is there a better place?
Cast into the open, with nowhere else to go

Or should I stay awake?
Tired of going in circles, trying to stay alive

Because it keeps on working
Don't make it right

I'll try anything, that could somehow free me from
The ball and chain
If I can hold out, for I've nowhere else to run
Or person to blame
I may be weary
But I'm on my feet again
I had a love that I could call my own
But I had no choice
Who's afraid of nothing, must be clinging to the vine

Because it keeps on working
Don't make it right
I raise my head high, and make a toast to the fallen saints
Bless their souls
It's been a long ride, we've all endured some aches and pains
Heaven knows
Could have been easier
But misery loves me so
Cast into the open with nowhere else to go
Tired of going in circles, trying to stay alive

Born with teeth

Out of the womb into an ugly world I've been thrown
Welcome to the race
Up on two legs before it tumbles on me
I'm not looking for a kind work to keep me going
It' so much better off this way
To be born with teeth

After all that I've seen taken place
Very little has affect
I've been treated like I should have been
At least that's what my mind says
I'll be around when everyone has been satisfied or overcome
It's possible even my happiness will stumbled on

Out of the womb into an ugly world I've been thrown

I get along without to much advise
Ahh, but if it weren't so hard to make things right
It's gonna be whatever fate will bring
I've managed to look good so far
But there's no use pretending

But how could I know 
When I believed that there were angels 
Calling my name 
As though they're watching over me 
Nobody's home 
So I go looking out for trouble 
And another story that I can believe 
Just another story that I can believe 

Don't be frightened babe

To find all these things that you need? 
If you were but one

That claims he's free 

Just around the corner, half a mile to heaven 
Strong enough to hold you, starved for some affection 
Darling come quickly, come ease my mind 
For my prayers have not been answered in a long time 

I've already made my bed, like it or not 
As long as there's no regrets 
I'll be here when the ride stops 
These comforts to me and these crosses to bear 
With which we live

I got a ride from a coyote

So your loved one can be home soon 

Fine women with dress-up clothes 
Say and do anything 
Wake up to work the day

Rub shoulders with the downtown gang 
Where the Virgin lives 
Just like a movie star 
Hopeful and graceful

People do what they like, that much is sobering 
But nothing less than a miracle could answer to all my pleas 
Hope for my wish, the waves of a parting sea 
I could use a little thunder 
And lightning from the sky 
So should I leave these precious dreams 
Will not die 

How to live by the rules when I've read this book before 
There's no courage to prove, just your reasoning 
Faces of forgotten men much too afraid to ask 
Like cogs in a wheel, we long to keep turning back 
I've got to keep from going under 
While running for my life 
So should I leave these precious dreams 
Will not die 

After years of uncertainty I wait for the final round 
Losing my place, you call me to calm you down 
I could use a little thunder 
And in someone to confide 
So should I leave these precious dreams 
Will not die 
A little thunder and lightning 
So when I leave these precious dreams

When you're blind I'll be your eyes
When you're weak I'll carry you
When hope is gone I'll pull you through
And I'll believe in you

In darkest hours, in troubled times
Through seas of fire and fields of lies
When all is lost in clouds of pain 
I'll be your comfort and your guide

When all around the battles rage
Remember you were born to be free
I'm in your blood, your part of me
And I'll believe in you

In darkest hours, in troubled times
Through seas of fire and fields of lies
When all is lost in clouds of pain 
I'll be your comfort and your guide

When your back's against the wall
I'll never let you fall
And I'll believe in you",Anthem
Cock Sparrer,"We were born by the Thames' running water, sons of the social disorder
Go to school, get a job, be a fool or a yob and prepare yourself for gaol
But we tired of the constant surrender to those with a hidden agenda
So we fought with the best, now it's time for a rest as we say our last farewell

[Chorus]
Goodbye, we're calling it day, we're having it away, we're gonna say goodbye
Goodbye, there's nothing left to say, we're getting in the way
We're gonna say goodbye

For the holidays in Devon, for the spirit of seventy-seven
For the laughs and the ligs and the drinks and the gigs
And the making of the fuss
For the friends who knew just where to find us
For the mates who were always behind us
When you're next in a pub or a bar or a club, have a drink on us

Peace in our time, no pain no gain, management decisions, insurance claims,
The slow but sure will always win it, there's one born every minute

It's a lie

The cheque's in the post, you won't feel a thing, the power of prayer and the deadly sins,
You're as young as you feel, your mother knows best, the truth will out, young man go west,
The end can justify the means, God save the queen

Expense accounts, graduation days, a friend in need, a spade's a spade,
The power and the glory, the country's burning, the lady's not for turning

Credit ratings, human rights, the seven wonders, another street fight,

You can fool some people some part of the time

Don't you ask no favors from me

'cause we're blanked
And I wonder what is that we've done
Oh he was only having some fun
What went wrong
I get the feeling that somebody's got it in for us all the way
And we've been called names that were not justified
And we never had the right to reply
Telling lies

Somebody somewhere must care
Hello hello is anybody there
Who'll lend us an ear

It's just amazing how little people know about us
Not a thing
But rumors carry more weight than facts
And they only contribute to the fact
That we take

Never mind the bollocks the truth is plain to see
If only people took the time to come and talk to me

The pressures mounting, everybody's waiting to hear at the end
But the more they try to sweep us away
Makes me all the more determined to stay
We won't go away",Is Anybody There?

Too many hang ups lie festering
Too much in the art of conditioning

Cockspur Steelband,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Just for ya, is it déjà vu?

The way you whisper, the way you touch me,
And the way you say my name,
Is the feeling that I can't explain, no.

You can take my breath away

In a world where I have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow
I will show the world what's inside my heart

Must I pretend I'm
Someone else for all time?

That burns with a need to know the reason why
Why must we all conceal
What we think?

How we feel?
Must there be a secret me

Coco Montoya,"Woo!

The joint was a jumpin' on the corner
(Yeah, yeah)
Down on a Honky Tonk Street
(Yeah, yeah)
When all of a sudden up drove a Cadillac
(Yeah, yeah)
And out stepped a cat named Pete

Diamonds on-a every finger
(Yeah, yeah)
Wore a tailor-made suit
He smoked a black cigar
(So what?)
He wore a Stetson hat
(Yeah)
He wore a pair-a cowboy boots

He busted on through the doorway
(Yeah, yeah)
Bad as-a he could be
(Yeah, yeah)
He pulled out his pistol, he turned around
He said, 'My name is a Big Boy Pete'

The music stopped, there wasn't a sound
A-over in the corner stood-a, Bad Man Brown
Brown smiled a grin, he said, ""My friend""
(You take your 3 steps forward and I'm 'onna-a, clue you in')

Now Pete said, ""A look it, here buddy""
(Yeah, yeah)
'Fore I tan your hide
(Yeah, yeah)
I got a forty-five to keep me alive
Seven bullets on my side

Brown pulled a knife, he jumped on Pete
They fought from the counter right on out to the street
They swung from north, they swung from south
Brown cut that black cigar right outta Pete's mouth!
Pete hit the ground, he yelled and screamed
(Pete took his Stetson hat and beat the scene)

Now if you're ever down on the corner
(Yeah, yeah)
Down on-a Honky Tonk Street
(Yeah, yeah)
Don't mess with Brown
(Yeah, yeah)
He'll cut you down
Take a message from-a Big Boy Pete

Umm-umm, umm, umm, umm
(Yeah, yeah)

And my mama used to hang me out to dry
You know the boy couldn't have it
Sometimes he just had to find
A hiding place to hang his head and cry

Little bit of shelter from the blues

Here I am as a young man, my feet out on the highway
Summer breeze to tell me what to do
I might meet a young lady and stop off for a while

We all need the hiding place to get us through
Yes, we do

Oh, I can tell the difference between right and wrong
I can't always tell which one's best for me
But I know this dirty city like the back of my dirty hand
And still can't seem to find no sanity

Now I'm looking out a window and you are looking in
And we both are thinking and we like just what we see
You say you can't be certain, baby, what I see in you

I think I should just step aside

So, don't take it personally

Well, I'm that one guy in a million
That you picked out from the crowd
You were sure that you could change me

So, let's both make an admission
We just can't work it out, no, how

Don't get me wrong then right, then plead me to play

This time I ain't gonna lose

I hear what you're sayin'
And the words go down like fine wine
But my heart's feelin' heavy [unverified]
Like I just drank some turpentine

Try to make me a fool
From my head down to my shoes
Well, enough is enough
This time I ain't gonna lose

I let it slide one time before
You didn't think I knew
It never was a secret girl
That you lay down like you do

Don't you stumble now baby
But you're walking a very fine line
Might as well admit it girl
You caused a serious crime

Sent me packing in my beat up Ford
Told me money was the thing that I lack
But I came back in a Cadillac

She said, ""You'll never be a man of means
You don't do nothing for my self esteem""
Hurt so bad and fellas I ain't lyin'
Eyes wide open, girl robbed me blind

A little hug, a little kissin'
What cash I had it all come up missin'
Robbed me hard, didn't cut me no slack
But now I'm back in a Cadillac

Thought I'd take a ride
And park it right by her door
(One more)
She came outside
With her arms open wide
I said, ""Too late, baby
I don't need you no more""

Now I'm wiser and a whole lot richer
Since I got that girl out of the picture
I get more lovin' it's a natural fact

Home where the grass is greenah
And all the gods and earths choose a court in Medina
Bucktown
The place where I received my roots
Got put on to this loot
And got my first Tim boots
Bucktown
See me in the G-S-T-0-0
On the side of the road
Gettin' harassed by po-po's
Bucktown
Home of my be	-see-see
And everybody that I roll with, the family

Boot Camp's the way of life for a loner like me
Constantly holdin' courts in the street with police
Like the sergeant 81st, pretty boy is what they call 'em
Said he was a gun man, duke is kinda brawlic
Speaks with an accent, ????? I would imagine
A hot-headed dred known for jumping into action
We danced a few times
He got his, I got mine
Called the whole force up to pat us down for the crime
Said it's all about a quarter and his veins bleed blue
Your man Rudey, Juliani fucked it up for you
Ain't gonna be no dice throwin'
Dead that weed blowin'
Domestic violence, automatic fire, he ain't jokin'
Now you first offenders are gettin' hit like predicates
Goin' through the system just for standin' on the strip
Gotta keep an open eye when it's time to cop la
From dirty ass deeds and unmarks ridin' by

(Chorus)

Home of the Originoo Gunn Clappaz
And bank safe crackers
Pot-pushin hustlers and everyday jackers
When flauntin' get cautioned if you don't ride with the right crew
?????????????????? and bust off when they can front on you
I still do
Smoke buds with the thugs
About to face the judge 
Show all my niggaz love
I can't knock the hustle, get your cream by all means
Do what you gotta do to live, to feed you and your seeds

Bucktown's everywhere I see
Representatives livin' nocturnally
Break a day on the regular
All night is all right with us
As long as we can get rid of the red we get the better
But never lose your head, just maintain
Only use the cushion pain to ease your brain
No strain
When Tek and Steele bang
Ain't shit changed from birth
be	-see-see degrees, on to them other planes

(Chorus)

Cocoa Brovaz,"Here's the science, it seem like yesterday to me
H.N.B. robbery, in Manhattan for currency
Sittin' up in the crib, drawin' out a map
On where security was gon' leave the door open at

Park the van around back, the M.P. jet black
We should be in and out 60 seconds flat
So son what's the deal? He ain't takin' his route
He rather stay home like a bitch, and have a alibi

What his cut look like, he think he takin' half
While we do all the dirt, he sit home on his ass
I got a funny feeling son, somethin' just ain't right
Kinda glad, I didn't go wit Rum and them that night

And sure enough nigga, you best to believe
Duke snitched under the hot light, like steady people
Wit a vote than a Clinton, Rum and me
Him in cell 2, and me in cell 3

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

Me off the job would of been easy, if son wouldn't have been greedy
I told him to parle, 'cause he one high jet speedin'
Laughin', countin', tryin' to play with money he ain't got
No knowledge of himself, and the trigger gave him heart

He just finish biddin', some remote federal prison
D said he was quotin' niggas, word to word shittin'
To get a light of sense, evident as I remember
When Dunn Dunn got knocked, I just seen him last summer

At Soul In The Hole, it was a King E. King game
First time out his crib, the kid got body, he got blamed
For being the last one seen, fleein' from the scene
Walk was with him up there, he said Duke was held obscene

On some in and out a cell, C.O. slayed him on his mail
His family got banked, he out on 200 foul bail
Myself I don't trust, and that's ya man, so you bust him
'cause every man, know a dead man don't answer questions

It was all love, when push came to shove
I had back, till one kid got clapped
They lock G, for conspiracy
He turn around tryin rattle me, Arabic

I know about this type of shit, snitches do exist
To all my dunns, holdin' guns
Gettin' funds, watch ya self
Through most of ya crimes by delf

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

She said she love me, but she took me for granted, when she panic
Flip the whole street, to some shit I couldn't handle it
From my man from up the hill, what the deal?
The block is heatin' up, and I need to cop steel

Come and see me, come bring dough 'cause, I can't afford a freebie
And come alone son, 'cause cats know to be snitchin' on TV
Be easy, I'm out but my love wanna tease me
Shorty want some attention, not to mention wanna please me

Hold tight, I'll be back in a flash, don't worry
You got money honey, stop actin' funny
Out the door, to care of my B.I.Z.
And I know this muthafuckas that's eyein' me

Is it a set-up, I peel but I make a detour
And come back, and see my shorty talkin' wit the law
I witnessed her trappin' 'bout my business
Where I be goin', who I know in the industry

She sex me good, but I should of known
Come into this world alone
Leave this world alone
Word is bond

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

Cocoa Brovaz,"Yeah, after Dah Shinin, it all became clear to me
I knew things would be different son
I knew it'd come time for a change
Seems like the time is now

Jah! Rastafarai

Greetings to my soldiers and soldierettes

Jewel on the world, make the earth sink
On the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reachin' for infinity
Can he be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck, they can't function
Caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it to the finish

As the sun heats, I put my feet to the concrete
Hard to sleep so I take it to the streets
Hold my head up, try to keep it movin'
Fed up with losin'
I need some air
I think I take a cruise with you
I'm using, what little know how I possess
To keep our familia down to rest
Now I stress defensive tactics
'Cause police seem active
Got me in the crib sleepin' with heat under the mattress


In case of home intrusion:
First the dogs go ""bark""
Then about five sparks bringin' light to the dark
Like ? does his movement when he's dealin' with math
Or the boss tell his workers where he's keepin' the stash
When that gun blast, better have Jah on your side
Or an act of devine intervention from the most high
I know guys that get a thrill from the kill
And other niggaz, who hold the greed to sling ?frills?

Chorus
Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay
(Repeat)

Damn I haven't worked since I was 'bout 17
They had time busy hangin' out being a drama fiend
I had to run the streets, see what the night brought out
Sneak in the crib
Hear my moms prayin' to God that I sprout
Take all responsibilities like a man would do
'Cause she know that the streets can bring the worst out of you
She told me concentrate on school but what I do about loot?
I want to push the fat ride, have bitches sweatin' me too
But you know you need dough so you can do the do
And going to class everyday don't bring in no loot
Plus I just been told that I was cold by club bouncers
Standing there hot headed ?bout to set it while they denounce us
Crab niggaz still beggin? for CD?s
While brothaz? careers is stuck on halt and freeze
About to face extinction ?pockets dead is thinkin??
Something ain't peace and suicide?s part of my thinkin?
Even God don't hear my prayer or him just not care
Got a son in this world, stressed out losin? my hair

Chorus

It?s time to take the struggle to the pavement
Let the people know the mayor sent the OK for enslavement
Orders from the government
Official stubborn men with egos runnin? shit
They put the hit out on whoever try to get out
And they are the directors who are dead and ?
Even down south in Atlanta
Police play the pawn for their master
It?s a disaster, practicing who can kill us faster
For less than nothin? like they did Bobby Huton
Corruption got me clutchin? my rifle for gun bustin?
Somethin?s cookin?
Look at the way some faces be lookin?
Cross the bank rock on to Brooklyn, Texas
Even in Houston P?s be shootin? us like sitting ducks in groups
And I can't trust who or what
That will explain the way I watch you, plus,
I know the chosen are few
Many come around to proclaim things they know not
Let alone maintain
Shame, some of my worst enemies
Live right around me and look just like me
I see that its time to intensify the movements in front of my eyes
can't rely on a seeing dog they got me
Or lay and wait for the devil to surprise me, nah G

Chorus (twice)
 It only takes a line to make the mind think
Drop a jewel on the world make the earth sink
I'm on the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reaching for infinity
Plenty be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck they can't function caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it ?till the finish

For some reason, niggas be fiendin'
And when niggas be fiendin, they be quick to commit treason
But I keep breathin' through, though the season do
Be seemin' to get a lot more hot than usual
So, who can I confide in, who can I trust to bust when I'm ridin'

There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own

Every clique got a soft nigga in it, believe me
That potray a kid he saw on the streets or in the movies
Tryin' to do the same he seen on the screen
Got his big guns, Timbs, hoody and his jeans
Talk the fast talk but there's a pause in this walk
Rock his jewels, truck and he still eat pork
He get his little hustle on, he run with his major team
Crazy ass dread from Jamaica, Queens
Ain't never seen war up in his face before
Get his news from the barber shop beeper store
But if you let him tell it, he's the last man standing
talkin' bout son, I held it down with the cannon
Should of seen the way that I was blazin' at the cats
Twist of the wrist, while I was pattin' one back
Like that kid did to Menace, when he had the four pound
You know it's only right, I had to hold the fort down

Blazin' with' ya friends, when we ridin'
There's no suprisin', it's all good

Tryin' to big up, tryin' to big up with my master plan

As a youth I would sit up in my room and dream
One day I became with a ruthless teen
Little did I know that every step I took
Had already been signed and sealed in some books
So I took a look at what I got to work with of course
And if granted by the source move on with full force
What choice to choose, if I sin will I use

To which ever form you base your religion on

Strung along the highway

Following the stars of your eyes

Promise me that you'll cherish
This tarnished offering

And if you take me inside
And you give me a place to hide and cry
I'll bathe you in the crystal light
That sleeps between my thighs
A times you fear the angle's sigh
To the lord and heavens that is aint right
But in this chalice you'll fine the wine

And the heart is dumb and the heart is blind
But I think you'll find that the lord is kind

My soul was filled with crystal light
Lavender ribbons of rain sang
Ridding my heart of mortal fright
Of mortal fright

Broken sundown fatherless showdown
Gun hip swollen lip bottle sip yeah I suck dick
Loose grip on gravity falls sky blinding crumbling walls
River sweep away my memories of
Children's things a young mother's love
Before the yearning song of flesh on flesh
Young hearts burst open wounds bleed fresh
A young brother skinny and tall my older walks
Ocean ward and somber, slumber sleeping
Flowers in the water, but I'm just his daughter
Walking down an icy grave leading to my
Schizophrenic father.
Weeping willow won't you wallow louder
Searching for my father's power

I'm a shake you off though
Get up on that horse and
Ride into the sunset
Look back with no remorse

He's a black magic wielder some say a witch
Wielded darkness when he was wilein' on his mom's
And born child and he was the bastard the that broke
Up the marriage evil doer doing evil from a baby carriage
And he was born with the same blue eyes
Crystal ships dripping with ice, diamonds coruscate
In the night fireworks electric bright
And now he's got his own two sons
Trys to hide his tears in a world of fun
But loveless bedrooms filled with doom
Bring silent heartache July to June
Swoon over new young hot flame
Mourn the memories later
Laugh now alligator

In a dream my father came to me
And made me swear that I?d keep
What's sacred to me
And if I get the choice to live in his name
I'll pray my way through the rain
Singing oh happy day

I don't mean to close the door
But for the record my heart is sore
You blew through me like bullet holes
Left stains on my sheets and stains on my soul
You left me broke down begging for change
Had to catch a ride with a man who's deranged
He had your hands and my father's face
Another western vampire
Different time same place
I had dreams that brings me sadness
Rain much deeper than a river
Sorrow flow through me
Tiny waves of shivers
Corny movies make me reminisce
They break me down easy on this generic love shit
First kiss frog and princess

I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right

Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night

I gave you every dime and tell me what did you do
You broke this heart of mine by loving somebody new
You said that love was forever you'd leave me never
But where are you now

Chorus:
I gave you everything all that one could ever give
I gave you everything you were my reason to live
Everythings out of place
There's an empty space
In my heart
And I gave you everything

You took the best of me you took everything I had
You took so selfishly and gave nothing in return
I would have set you free if that's how it had to be
Why would you lie (why, why)
Why would you need to make me cry

Ooh, yeah, I cried myself to sleep that night
It wasn't right for you to leave me here high and dry
It wasn't right to close the door without so much as a goodbye
Could have blood from a stone
Why did you leave me alone?

Staring out of your room

Feeling blue
What am I gonna do?
Look at me, just close your eyes
Try to realize
Look at me, just close your eyes

Coffee's there
On the floor
From the night before
Shades are drawn
Against the sun
Where is everyone?

Codeine Velvet Club,"Down down, you bring me down
I hear you knocking down my door and I can't sleep at
night
Your face, it has no place
No room for you inside my house I need to be alone

Don't waste your words I don't need anything from you
I don't care where you've been or what you plan to do

Turn turn, I wish you'd learn
There's a time and place for everything I've got to get
it through
Cut loose, cause you're no use
I couldn't stand another second in your company

Don't waste your words I don't need anything from you
I don't care where you've been or what you plan to do

Stone me, why can't you see
You're a no-one nowhere washed up baby who'd look
better dead

Your tongue is far too long
I hate the way it sucks and slurps upon my every word

Don't waste your words I don't need anything from you
I don't care where you've been or what you plan to do

I am the resurrection and I am the light

Codeine Velvet Club,"Windy old head
I sang along with the words that she said
Happy and bad
""Where goes the time?""
She asked me once
Oh and if you don't mind
Give back my heart when you go

Begging bowl blues
Wrapped round my head
Like a fistful of news nobody reads

Me and her name I can't recall
I was never the same after she left me

And oh I missed her so
Never thought much of her reason to go
And well, she cast a spell
Under I fell in a useless hello

Useless old day
Wishing the hours would take me away
Just for a while
Nobody's crook, stealing an answer
Oh why does he look drunk as the day he was born?

Ragged and torn, lives for the money these days,
What a joke
And once, twice is a sin
Couldn't get in with the elegant folk

I cannot wait any longer
And I cannot claim to be free
Whenever it seems like I'm losing
The begging bowl blues follow me

And she cannot say that she's happy
And I cant be sure if I care
I got wrapped up in the money
And the begging bowl blues kept me there",Begging Bowl Blues
Codeine Velvet Club,"Please baby let me sit by your fire
I'll steal all of the things that you desire
Midnight's howl and jukebox love
Are the only things I'm dreaming of
Don't misunderstand me when I say

I can't hear anything that your saying
Twenty steps to heaven and then you leave me praying
I'm not the kind of girl to be impressed by that

Someday soon when the black roses wither
You'll remember her
And everything you didn't give her
And I'll be the one you see
When you can't turn back

The walls pound and my hands shake in the night
My heart freezes in cold wondrous fright
12th street jokes, worn out pride
There's nothing much left here to hide
I could drown for days on last years tide

I don't buy anything that you're saying
I don't believe the half of it, the cards that you've been playing
I'm not the kind of girl to be impressed by that

Someday soon when the black roses wither
You'll remember her and everything you didn't give her
And I'll be the one you see

Codeine Velvet Club,"How can it be that I could be lost again?
Here in a town of yesterday's desperate men
All dressed up to go for the final scene
Here comes the dread, they fed me in last night's dream

She's got too much class for the likes of me
I'll stay but don't make me nervous
Lost in the haze of yesterdays memory
Don't think that you don't deserve us

Crying all the way to the bank on the bullet train
But crying don't get you nowhere
I must be the only man that they couldn't frame

I couldn't see the enemy till he was close behind
Waltzing blind, through my mind
And if the lights should freeze, oh please
Don't make it him or me, then we'll see

This city is a monument to bad taste in vain
Hooray for Hollywood, break out the search lights above
But I couldn't tear myself away so I can't complain
Send out the substitutes, tonight we'll be making love

Crawling in deaf and dumb for the losers ball
Here's to the house on the hill and the thrill of it all
Sinking in a tidal wave of alcohol

How could I miss, it's come to this
Hollywood final scene, make it clean
And if the lights should freeze, oh please
Don't make it him or me, then we'll see

I couldn't see the enemy till he was close behind
Waltzing blind, through my mind
Look out below, this heart will blow
In Hollywood style tonight,",Hollywood
Codeine Velvet Club,"Dead as the lights on the wrong side of midnight
Praying to god that something would feel right
I loved you more than I probably should have
You might have done more and you probably could have

Nothing could stop me from being a man
I've tried all the words that I possibly can
I should arrived when I said that I would
I called out your name but it done me no good

I would've agreed with whatever you told me
I would've paid double the price for which you sold me

How would you feel if I told you I loved you?
I want to scream that there's no one above you
I would send you roses every single day
I would send you roses every single day

Codeine Velvet Club,"There's nothing that I wouldn't do if you'd only ask me to leave
Like a cold Casanova in the bedroom of a cynical thief
Honestly, honestly, won't you tell me please
How a fool can rescue you chasing every pretty thing he sees
While begging on his knees

There's nothing I can do for you when your so alone I could cry
Like a soulless bella donna dying in the blink of an eye
Dance for me, dance for me
Wont you tell please
How you came to love me in the rhythm of this never ending tease
While begging on your knees

There's nothing that I wouldn't say if you'd only choose to believe
My love for you is endless like a full moon dead on the sea
Wait for me, wait for me, till the day is through
Dancing round the ashes of our love was not enough for you
Raging in the fever was enough to make you freeze
You and I the victims in the rhythm of this never ending tease
While begging on our knees",Like a Full Moon

Hey little sister just watch them go
Hey little sister don't go down go down
hey little sister just down let go

You keep winging it
They'll keep singing it
Wrong key most of the time
They'll keep selling it
Cast your spell on it
It's not that easy to find

You keep trying it
They'll keep buying it
Sending half the nation to sleep
No direction upon reflection
There's nothing for you out there to keep",Little Sister
Codeine Velvet Club,"Should you always be a mystery
I'd be lost in daydreams constantly
Out of reach, strung out like yesterday
Close your eyes and watch me drift away.

Somewhere in between the speeding cars
I was born beneath a shooting star
In the morning sun they sold me
Electric hours of fun needlessly

Promise me, promise me
You'll never wait for me
There in the vacant light
Don't say a prayer for me
Tell them I've got somewhere I have to go
That I wished on a star
I'll be back by the end of the show

Should you ever drift into the parade
I'll be the first in line to be saved
And after all know one really knows this desert wind
Or which way it blows

Come out tonight and realize
Here upon my restless sunken eyes
We can sleep till night comes calling
And stop this sky of lights from falling in

I'll love you even when you're poor
You don't mean anything

I heard you calling out my name
You don't love anyone
You don't love anyone

But midnight's on its way
and there's so much I'll never say
And all the streetlights flicker endlessly
And steal my heart away, so wont you

Stay with me, stay with me
I don't need you
I just want you here with me
Nights like these
Come and go so needlessly

Where did your good times go?
You used to chase me from your door
You don't know anything
You don't know anything I'm sure

I know enough to see
That you need anyone but me
You don't hear anything
You never hear a word I say

You must believe me
Do your lonely eyes deceive me?
Did the moonlight have to leave me
In this cold and vacant way?

Wont you stay with me, stay with me
I don't need you
I just heard you'd wait for me
Endlessly naming every street for me

Blue light fuels the daze
Of all those promises you made
And every love struck scene on silver screen
Pulls me right back in

So wont you stay with me, stay with me
I don't need you, I just heard you'd wait for me
Endlessly naming every street for me

I'm not sure what we should sing
A toast to life and its bitter ironies

Another day, another night
Another time, would it change anything?

We had the melody
But we were missing the rhyme
Will we ever be in the right time?

The clock is ticking
How long until we are there?

An off beat love affair

Just dance me out of despair

As long as we get there

Another day, another night
Another time, would you be ready for me?
