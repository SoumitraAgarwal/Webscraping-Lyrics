Dick Haymes,"I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
The devil and the deep blue sea",Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea
Dick Haymes,"Only last Saturday,
Or was it yesterday?
I was rehearsing a speech,
Really, I think it's a peach!
Hope you don't think it's a breach
Of recognized etiquette,
(I'm from Connecticut!)
You see the state I'm in,
I mean I'm in a mess!
What was that speech?
Oh yes, yes!

I like the likes of you,
I like the things you do,
I mean I like the likes of you!

I like you're eyes of blue,
I think they're blue, don't you?
I mean I like your eyes of blue!

Oh dear, if I could only say what I mean,
I mean if I could mean what I say,
That is, I mean to say that I mean to say that,

I like the likes of you,
You're looks are pure de-luxe,
Looks like I like the likes of you!

Oh dear, if I could only say what I mean,
I mean if I could mean what I say,
That is, I mean to say that I mean to say that,

I like the likes of you,
You're looks are pure de-luxe,
Looks like I like the likes of you!",I Like the Likes of You
Dick Haymes,"If I should lose you, the stars would fall from the sky
If I should lose you, leaves would wither and die
The birds in May-time - they'd sing a mournful refrain
And I would wander around - hating the sound of rain
With you beside me, the rose would bloom in the snow
With you beside me, no winds of winter would blow
I gave you my love - and I was living a dream
But living would seem - in vain if I
(Hating the rain - if I)
(All is in vain if I)
If I ever lost you",If I Should Lose You
Dick Haymes,"The weather is frightening.
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day. 
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day?
Dick Haymes,"Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so",Moonlight Becomes You
Dick Haymes,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark
Dick Haymes,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.
And if my throbbing heart should ever start repeating 
That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You
Dick Haymes,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you 
Just the way you look tonight.

Mm, mm, mm, mm,
Just the way you look tonight",The Way You Look Tonight
Dick Haymes,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Dick Haymes,"I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you, 
Come rain or come shine. 
High as a mountain and deep as a river, 
Come rain or come shine. 

I guess when you met me 
It was just one of those things, 
But don't ever bet me, 
""Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me. 

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me, 
Come rain or come shine. 
Happy together, unhappy together 
And won't it be fine. 

Days may be cloudy or sunny, 
We're in or we're out of the money, 
But I'm with you always, 
I'm with you rain or shine.",Come Rain or Come Shine

Song: ""How Deep Is the Ocean?"" Lyrics
How can I tell you what is in my heart?
How can I measure each and every part?
How can I tell you how much I love you?
How can I measure just how much I do?

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
>From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?",How Deep Is the Ocean?
Dick Haymes,"Its very clear our love is here to stay
Not for a year, forever and a day
The radio and the telephone
And the movies that we know
They're all just passing fancies
That in time may go

Oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together were going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
Oh, our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay
Dick Haymes,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In
Dick Haymes,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Dick Haymes,"The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

",The Very Thought of You
Dick Haymes,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Dick Haymes,"The girl that I marry will have to be
As soft and as pink as a nursery
The girl I call my own
Will wear satins and laces and smell of cologne

Her nails will be polished and, in her hair,
She'll wear a gardenia and I'll be there
'stead of flittin', I'll be sittin'
Next to her and she'll purr like a kitten

A doll I can carry, the girl that I marry must be

Dick Haymes,"Here's to my lady, here's a toast to my lady,
And all that my lady means to me!
Like a hearth in the winter, a breeze in the summer,
A spring to remember is she!

Though the years may grow colder as people grow older,
It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!
But be it sunshine or shady, here's my love to my lady,
I pray may she always love me!

Dick Haymes,"I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.

Then tell me please:
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?

Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?
How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye

Come smilin' by and does she walk away,
Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin"" Too ra lay

My love for you should have faded long ago.
I wish I didn't need your kiss
Why must your kiss torture me as long as this.

I might be smilin' by now 
With some new tender friend.
Smilin' by now
With my heart on the mend.

But when I try
Something in that heart says ""No"".

I wish I didn't love you so.",I Wish I Didn't Love You So
Dick Haymes,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew
Dick Haymes,"If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way

With nothing to mar our joy

I would say such wonderful things to you

Dick Haymes,"You sigh, a song begins,
You speak and I hear violins
It's magic
The stars desert the skies
And rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic

Without a golden wand
Or mystic charms,
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland
It's magic
How else can I explain

Why do I tell myself
These things that happen are all really true
When in my heart I know
The magic is my love for you",It's Magic
Dick Haymes,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.
And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Dick Haymes,"(Roses, roses)
If I sent a rose to you for every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white for every time I cried all night

If you'd took the petals and tore 'em all apart
You'd be tearing half the roses just the way you tore my heart

Dick Haymes,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek

I see a puppy upon a summer's day

I want to be out in the sun

Stretching and yawning
And let the world go drifting by

I want to peep
Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep
'til I sleep

With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm

And getting shorter with each day that goes by
And how the time does fly

And oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight! 

What appeals to me

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Finding another world.

Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love
Dick Haymes,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Dick Haymes,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Dick Haymes,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Dick Haymes,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Dick Haymes,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Dick Haymes,"Somewhere in the night
There must be someone for me
Somewhere in the night
Who knows, where somewhere may be

Across the way
Or maybe, way beyond the distant star
How I wish, I knew
Just where and who you are

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
""No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night""

I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

One night perfect for romancing,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
He wanted thrills, she wanted love,
Oh but his sighs were tender

As he begged her to surrender,

And she believed that it was love.
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing,
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

Dick Haymes,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Dick Haymes,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Dick Haymes,"I heard you cried last night and I know why
I heard you cried last night and so did I

Why did you make us part
I'm so alone, why did you take my heart
You didn't want it for your own

And if you hadn't cared to make amends
I might have never dared; we'd be just friends,
So calm your fears and dry your tears

Come kiss the boy you adore
Now you can smile tonight and cry no more.",I Heard You Cried Last Night
Dick Haymes,"Till the end of time,
Long as stars are in the blue,
Long as there's a spring, a bird to sing,
I'll go on loving you.

Till the end of time,
Long as roses bloom in May,
My love for you will grow deeper,
With every passing day.

Till the wells run dry,
And each mountain disappears,
I'll be there for you, to care for you,
Through laughter and through tears.

So, take my heart in sweet surrender,
And tenderly say that I'm,
The one you love and live for,
Till the end of time.",Till the End of Time

But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out

Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

It was spring

Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

There is no one else but you
All alone by the telephone
Waiting for a ring, a ting-a-ling

I'm all alone every evening
All alone, feeling blue
Wond'ring where you are and how you are
And if you are all alone too

I wonder where you are (remember me) and how you are (remember me)
And if you are (I love you) all alone (I love you) too
Backup in final stanza is a soprano",All Alone
Dick Haymes,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Love and joy come to you
And to you, your carol too you
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God send you a Happy New Year",The Christmas Song
Dick Haymes,"After the gray of a long dreary day comes the evening
Peaceful and calm as a sheltering palm is the evening
Daytime has gone to rest, there in the golden west
Soon little stars will appear in the sky
Seeming to say, ""We are here, hush-a-bye""

Evening, lady of the evening
I can hear you calling me

Calling, while the shades are falling
Falling over land and sea

You can make the cares and troubles
That followed me through the day
Fold their tents just like the Arabs 
And silently steal away

Evening, lady of the evening
I hear you calling me

After the sun when its day's work is done comes the evening
Then with the night comes the angels who light up the evening
There in the sky they stand, each with a torch in hand
Then one by one, little stars in the sky
Look down and say, ""We are here, hush-a-bye""",Lady of the Evening
Dick Haymes,"Say it isn't so

Everyone is saying you don't love me,

Everywhere I go,

Whispers that you're growing tired of me,
Say it isn't so.

People say that you
Found somebody new,
And it won't be long before you leave me,
Say it isn't true.

Say that everything is still okay,
That's all I want to know.
And what they're saying,
Say it isn't so.

People say passing by
Say he's younger than i

Dick Haymes,"Music is a language lovers understand
Melody and romance wander hand in hand
Cupid never fails assisted by a band
So if you have something sweet to tell her

Say it with music
Beautiful music

Somehow they'd rather be kissed
To the strains of Chopin or Liszt

A melody mellow
Played on a cello

Helps mister Cupid along
So say it with a beautiful song

There's a tender message deep down in my heart
Something you should know, but how am I to start?
Sentimental speeches never could impart
Just exactly what I want to tell you",Say It With Music
Dick Haymes,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended
Dick Haymes,"Though we're called a people of serious mind,
'Tis often we dance, 'tis often we sing.

And bein' as human as all human-kind,
We aren't superior to havin' a fling.
I'm taking the fling of a lifetime.
The fling of a husband and wife-time.

A-when I a-went romancing
I a-gave no thought to any wedding ring.
Every bonnie lassie was
My highland fling.

A-no chance was I chancing
I' a-m not the man ya dangle on a string.
I was canny waitin' for the
Real, real thing.

A-though I danced each girl in a twist and a-twirl

Oh

Now my heart is prancin'
A-gay as a lark and happy as a king.
The years I'll weather, in the hame on the heather,
With my one and only highland fling.
I thought you were fallin' for Andy MacPherson.

Ney, ney. He became an impossible person.
But what about you and that Connie MacKenzie?
She talked when I putted and drove me to frenzie.
But what of the lad known as Bobby MacDougal?

It pays to be thrifty, but he was too frugal.
And weren't ya daft about Megan McDerrmot?
I tasted her cooking. T'would make me a hermit.
How jealous I was of McDonald McCutcheon.

His neck had a head on, but there wasn't much in.
And what about Sandy?

His hands were too handy.
And wasn't there a Jenny?

I'm not wantin' any
I'm not wantin' any but you.

When I went a-dancin'
No special lad I was encouragin'.
Every lackly laddie was
My highland fling.

No glance I was glancin'.
Well, nothin' really worth a-mentionin'.
Hopin', watchin', waitin' for the
Real, real thing.

Though they spoke me soft in the moonlit oft',
Ney one would do.
'Til it came to pass to this lucky lass
In a fling I was flung with you.

Dick Haymes,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

Like to watch you all the day

Telling people what I've found

Don't know how it happened quite
May have been the summer night
May have been; well, who can say?
Things just happen any way
All I know is I said ""yes""
Hesitating more or less
And you kissed me where I stood
Just like any fellow would

With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up

I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

So frequently to vanquish all
The friends of Satan quite""

Dick Haymes,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now

And they whirl you across the floor

With evil on his mind

At night through the window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby

When he walks in the room, he feels confused
Like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
Except a crazy girl with a secret lover who
Keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane

Will color all my dreams

I will be remembering

Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end

And traffic jams
And anagrams

And Cuban rum

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Dick Hyman,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Dick Hyman,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby

Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Way down at Mister Joe's Cafe
They're takin' someone far away,
And if you hear a song today.
It's a sad tune that you'll be playin':
 
She's leavin' and folks are feelin' so low,
They're grievin' and they're consolin' poor Joe;
Gonna miss her song
Gonna miss her smile

Like a flower crying

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Dick Hyman,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
How can you face them?

What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town, hm
 
It's the talk of the town.",It's the Talk of the Town
Dick Hyman,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Dick Hyman,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Dick Hyman,"Dancing in the dark Till the tune ends,
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends,
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here,
Time hurries by, we're here and gone;

Looking for the light of a new love,
To brighten up the night, I have you love,
And we can face the music together,
Dancing in the dark.",Dancing in the Dark
Dick Hyman,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Dick Hyman,"I'll get by
As long as I have you
Though there be rain
And darkness too
I'll not complain
I'll see it through

Poverty
May come to me, it's true
But what care I
Say, I'll get by
As long as I have you.

Dick Hyman,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Dick Hyman,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?

Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Anniversary Song
Dick Johnson,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight

While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Will it fade way out of sight

Dick Merrick,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Dick Miller,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Dick Mitchell,"I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I've come
To complicate the dead
Are you with me?
I've written out all my vows again

We're almost home
To see the silence break on New Year's Eve
We're only 17
So if love exists I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Just one more kiss
To soothe the pain exists
In a world of lies
Misery take my shame and life

And everything fails a violent death
The smile you gave
Visit me in hell tonight
And say, ""If love exists, I will fall?

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
Almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I'll wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love

I feel so alive
I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling

So alive, I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling
If love exists, I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
Almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Dans des courants rebelles

La vie à mille à l'heure
Le goût des longues soirées
Je refoulais mes peurs
Je joins mes mains aux tiennes
Pour vivre entrelacés
Et que rien ne revienne
Des douleurs du passé
Dans un monde tragique
Fait de masques et de leurres
J'ai cherché le magique
Dans un bain de tiédeur
Et toi tu étais là
A des années lumières
Loin de tous ces gens las
Tapie dans ton repère
C'est bien beau le show bizz

On s'aime on s'fait la bise
On s'poignarde en plein coeur

Pas tout de suite souri
Mais quand tu m'as touché

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""

Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

Do you think that I am someone dumb?
You can't cut twenty inches off my favorite tracks,

It just looks like cheaper to me.
Next they'll take the Liberty Bell
And downsize it's ring

Could it be that something isn't right?

I don't want to drive around in no Jaguar,

Watch and Slip On Down

I never wondered how,

I always had a gas, a pleasure and a half, 
I never wore a furrowed brow, 
But, now I'm getting worried,

What you think a guy like me should do?
I can't drive around in no Chevrolet, 
I need a full-size, someone gonna pay
I'm gonna crack my book of dreams and pick my number
Take my chance of life in the lottery.
I'm gonna spread my little pillow underneath that shady tree,

But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Dick Wellstood,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Like the kicker in a julep or two

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,

And loses herself in her
Dreaming and sleep, and her
Lovers walk through in their coats

Talk of her notes and the
Flowers that they never sent
And wasn't she easy, and
Isn't she pretty in pink?

First in the line is the
Last to remember her name
He's walking around in this
Dress that she wore
She is gone, but the
Joke's the same

Softly sometimes, she says,
""I love you"" and ""Too much""

Dickey Lee,"On the weekend pass I wouldn't have had time
To get home and marry that baby of mine
So I want to be explain and he authorized me to send for my ebony eyes
My ebony eyes was coming to me from out of the skies on Flight 1203
In a hour or two would I whisper I do to my beautiful ebony eyes
The plane was way overdue so I went inside that airlines desk

And said sir I wonder why 1203 is so late he said oh they probably took off late
Or they may have run into some turbinate weather and had altered the course
So I went back outside and I waited at the gate
And I watched the beacon light from the control tower
As it flipped through the dark of ebony skies as if it were searching for
(The ebony eyes)

And then come the announcement over the loudspeaker
With those having relatives of friends on Flight No 1203
Please report to the chapel across the street at once
Then I felt a burning break deep inside and I knew the heavenly ebony skies
Had taken my life's most wonderful price my beautiful ebony eyes
If I ever get to heaven I'll bet the first angel I'll recognize
She'll smile at me and I know she will be my beautiful ebony eyes",Ebony Eyes

But a little bitty tear

I said I'd laugh when you left me full of funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another one a waiting I'd wave goodbye as you go

Blew my newspaper blanket off my back
Through my dirty broken window the grey sun filtered in
As I dreamed about the Southbound railroad track
I could almost hear the crickets in a sleepy cotton field
As daddy drove our wagon to Virginia
But today I'd give a fortune for a twenty five cent meal
And I wish I was a country boy again
So let me ride on the Southbound
Back to where I came from I don't care or where I am
Let me ride on the Southbound and put me off somewhere near Birmingham

And maybe you don't see him anymore
Special I hear your lonesome whistle whine
Special keep moving me on down the line

My mackinaw's full of holes and ain't too good at keeping out the cold
My shoes are worn as paper thin my feet can feel the cinders through the soles

There lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed oer the range

Her voice was as sweet as the sugar candy
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights
That shone in the night out of Yerrington town

She was courted by Young Vandamere
A fine lad was he as I am to hear
He gave her silver rings and lacy things
And she promised to wed before the snows came that year

But her pony did stumble and she did fall
Her dyin touched the hearts of us one and all
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet through his brain
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall

They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too
At dusky sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy whose love was true

Dicky Wells,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon!

Dicky Wells,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Dicky Wells,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

To the rhythm of my love for you,
And now it's beating slow, and you know
This the end of the road when I sing this slow song for you you
And love was nothin' but another gun for you
And I would hide it in my hopeless soul

Diddy,"Yo yo this Mase, you know what I'm saying
You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggas that's mad 'cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the, those PHD niggas
but you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though see it's a difference,
a lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit we come to bring it to y'all niggas,
Me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob
If you wanna dance, we dance

Now trick what, Lace who
That ain't what Mase do got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face boo not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack, write hot shit
And make a nigga say, rewind that
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says okay my tint smoke gray No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my six
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling
I was a gentleman living in tenements
Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins
Hoes of all complexions, I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in
What you waiting for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way it's hot and hazy,
Never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish
And I be switching fees with a wrist full of G's, nigga please,
I'm the macaroni with the cheese

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies come
Get 'em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, enough money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies

Put it out, all the stores, bet you could shop that (that's right)
Leave a nigga with a hot hat, fronting like Bad Boy ain't got tracks (nigga stop that)

There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga
Nickel-nine nigga, floss you die quicker (uh-huh)
This fed time outta town pie flipper
Turn Cristal into a Crooked I sipper

Everybody want to be fast, see the cash
Fuck around they weak staff, get a heat rash
Anything in Bad Boy way we smash (we smash)
Hundred G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (hehe)

I'm through with bein a player and a baller
Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her
Mase want to be the one you respect, even when you're vexed
Rock Versace silks over spilled brunette
Got green never seen so you suck my jewels
Clutch my uz', anything I touch I bruise
Puff make his own laws, nigga fuck your rules (that's right)
Goodfellas, you know you can't touch us dudes

Don't push us, cause we're close to the, edge
We're tryin', not to lose our heads, a-hah hah hah hah

Broken glass everywhere
If it ain't about the money, Puff, I just don't care (that's right)

Puff why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high

Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby

Though I'm never drugged, I'm the venom in the club, G
Though I know the thug be wantin' to slug me (uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)
Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna, rock the Rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out glocks, stop my life (uh)
I'm like, ""Damn, how these niggas got they trust?
Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?""
Do you think you snake me, cause they hate me?

Diddy,"Then, there are the times in my life
When I feel, trapped
Feel there's, no way out
No escape
To be honest, I don't know where my life is goin
Where I'll end up at
I just don't know

I looked back and saw the cat focus, took notice
Stayed away from the bogus, til his rise began
Phillies stacked his grand played the brokest
til he seemed hopeless, soon to be the dopest, cat comin
Track stunnin, fame singin, his name ringin
Money starts to pile, honeys start to wild
Top notch drop top make everything he drop hot
He dream, visualize, plot and scheme
Got the cream legally without the beam
Witcha fire eye drive slow, 8-5-0
Jet black tint still, they might know
Who the cat controllin the strings of rap and R&B
Trapped inside of a movie starrin me, so far

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Shorty was brimmin, singin, hangin with cats who move bricks
Heard she do backflips, for niggaz who stack chips
Suck for dough, now she fuck for Bills up in Buffalo
Real G's makin her back swell
Only givin head to those niggaz who rapped well
Owned a black cell, flip it, sippin on Whitman cool mints
Rumors spread, half a G she took, six or more
Two bagged up, four went raw
Back of my mind countin up the big score
Violators from the door, she lookin up from the floor
Sore from all the pain her body couldn't ignore
So far from pure, rotten to the core
Either or, for sure, trapped inside the world of a whore

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Hard to cope with, all these niggaz and dope whips
with cash flow, motherfuckers that gotta flash gold
to bag hoes, they not nice, 600 circle the block twice
In they Roleys they rock ice, to get they hit on
Bitches dyin to get on, suck a dick or get shit on
Don't understand they playin wit it
Players get these bitches open and let they man hit it
Fuck that, you can trust that, if I had a gun
I'd release slugs black and bust back
See how these players love that, to the point where
I can't take it, I'm a playa hater, I can't fake it
I wanna spill myself, to feel the thrill myself
And since I can't be a player, wanna kill myself, trust

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

I been on this road for a long time now
At time it seems like the road is never gonna end
On this road there's a lotta, hills and mountains
Peaks and valleys
Even a lot of potholes on this road
It's never smooth, on the road of life
I don't know where I'm going
I just know where I wanna end up at

Do you know where you're goin to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?  Do you know?

Lord can you help me get there?
Please let me get there

Verse One: Puff Daddy

Yeah yeah, uh-huh, check it out, yeah, c'mon
Whether you like it hard or the live guitars
Anything dropped if it's hot it's ours
If it's not it's yours, we on the job
Everybody eatin, everybody involved
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap
Bad Boy stop what's the chance of that?
We don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks
And we don't have to answer to Jack
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers
Pull up at the party, eight straight Hummers
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders
Pop corks, we be the toast of New York
And out West, we want y'all to understand
All we wanna do is make you dance
We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

Verse Two: Lil' Kim

When it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough
Fuck Domino's, strictly dice
Bet you niggaz won't flow for this ice, notes is the price
Lil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggaz still broke
While my pockets on re-up
Y'all niggaz shit on E, what a pi-ty
Ain't it a shame how your man chose me
And you wanna know why, it's mad simple
Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit my jimmies
Drive a Ta-hoe, wit plenty cash flow
He know, anything I touch I blow
And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow
Gotta crew full of niggaz and a Lexus too
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you
So who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone
Lil' Kim and Puff Daddy keep keepin it on

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

Now you can pump this in your jeep, on an off road
Pump this to your blows on the way to the tow
Bang this til you're bein old when you at home
On the six-four, sittin on chrome
Yo we don't stall we ball while you playin the wall
We in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off
Gotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us
At the end of the night they gonna slide with us
I could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious
To the top now, ride with us, c'mon
We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch
Every single region, we own blocks
Never let up, you tell me, who do it better
Every single I drop, at least two are better
The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

You knew I was comin' to put it down so what now?

In the five-speed, smirkin' then pull up at high speed

I ain't know the real deal until last night
How, one of them brothers was locked with bankroll
Used to call my crib to see seventy-four
Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the dac
Babe bro told him, 'You wanna get money, see Black
When you get home', we never had chance to get up
And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up
He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin' honey
Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money
Funny how it's a small world, baby girl
Youse about to get, fucked with no jail
I'ma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin'

Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door
Life is out, snuffed all they mans in
In the end, she had to be the Last bitch standin'
Not for long the buck the forty-four strong
Just like that she was gone, now it's over

When I think about dyin, I think about
Won't it be, alllll, before my time?
A sense of release
Just released from all the pressures
I know dyin', sugar yeah
And all the negativity
Cause, I know you
I also think about, finally, gettin' a chance to see
All the loves ones again
If, I, should, die tonight
That left before me
That'll be kinda fly
Won't, it be, all, before my ti-me
Walk through the gates, see my grandmother
See big, see god, heh
I know dyin', sugar yeah
Shit is crazy
Because I know you, know you
I never been afraid to die
If I should, die tonight
But I know I don't want to die
Not just yet anyway
Won't it be, all before, my time?
Feel like I got a lot more livin' to do
I know dyin', sugar yeah
Lot of unfinished business
Cause I know, you, oh
Knowhati'msayin?
If I, should die, tonight baby
We'll see
Won't it be far before my time?

Diddy,"Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Sometimes I be wakin' up at high noon
Sayin', ""Why me Lord?"" folks thinkin' I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin', but when they sleepin'
I be concealed up in my room, knowin' that it could happen
I'm just tryin' to maintin', because the future is untold
Till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin' after my P
So many phony niggas lovin' to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggas comin' after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin'?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin' for bruisin'
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin' his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin' with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin', I ain't scared to go
But yet my heart is steady pumpin' for somethin'
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin'
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin'
Bodies start jumpin', wreckin' my brain not to try and understand
But withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin'
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
Even though I'm not hopin' to go
I wish someone would open the do
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a Land Cruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a light pole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion
I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin' too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
And the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin' but steady fallin'
Right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin' Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggas wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin' us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin' shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renault's get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin' closer
Paranoid like a crack fiend when the gat seen
Scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
So now my sight is gettin' dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin'
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin' weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
But wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin' close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin', but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen

Even the dog can feel the chill
She lays her head down on the table
Next to a stack of unpaid bills
Daddy comes and puts his arms around her
He says ""Girl, your stockings' startin' run
Now it ain't ever been easy
But ain't it always been fun, fun, fun""

Got the engine hangin' from a tree
Kickin' the tires on the T-Bird

Mamma comes dancin' out the back door
Snappin' a dish towel in her hand

Don't you know how I love a sweaty man-oh-man-oh""

Diddy,"There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away

Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin' about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin' you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin' the grief
Baby moms starts sexin', my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
Or relievin' your breathin', long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin'
Pain

I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
I wish this pain, would go away
Just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone

I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin' chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin' I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin' my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
God, please take the pain away

I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin'
On my knees cryin' and prayin', then I said
""God why?  Got to know how hard we try
Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead""
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening three
With platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me""
He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenuous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids""
That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away

I'm tellin' you man
Now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck who it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
Man fuck these niggaz man
Fuck these niggaz man
And I'ma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
Hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin' your name out
Like they screamin' all these other, so-called hot niggas
Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo
Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year

Honey I keep you hot and wet, just flooded with ice
And you can spend all day and chill, all night
Come sleep with the king, peep what I bring
Every few weeks it's a bigger size ring
Carats ain't nothin' when the cabbage ain't nothin'
I got habits like goin to Paris I ain't frontin'
You can never need for nothin', only one pipe
Would you like to go to dinner, wit Jordan and his wife?
Am I moving fast?  It could happen real soon
Thousand dollar shoes, dance in ballrooms
You know the dress, that got the party impressed
You'll only wear it one time, cause the world is mine
I try to address it, but you never get the message
You the water in my life and I'm trapped in the desert
I never seen a honey sweeter, won't stop
Till I get her cause I need her, my senorita

Mami ven aqui, I wanna be your
Papi chulo can't you see? mi amor
Baby I need you conmigo

Baby come to me
Baby come to me

Her name is Carmen, she live down in Spanish Harlem
And I think I have the key to her secret garden
When I seen her, I used to want to beg her pardon
But I was scared, I ain't really have the heart
And when she walked by, I would panic, even though
I was cool with her pops Lou, the mechanic
Went to school with her brother, that's right
I never could build up the words to express how I loved her
Long hair, pretty face, slim waist
The kind that you marry and take to another place
And exchange vows, spend thous
Make love in a hot tub, where there's a hot towel
She'll be loyal without being spoiled
You can shuck all you want but she's still gonna ignore you
Makes no sense to say mira
Cause bet she won't turn him around, she's my senorita

I rock regular clothes, as well as Gucci too
And if you don't believe me, ask Groovy Loo
You're beautiful, so I stay true to you
I think you oughta see things like Bermuda boo
No cooperation, got me walkin' around pacin'
Patient, waitin' for my day of penetration
Your relationships is bullshit, your man is a prick
With a little bit of bricks and a whip baby
Please, I got plenty of V's
What you want the pink C-2, or the yellow 3-2-5
That's when I opened my eyes
I was dreamin', damn it was all a surprise
But it felt real, I hopped up in a wet chill
Yet still gotta keep this one concealed
Even though I never got a chance to meet her
I still need her, cause she's my senorita

Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Luc'

Niggas step up, with just Mase and 'em

Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you

Alright
I never shoulda put my trust in you
But I never thought you'd let me down
It seems like you get a thrill out of
Out of making me cry
And baby everybody's seen it but me
Cuz I was so blind I couldn't see
I never really needed your help
I could do for myself

Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed
Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known 
Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you

Baby, can't you see
I want it for you more
Than you want it for yourself
Always there for you
I was there for you, there for you
What ever you needed
You know what I've gone through for you

I was saying bye-bye baby
Now whatcha gonna do
My love is gone, the money gone and the house too
Now how bout you?
Get away from me and let me clear my mind
This is hurtin' me just to visit you one more time
I know you fine but I ain't gonna get distracted by your charm
I figure this is the beginning, you intended some harm
Remain calm, it ain't no reason to drop the ball
you should get 10 points just for being On My Arm
But still, that's the past tense, I was speakin' a then
You asking me 'bout that woman now, it's a negative ten""
I had to catch myself before I tried to make her my girl
Start a family and start to bring kids in this world
See life is like a gun, it can backfire then shoot you.
What's good for the present ain't always good for the future
I shake and shiver, look deeply in the mirrow at myself
Wondering will I make it with someone else
Whatcha gonna do

Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you

Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love

Diddy,"Uh, check it out, uh
I steps in where the Mo's and the hoes at bay-bee!
Fuck all that pretty shit
Takin' it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers
Niggas know the deal
Niggas know who the Don is
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what

Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop?  Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin' for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but separately cause now I, charter my own
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us
Why niggas bring the ruckus?
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin' through your head
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin' of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, one seems, like a lost body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin' me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin' out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi' before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin' or clappin' have it your way
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin', I'm clappin' your way

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets, these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumference, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin' bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punany, like heiny
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin' lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental
What? From a, from a young G's perspective

At the media party. He was pronounced dead on arrival.
No suspects have been taken into custody.

[Radio Announcer2]
Combs' trouble seems to continue as he turned himself
In today to local police for an alleged assault and
Battery charge. He posted bail and was released on 
His own recognizance.

In my distress I prayed to the Lord
And the Lord answered and rescued me
The Lord is for me so I will not be afraid
What can mere mortals do to me
Yes the Lord is for me
He will help me
I will look in triumph at those who hate me
It's better to trust the Lord than to take confidence in people
It's better to trust the Lord than to have confidence in Princes
Though hostle nations surrounded me
I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
Yes, they surrounded and attacked me
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
They swarmed around me like bees
They blazed against me like roaring flames
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
The Lord is my strength and my song
He has become my victory

Diddy,"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you


Don't let him sing you a sad song No baby
Waiting for love like this too long
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby
All that you need I can give you
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on
I do, satisfy you
You don't have to wait on him

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Diddy,"I've seen a lot of things in my life
A lot of ups and downs
Made a lot of mistakes
No matter what, you've always been by my side
You've always been my best friend

You're the love of my life
You're everything to me
You never left my side
You're my best friend
I love you so much
Yes, you are
You're my best friend

Since the beginning of time
All you did was bless men
Too young to understand but now you my best friend
How could they doubt you, never think about you
Don't they know nothing's possible without you

Faith without fear that's how they raised me
Words of man kill but never phase me
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?

Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in
Gotta be more than just to lust women
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen

Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord

Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling

You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight
Then give it to you and let it shine bright

My best friend, only know how to teach the truth
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit
Can't you see that He spread love for you
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you

Willies with mac millies know how you get down
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town
Just remember when you pray, God is love
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs

Life as we know it, it all begins with Him
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him

Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling

You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

Been two and a half years since my man Big passed
Been two and a half years since my world crashed
I needed help, God gave me the power
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour

Looked me in the eyes and ask, ""What you doing unhappy?""
""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out
Never wavered once, gave me no way out

Your time to die, don't even stress the date
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take
I told him, ""I'm too much blessed with faith""
""And living for Christ"" and then he said, ""Manifest the great""

All of a sudden, what I'm remembering
Ground started to shake, everything trembling
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on

Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling

You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be

Diddy,"Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Sometimes I be wakin up at high noon
sayin, ""Why me Lord?"" -- folks thinkin I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin, but when they sleepin
I be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen
I'm just tryin to maintin, because the future is untold
till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin after my P
So many phony niggaz lovin to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggaz comin after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go
but yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin
Bodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand
but withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
even though I'm not hopin to go
I wish someone would open the do'
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a landcruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion

I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
and the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin
right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggaz wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer
Paranoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen
scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
so now my sight is gettin dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
but wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when

That's Right
Journey Through the life of some real niggas
Some real niggas, You'll never see what I've seen

When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost, Feds with toast 
Knockin' my door down sweat poor down my body 
Roast from the heat so I soak my sheets
Wake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy
Every night is different pussy since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminisce how I miss a stare in this space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face
Lampin' in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits
If nigga's try to rob me then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks cuz I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down
Fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breasts
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva
Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)
East vs. West the rap game where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax
Tell me if you feelin' that

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder
By the time that you realized that it's goin' down
You may find yourself going underground
When they see that this life is upon us
We would see that there's no one that we can trust

You can never see what I see, motherfucker
Beanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught
Stay cased up nigga, stay deep in court
Reminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought
Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Streached up in hospital beds, fed fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap
Upstate the case niggas slice your throat
Wear your boxers in the shower when you gaurd your soap
I done seen the biggest nigga's in the yard get broke
I done took blocks through war, took blocks for fall
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw
What you think 33 in the glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars, 
C4, block your doors, nigga's can't stop this war
I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for
Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for
Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
Only reason you switchin' up your droid is cause you keep gettin' robbed
I looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God
Beanie Sigel, desert eagle, the realest nigga alive

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas

The Bible has words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats
I speak all my life under oath
Since a kid, troublesome
Thrownin' shit at little girls jump ropes
Bustin' B-B Guns at stray cats, that was way back 
Watched it die, covered in flies
Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in it's eyes
Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penile
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile
Lifestlyes of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch
I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again
Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin', slay men
Leave your whole body cold
Your nails grow long, you get gray skin
May this nigga rest in peace, Amen
I run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'
Names engraved in the pavement
Brick building, grown ladies jump off the roof
Nigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth
New York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga

Cause i'm that enemy that you can't see
But you wanna be  you ain't shit to me
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me
Playa, my real dogs  they'll spit for me
So if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart
I've seen em come and I've seen em part
If you ain't want beef then why did you start?
Front from the light catch shots after dark
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these
On the spot, red dots make em all believe
Ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these
See I do the things that they can't achieve
So don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing

Because i'm public enemy number one

Let me ask you, what you got against me?
Is it my girl or is it the bentley?
Is it my house or maybe its all three
I just came up and you're all against me
Now ask yourself, why is he number one?
Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?
You think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one
Always with God and I don't swing solo
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though
Pretty young things wanna have my photo
One in the room hangin' on the wall
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all
Got no time for those that think small
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball
Hate shot callers
Hate them ballers
Back in control now I call orders
It's no fun fleeing under the gun 
Cause they got me public enemy number one

One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One

All you suckers, liars, court testifiers
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire
I spit lines, hit rhymes
Keep dimes sweating
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor
Before you try me, you better say your prayers
My word to the wise is: ""Do not cry""
You know that i'm gone then say don't die
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme
Thought it was over but I crept from behind
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind
Almost 2000 and running out of time
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine
Soldiers in position all on the front line
Don't make a move till I give them the sign
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son
Because i'm public enemy number one

That's what I'm talkin about love
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers

Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down
But fuck dat, they just mad

Grab the rope and yell rawhide
Front line is pussy, call off sides

We value-packs, y'all small fries
Yo, I'm from the projects
Yo, but on the floor tied
Don't matter, we'll take up all size
Truly yours doc, then PPP hide, my name is

In church dressed in cordoroy ties

Besides, I'm just a sight for soar eyes
Brick city, known pop the door wide
Stolen Bonneville in New York High

Reversin' the plot
Last come, first one to rot, first in the glot
If I miss, circlin' the block, servin' the pot
And I be the person to watch
If your girl missin' the rock, purse and a watch 
Hot as it gets, from Hell came outta you debts
Buy the cassette, rewind it to death
Alota y'all sweat it, you try to forget
How I rock shit from N.Y. to Tibet
You got it to bet? That's just how you got into debt
You lost when you nodded your neck
Through the vest, through the chest that you tried to protect
Take the voice that you try to project, check
Darin' you to kid, cat shootin' sperm in you wiz
I'm why you smell herb in the crib
Man I'm out for doubtful, shit I spit a mouthful

Observe it from over there, ok 
Ain't It obvious we overheated

But I jus' know that you meant me 
But evidently, you don't know
I get your ass gone permanently
It ain't complex
I'll just bang holes or you're ablin' to ask who next
Do a drive-by on your project, take the traps
Come on and get some of our gun craps
I'll straighten out the nigga now
When I snap, make your chest cavity collapse
When I glide the entire map
With the frequent four alarm fire, rap straight up
Put weight down, fuck around, you ate up
And nigga when I eat, I mean I lick the whole plate up
Look in my eyes, I'm not scared
Sucka, you heard what I said
If you don't wanna get dead
No it ain't no cure, ice cold in the low, the go-rilla
The mo' scrilla the more real-la, I live to rule

Don't hold me back, you bet
How many nigga's think they fuckin' with mines
A nigga God blessed with such an undeniable shine
I hope you know there's nothin' fresher
The manifester apply the pressure
Tie you up and gag you in your mouth with a piece of polyester
Now fix your fuckin' face up
Empty the chest of drawers before I stretch your jaw
Everybody hit the fuckin' floor
Only the real mother fuckers belong
I hope nigga's don't end the party before we finish the song

You be the last to come and harrass, reflect on the past
When I used to pull spine outcho ass
Live nigga's go stack money, continue to bill shit
Long as I'm in this fucker I'm determined to kill shit

[Black Rob]
Hey , back on the scene
Ain't nuthin' changed
Still doin' wild things
Whippin' something mean
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off
For sure, bouncin' the bar on my next world tour
When we hit the sick, I'm the cure
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor
Ain't nobody botherin' you
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few
Illegal aliens
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans
The top story, evening news
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville
Shoot to kill
Ask niggas, Duke is real
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal
He determined
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'
I want my glory
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs
That's cause my dogs ain't there

[Chorus: x2]
The more hits we make, more money to burn
The more fame we get, niggas get concerned
It don't matter who's hot, who's out
Bad Boy is Back For Good Now

[Loon]
Hey yo, I'm fresh off the plane
Trying to get a little bit of stress off my brain
M-I-A
Dom P., palm trees, 9O degrees
Arm freeze, mom please, ain't nothin' but cheese
Caribbean Sea, Malibu breeze
Watchin' DVDs on 5O inch screens
So cut it out, you ain't now Don Juan, please
I stay spillin' Dom on my Sean John jeans
I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me
Pop bottles, models, be all on me
You all goin' see how it's all gon' be
Front on me and see where you all gon' be
Six feet deep
When the heat seek, niggas be misty
From 155th to 11Oth Street
Harlem bound, Bad Boy, who the fuck want a problem now?

[Chorus: x2]

[P. Diddy]
See this is the part I like right here
I like when I see everybody on the dance floor
Yeah, I see why y'all, just shakin' your asses
See man, hold on, I need to break it down
Yeah
One time like this

Now would you clap your hands
Your hands you clap
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that
But you never see me standing on the corner like that
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting
I rock Sean John everyday
Boutiques from France to the USA
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent
Cause, I'm droppin' hits
Daily
You burn me?
Really?
Think Bad Boy been played a million times
And I don't care if niggas write a billion rhymes
Damn, we still payed!

We still payed!
Yeah, we got it made!

[Loon]
Hey yo, this game ain't stoppin'
We champagne poppin'
Girl, I got shit that your man ain't coppin'
You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him
Your man got a lot to learn
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned
One day you goin' actually learn
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn
I stay on my J-O-be	
Nigga, me, P. Diddy, B. are-O-be

Let me tell you something

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with these chick
Named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers
To spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind
My repratoir is Menage Trois
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stopping this

And Ima make ya head bop to this
And at the end you gon rock to this
Now say my name

Ay yo, I came in the door
I said it before
I never the ladiez hyptonize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
'Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Make the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Cause I came too far
For me to be bouswar
It's a Bently to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me

(La La La La La La La La La La La La)

Now hold up, stop, wait a minute
We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit
My aim is winning
Got asian women
That'll change my linen
After I done blazed and hit em
But I just wanna rock wit you
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do
If it's possible
Cause I ain't trying to stop you boo

Got on a ninja
One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya
That's when I met this chick named Brenda
Tender, her whole body bend like fender
So let me see you shake it girl

Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me
I caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me (Thank you)
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would have had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild, now these days that I reminisce

Guess who ghostwrite for me, my brain sails/sells
Now believe it, better place checks
Bad Boy, big things nigga, HF

I put it down for mine, my crew live a life of crime
Constantly non-stop, when they on the climb
And BK, no such thing, it's dark

Cases handle in the street, motherfuck the court
Shouldn't talk the talk, you can't walk the walk

Now if you want this money baby
Then I guess you in the right place
And if your mind ain't right sugar

Wait till I drop it, then you can learn more (Why?)

Got so many spots I don't even buy luggage, ya love it
Make moves major, hide out in Asia
If your girl keep comin around them I'm a blaze her
I'm the Bad Boy flavor, light blue gators
NOT GUILTY, and I'm filthy, c'mon

(Chorus)
[Black Rob (Puffy)]
I be the Eastside Soprano, Rob Marciano
Flow in e'ry channel with the Iverson handle
Forty-five sparks turn your day gray flannel
Snatch the yay of the mantle, then proceed to dismantle
Can't slay Rob
How many niggaz done tried to play Rob, quit they day job
Tired of putting broke niggaz under the wing
If I go to jail again I'm goin under the bing
Act like you gon' pull that thing thing
You the only one that always get stuck for bling bling
I represent ""A"" block in Sing Sing
Almost caught a buck fifty for fuckin a Latin King's queen
Moves for paper, booze no chaser
Bullets out the blazer four-fifth with the laser
Come and get your shit splitted, newspapers said I did it
(He ain't do it) Now let's get it (Let's get it)

This goes out to my nigga B.I.G.
Listen to me playboy, check dis out
I go, on and on and on and
Won't take her to the crib unless she's bonin'
PD call her on the phone and
Promise I'll leave her moanin'
Now she zonin'
Tellin' me she's all alone and
Love the dark chocolate tone and
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes
The cars and the chedda is mine
We ain't, the type to sit back and lose focus
Spit that mack-a-docious
Most ferocious
Cash all in my holsters
Burn more bread than toasters
You must know this, the cats 'm with is the coldest
Hip-hop quota but quote this
Back on the track again, that's what's happenin'
Please believe it, we on top and won't leave it

Come on ma your riding with me
Leave the lame respect the game
When you hanging on my arm you expect the same
And, ecstasy when you sex the Kain
I, only link with the wealthiest
And only cop jewels if it drop Celsius
Now, you can run but you can never hide
But, where you go when the temperature rise
It's Bad Boy see death in ya eyes
Kain Cioffe the next on the rise
Damagin' shit hot stamina split
You got screwball raps we the hammerin' clique
Limo, the club, and the cameras'll flip
Money, music women son we standin' in it HA!

[Chorus]
[Mark Curry]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Don't panic, don't take this for granted
I did then still do and always ran it
A lot to gain when I say I'm off the chain
The shit I spit, burn flames
Who's controllin' this
I can make the bitches grin
Cause I get money and run with the richest men
Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again
Been down since the jump off begin
You know who I am
Don't get it all twisted up
Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up
We can pick it up, we can drop it low
Recognize what it is when I come through the door
Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp
Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since
Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan
Ain't none of yall seein' ya man
Get a grip niggas

Pimp tight! M-J-G
Fin' to get up on the mic with a passion
Get up on some pads Gwen, my chick get her ass in
For the track, make my money
Bring it on back to the middle of the floor
I want the whole stack
Plus I, need a little more, I gotta eat a little mo'
My seed gotta grow
I got a reason to flow, a reason to show
What I mean is I go
off like a champ, when I cling to the floor
My Twinkies shine when I hit the strip, 'llac dipping
Strictly pimping, as long as tricks invest in women
From the Memphis Tenn., to the N-why-see I'm representing
I put mo' spice into yo' life than yo' entire kitchen
Big dicking, choking hoes with anaconda
If my pimping was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder
I slang lumber, a spell I keep my women under
Through all seasons, they fall winter spring and summer
I hit the highway smoked out pistol gripping
But I ain't tripping though I'm high as hell, spaceship'n

Let's go

""And now, for your, bad bad boys, starting at guard""

[P. Diddy]
why y'all niggas still talking?
Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune?
What you have is a portion
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and
So you better use caution, knowing I'm the boss and
I'm sitting on pyramids, flossing
I don't really gotta talk son
I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements
I'm a pro, kid
Why you acting like you don't really know, kid?
Any records I broke it
Through the fame and the stardom, making my mark on Harlem like Poe did
I said, here's your eviction notice
But you probably already know this
I don't mean to be greedy, but turn on your TV
or pick up your CD, P.D.

[G. Dep]
This is gruesome
Niggas always grab that mic and salt like they really gon' do some'
What's wrong with you son?
Oh you got a new gun, do you know how to use one?
Then you living an illusion, living in a used one
while I'm in the Limited, cruising
You ain't really got a crew son
You giving them amusement, fuck what your Comic Views meant
You's a smoke head
I've been doing this since this Pro-Ked
Broke breads with the cokeheads
Been down, still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped
I said, I'm a ""Top Gun"" like Gossett
Run and get your CD and cass-ette
Gossip, lotta niggas got lip
But they ain't got hot yet 'til they got Dep

[Loon]
Why niggaz lie like that? Know they ain't fly like that
Niggaz get fried like that
And you don't want to die like that
Have your momma crying like that
Besides all that, I'm in to get it frying like that
Still on the block and move pies like that
Never my life dealt with guys that rap
In fact, I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad
Swoll up, why y'all niggas better hold up
Any nigga that roll up, could get fold up
Body get ripped up, and then sewed up
Every nigga I fucked with, niggas is growed up
We don't play games, get on the stand, and say names
All we do is cock back, and spray planes
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang

[Black Rob]
Keep fronting, I'ma put a crease in your jaw
Might catch me squeezing the four
My nigga I go to war
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store
why'all never had a run-in before, with the likes of an outlaw
Predicate assassin, smashin
Open shit, rig scope, focus it
Give niggaz what they 'posed to get (shit)
Oppose the clique, I send five close to six
Hoodfellaz, that'll come close your shit
Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists
Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off
Fix your face, we back on the paper chase
Never left, so I ain't gotta take your place
Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that ain't notice
the breadwinner, three-six-five I stay focused nigga

[P. Diddy]
We'll never stop..
We'll never stop..
One of the greatest teams that ever lived..
It's like in our blood..
We gotta be born this way..

One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder

Stayin' at a hotel called the pink flamingo
Callin' up MC from a cuatro cinco
The set up, tryin' on my way to uniform
Room service bumpin' Kain on the newest song
Holdin' gats knowin' everything I do is wrong
'Till I hi-jack the sky flyin' on a unicorn
Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks
It's a set up
Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops
Hit both the hot locks
Let'em read it that Diddy is on them hot blocks
So we sent two teams to rush both spots

Thumbs out watch the motherfuckin' door with our guns out

Diddy,"I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don&'t romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word, it's just you and me

Now let's ride

[Chorus]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
With the time and no full limits, no right
Anytime we together would feel so right
You the girl I been looking for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight

I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride

Diddy,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

'Cause Black Rob he on trial and I escaped death
Still in your tape (yeah) still gettin' hate threats
Still gotta take that
Still gettin' sued for money I ain't even make yet
Without you girl I'm incomplete
I can't lie ma I'm in too deep
And yo I know we don't get to spend time together
Just you and me never mind the cheddar
And though we barely speak on the phone
Could tell by your tone, you hate bein' home all alone
And I wish I could sleep witcha
Roll around in the streets witcha
No fans hold hands on the beach witcha
Girl I'd do anything just to be witcha
On the real 'cause I feel so complete witcha
Yeah, talk to me girl

I remember what you said
When you said it to me last night
We was talkin' and you reassured me everything's fine
When I woke up this morning to get some lovin' from you
I turned to one side
To my surprise, I wasn't layin' next to you m'mm

Why did you get close to me
Thought it was supposed to be
Me you you me so complete
Why you handelin' me this way
What was it you was talkin' yesterday
Yesterday, I could say, I seemed to be
So complete so complete

[Chorus]
Went away you said nothing
You didn't no kiss no lovin'
You didn't it's a shame
But it brings about the weak in me
You didn't spend a lot of time with me
You didn't share things I wanna see
You didn't when ever you're around me it's so complete

So I waited and I waited
'cause I knew that you would call
Hours 1 hours 2 hours 3 hours not at all
If I'm dreamin' wake me up
'Cause I just about had enough, I had enough
I cannot see how you would ever let this happen to me
Oow oow ooh

I still believe that it was supposed to be
Me you you me so complete
If you're sayin that you need to leave
Then be a man about it step to me
Step to me, tell me please
That without me it's so complete, so complete

[Chorus]

Won't you tell me right now what you want from me
What you want from me
'Cause it's been too long that you've held it in baby
Held it in
Thought you were the one but you just played me
You know you played me
Now I feel that I'm so incomplete
Yeah ho ho yeah yeah

[Chorus]

Please, give me the response I need
I want you to complete me, ohh baby
Pleas, give me all the lovin I need
Promise you'll never leave me whoa baby

Fantasizing wild thoughts of me coming on like (I'm here, when will you make your move?)
She digging my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the Boy's absurd for sure
You can't fall till my aura called

What you want, mama, order, it's on my tab
I'm so bad with the cash, I dropped the whole bag

Diddy,"I just don't know if love is supposed to be like this, 
And I don't even know if its something I even want no more

Yeah, yeah
Oh oh oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm used to moving out, feeling kinda stuck these days..
Because of you
And I'd be on the highway, if only I could leave my place
Because of you
I used to be a talker but I ain't got nothing good to say
Because of you
An I been trying to hide but it's written all over my face
So I

I really thought you were the one, the only one
I guess that I was wrong
And you turned out you wasn't it
If everything I thought so
But what do you do after love?
After love
What can you say when it's said and done
Nothing at all
Cause you can't hide a heart break
Wen you can't stop these tears from falling down
So what do you do? what do you do? what you do?

After love.
After love.
After love.
After love.
After love it hurts so bad
After love.
After love.

Yeah uh uh I remember that first day that I saw her face
The feeling I had sorta felt like my birthday
Beautiful I must say
She was my earthquake
Cute face, nice shape, she made my earth shake
I'm a try an keep the faith, do it like the church say
She the one for me and I don't care what him or her say
Thought I had a home run
But I'm just at first base I found out the long run
Just another heart break
So how much can my heart take
You was like air to me
You know I wouldn't leave, I needed you to breath
See life is but a dream, so is love and I believe
If you ever been in love you would know what I mean yeah
So lord help me please I wanna see the light
She keep telling me I'm wrong but I know I'm right
But trying to ignore cause I don't wanna fight
I know I make mistakes
But still I need her in my life

Tell me how I'm supposed to heal this open wound
Because of you
And tell me who woulda thought that id ever be trying to get over you
I'm stuck in the moment, of memories of me and you
And I can get over it, but I ain't sure if I want to
Cause you dun made your bed, now you gotta lie in it
You gotta lie in it babe
Now all the things you said don't mean a thing
Don't mean a thing to me now
I can't believe I gave you one, last, shot
I let it ride now baby it's your stop
Oh so so leave
Now the jokes on me
It took a while to finally come to my senses
But what
What do you do, what do you do after love? oh
What can you say ..what can you say when it's said and done
When its over, oh
Cause you can't hide a heart break
Wen you can't stop these tears from falling down (i can't stop these tears)
So what do you do? what do you do?

After love.
After love.
After love.

(i know you hear me..listen to me (please)
This is what you made me do
Pay attention
She know who I'm talking to, and I know you listening
I think about you all the time, if not every minute
I promise hurting you was never my intention
Something bout your style, the way that you presented her
Every fantasy I ever had you was in it
I apologize for every time that you might have cried
There's not enough words to describe how I feel inside
Guardian angel sent from the skies
I always knew you woulda made a beautiful bride
And that's why
I wish you could of stayed, so much
But I fucked up, an went and betrayed your trust (you know)
There's no more Dolce Gabbana, Gucci, Prada, trips to Nevada
And I admit what you probably heard was true
But outta of all these girls the only one I loved was you
I love you

You know I love you more then anything tho
That's one thing you can't run from
I just wanna end the conversation in a good way man
Aight
Love you very much
Love you too
Have a good night",After Love
Diddy,"Sometimes I try to figure out 
Just why
Why you are the way you are
You, you make it so hard for me to love you

Hold up now
Listen, I ain't gonna try to sit here and say I'm perfect
You know 
I mean, I'm tryin' to do the best I can
With my time here on earth
You know, you know my mother
Mama always say that I'd be somebody
You know
So you know, I figured that I might as well be great
You know
I mean, it's hard to understand how I am
Some shit you just don't really need to be 
Mother fuckin' understanding though
I mean God put me here for a reason
And I'm here to let these mother fuckers know

I've come to claim my place

I've come to claim my place

I'll show you the way

A lot of people don't understand
They'll understand one day though

I just like to make people feel good
I really feel I can do anything
I really truly believe in God that way
So much that I believe in myself
I guess I'm kinda like my father
You know, who had a relentless spirit
You know
He would stop at nothing to achieve his goal
You now nowadays
A lot of these mother fuckers don't understand that
They gonna have to handle it
Yeah, you feel me

I've come to claim my place
And I ain't gonna stop
I ain't gonna never stop
I thank y'all for ridin' with me
Thank y'all for rockin' with me
Through this journey
It's just begun
And I wanna take the time to say
Thank you

Tryin' to keep your weight up better eat that spinach
For four twenty-five niggas lives get diminished
The world serious, I'm tryin' to win a pennant
Cops be on patrol through the block every minute
Itchin' just to pop somethin', swearin' I'm a menace
They disturb me but it's love like tennis
Man, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage
Chicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness
Damn it's a scam but I handle my business
Tryin' to be the man if the Lord be my witness
Do my ? with the walk sign for my physical fitness
16's sicker than all signed flows it's ridiculous

Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Told y'all really really y'all can't hold up
Hold up, hold up hold up hold up hold up

Easy now I'm seein' 'em, mind where you patrol
Fall back young'un, play your lane like a goal
When his majesty speaks, speech defy gravity

Pop shit like needles through ? balloons
I urge you to tell a friend, warn a brother
About my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers
Thugs actin' funny cause chicks call me honey
See a 9 figure nigga makin' Bugs Bunny money
Eons beyond bling bling
So I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's
Make a name, let it bang so beautiful
The theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals
Or, suitable for, a recruit-able whore
To service the whole crew when we out on tour
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

It's like the music will literally stop time
(Hold up hold up hold up)
We roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up
Get inflicted by my verbal conviction
A Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston
You're not focused enough, you're not listenin'
You need to slow down, hold up like kickstand
Hop to it, get on your grind music
Across 110th sharp Caesar with a lime music
Fine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning
Your live shows are boring you're just not pleasin' 'em
Stop teasin' 'em you can't rock Palladium
We bring New York back like that West side stadium
Fuck the game and if the fame went away
Still be the hardest workin' man in entertainment today
Learn a lesson and that's, no questionin' that
No guesswork involved so stop stressin' the facts

I gave most of you dudes life, now give back (give back)
I'm the man that beefed with a whole coast
Lost my best friend and still see his ghost (c'mon)
Your lawsuit is lost, I walk through courts (uh-huh)
So disrespectful I spit when I talk (woo!)
I recognize niggas tryin' to copy my style
But never been a nigga this fly holdin' it down for this long
Nigga I let y'all eat for this long
Now the King's back on the streets crack
I'm a put it on my son's name
I'm a change from the mundane, Monday through Sunday
Lived through the gun play now I'm in one lane
Fuckin' with the white man, gettin on my fun shame
Can't com-plain, fly as I ever been
Half a ounce sniffer, high as I ever been
Never no losses, I'm a winner
The boss of all bosses, I'm that nigga!

Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be

You always sayin' that I don't want you to hurt 
You always complainin' 
But I was makin' it worse 
Besides all the games that I's kickin' at first 
It's time to explain 
My mind's been in reverse 
But now I think back 
When nobody cared 
And you was there 
Just to roll by your man 
And came back 
Even know what I did 
I realize and I'm aware 
I know what it is 
Put that on everything 
Girl you my everything 
I don't know where I'd breathe 
Cause you the air I be 
If lovin' is wrong 
Who could be right 
I wouldn't know what to do 
Without you in my life 
You're more to me than the world I pray 
The more nights for your heart to ache
Right in the middle of the dawn of day 
I think of all the pain I caused 
And throw it away and say 
I need you in my life 
Can you feel it in your soul

I've been thinkin', times is hard
'Fore it get worse and fall apart

And make you my partner for life

So we can chill (and have some little ones)
So we can chill (until our living's done)

Can I talk to you for a second?
There's some things I've been meanin' to tell you
Some things that have been on my mind
Listen to me baby (let's go)

Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)
Boo you know what? (What)

The day when I first seen you
You know I didn't stand, but I ain't mean to (yes you did)
Back then it wasn't oh so fair
You came through like some good clean air
Skin softer than the softest fabrics
You heard about me (I heard about you)
How I ball like the Dallas Mavericks
Sayin', anything you want, you can have it (give it to me)
That's Harlem World, I get on my grizzly savage see?
From the first day, we laid eyes on each other
At the office I knew we was goin' be lovers (I remember)
Mark hotel under the covers
You said I was cool and not like a lot of them brothers
Who used and abused you and took you for granted
See you a Goddess, that's why you was put on this planet (I love you)
Since you got me all sentimental

[Chorus]

C'mon, don't stop
Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)

You're so amazin'
All I can see is us now in the sun just grazin'
Boo your brown complexion, I never seen a
Same color as coffee a teaspoon of creamer
'Member when I had the Beemer? Remember?
Goin' through tough times and knowin' the other side was greener
We had a dream, we pursued it
'Member that conversation, all or nothin' before we lose it?
You remember, it's all words like music
Came at a time I needed soothin', soul body and mind
At times I felt violent, you kept me in line
Where-ever I went you wasn't far behind
Girl, we got a bond no one can break
And I'm sayin', I pray to God every night we make it, pray to God
I'm hooked and I don't wanna shake you, c'mon

[Chorus]

Yeah I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' lately baby, yeah
Now I know I done put you through a lot of shit
I know it's hard fuckin' with a nigga like me
Yeah, you get a lot of respect for that shit
Ridin' with a nigga
You know, you might as well.

[Diddy]
Now sit back and reflect, on all our accomplishments
The mansions, the plush apartments and
The big boats and the cases of whole klicko
I don't ever wanna let you go
It's a certain kind of feelin', you know that feelin' you get
When your girl right and you know what's what, uh
You got me on some lay low stuff
You stood by me, all through that J-Lo stuff
Brush your shoulders off girl, go 'head and brush 'em
Without you around, I can't function
We gon' be together 'til the day we die
And when they put us in the ground we'll be side by side
I never had a girl make me feel like you
And every day I wake up, I feel brand new
I live for you and I'll die for you too
I love you girl

Girl, maybe we should think about it

Have a couple kids and make you my wife, baby
You're beautiful lady

When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you
That makes me wanna change

I like the way you take away the pain

Can y'all hear me out there? Uhh

Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin'
Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product
Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic
While I cruise through the concrete, blowin' my chronic
And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps
Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at
Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet
Of the almighty, a God to the black child
I told moms I would be somethin'
I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin'
Listen up, I got a story to tell
It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell
It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire
You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire
Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong
With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone
But nope, I hold my stance in stone
I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin'
Won't stop been the motto, feelin' rich like I won the lotto
It's almost like seein' through the eyes of a crack child
Dodgin' crisis, three strike system niggaz trapped in a vice grip
You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages
I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush
Thinkin' back when my moms gave that first push
Thank God for my life I came through the room
Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel
Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil
Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils
I foiled your plans and made you aware
And turned America's dream into a nightmare
Yeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers
The first B.I., ""Ready to Die"" muh'fuckers
So ""Who Shot Ya,"" nine to five muh'fuckers
""Bad Boy for Life,"" is I muh'fuckers
And it's back, better than it ever was
I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was
So I deliver the truth uncut
We produce more hits got the booth fucked up
On top of the statue yellin ""Who want what?""
For the past ten years, the future is us

The preview is over, now enjoy the future

Take a good look at me
I done cried from the lies
It hurts so bad inside
If you need a thing ain't never had nothing to me 
break me down to the floor til I hide the pain 
And to show you your girlfriend 
What you had me thinking you word was your bond 
(don't you know)
That your never gonna love if you knew it was a situation 
you knew you weren't ready for
I could see if your feelings had changed but damn you just slammed the door
You told me the one you said you would put down your whole life for 
I can comprehend 

How can you turn on me
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heat
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me
Thought you said thought you said you complete me
Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said thought you said wen you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that your never gonna let it go

The times that you weren't there
The times that you left me here 
The times that I needed you 
You know my love is true
My passions inside for you
The nights that I cried for you 
A man has these feelings too
Same shit that chall go through 
I been here before 
Sometimes the pain you ignore
Until its right at your door 
And then you just can't no more
Why does love feel this way
Why does it hurt so bad

Can't even look me in the face
Why does love hurt this way

How can you turn on me 
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heart
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me

Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said thought you said when you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that you never gonna let it go

The heartache and pain 
Sometimes it goes to your brain 
Sometimes it makes you insane 
Sometimes our joy is our pain
'cause it tears you apart these affairs of the heart
I think I'm strong but I'm not
And when I look in ya eyes you know it kills me inside
But I can't wait for that day that you come back to me girl
After we both go away its just to see if its real
There's no denying the fact its meant to be
If you let it go and then they come back.
If this is our last dance we need to practice our steps,
The situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept, 
You said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault 
And of course you lost me with your alibis and all of your talking 
And most important I just question my self

The pain is taking over I can't believe
(I need your hand)
What happened then compared to now is dreams
(I need your hand)
And I know now that you'll, me

I can't sleep, I can't breathe, I ain't eat in days, stomach pains from arguing
Didn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started 
And as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson
Well its all in the healing and that process has got me stressin'
I'm so pressured I'm so physically drained 
I ain't thinkin' straight I loved you more than my own self
Although I couldn't bear the pain of seein' my old self 
Young wild uncontrolled self
I love you girl I don't need no one else

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heart
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said, thought you said that you need me

Thought you said, thought you said when you held me
Thought you said, thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said, thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said, thought you said that you never gonna let it go

When I look in your eyes you know it kills me inside

Didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, ooh ooh 

Lesson learned
House can burn 
We close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me

She didn't see
I do believe
That you wanna come by
Rescue me
If you read my mind
I have set you a place
I wonder if I'll just will be
In time we'll see
She told me

She told me
She showed me
But she hurt me
Yet she loved me the same
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
Could you really love her through the pain?

Yeah
When I don't wanna feel this way (this way)
I got too many bills to pay (to pay)
I'm hangin' on Patron all day (Aye)
Mind in a maze (maze)
Blowing on shit
I can't function
It gotta be something (go ahead)
That you doing
That got me unconscious (aye)
All this money this fame this fire
How could I feel this empty inside? (talk to 'em)

I've been thinkin' 'bout giving up (can't give up)
But there's something inside me that's holding on
When we don't know who's right or wrong
We still stay strong
Keep movin' on (Don't stop)
And I promise I will never leave
Now would you do the same for me?
I wonder if I'll just will be
In time we'll see
She told me

She told me
She showed me
But she hurt me
Yet she loved me the same
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
Could you really love her through the pain?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fine as hell
Fly Chanel (so fly)
But will it last?
Only time will tell (only time)
Love is real
And what I mean is
There's not enough word to explain the meanin' (C'mon)
And what I'm saying is
All I need is for you to understand
How beautiful she is (she is)
And all it takes is a little faith
And no matter the situation
In my heart you'll Stay

I'll always be your friend
You'll always be my girl (I'll always love you)
I'll never let it end
For nothing in the world (you'll never stop me)
Cause no one else can do
The things you do (no one else do the things)
You make me feel (you make me feel)
So warm and new
So would you stay with me? (she told me)

She told me (she showed me)
She showed me (but she hurt)
But she hurt me (yet she loved me)
Yet she loved me the same (all the same)
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
(has anybody, ever made you feel that way?)
Could you really love her through the pain? (could you?)

Thank you for showing me how to love
Thank you for showing me

Girl you mean the world to me
Just a little more than I can see
Breaks us down
We'd stay together
Only we can last forever
Would you come and go with me
To fulfill our fantasies
Take me by my hand my dear
Promise me you won't have no fear

She told me (she showed me)
She showed me (but she hurt me)
But she hurt me (yet she loved me)
Yet she loved me the same (all the same)
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
(has anybody, ever made you feel that way?)

Diddy,"Baby this is your last dance; you know how you do it
There's no nigga like you and there'll never be another nigga like you
Put your foot on these motherfuckers necks
Do it to 'em daddy, do it to 'em

As my, Daytons spin lowrider sittin' low
Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims
Hard top six-four, I'm Diddy no tint
I can't hide in New York City
I'm 'bout it in the South, sleep good in the West
Know a chick from Watts with Bad Boy tatted on her breast
I done been there and did it (I done been there and did it)
Ten years without gettin' sweat inside my Yankee fitted
1990-Raw I showed you ice
You ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice
When it was (All About the Benjamins) I had two bezels on my arm
Like a Don's supposed to, Sean
Ride with a chauffeur in Gucci loafers
And switch to All Stars without losin focus
These rap niggaz hopeless (hopeless) you can change the locks
But I'm a shine for niggaz that ain't know Big

[Chorus]
Do, seem, like, my, fu-ture's, here, now
It feels good to see the sun in the mornin'
I'm tired of feelin' that the people are talkin'
I heard a rumor that things ain't changin'
But Lord knows that we goin' make it
Oh

The world famous
As we proceed
To give you what you need
It's been so long
It's been so real
So magnificent, thank you

Tell me who shot Big (who shot Big)
And take the bullets out of 2Pac's ribs (take 'em out)
If I could I would reverse the car, reverse the beef
Put it all in a pot and boil it on a D. Dot beat (hit me baby)
Sometimes I get drunk, for stress relief
Other times I put ""Life After Death"" on and peep
We ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe
Without my nigga on the passenger side?
And still I try (I try) to get money stay fly
Finish the race, holdin' my crown high (take that)
I fly next to God, my eyes on the prize
Been away a long time but now I'm re-energized
(AS WE PROCEED) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon)
Dedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine)
And the day I die, let a G4 fly
And dump my ashes over N.Y.

[Chorus]

Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin' name
I told you I was gon' be great ma
I told you I was goin' be somebody!
Oh!! Feel so good
Feel so free
Put your fists in the air, aow!

I'm the King of all Kings, I abide by no rules
And do what I do by any means (c'mon)
Call him necessary, the great visionary
Born extraordinary, a life legendary
Who else put flows out, that put clothes out
Flee the cold weather, short sleeves with my toes out
Nine-six Big showed me what to do
But deep in my heart, this is ""No Way Out II"" (let's rock)
I spend absurd money, private bird money
That Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bloomberg money (you know what it is)
Old habits die hard, the Vanguard award winner
New York torch gripper, O.G. of the floss nigga
I'm seein' visions like I did a bag of angel dust
This is life when you black rich and dangerous
I'm with God, I'm a live on forever
Bad Boy for life bitch, nobody does it better (nobody)

[Chorus]

Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin' name
I'm in the best shape of my life!
Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin' name
Yeah! You created this monster!
It's so inspirational, it's so real
Bad boy bitch!

So there y'all have it
Words from a wise, great King

Welcome to the future I'm the captain of the cool kids

Great booty better thighs I ain't wanna tell her bye
First, I tell her hi, then I give her one and let her fly
Never tell her lie the night you couldn't find a better guy
King shit fly to anywhere you get seen with
Gangsta distinguished, cool as a penguin
Got a team of them, honey feel free to bring with
G-5 waiting, fly away at my convenience
You seen Tip checking in a 5 star suite with some 5 star freaks
Gettin' high all week, catch me in the V
I was in the back when y'all sleep
In a fast car super bad broad back seat

See the moon say goodbye and the sun greeting us like

Diddy,"So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
Ain't nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
When you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Chorus: x2]
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself

Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly,
So many lonely sleepless nights,
I'm going through hell to convince you love me,
But never her approval no matter how I try,
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
Momma always told me to respect the woman,
But what am I to do when her parents do not try

So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say
Ooh

[Chorus: x2]

I've been so dependent on your love for so long,
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now its changed,
My life ain't the same as it was,
Heart broke to the point, sometimes wanna end it,
If I can't have what mean most to me

So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say

[Chorus: x2]

(Diddy, Drizzy baby)
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn, tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became somethin' different
Its just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure

So selfishly
You can only show fear 
Unless you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh time, oh time has changed 
And I'm no longer wiling
You can see how my heart is bleeding
Oh yes

[Chorus: x3]",[Untitled]

Smoke weed, listening to Sade
I left my pain in Paris
Why can't you see shit my way
You on that lonely highway
My car's still on that driveway
Feels like I'm dying slowly
Feels like what more can I say
I made you face your fears
I think we could have made it
Thought I told you I love you
Maybe we should have waited
How could you ever doubt me
When I stood by you proudly
I would have gave my last breath
Now you can't breath without me

Oh when you're in the club ya
All you think about is your baby
Oh when you're in the club ya
All you think about is your baby

Baby I want you
To need me

Diddy,"I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

I'm back where I belong,
Yeah I never felt so strong
(I'm back baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
And if you with me put your hands high
(Put your hands high)

If you ever lost a light before,
This ones for you
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear ""The Tears of a Clown""
I hate that song
I always feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another Dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but its harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night the inevitable prolongs
Another day another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Taneisha I'll be back in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

""A House is Not A Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone (no)
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own
Pick up your phone, come on

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
'Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
Is what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you big)
And here I stand, a better man! (a better man)
Thank you Lord (Thank you Lord)
Thank you all!

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home",Coming Home
Diddy,"I don't even know if found redemption
Cause I still hear something whispering,
Try to tell something about you,
Don't know how to tell him I'm through
Baby my sanity, you give me a chance to leave,
You're telling me, I wont leave you
I don't believe you!
I don't need somebody like you.

To the sky 
I smoke my reefer gettin' high
You know without I'ma die,
You clip my wings now I can't fly,
My momma told me never cry,
She never taught me to say bye,
I cannot let you go I tried,
I hate you girl, you know I lie,
I hate you girl, you know I lie.

Boy you're gonna have to use your senses
Just to figure out the distance 
How you wanna love me, you choose,
Except for why you looking confused,
I gave you my sanity 
I gave you a chance to leave,
Telling me I don't need you, 
I don't believe you,
Cause I don't need nobody like you.

You's a motherfucking bitch to me
You just let me bleed,
You just let me leave,
Now I cannot see,
'Cause when I cry, 
I cry, tears of blood
You're the one I love, 
You're the one I love,
You're the one I trust,
And you said you can't fuck with me,
I can't fuck with you,
We can't fuck with we, and we cannot see
I hate you girl you know I lie
I hate you girl you know I lie

Baby I can't stand you, baby, 'cause I'm gone
I better hate you to see you at the door,
Baby ain't no love left here for you
If that's what I'm telling you
I hate loving you
I don't wanna, don't wanna be without you no

Why not tell the truth, I hate loving you
I don't wanna, don't wanna be without you
I let you control my heart
Baby don't you go too far
Baby I hate you

Yo turn the piano up
Can you feel it
Yeah like that
This the way love feels
Yo check it

Are we living in vain,
Are we living in pain
Girl remember my name (remember my name)
And whatever remains
After we walk on white sand
Lets travel in style
Just want to see you happy and smiling
I can change your life in one flight,
Lets take off tonight, come on

We go,
We go down
Love is in,
Then its out
We can tell,
Tell by now
If it wont, work out

Lets not forget
Back in Brooklyn
Where the future
First began
Lets start again
Cant be over
That's what I told her
And then she said

I hate that you love me
So much boy
I hate that you hurt me
So much boy
I hate that you love me
So much boy
I hate that you hurt me
So much boy
I hate that you love me

One time is enough for me
Close your eyes, there's much to see
So lets jump and both touch the clouds, and we never come down
Its amazing the view here
On top of the world where even the air is all brand new here
Fireworks like new years
Hurt is old news, why would you shed new tears

How can you
Trust in love
When our time
Our time is up
If I leave
Will you
Walk away
From the truth

Lets not forget
Back in Brooklyn
Where the future
First began
Lets start again
Cant be over

I hate that you love me

Things I know now, don't allow me to turn back
We been through it all but now I just want my heart back
And I could walk away but see your love is my weakness
Oh it could be pointless to try and walk away, that's why

I hate that you love me

But now you're gone
And I'm forced to deal with your absence
All alone in this madness
All alone on my mattress
Don't know how the hell did this happen
You knew loving me was a hazard
Outcome of my actions
I wish we could go backwards
Go back a couple chapters
Back when there was laughter
Back when we first met
Before we came such a disaster
Before your heart got shattered
Before I forgot how much you mattered
Crazy we don't realize what we have until after
We no longer have her
Uh eh

Can't help but think of you when I'm alone
Try and fell I call your cell
You don't pick up your phone
Guess that really means
You mean just what you said said just what you mean
Getting all this bread but it don't mean shit
Fuck the dough I get plus the dough I spend
Darling just,
Don't you ever leave
Don't you ever go away
And throw it away

There's a raincloud above my heart
And it's only because of you
I knew it from the very start
Running out of complaints
No no and the least of my problems today but,

Looking at my heart I'll give it away babe
