Nino Bravo,"El tiempo pasa muy lento te lleva lejos
Pero quedaste en mi alma, mi alma
Por más que brille la luna en mi ventana
Si no estas todo me falta, me falta

Paso tras paso
Yo se que te vas acercando a mi
Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar
Siempre aquí

Vuelve, que yo te sigo esperando
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Es hora de pensar en un cuerpo real
Que no desaparezca entre mis manos
Que yo pueda sentir, que yo pueda tocar
Como la melodía de un piano

Si quieres, vamos, nos cojemos
Nos tiramos, nos merecemos
Nos maltratamos
Sin lavarnos las manos, cariño
A veces no basta con que queramos

Digo tu nombre de nuevo
Y a veces creo, que estoy perdiendo la calma, la calma
Y cada noche despierto cuando siento
Tu voz que siempre me llama, me llama

Paso tras paso
Yo se que te vas acercando a mí
Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar
Siempre aquí

Vuelve, que yo te sigo esperando
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Un beso flotando en el aire nos quedara
Mi amor, te pienso
No me dejes de pensar

En cada radio del barrio, suena mi canción
Quiero que llegue a tu casa y tu corazón
Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado

Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado
Vuelve, vuelve
(Que todavía te espero)
Vuelve
Por favor vuelve que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Nino Bravo,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Nino Bravo,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only `cos you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Nino Bravo,"Contigo...
Yo me siento el rey del mundo,
desde el momento en que dijiste
que me quieres solamente a mí.
why ya no pienso nunca en otra cosa,
que estar siempre junto a tí...
Contigo...
Yo podria estar contando,
una por una las estrellas
que nos guían en la oscuridad
por donde planto el brillo de tus ojos
cada noche junto al mar...

Contigo soy feliz
desde el instante en que te vi
why ahora comprendo que sin ti
ya no podre vivir...
Contigo soy feliz
viendo tus labios sonreir
porque al besarlos descubrí
tu gran amor por mí...

Nino Bravo,"This girl walked in dreams
Playing in a world of her own
This girl was a child
Existing in a playground of stone
Then one night her world was changed
Her life and dreams were rearanged
And she would never be the same again

This girl is a woman now
She's learned how to give
This girl is a woman now
She's found out what it's all about
And she's learning learning to live

This girl tasted love
As tender as the gentle dawn
She cried a single tear
A teardrop that was sweet and warm
Our hearts told us we were right
And on that sweet and velvet night
A child had died
A woman had been born

This girl is a woman now
She's learned how to give
This girl is a woman now
She's found out what it's all about
And she's learning learning to live

This girl is a woman now
She's learned how to give
This girl is a woman now
She's found out what it's all about
And she's learning learning to live

This girl is a woman now
She's learned how to give
This girl is a woman now
She's found out what it's all about
And she's learning learning to live",La Niña Es Ya Mujer (This Girl Is a Woman Now)
Nino Buonocore,"Scrivimi
Quando il vento avrà spogliato gli alberi 
Gli altri sono andati al cinema 
Ma tu vuoi restare sola 
Poca voglia di parlare allora
Scrivimi
Servirà a sentirti meno fragile 
Quando nella gente troverai 
Solamente indifferenza 
Non ti dimenticare mai di me
E se non avrai da dire niente di particolare 
Non ti devi preoccupare 
Io saprò capire 

A me basta di sapere 
Che mi pensi anche un minuto
Perché io so accontentarmi anche di un semplice saluto 
Ci vuole poco
Per sentirsi più vicini 
Scrivimi
Quando il cielo sembrerà più limpido 
Le giornate ormai si allungano 
Ma tu non aspettar la sera 
Se hai voglia di cantare 
Scrivimi

Anche quando penserai che ti sei innamorata 
Tu non ti dimenticare mai di me 
E se non sai come dire 
Se non trovi le parole 
Non ti devi preoccupare 
Io saprò capire 
A me basta di sapere 
Che mi pensi anche un minuto 
Perché io so accontentarmi anche di un semplice saluto 
Ci vuole poco 
Per sentirsi più vicini 
Scrivimi
Anche quando penserai che ti sei innamorata 
Tu scrivimi",Scrivimi

Nino D'Angelo,"Feels like heaven when I think about you
Sparking that love within my soul
And when I touch you, I can't describe it
Sending chills down my bones
With God as my witness and watching over
We'll write our love in the stone
Please give us strength, Lord, to fight our battles
And we can walk on the streets of gold
'Cause you take me higher than I've ever, ever known
Give me good feeling like a king and queen on a throne
'Cause you take me higher, further than the sky above
Send me in ecstasy, baby, with your love
Tell me what you're thinking of, must thinking of love
Put your hands into mine and then we'll take off to the sky above
Soft like an angel, like the feathers laying on a dove
Touch me with your soul, love, till I lose control
Just like an angel watching over me
(You protect me from my fears)
I once was blind but now I see
(Ever since the day you appeared)
I just wanna say, I want you in my life till the day I die, baby
Just like an angel watching over me
(You protect me from my fears)
I once was blind but now I see
(Ever since the day you appeared)
I just wanna say, I want you in my life till the day I die, baby
Look in my eyes, tell me right now
That you and your love will forever take me higher
With God as my witness and watching over
We'll write our love in the stone
Please give us strength, Lord, to fight our battles
And we can walk on the streets of gold

Nino de Angelo,"Do und ich
Wir sind so hoch geflogen vor gar nicht langer Zeit
Ein Flugzeug voll mit jungen Träumen stand für uns bereit.
Das mit uns war so groß
Wir eroberten den Himmel
Warum liess't do mich nur los ohne Fallschirm in der Nacht ?
Ich hab' die Zeit nie ganz vergessen
Als wir noch Flieger war'n
Do gehst nicht raus aus meinem Herzen
Ich denk' nur noch daran:
Do hast oft gesagt
Wir sind stark
Wir zwei
So was geht doch nicht einfach so vorbei.
Ich hab' die Zeit nie ganz vergessen
Als wir noch Flieger war'n.
Würd' es gern nochmal mit dir erleben
So'n Flug ins Abendrot
Würde gern nochmal mein Herz riskieren
Sogar bis in den Tod.
Das mit uns war so groß
So was gibt es nur noch selten
Werden wir nur einmal noch auf den Wolken uns verlier'n ?
Ich hab' die Zeit nie ganz vergessen
Als wir noch Flieger war'n
Do gehst nicht raus aus meinem Herzen
Ich denk' nur noch daran:
Do hast oft gesagt
Wir sind stark
Wir zwei
So was geht doch nicht einfach so vorbei.
Ich hab' die Zeit nie ganz vergessen
Als wir noch Flieger war'n
Do gehst nicht raus aus meinem Herzen
Ich denk' nur noch daran !

Nino de Angelo,"Komm rein zu mir
Denn do brauchst nicht hier
Zwischen Tür und Angel zu steh'n.
Aber schließ' dein offenes Kleid
Und sieh mich nicht an wie I'm Liebesroman

Ich verspür keinen Hunger nach dir.
Meine Liebe zu dir ist erfror'n zu ewigem Eis.

Ich bin endlich die Ketten los
Und ich fang' nicht noch einmal an

Ist die Sehnsucht auch manchmal groß
Doch ich sterbe nicht nochmal.
Damals gingst do durch diese Tür

Ließt mich steh'n ganz allein mit mir.
Ich war verloren und bin neu geboren

Hab' zu mir gefunden
Ich sterbe nicht nochmal.
Ich war verloren und bin neu geboren
Ich sterbe nicht nochmal.

Ich spür' deinen Blick
do willst zu mir

Und ich streichel dir sanft dein Gesicht

Hat das Leben ohne Liebe 
Hast du jemals in der Sonne so gerfror'n. 
Jeder fühlt es in sich schon 
Und doch will es keiner seh'n. 
So als wären alle Menschen blind gebor'n

Warum leben wir wie Feinde ich und 
Du im Licht und Du im Schatten hör mir zu 
Das letzte Lied der Erde 
Hat längst schon angefangen 
Auch mir ist ohne Liebe 
Der Atem ausgegangen 
Und doch sagt mir das Leben 
Für Liebe ist es niemals zu spät

Das letzte Lied der Erde 
Geht irgendwann zu Ende 
Berühre meine Hände 
Solange diese Erde noch lebt 
Solang sie noch lebt.

Atemlos, ohne dich bin ich atemlos 
Atemlos, ohne Dich bin ich atemlos

Ja, ich weiß es lange schon 
Sind die Träume erst gegangen 
Hat das Leben seinen letzten Freund verloren. 
Darum wein' ich manchmal schon 
Denn ist Hoffnung eine Lüge

forse, mi mancherai
non si puo' stare soli
amo te, niente piu'

e non c'e' piu' bisogno d'inventare
le sere per poterti divertire
la scusa dei blue jeans che fanno male
per poi finire sempre a far l'amore.

E non c'e' piu' la luna che ti guarda
l'avevi detto tu che e' un po' bugiarda
il vento che portava il tuo sapore
la voglia matta di ricominciare.

Piangerai? Forse si', forse no, se non piangi tu
Scriverai? Forse si', forse no, se mi scrivi tu
Dove andrai? Forse qua, forse la', ti ritrovero'
Ci sarai? Forse solo un momento ti aspettero'

If you don't come 
Oh, I'm in trouble. 
What do you think about me? 
What do you think about me? 

Well you know part of me is 
Deep in you 
You don't want 
All my trouble... ahum 

Won't walk out 
I want to stay 
I'd light up your heart 
If I found the way 

After this love 
After the rain 
After our river?s meet 
You'll fill my eyes 

With silver curves 
And golden memories 
I'm still here 
Unafraid 

Won't you please come 
After this love 
After this crying 
After the stars all fall 

You'll fill my eyes 
With tears of joy 
We'll laugh about it all

Nino de Angelo,"Quella sua maglietta fina
Tanto stretta al punto che m'immaginavo tutto
E quell'aria da bambina
Che non glie'ho detto mai ma io ci andavo matto
E chiare sere d'estate, il mare, I giochi, le fate
E la paura e la voglia di essere soli
Un bacio a labbra salate, un fuoco, quattro risate
E far l'amore giù al faro
Ti amo davvero, ti amo lo giuro, ti amo, ti amo davvero

E lei
Lei mi guardava con sospetto
Poi mi sorrideva e mi teneva stretto stretto
Ed io
Io non ho mai capito niente
Visto che oramai non me lo levo dalla mente
Che lei
Lei era
Un piccolo grande amore
Solo un piccolo grande amore
Niente più di questo niente più
Mi manca da morire
Quel suo piccolo grande amore
Adesso che saprei cosa dire
Adesso che saprei cosa fare
Adesso che voglio
Un piccolo grande amore

Quella camminata strana
Pure in mezzo a chissacchè l'avrei riconosciuta
Mi diceva ""Sei una frana""
Ma io questa cosa qui mica l'ho mai creduta
E lunghe corse affannate incontro a stelle cadute
E mani sempre più ansiose di cose proibite
E le canzoni stonate urlate al cielo lassù
""Chi arriva prima a quel muro!""
Non sono sicuro se ti amo davvero
Non sono, non sono sicuro
E lei
Tutto ad un tratto non parlava
Ma le si leggeva chiaro in faccia che soffriva
Ed io
Io non lo so quant'è che ha pianto
Solamente adesso me ne sto rendendo conto
Che lei
Lei era
Un piccolo grande amore
Solo un piccolo grande amore
Niente più di questo niente più
Mi manca da morire
Quel suo piccolo grande amore
Adesso che saprei cosa dire
Adesso che saprei cosa fare
Adesso che voglio

Nino de Angelo,"Storie di tutti i giorni
vecchi discorsi sempre da fare
storie ferme sulle panchine
in attesa di un lieto fine
storie di noi brava gente
che fa fatica, s'innamora con niente
vita di sempre, ma in mente grandi idee
Un giorno in più che se ne va
un orologio fermo da un'eternità
per tutti quelli così come noi
da sempre in corsa, sempre a metà
un giorno in più che passa, ormai
con questo amore che non è grande come vorrei

Storie come amici perduti
che cambiano strada, se li saluti
storie che non fanno rumore
come una stanza chiusa a chiave
storie che non hanno futuro
come un piccolo punto su un grande muro
dove scriverci un rigo
a una donna che non c'è più

Un giorno in più che se ne va
un uomo stanco che nessuno ascolterà
per tutti quelli così come noi
senza trionfi, né grossi guai
un giorno in più che passa, ormai
con questo amore che non è bello come vorre

Storie come anelli di fumo
in un posto lontano, senza nessuno
solo una notte che non finisce mai

Ci avresti scommesso tu.

Vedrai
e tutto sbagliato.

Su di noi nemmeno una nuvola
su di noi l'amore e' una favola
su di noi se tu vuoi volare.

Lontano dal mondo portati dal vento
non chiedermi dove si va
noi due respirando lo stesso momento
per fare l'amore qua e la
mi stavi vicino e non mi accorgevo
di quanto importante eri tu
adesso ci siamo

per fare l'amore qua e la.

La maison près de la fontaine
Couverte de vigne vierge et de toiles d'araignée
Sentait la confiture et le désordre et l'obscurité

L'automne, l'enfance, l'éternité

Autour il y'avait le silence
Les guêpes et les nids des oiseaux
On allait à la pêche aux écrevisses avec Monsieur l'curé
On se baignait tout nus, tout noirs
Avec les petites filles et les canards.

A fait place à l'usine et au supermarché

Devant ce que maintenant tu sais,
Tu n’as pas trente-six solutions,
Tu n’as le choix qu’entre ces deux voies,
Il faudra bien que tu en arrives là.
Tu peux choisir de ne plus penser
Qu’à ce qu’on a déjà pensé pour toi,
En regardant ton cinéma.
Ou bien tu peux te sentir mal
Et découvrir autre chose en toi,
Caché sous un tas de conneries,
Qu’on a mis là pour faire joli,
Le dégoût, la nécessité,
La peur de ne plus jamais trouver
Ce qu’il faudra pour commencer :
L’an 2000, l’an demain,
L’an 2000, l’an demain.

Avoir une autre liberté
Que la liberté de choisir
Entre pouvoir mourir de faim
Ou pouvoir vivre comme un chien.
Pouvoir t’aimer, t’aimer, t’aimer,
T’aimer bien,
Qui que tu sois, d’où que tu viennes.
Être le Dieu dont nous sommes les idées,
Car il n’existe pas
Si tu ne lui prêtes la vie,
Même si toi, tu n’existes pas sans lui.
Pouvoir t’aimer, t’aimer, t’aimer,
T’aimer bien,
Pouvoir t’attendre et commencer :
L’an 2000, l’an demain,
L’an 2000, l’an demain.

Plonger dans cet autre univers
Que je sens là, tout près de moi,
Dans ce miroir à double fond
Qui nous attire, et qui nous fuit.
Plonger dans cet autre infini :

Il en faut vingt pour l’achèvement,
Lune et dollars, matraque et rêves,
La matraque, c’est ce qui prend plus longtemps.

On fait la croix sur ce qui reste,
La croix de guerre évidemment,
Ensemble il faudra vaincre, ou bien subir
Tout le meilleur et tout le pire.

Après deux heures, après cent ans,
C’est une question sans importance,
Ce n’est qu’une question de temps.

Au milieu d’une foule de gens, des gens de cinéma.
Elle m’a regardé, nos regards se sont caressés
Et je me suis laissé prendre au piège encore une fois.
Elle m’a dit :
« Je m’appelle Sylvie. »
J’ai dit : « Oui
Oui oui oui Sylvie »

On s’est revus quelques heures à l’Auberge du Bonheur,
Puis elle est venue chez moi, elle est venue trois fois.
Puis elle n’est plus revenue, je ne l’ai pas revue
Et ça s’est arrêté là, je ne sais pas pourquoi.

Même s’il est improbable
Que tu reviennes

Près de toi

Et je regarde le bonheur à portée de la main.

Nino Ferrer,"MOBY DICK

Le port de Nantucket à la douceur d’un lit,
Et l’habitude y fait disparaître l’ennui,
Et le brouillard étouffe le contour et le bruit
Du port et de la ville,
Et de la vie.

Dans la mer des Sargasses, les algues engourdies
Et les vertes épaves tournent à l’infini.
Il y a tant de sirènes, il n’y a pas de merci
Dans la mer et l’amour,
Et dans la vie.

Dans l’océan de ma vie, je te suis,
Je te poursuis sans répit,

Elle te tendra les bras
Quand tu le voudras
Quand il le faudra
Même si tu n’en veux pas
C’est elle qui gagnera
C’est Elle qui gagnera
Tous les deux on pourrait faire
Un univers imaginaire
Sur une île où tout serait
Comme on aurait voulu que ce soit
On préfère avoir la mer
Plutôt  qu’avoir un réfrigérateur
Mais il n’y a plus un endroit sur terre
Sans qu’il y ait des morceaux de fer
Qui tournent autour de moi… moi…

Ils tournent au dessus des toits
Quand le ciel est bas
Quand le ciel est bas
Même quand on ne les voit pas
On sait qu’ils sont là
On sait qu’ils sont là

All your life you kept it hidden inside

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

You have a lifetime before you.

Please don't be blue for the present,

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

A part la rue on connaît rien nous on est des gars che-lou
Tellement des galériens même entre nous on s'regarde chelou
Millionnaire, l'espérance de vie raccourcie, naturellement endurci
Sur les nerfs j'collectionne les soucis, les serments, les mois d'sursis
La haine attire la haine, pour ça qu'on s'ra jamais quitte
Sers moi pas la main si t'as poucave un gars ton équipe
Eh, on s'en bat les couilles de savoir t'es qui
T'as beau être solide, y'a toujours un moyen de razba ton liquide
Apprends moi à nager dans l'oseille, j't'apprends à nager dans l'khla
J'marche qu'avec mes semblables, trop peur de canner dans l'haram
Continue à baver, crache des mollards si ça te soulage
T'es comme une kahb de luxe cachée derrière un foulard
Si t'as une équipe toute pétée, tu risqueras pas d'percer
Vaut mieux avoir un seul bras droit qu'avoir cinquante bras cassés
Flow tordu comme un joint pas tassé
J'veux être de ceux qui prennent la caillasse et pas d'ceux qui s'font caillasser

Zoulou fait d'la place, N.I.R.O progresse
Si t'es trop boukak on t'balafre en te-trai
Une salope ça reste une salope même à la retraite
Trop frais, j'fais pousser d'la beu dans ton jardin secret
Si tu nous aimes pas khey va t'faire enculer
Si tu nous aimes pas khey va t'faire enculer

Une info, le Kat est en ville
GoodKat?
Oui, c'est ce que disent les drogués
Ah oui, et comment ça se fait?
Ah c'est sûrement pas un hasard si GoodKat est en ville
Euh, c'est qui ce GoodKat?
L'élite des tueurs
C'est le meilleur
Il débarque, y'a des morts, et il disparaît
Personne ne sait à quoi il ressemble
Je veux un rapport sur ce petit enfoiré
Je veux tout de A à Z. Je veux savoir qui c'est
Qui il connaît et qui le connaît, et ce qu'on sait de lui
Je veux savoir ce que ce merdeux est venu faire dans ma ville

Ouais ouais
J'suis comme GoodKat sale enfoiré
J'passe, y'a des morts et j'disparais
N.I.R.O

J'veux voir l'Afrique manger à sa faim
Que sa richesse profite à chacun
Mais wAllah aujourd'hui j'y crois plus
Comme la reformation d'la Mafia K'1-K'1
Tu veux savoir un truc essentiel?
L'argent et l'respect n'font qu'un
Eh, c'est pas parc'qu'on est personne
Qu'on doit respecter ceux qui s'prennent pour quelqu'un
J'ai tout essayé, leur donner d'la haine
C'est tout c'que j'ai pu faire seul
Calibré en hiver, à deux les pieds congelés dans la Supercinq
Y'a bien longtemps qu'ça nous fait plus bander
Y'a bien longtemps qu'on t'a appréhendé
On a grandi donc redescendez
Paix à nos morts, paix à nos mères
Qui nous soutiennent même chez les condés
De toute façon y'a rien d'fondé
J'dormais bien profondément fonce-dé
On charbonne de janvier à décembre
Pour faire des revenus, des sommes
Les hommes sont devenus des meufs
Les meufs sont devenues des hommes
Plus rien n'm'étonne dans cette vie d'paro
Ils ont tous un masque comme Jim Carrey
J'suis comme GoodKat sale enfoiré
J'passe, y'a des morts et j'disparais
Salam à tous, on n'a rien sans rien
Fais tout dans la souffrance, avec des paroles
On rembourse pas tout c'que la rue nous prend
Ni les années d'galères de nos daronnes
On n'a pas les mêmes problèmes ma gueule
Donc tes histoires de rap, on s'en passera
Ton flow, ta vie d'voyou inventée de toute pièce, on s'en lassera
En premier lieu y'a la famille, juste après ça y'a la vie
Y'a mes amis, y'a mes ennemis, et au-dessus d'tout ça y'a Rabi

J'suis comme GoodKat sale enfoiré
J'passe, y'a des morts et j'disparais
Ouais ouais
J'suis comme GoodKat sale enfoiré
J'passe, y'a des morts et j'disparais

Si je m'en sors j'serai privilégié
Parce que d'cette vie j'me sentais piégé
Ma conscience peut dormir tranquille
Mais gros ma haine a l'sommeil léger
Faut qu'j'me casse, que j'm'arrache d'ici
Mes roses ne cessent de faner
Donne-moi la combinaison du coffre
On parlera d'blé dans quelques années
Viens à B.L.O, tu seras bien vi-ser
Beaucoup d'sel3a, beaucoup d'misère
De quoi en faire tout un fromage
Le donner aux rats dans la souricière
Très très loin du système solaire
J'gagne mieux ma vie qu'les éducateurs
Les psychologues et les professeurs
Qui m'ont vu en échec scolaire
On est les plus durs à contrôler
Ils arrêtent pas d'se branler sur nous
Là, c'est plus du rap qu'on t'promet
C'est du porno, ouais salope t'es mort-née pour nous
Fais pas l'fou quand tu marches avec nous
J't'offrirai pas une deuxième paire de couilles
Sale fils de pute j'suis pas Afflelou
Je démarre à feu doux comme à l'époque où j'détaillais des ze-dou
Motherfuck' on galère frère même dans la che-dou
Ceux qui m'aiment pas c'est chelou
C'est la même pour moi zoulu
Bang bang dans tes genoux
Ramène pas ta gueule au fond d'la benne
Sur la pelouse on les baise
Pourvu qu'la concurrence repose en paix
Quand c'est la sécheresse le caractère est trempé
En feux d'détresse sur le bord de la route
J'attends pas qu'tu m'aimes
Nan nan nan poto j'attends pas qu'tu m'aimes
Nan nan nan poto j'attends pas qu'tu m'aimes

Faut pas se fier aux balances et aux apparences
Ceux qui parlent beaucoup n'ont jamais eu de parole
Ils t'aimeront quand t'es mort comme DJ Mehdi
J'ai mérité mes titres, plein de vérités j'ai dit
C'est pas de la comédie, j'ai médité
Mais qui t'es pour juger, critiquer, mes idées, mais dis
J'ai débridé mes vices, élucidé mes vies
J'aurais mieux fait d'éviter des feats et des beats et des hits
Mais j'ai kické, j'ai vite compris que j'étais pas comme eux
Quand je les ai vu sucer des bites et des bites, là j'ai tilté
Les dés sont pipés, les jeux sont truqués
Moralité, après Miraculé je suis trop rancunier
Va te faire enculer par Laurent Ruquier
La vie ça donne des va-vapeurs, de quoi halluciner
La plupart de tes rappeurs t'ont baratiné

Sauf que toi, demain on va t'oublier
Faut du pèse pour m'apaiser, ça m'aide

Autrement dit, des millions d'euros
Là c'est de la faim ou de la gourmandise?
Là c'est Nourredine ou N.I.R.O?
Bah ouais, mon ami

Ils avaient plus la dalle, nous on va tout prendre
Ici on a tout compris dans la souffrance
Tire les penaltys, les corners et les coups-francs
La jalousie les tuera tous, qu'ils meurent en souffrant
La jalousie les tuera tous, qu'ils meurent en souffrant
Les hâtai se taillent, y'a que les vrais qui restent
Tu me dois du biff espèce de suce-bites
Si je te croise à la tirette, j'te roule dessus direct
J'suis né dans les prises de têtes
J'ai jamais mis mon nez dans la roupette?
Vous allez retrouver vos carrières de merde
Découpés en huit dans un sac poubelle
Depuis que j'ai sorti ""Vivastreet"", les salopes augmentent le prix
Tu veux réussir? Ok, bsahtek
T'as un gros Q, mais il te manque le I, salope
Y'en a qui soutiennent que par intérêt
Qu'ils soient bons ou pas, je peux plus les voir eux
Ils veulent te serrer, venir à tes soirées
Ils te ramènent que dalle, que des plans foireux
Gros, qu'est-ce que tu veux? Je les ai vus venir depuis la couveuse
Ils veulent tous partager leur enfer
Mais ils gardent tous leur paradis pour eux
Chacun sa route, niquez vos mères
Les grands bonhommes font les grandes victoires, salope
Les grandes salopes font les grands histoires, salope
J'pense à ceux qui sont pas en vie
Et puis aux vrais qui ne nous envient pas

Et ouais, hey, hey

Ma mère m'a dit ""mon fils, le hasard n'existe pas""
Avant mes premiers pas, je voulais marcher mais je pouvais pas
Je regarde les autres à l'école fuirent leurs parents comme la peste
Tout ce que je voulais c'était voir ma mère mon père dans la même pièce
J'ai trainé pendant des années solo dans les rues de ma ville
L'impression d'être condamné, vivre malheureux à vie
Me revoilà dix ans après, devenu violent pour de vrai
Vos mères nous voient de loin parce que le haram nous suit de près
À l'âge de quinze ou seize, une cinquantaine sur le banc
On allait dans leur cité pour tabasser leurs grands
C'était pas gratuit, en effet, le poto s'est fait mêler
J'ai vu plus de violence dans la vraie vie qu'à la télé
Ce sera pas pour bricoler si on doit sortir les outils
Mineurs, on envoyait des gens dans le coma pour des broutilles
On a volé, on a bicrave
Pas pour faire de la pub
J'ai grandi dans la ZUP donc j'ai grandi dans la stup, ouais
Aveuglé par la fumée, j'ai vu le temps se consumer
Consommer pour me consoler, je rêve d'être riche au fond du tro-mé
Je pensais à tout ce qu'on a raté, le temps perdu sur le rain-té
À regarder tous ces blindés passer en gros gamos vitres teintées
Ils rêvaient d'avoir leurs diplômes, je revais de braquer la Brinks
Acheter une villa à ma mère, mettre la famille à l'abri
Mais le réveil est brutal, gros
Ouais, le réveil est brutal
Mama m'a dit: ""c'est la vie""
Dehors je suis mieux qu'à la maison
Mon soce y perd la raison
Il m'a dit: ""je suis malheureux, j'étais mieux quand j'étais en prison""
Ainsi va la vida
Je regarde les voitures bruler
Et je les brule à mon tour pour dire au monde de se faire enculer
Dans le halal on me regarde chelou, dans le haram congratulé
On trainait tard entre nous, je voulais pas être adulé
Moi j'avais pas de père, pas de grand frère et pas de flingue
Mama j'ai mes raisons, monter en l'air ces baltringues
Et j'ai du mal à me raisonner, calcule pas n'importe qui
Ils font les 'chants, on les connait
On sait qui a peur de qui
Poto, je leur ai pardonné
Je n'avais que mes couilles et mon schlass gros
Ouais, mama t'avais raison
Mama t'avais raison
Mama t'avais raison
Mama t'avais raison
Mama t'avais raison

Tu perds le sommeil quand ça joue les caïds
Mama t'avais raison
Rendors-toi j'ai compris, ouais ça y est j'ai grandi
Mama t'avais raison
Mes deux fils, mes amis, ma famille, c'est ma iv
Mama t'avais raison
Je graille, ouais je maillais mais jamais j'ai trahi",Mama t'avais raison

Tout l'monde écoute et même les sourds
On vient d'en bas comme Zizou
A part au Top tu veux qu'on finisse où?
Un flash de vodka ils commencent leur ciné
Ils font la morale le nez enfariné, la routine
Bref, comme d'hab', j'les laisse parler fort, nous baratiner

J'te mets face à toi-même comme un selfie

Tu m'feras pas regretter l'bénéfice

Mon oseille a dû hanter mon sommeil
J'suis pas dans l'ascenseur émotionnel
Libre penseur, pas révolutionnaire
J'ai des frères qui dorment en cellule
Traversée du désert, attendent le déluge
Les balances agissent dans de tristes buts
Protégez mes soldats de ces fils de pute
J'ai jamais voulu faire des thunes
Garder mes principes ça m'a coûté un bras
J'ai craché sur des thunes
La rue m'a rendu c'qu'il m'est dû mais pas tous ces ingrats
Comme d'habitude, ça s'tire dessus pour la crave-bi
Trop divisés pour un lobby

Comme d'habitude, on fera l'boulot salope
Comme d'habitude, comme d'habitude

Mon soss' a pris ta carte bleue, tu crois qu'elle est encore dans la fente
Faut qu'on mette les voiles à temps, appelle-nous si t'es sûr un plan
Le seul D.A.B que j'connaisse, celui qu'on pistait devant la banque
J'passe d'un hôtel cinq étoiles en G.A.V j'dors sur un banc
Un pied dehors l'autre sur un Glock, en bas d'chez toi ça dort en planque
J'pense même pas à toi dans les chiottes, t'es juste une fiotte comme Laurent Blanc
Bien sûr qu'on est rancuniers, sale grosse pédale t'es bien renseigné
On baignera dans le son c'est rien
On régnera jamais sans saigner
Y'a plus personne derrière toi comme Rama Yade
J'te vois tout petit du haut d'l'Himalaya
Si t'as pas d'cul mets du culot comme Zahia
J'm'en bats les couilles tant qu'tu ramènes la caillasse
C'est comme d'habitude, sombre attitude
Paye-moi vite si tu m'dois des thunes
C'est une certitude, j'suis bien entouré
J'suis sur le bitume, sale fils de pute, j'ai pas d'inquiétude
Sais-tu c'que c'est d'nager dans la merde à contre-sens?
J'ai pleuré mes disparus avec deux grammes dans l'sang
Si tu comprends c'qu'on ressent, c'est bien c'qu'il m'semblait
On doit s'ressembler, on doit s'rassembler, avec ou sans blé on les fera trembler

Je me suis demandé s'il fallait pardonner, les étrangler ou pas
On s'demandera pas si ta vie valait la peine d’être enlever ou pas
Ah ouais ouais, j'passe dans tout les secteurs
Ah ouais ouais, pas comme ces disquetteurs
J'les baise toute la nuit, toute la journée
J'quitte la chambre d’hôtel à 17h, ah ouais ouais
J'ai laissé deux trois fois ton salaire au resto hijo de puto

La où tes rappeurs ne vont pas, j'me sens comme à la maison

Quartiers colorés comme à colibri
Des albums et des guerres à livrer
Montée de violence quand le soleil brille
Tous les quartiers de France sont calibrés
Y'a pas d'heure pour se faire rafaler

Être en galère, plus savoir où aller

Sale pétasse (Salope!)
J'pense à la mort, 5 fois par jour, elle m'rend visite
Tape à la main, tape à la joue, ces fils de putains sont imprévisibles
Ne soit pas de ceux qui suivent
Ne croit pas ces imbéciles
Tu parles de rue, mais j'y suis
J'te vois pas, t'es invisible
J'suis comme le temps, j'passe en de-spee depuis que j'ai deux fils
Tordu comme la tour de pise, faire la monnaie, c'est la seule devise

Si mes ghetto youth dorment en cellule à l'heure où j'te parle c'est par nécessité
Tits-pe on était déjà évités, cherchait encore leur crédibilité
Ils nous sucent, nous détestent en même temps, complexe d'infériorité
Leur buzz de l'automne ne pousse pas au printemps, on entendra plus parler d'lui en été
Sept heures du mat' le maton m'matte à l’œilleton
M'demande si j'suis mort ou dans l'coma, c'est le bétom

J'leur ai donné presque tout mon pain à l'époque où j'traînais sans blé

And an illustrated book about birds

Who needs action when you got words

When you're finished with the mop then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work it took was fun

Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood

They bring out the older ones
They point in my way
They come with a flash of light
And take my family away

Accept some friends of ridicule

Nirvana,"Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And flew away howling on the yellow moon
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July
People cry and people moan
They look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make them their own
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again 'till the fourth of July",Lake of Fire [DVD]

What's the reason of love if you can lose everything
What's the meaning of love, it's a crime if anything

How can a culture can forget it's plan of yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend

Barely heat the top of friend like it moves everyday
You could shit upon the stairs
You'll be friends

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

The gadget turned the pre-dawned sky as bright as the sun
As the first atomic mushroom cloud rose above the horizon.

We knew the world would not be the same...
A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.
I remembered the lines from the hindu scripture, the bhagavad gita
Vishnu was trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
And to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says,
""now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.

Nitin Sawhney,"Today at 15.45 hours
India conducted 3 underground nuclear tests
In the bogram range

Hope falls softly from your hands
Dreams burn deap beneath the land
Time casts shadows overall
Sweating fever, rain or river
Brushing winds beneath your call

Broken skin, distant fear
Shattered worlds of endless tears
Hidden fires, distant lies
Burried hopes beneath the cries
Broken skin, distant fears
Silent lips, so far, so near

Silence, it is every hope apart
Two flames burn deep beneath one heart
Teardrops flow faster with the tide
Raging over calmer waters
As the timeless land divides

Broken skin, distant fear
Shattered worlds of endless tears
Hidden fires, distant lies
Burried hopes beneath the cries
Broken skin, distant fears
Silent lips, so far, so near

Broken, distant, shattered
Hidden, distant, burried
Broken, distant, silent

Cold games repeat on eastern shores
Strong winds blow over colder wars
Proud lips stay silent in the rain
There are half a million voices in the song without a name

Broken, distant, shattered
Hidden, distant, burried
Broken, distant, silent

Shattered
Hidden, distant, burried
Broken, distant, silent

(so far so close)
Shattered

Distant

That they are encouraging for people to come down and work
And then we went to the embassy and they showed us
Kew garden pictures and pictures of the various parts of england
That it is all that beautiful and everything is just right
And that's why we just applied for the voucher.

You burn my flame within your hands
You know when my destiny falls
This time has insecurity
I feel, makes me restless inside
Will you take me there
To a distant place I've never been before
I could leave this world
I could follow you like oceans to the shore
You could take me there
Make the rivers of my mind flow to my dreams

You hold your secrets from my eyes
You see where the furthest rain falls
The day breaks over in the streams
You know where my rivers will flow
Will you take me there
To a distant place I've never been before
I could leave this world
I could follow you like oceans to the shore
You could take me there
Make the rivers of my mind flow to my dreams

And I dream of places far from here
And I call your name to the wind
And I wish the night would take me to another world
Where no one knows a face or has a name
Will you take me there
To a distant place I've never been before

One day perhaps we will come back to this country and bring our children to show them you know
And what we had to sacrifice to be in that country you know.
But I think in the initial state that we had a lot of struggle
But with god's grace and his kindness we are okay now and our children are okay as well

Nitin Sawhney,"Woke up in the morning in a temple
Kinda lucky on my feet for it was central
So I walk across the village
Saw a group of kids pillage
And I thought to myself I might be meant to
You see

Pilgrims in the town
All seem to hold a frown
Say all they want to be is diggy down
You know Speck thought he'd ask
But figured it's just a mask

This guy's on something else that's profound
I'm not the stool or the fool or the leader here to rule
Not the lover or the fighter who came here to duel
But I thought I looked into, but I walked into

So I can understand all the rules, cool?
Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties, meet my pal compromise

And the kid you want to be you can be that
Who's ever watched the world that's my motto
Don't ever want to play the head honcho dig but huh
If you try to push I won't beat around the bush
Straight up you're getting dissed on the pronto

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties, meet my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be, you can be that
If I could, I'd solve the problems of the world that exist
If I could always chill, I would without resist

If you weren't so literal, brother you might get it
Pack my bags, tambourines, and jeans so don't sweat it

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties, meet my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be, you can be that
Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet, my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be, you can be that
Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet

As the journey continues I gain current instincts
I feel I know what they must be thinking, for instance
When they speak in riddles I'm left with the question
But won't stop arguments to kill attention
They all got a sixth sense to be one another
So pilgrims seek refuge undercover
Where it's fly like birds to live a lot is absurd
Try telling that to this kid named Unver

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be you can be that
Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet, my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be you, can be that

I met him on tour a week on for twenty four
He was born in the village, but left in ninety four
Now he's still got probs he doesn't know how to solve
I said, ""Unver, I've been there before""
In the light of understanding I forgot it
Sometimes the boat shakes when you rock it
I told him we are like family, a part of humanity
Don't overdo, and don't toss it

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet, my pal compromise

Life is like a puzzle not pieced yet
Might take a village ever long to see that
Don't break your ties meet, my pal compromise
And the kid you want to be you, can be that

He dug and moved on with his life
'Cause he digs it gets real dark at night
Don't want a collar that's blue or a reflection of you
Just wants us to get his plight

Myself I'd like the years just to take me away
It might leave a part of this world in dismay
But the village calls the pilgriming negroes
After all I'm just one needle in the hay

Now what I'm speaking in is symbolics
But you can call it what you want to call it
See all that I do is throw words, and I hope that you caught it
Only got one arrow but I aim for two targets

I smell the lies beneath your smile

From pictures filled with silence
Nothing mentioned, nothing gained

We're here and then we're gone

But we're cold and intimate

Nitin Sawhney,"They've incorporated their culture and their values into the city and they've enriched the city 
both like, from uh, you know work ethic and you know the restaurants and the music and it's really a diverse city. 
I mean you walk through the Vany Avenue, you know you go through Korean neighborhoods, 
Old Jewish neighborhoods, Arabic neighborhoods, uh, Pakistani-Indian neighborhoods. 
It's incredible. The intensity... I think yeah, development has pushed us away from other people. 
You know a lot of times people are rude because they want like immediate access or immediate information. 
You know some things in life can't be immediate, sometimes you gotta wait and let things happen... 
People are like, are increasingly rude. Like I'll say somebody will get in a cab, we'll say ""I'll get em there in 5 minutes."" 
And they'll say, ""Well, It should only take 3."" Now who gives a shit if it takes 5 minutes or 3 minutes, who cares? 
At the end of your life nobody's gonna put at your tomb stone ""shit I got in a cab in five, in seven minutes instead of three"". 
You know, It doesn't matter, and technology has made us slaves to time. 
Naw, a lot of people that are really have technical jobs, they're slaves to time. 
And time is the essence of life it seems like. And they're basically like losing it 
They're losing the essence of their life because, you know, their life is like just going away and, 
They're not enjoying it because their so engrossed in efficiency and productivity and shit like that. 
That it's almost sad. They all come here from somewhere else like seeking their fame and fortune or, 
The top jobs and they're and career-you know, in their, in their industries. 
They get very engrossed, and they into these you know these cell phones and computers and... 
I think the real important things in life are you know, people and your family. 
I think you don't realize that, a lot of people don't realize that until they're older.

Nitin Sawhney,"I have lived life until now to the height of enjoyment
My physical body accompanied by a conscious mind
Endless desires swirl outside of me
HE is also taking me along his cosmic path giving me experience of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling and feeling
I feel content while sleeping, crying, laughing, eating and drinking
Day and night I think that there must be some purpose to this life
I have come to understand joy and sorrow due to lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego
I have started to think about what is the characteristic won't of life and about what is the uncharacteristic won't of life,
About what is benevolent use of mind and words and what is harmful use of mind and words
And about what is sin and what is virtue
Thus no more desire or expectation for past, present or future remains with me
My mind has gone beyond past, present and future and beyond the rational intellect of imagination
I see that I am beyond birth and death and am enjoying mind in a state of samadhi

PS : I found this translation n a forum. Here is what the guy said :

An Indian friend of mine recently translated Chetan Jeevan (Conscious Life) for me and I thought I would share this in case other people are interested. My friend doesn't speak very good English so I've had to piece this together quite a bit. I'm sure it's more eloquent in its' original form and if anyone can help with a truer translation then please feel free!
I use the definitions given by Shrii Shrii Anandamurti-ji for Dharma and Satya but realise that Hindu and Buddhist definitions are various and differ.

Lost in a clouded mind
Held down by all the things that seem so real
The world you can't leave behind

You've made all of the money you could spens
You're begging for something more
Behind the prison tou call your home my friends
The light in the endless dark

Lately, you've followed your fears under the bed
And fell for a hundred years
Into the arms of a wounded melody
The promise that love's still here

You held a cynical world like God's bruised fruit
Chopped from a sacred tree
It's us, the enemy we fought all these years
The stories of you and me

So we hurry, go faster and faster to find that we've ran our whole life
Forgoing the sweetest view
There's a buzz like a lightbulb up to our ears
Promise that love's still here

Retrace the steps in the snow to find your friend
'Cause the child had melt so fast
Big dreams, the future you taste on summer's time
Having it just won't last

Right here, we've all got the answer in our heart
If we could just let that go
Lifetimes of beautiful Sunday church bell girls
The junkies upon the floor

So we hurry, go faster and faster to find that we've ran our whole life
Forgoing the sweetest view
We could argue forever and ever, be clear
Promise that love's still here

If forever and ever and ever we find that we've ran our whole life
Forgoing the sacred view
There's a buzz like a lightbuld up to our ears
Promise that love's still here
The promise that love's still here
The promise that love's still here
The promise that love's still here

Like to know whats..going on
In this world we're living on
There's so much poverty all around me
This insanity that surrounds me
there's the world that seem so far away
Peoples lives changing everyday

[Chorus: x4]
OOh no
I can hear the rainfall 

Like to know when you and I
Will stop walking and passing by
So much ignorance that my eyes see
And my experience cannot blind me
'Tis the world seems so far from here
Seasons change and the rain is near

[Chorus]

Like to find a new reality
Something more than this fantasy
No more false streams
No more mind games

I can even see through this dark frame
There's the world seems so far away
Peoples lives changing everyday

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.

I know you needed a friend
I know you needed some blue skies
You need some laughter again
Till magic returns to your blue eyes

You're lost in a circle of pain
Where's it all going?
Each day is, the same
Where are you going?

Say hello, say hello
You're never alone
Say hello, say hello
You're never alone

Something inside of yourself
When darkness approaches your silence
Freedom's forgotten her name
Nothing makes sense you don't complain

Everything started to fall
Where's it all going?
Can't make any sense of it all
Where am I going?

Nitin Sawhney,"The Royal Air Force has enjoyed a good days flight
With excellent weather over Iraq
The army has been continuing to prepare
For the coming land battle, and I can report on the arrangements
Being made for handling prisoners of war

O, mistress mine, where are you roaming?
O, stay and hear your true loves coming
That can sing both high and low
Trip no further pretty sweeting
Journeys end in lovers meeting
Every wise man's son doth know

What comes now has gone tomorrow
Present smiles are full of sorrow
But I see you in my mind
From the shadows of my memory
I can feel you walking near me
And I'm waiting for the rain to fall

Dust from your eyes, angels are falling
From distant fears, your cold hearts beating
I can see you in the dark
Or the flicker of a daydream
From the edge of silent tears
I remember and I smile

What is love? Tis not hereafter
Present mirth hath present laughter
What's to come is still unsure
In delay there lies no plenty
Then come kiss me sweet and twenty
Youth's a stuff twill not endure

Nitin Sawhney,"There's no more trains going that way
There's no more trains coming this way
You better make your way home, son
There's something going down in London

Well, that ain't gonna stop me
So I step out the station and what do I see?
Traffic for days
Let me walk a bit and I'll see where it get me

Then it all went slow motion, everything slow motion
First came the flash of lights then the sound of explosion
And we're still in slow motion, we're still in slow motion

On these streets where I played
And these trains that I take, I saw fire
But now I've seen the city change in
Oh, so many ways, since the days of fire
Since the days of fire

Now I'm on the train, going that way
There were too many people coming this way
Delayed trains, delayed trains
Didn't plan for death on the subway

So I step out the station
Brazilian name all over TV
Realization, I was on the next train
Could've been me

Then it all went slow motion, everything slow motion
First the flash of light then the rise of emotion
And I'm still in slow motion, I'm still in slow motion

On these streets where I played
And these trains that I take, I saw fire
But now I've seen the city change in
Oh, so many ways, since the days of fire
Since the days of fire

One day going that way, one day going this way
Those summer days, that crazy phase
Like a jack-knifed car on the highway

Just two mad situations
Fire on the news, fire on TV
A bus, a train station
The crossfire sights of destiny

Now it's all gone slow motion, everything slow motion
The lights gone out, I feel no more emotion
I'm all out of emotion, I'm out of emotion

On these streets where I played
And these trains that I take, I saw fire
But now I've seen the city change in
Oh, so many ways, since the days of fire
Since the days of fire

Nitin Sawhney,"This city, everywhere I go, I see faces I know
All in their different zones
As we're flying through this world underground
And my eyes are wide shut, I'm not hearing a sound

Time standing still
Surrounded by sad hearts unfulfilled
Empty places for the disenchanted
Pass and fade away

Distant dreams, where I go
Distant dreams, when I'm low
As they echo in my head

Distant dreams, how they flow
Distant dreams, moving slow
As I'm falling out of time
I still have distant dreams here in my mind

Faces distorted by pressure
Everyone forced together
Spilling out through the doors

No more spaces
It's a dog-eat-dog world
And a mad free-for-all
Maybe room for one more

Time standing still
Surrounded by sad hearts unfulfilled
Empty places for the disenchanted
Pass and fade away

Distant dreams, where I go
Distant dreams, when I'm low
As they echo in my head

Distant dreams, how they flow
Distant dreams, moving slow
As I'm falling out of time
I still have distant dreams here in my mind

Distant dreams, where I go
Distant dreams, when I'm low
As they echo, echo in my head

Distant dreams, how they flow
Distant dreams, moving slow
As heartbreak surrounds me
And heartache has found me

Distant dreams, where I go
Distant dreams, when I'm low
As they echo in my head

Distant dreams, how they flow

As I'm falling out of time

I want to walk through your fire
Light up my eyes with your smile

I was awakened by magic
I was alone in this world
Take me away from here

Life's being run at a blistering pace
I've been shot from a gun
To your final embrace

My soul, your heart, two worlds apart
This life is all we have

How could they steal all these feelings?
How could they lie to this world?
A picture away from your smile

Life's being run at a blistering pace
I've been shot from a gun
To your final embrace

My soul, your heart, two worlds apart
This life is all we have

One soul displaced, one heart replaced
Feelings defaced, invade our space
No one left to give us back our time

Climb every mountain
Swim through every sea
When all the world is asleep
We could set ourselves free

My soul, your heart, two worlds apart
This life is all we have

We could climb every mountain

I'm floating nowhere like
A wasp in October
Summer's over and done

These empty dreams of mine
Are out of place and out of time
Is just a grain of sand for me

Seasons change, memories fade
Daydreams fall like golden leaves

Another day
I'm watching dreams just slip away
The summer moon

Gives way to autumn's dusky bloom
Seeds I've sown
Are almost spent, I'm here alone

Wandering, I roam
Beneath the half light of forgotten sunsets
Searching for my home

Inside this lonely place
I'm chasing shadows like a wasp in October
Fading in the wind

Seasons change, memories fade
Daydreams fall like golden leaves

Um dia de mas
Meu sonho desapareceu
Lua no céu

Rio da noite, coração
Sozinha aqui
Você não lembra mais de mim

Hear the punch line on the radio

Voices weaving, smokescreen dreaming
Cold, deceiving, cloud my hearing

C'è più spazio per le canne di cui parli in ogni pezzo

Nits,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Nits,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?",Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)
Nits,"Once on a cold grey morning
I was walking home alone
The traffic light in the falling rain
The unanswered phone
I was so sad and lonely
On a lonesome avenue
So sad and lonely
What could I do
Once I opened a drawer
In a room of a strange hotel

I saw a photograph of you
You looked so sad and lonely
On a lonesome avenue
So sad and lonely
What could I do
Once in a railway station
In the city where I live
The windows were like mirrors

Nitty,"I started out with
No dough, no clothes, no shows, and no hoes
And ended up with 
Mo hoes, mo shows, mo clothes, and mo dough

I used to be the ideal nigga 
Preppy like Hilfiger
Pretty vill nigga 
But wanted to make my dollar bill bigger
Turned into a field nigga
Not pickin' cotton 
But pickin' up mics and rockin'
Recoppin' so I can feel richer
So I started drinkin' real liquor
Send me a groupie
And I will stick her real quick 
The dilsnick it will hit her ex pills
I can feel nigga best deals 
You can get the steal
If you ill I'm concealed with a
Technina millameter by my side
God used to guide me Lucifer beside me
Evil was lively trippin' with wifey
Never was treatin' her nicely
What this music got me into 
This is the message Imma send to
God the evil shit I've been through
Lettin' me really know what sin do
Listen 'cause the hurt cut me deep like a ginsu

[Chorus: x2]
This life 
Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever
Burn in the flame 
This life 
I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's
Possessing my brain 

This life 
Full of money bitches weed and riches
Kansas City niggas grind it
Cook it up in the kitchen 
Pay attention to the corner nigga
Roguish and rugged 
Nigga fuck it it's a must
I conceal it and tuck it 
This life
Can make a nigga murder for nothin'
This life 
For the money have you fakin' and frontin'
This life
Can make a nigga take a deal with the devil 
This life 
Got me rippin' up shit in my kennel 
Ya see I live in the rain 
Laugh at the storm
And mastered the pawn 
Bringin' war at the crack of the dawn 
Tottin' the bomb 
A nigga with a third eye vision 
Like a malachi blowin' smoke in the sky
See the world through the eyes of a real nigga
Look into my eyes
You can tell I'm a rider 
More shows more clothes 
More hoes more dough 
And no foes yo 

[Chorus: x2]

Some times I wonder
How did I survive 
With all this drama in front of me 
Poppa went out like a bitch 
For runnin' from me 
Though momma never lied
She cried 
Seen me sittin' in prison
Servin' a sentence 
With bad intentions 
Still no repentance
I'm heart broken while chokin'
On a joint dipped in water 
And high hopin' the future's wide open
For my daughter my eyes are open
To all animosity constantly
Falling quickly the devil calls it
A blessing to cross Nitty 
Lessons are taught quickly
Hell my pride will die with me
Then to repeat back 
To the penitentiary visit me 
Hell bound coffin dwellin'
Before a life in the cell yelllin'
Now free me 
I'm in desperate need immediately
Truthfully speakin'
My life from night to day
24 hours I fight 
Despite this hell to pay
Can't wait to see the day 
When my adventures begin
With this here life of sin 
I'm all in 

[Chorus: x2]

Is it heaven or hell
I really can't tell
It half cupid half relic
My life is anghellic
So I dance with the devils
And I fly with the angel 
And I stand on a level
Where mind is so tangled",This Life
Nitty Gritty,"""Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.


T'was Grace that taught...
My heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear...
The hour I first believed.


Through many dangers, toils and snares...
We have already come.
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far...
And Grace will lead us home.


The Lord has promised good to me...
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be...
As long as life endures.


When we've been here a thousand years...
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise...
Then when we've first begun.


""Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.

if you really want somebody to make a fool of you, baby girl
walks around like she has no clue
you're talking to the wrong one about this mess,
so why even bother when I couldnt care less
tell me why your man keeps stalking me,
call me on the phone, keeps paging me
you know he's doing wrong, why you talk to me
if that's your man, check your man
heard about the things that he do to you
you're up in my face what you want to do
i can take it there if you want me to
if that's your man, check your man
if he's your man, then why the hell are you walking up on me
need to check him out, cause I'm a lady not a girl who will put up with your 
mouth

still I'm trying hard now, to keep my sanity
but see I'm not about to start up a fight over some silly situation that's long 
gone

you better get up out my face before I make a scene, see the trick is on you
you better get it right, I'm not tryin to fight, but if I have to I will, yeah I

At the awards don't say shhhhhh
You're mad with me 'cause it's over

Nivea,"I know that I'm a diamond
But you don't gotta treat me like one
I know I shine like platinum
And I'm about as real as they come
And I don't like the way you're doing me
You wear me then you put me away
Can't come out until you want me
And I can't let you keep it this way

[Chorus: x2]
I don't like the way that you be shining me
You be treating me like jewelry
Then you turn around and you stash me
You be treating me like jewelry

This has become a problem
You watch me like you're security
You place me under lock and key
Like someone's gonna run away with me
You keep the same old stories
You say that you're protecting me
But you only worry how long before you lose me

[Chorus: x2]

You make me feel like I'm your jewelry
I'm not your jewelry, don't put me on display 
You make me feel like I'm your property
Why don't you show me some respect

So now make your decision
Do you think that you could untie my hands
You know that you'd be stressing
If you were no longer my man
And there's no combination
I can leave you anytime that I choose
So if you don't believe me
I guess you will just look like a fool

And never get love

I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad

You love me, then you snub me

It's been a long fight, my heart went right out

And if we make it then we'll be just fine
Maybe you'll be yours and I'll be mine

There's always mischief
Oh, you know the devil's always prying
Now being good to you is all that's on my mind
Down

Yes, your mind gets like a villain, make you splinter
Sing your heart off walking through some long Russian winter
Crying at the sad stories in the paper and on the news
Then I gather up the scattered blessings to bring them back to you

And if we make it then we'll be just fine
Be the first I've known in a long, long time
Told my sad story to anyone who'd listen
Now I'm in your heart, talking like Ian Dury, I'll be blissin'

Praise be the hands that brought this to work now
Turn it on, switch me on
You took my hand, yes, that came first
Turn it on, switch it on

I'm full of song, unrehearsed
Go on and turn it up, turn it on, turn it over

Praise be the hands that brought this to work now
Turn it on, switch it on

Trying just to seek out your name, darling

Bring your loving, smiling face over
I feel like, getting it right
Overnight, start over

I thought playing that loving game
Would never be simple again
But you're staying overnight
So maybe I'm doing something right

You can feel it in the trees
I feel it by degrees
Feel it fresh and new
I'm getting myself in love with you

The sun will rise up and you'll be in freedom
So much freer than you were before
It's in the seed now, it's in the season
I'm so excited it's knocking down your door

And they say, it's such a funny story
After a winter of getting dull and blue like a Tory
In getting all feared up, as the bond that ties
Cries, lies, incites the tears to your eyes

And the job will know I'm insane
To go running from love again
Into a lover's arms
Like a burglar running out on an alarm

It's a fucking swarm of bees
Or some waitress, it's a tease
Or some song was full of light
Coming 'round to you late at night

The sun will rise up, and you'll be in freedom
So much freer than you were before
It's in the seed now, it's in the season
I'm so excited it's knocking down your door

The sun will rise up and I will wise up
So much freer than we were before

It's in your CD, it's fucking teaming
Saw it around you taking you on a tour
And now, now, call the fuzz, it's such a buzz

From the start
You press the memory
You press the memory to your heart

What you waiting for?
A fallen love is an idea for sure
What you waiting for?
Like there was any law
She's like a sonnet, she's so on it

From the start
You press the memory
You press the memory to your heart

What you waiting for?
Fallen love's an idea for sure
What you waiting for?
Like there was any law

The sun will rise up, you'll be in freedom
So much freer than you were before

And engine rattles my bum like berserk
While we're singing
Don't forget your shovel if you want to go to work

But he's been good fun and bubbling and joking away

And pull off again speeding by this summer green grass

And eat up all the bullies and the teachers and their pets

For his lover, she's an orange fire
And he praises her like it was Sunday

Instantly giving the sign
Instantly putting to rhyme
Instantly reform the crime

Instantly brought back to life

Instantly loving again

And every piece glows for love
And I offer up everything, dream songs, a spatula

Stop thinking that I can read what's on your mind
Girl, I am always here to work it out
So please don't fear
Express your feelings to me, don't keep them inside

And you will hurt my feelings

Is it me or someone else
Baby explain yourself
Let me know the deal, tell me

To tell me what you want to do
Now you can come with me or stay right here

We meshed the styles of five alive and intertwined and fused it 
Life comes from life and through our strife we strove to make the sound true 
Compelled to spell it out, (No Doubt!) in search of what we must do 

Our house was to small so we had to move 
The neighbors had much doubts so we had to prove 
That our soulful dimensions were true to the groove 
We, moved on, moved on, moved on 
To our house in the middle of our street

To kick back and think about
How massive it all is
And how many others are on it

I often think about the world
In which I live today, of animals and plants
And nature's gifts set on display
But the most amazing thing
That I've seen in my time
Are all the different people
And all their different minds, minds, minds, minds, minds
And different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
Not one's exactly the same

I'm looking at a picture of your face

I go around the world to see your face
'Cause this just ain't good enough

So I'm just kicking it I'm counting the days
I hardly can wait, for us to hang out
I'm really missing it in so many ways
I anticipate us making out

(Here comes another one)

Sip my morning tea but you're not next to me
Here goes another day
I'm driving in my car
I wonder how you are
When our favorite music plays
And there are flowers above to my surprise
But that just ain't good enough
And I got the note it gave me hope
But that just ain't good enough

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah

Soon you'll be here with me (making out)
Soon you'll be right here with me

And honestly you can trust me
But that just ain't good enough

I sit here and I can't believe my eyes
You found me at last
But wait and see how it'll agonize

But you looked like me on Sunday

I know who I am, but who are you?
You're not looking like you used to
You're on the other side of the mirror
So nothing's looking quite as clear
Thank you for turning on the lights
Thank you, now you're the parasite
I didn't think you had it in you
And now you're looking like I used to!

You came in with the breeze
On Sunday morning
You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning
And you want me badly
You cannot have me
I thought I knew you
But I've got a new view
I thought I knew you well, oh well",Sunday Morning [Multimedia Track]

Running all the time
Running to the future
With you right by my side

Me
I'm the one you chose
Out of all the people
You wanted me the most
I'm so sorry that I'm falling
Help me up lets keep on running
Don't let me fall out of love

[Chorus]
Running, running
As fast as we can
I really hope you make it
(Do you think we'll make it?)
We're running
Keep holding my hand
It's so we don't get separated

Be
Be the one I need
Be the one I trust most
Don't stop inspiring me
Sometimes it's hard to keep on running
We work so much to keep it going
Don't make me want to give up

No Doubt,"It's funny how I find myself in love with you
If I could buy my reasoning I'd pay to lose
One half won't do
I've asked myself
How much do you commit yourself?

It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends

Funny how I blind myself
I never knew
If I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose
I'd tell myself what good do you do
Convince myself

It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends

I've asked myself
How much do you commit yourself?

It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends

It's my life
Don't you forget

No Doubt,"For a long time I was in love
Not only in love, I was obsessed
With a friendship that no one else could touch
It didn't work out, I'm covered in shells

And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life
And all I needed was a simple man
So I could be a wife

I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean
I don't know how it got to this point
I always was the one with all the love
You came along, I'm hunting you down

Like a sick domestic abuser  looking for a fight
And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life

If we met tomorrow for the very first time
Would it start all over again?
Would I try to make you mine?

I always thought I'd be a mom
Sometimes I wish for a mistake
The longer that I wait, the more selfish that I get
You seem like you'd be a good dad

Now all those simple things are simply too complicated for my life
How'd I get so faithful to my freedom?
A selfish kind of life
When all I ever wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life",Simple Kind of Life [Alternate Take]

Wants to save us from ourselves
How ingenious you are
You'll be sorry when you fail

Like a guardian of life
You're ambition was too high
Like a sentimental fool
All your efforts so in vain

Made a journey with the noblest intentions
To go out and make discreet observations
On his way, he started doubting his mission

Turning water into crack for a nickel

Turning over all the things I used to treasure
Falling into something new and undetermined
Not to worry, second best is not the end of life

Burning bridges, empty words but not forgotten
Empty fridges, dusty rooms and burning ashtrays
Failing for you, taking every chance to prove it
Got to worry see the things I cherish start to slip

I don't know what you want me to be
'cause you push me around till I can't even breathe
I don't know what you are doing to me
You have turned me into something ugly and cheap

Confrontation ain?t your thing

You say that laying blame won?t do no good now

So before you go and say goodbye

And move on with your life I wish you would somehow

Give me a reason to believe

That everything you?re gonna leave behind

Is a waste of time and ain?t worth fighting for


Chorus:

Slam the door, yell out loud

Don?t hold it in, let it out

Put me down, put up a fight

I can be wrong, you can be right

Just get mad, is that too much to ask

But, don?t walk away, walk away like that

Don?t walk away, walk away like that


Kicking me in the teeth would be better than leaving me untouched

So try

Cause all the words we never say

The wars unwaged have started stacking up

So high

There may not be a way to make you

Wanna stay and try to save our love

But if it can?t be like it was before


Repeat Chorus


Give me a reason to believe

That everything you?re gonna leave behind

Is a waste of time and ain?t worth fighting for


Repeat Chorus


",Don't Walk Away
No Justice,"

Written by: Steve Rice


I know I missed you party again,

I?ve always had trouble being the man that you want me to be

And I know you wore that red dress you were shining like a diamond

I?m somewhere down in Texas trying to find a way

To give you everything


Chorus:

Baby I can?t sleep when I can?t get you out of my mind

You cut so deep in this dark hotel room I can?t unwind

Set me Free so I can run to you again

Take me back, take me home to your red dress


We knew it wouldn?t be easy living this way

Hours on hours days upon days on a hard worn highway

I know I made a promise that I intend to keep

I said I?d never leave you now you?re all alone in my sheets

You?re wondering where I am


Solo


Repeat Chorus


",Red Dress
No Justice,"

If I gave you up for gone, quit all of this holding on, would I wake up tomorrow feeling better? What if hopes the only thing keeping me from crumbling, the last thread holding the pieces together. And it?s hard to tell the one that i?ll regret just letting you know that I?m not giving up yet.


(Chorus)


Such an ordinary day, you know the one you went away. I?ve relived each minute a million times. And all the things I almost did then didn?t do instead keep running around in circles in my mind. This heavy heart just won?t let me rest till I?ve convinced myself that I tried my best.


(Chorus)


And I wonder where could you be? I wonder why, did you leave without me.



Chorus:

I want to run out to the edge of town, scream your name for hours out loud. Turn this world upside down to find you. I want to build myself a time machine, to go back and change everything to see you here with me. That?s the closest I?ve ever been to who I want to be.

Are we really happy here with this lonely game we play?
Searching for words to say
Searching but not finding out here, we're standing anyway
We're lost, here in this mask, this masquerade

We're both afraid to say we're not too far away
No, no, no, from being close together from the start
We try to talk it over, but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

Thoughts of leaving disappears, every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try, try
To understand the reasons that we carry on this way
We're lost here in this mask, masquerade

Like no rain drops in a sunny place
All the people that you knew before
Don`t seem satisfied any more
I just contemplate the days we had
Now the sorrow here and I feel so sad
All this burning pain so hard to contain
All my memories on the nowhere train
Hello, how are you?
Would be good to see you again
Hello, where are you?
I`ve been trying to reach you in vain
Since you left I began to feel so sad
And my heart`s been shaking with fear
I remember now the times we`ve had
And I think I wish you were here
And I think I wish you were here
Hello how are you?
My imagination`s driving me wild

And the sun was gone
Turned on some music
To start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
More than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
I begin dreaming
When I see my marianne walk away
I see my marianne walking away
So many people have come and gone
The faces fade as the years go by
And still I recall as I wonder on
As clear as the sun in the southern sky
More than a feeling
When I hear that old song they used to play
I begin dreaming
When I see my marianne walk away
I see my marianne walking away
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away
She slipped away

Pacing the walk of life
Withering with the breeze
Holding on to memories
Burning it in my mind
Veracities of mankind
The limits beyond what you percieve
Your soul's alive but does it breathe!

I lie with greiving sighs
Questions running through my mind
Answers lagging far behind
My mind is tired of trying
To see beyond what man can see
Can I face reality

Searching my head for a truth yet unsaid
I brace every breath as I lie in my bed
The bleeding I hide from this torn heart inside
Where do I go when we cross the other side

Black is my fear, faith my despair
Wake me, will you wake me
When the end is near?

The game you play is not for keeps
Clear as glass but hard to see
Your manifested destiny

Another challenge of life I will test
I am changing, I am changing
All who I am.

No more time for any distractions
And walk away from any detractions
I have taken, I have taken
All that I can.

Cut-I'm never gonna get away
If I don't ever make this change
Cut the weight and
Fuck all the human waste

Cut-they're never gonna take away
The vision that I portray
No time to waste
I cut all that's in my way

With a breath of a fresh new light
I will start again
And say goodbye to all of my fake friends
Rearranging, rearranging all that I have

Remove myself from more than I need
Separate from those who doubt me
I am changing, I am changing
All that I am

If I don't ever make this change
Cut the weight and
Fuck all the human waste

Cut-they're never gonna take away
The vision that I portray
No time to waste
I cut all that's in my way

close my eyes and take a look at my life
Think of all the ways that I've been denied
Is it pride or is it timing
It's taking time but the road I'm finding

Healing back now from the
Wounds that I've made
Stabbed myself a thousand times this way
To keep my pace up with the hill I'm climbing
I'll cut the ties of those that bind

close my eyes and take a look at my life
Think of all the ways that I've been denied
Is it pride or is it timing
It's taking time but the road I'm finding

Cut-I'm never gonna get away
If I don't ever make this change

That I've tried to understand
But something within me

Trapped inside this cycle hell
Fighting, and hiding
A persisting lust that I must fill

Wanting to give you
All I can that's in my will
But inside it has rule
The more I grab the more I spill

Decided, divided
I cannot drop this burning coal
Trusting, and lusting
Competing sides strive for control
Why?!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Falling torn by deceit, approaching self-defeat
The mental light that's hounding, pounding
I'm falling

A feeling of sadness
Follows me with my mistakes
Scarred in my conscience
Haunting every move I make.

Alone, drifting miles apart
I'm found, with an empty heart
The sound, of peace is calling me
I wait, for a time of ease

Can't you see, that I am weak
Can't you see, I'm falling.



",Falling
No One,"Within your mind a self-dignifying
Vision of life that's now compromising me

There's something that is not seen
Your severing the esteem
Tore apart the seams

don't come fuckin' with me
Fuck the hype you feed
Leave the altitude
With the multitude
Hype is all you need
To plant the poison seed
Keen and wicked tool
Lures the mindless fool

Devote your mind
To self utilizing
When all the while
You're chasing a hopeless dream

There's something that you cannot feel
Oblivious to what's real
Soon your life will yield



",Hype
No One,"I can feel it again
Let the games begin
Turn the lights down
Inviting the energy

suddenly, I can see
Something changing in me
Turn away all the pain
Inside me!

Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
It is my way
This is my way

Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate
This is my fate

Yesterday I had died
With frustrations inside
Will I ever change
This part of me

In my mind
I have seen
This was not
Life for me

Took my pain
And I made it something

Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
It is my way
This is my way

Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate
This is my fate

Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
It is my way
This is my way

Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate
This is my fate

Nothing you could ever say
Could ever change me
Nothing you could ever take
Could ever break me
Nothing you could ever say
Could ever make me
Nothing you could ever take
Could ever make....

Nothing you could ever say
Could ever change me
Nothing you could ever take
Could ever break me
Nothing you could ever say
Could ever make me
Nothing you could ever say....

Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
This is my way
This is my way

Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate
This is my fate

Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
It is my way
This is my way

Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate
This is my fate



",Nothing
No One Is Innocent,"Look what you're doin' to me
I'm utterly at your whim all of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down
Automatic, automatic

What is this madness that makes my motor run
My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

My hands perspire and shake like a leaf
Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure, they tell me

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

Love you so much come hold me

I never imagine a love so unique 
I can hear Angels each time you speak 

It feels like heaven there's peace in my life

Whose wise as a serpent soft as a dove 
Sometimes I fall short and I get so weak 
But you saw my faults and felt my needs

I'm right beside you there's no need to fear 
I'll be your shoulder whenever you cry 
Without you with me girl I'll surely die.

You struggle with your bills and he never has no money.

Let me take the pain away, your heart will never hurt again.

They got paper but it still ain't right

No Secrets,"Secrets (secrets) are no fun
Secrets (secrets) hurt someone
Let me tell ya how it all began 
A little secret got out of hand

I ran into him just by chance
at this party we were talking then we started to dance 
the music bangin' then he leaned in close
my mind is tellin' me that I should go (but I stayed)

in a moment of weakness (a mistake)
but I kept it a secret
Soon enough I found 
Secrets have a way of getting out

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise if you'll just come back to me I swear no secrets, no deciet
I'll be your angel oh so sweet no secrets will I keep

Every night I light a candle
every morning well I say a little prayer
In hopes that when I open my eyes
I will find you standing there 

I confess a crime against our love 
my lonliness is punishment enough
Forgivness is devine 
everyone keeps secrets sometimes

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise no secrets forever ever more

Angels in heaven above
I know I sinned against love
Grant me this one miracle
And I'll be a saint from now on

Look in my eyes and it's that that you see it
It's been two weeks since my confession
and still he's not back in my arms
My love for you is the truth cause my heart keeps no secrets
heaven just give me a sign, tell me his heart is still mine

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise no secrets forever ever more

It isn't anything consumed so is it
becoming a problem you can't hide?

Battling for breath, battling for blood
And a body of His own

For while I've waited and debated

Don't haunt my days and nights 
Don't haunt me anymore

Not as crazy or as mad 
But my soul will be my own

And I ain't gonna take anymore 
Believe me

Made some of the lies worth believing

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore
To know that
I can read your mind, I can read your mind

Don't leave false illusions behind
Don't cry 'cause I ain't changing my mind

How your bright eyes reflected the African plains 
You told me of Laos and the Ivory Coast 
And of all your friends with unsayable names 
You taught me to never hide my wings 
To strive for all the craziest things 
And always believe in the goodness men 
You told me all this 
And took off again

And the crack in your voice when you said 
Don't you worry 
You know I must go, but I'll come back again
In the book of your face I could read your story 
A torch in the disillusioned night 
You raged and raged and raged 
Against the dying of the light 
And I still believe in the goodness of men

We were inseparably entwined
Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine
Held together, holding each other
With no one else in mind
Like two atoms in a molecule
Inseparably combined

But then I woke from the dream
To realize I was alone
A tragic event, I must admit
But let's not be overblown
I'm gonna try to ride a love song
Just a sad, pathetic moan
And maybe I just need change
Maybe I just need a new cologne

But now I look at love
Like being stabbed in the heart
You torture each other from day to day
And then one day you part
Most of the time it's misery
But there's some joy at the start
And for that, I'd say it's worth it
Just as you play the shortest sharp on me

And if love is just a game
Then how come it's no fun?
If love is just a game
How come I've never won?
I guess maybe it's possible I might be playing it wrong
And that's why every time I roll the dice
I always come undone",2 Atoms in a Molecule

While my parents were working in town
And one morning in our school assembly
Played a cover of ""Don't Let Me Down""
The performance was nervous and awkward
But the passion was real and profound
And the kids in the audience laughing
While the band just looked at the ground

But the victory
For the kids who believe in rock and roll
I know for me
That performance lives, it never grows old

Noah and the Whale,"Oh well the world never seemed bigger
Than the summer of '98
Living out in the suburbs
Planning my escape
I grew my hair to my shoulders
Formed a band with a couple of friends
And we called ourselves The Devils Playhouse
Influences like Bruce and the band

And we'd sing and play
Simple three chord rock and roll
And miles away
The other kids would just grow old
But we're making our own way out
Yeah we're making our own way out

Well we'd practice every week in my bedroom
While my parents were working in town
And one morning in our school assembly
Played a cover of ""Don't Let Me Down""
The performance was nervous and awkward
But the passion was real and profound
And the kids in the audience laughing
While the band just looked at the ground

But the victory
For the kids who believe in rock and roll
I know for me
That performance lives, it never grows old
But we're making our own way out
Yeah we're making our own way out

Well I'd give it all back just to do it again
Yeah I'd turn back time, be with my friends
Yeah I'd give it all back just to do it again
Turn back time, be with my friends
Yeah I'd give it all back just to do it again
Turn back time and be with my friends
Yeah I'd give it all back just to do it again
Turn back time, be with my friends

Noah and the Whale,"But that's just me, before we met
But that's just me, before we met

Well I've always had a wild imagination
And a see through heart
Which I know can be, a wild combination
Like a flame forms from a spark
But don't be shy, be brave little champion
It's better to live than to hide

Well that's just me, before we met

Noah and the Whale,"Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
She's a rock 'n' roll survivor with pendulum hips
She's got deep brown eyes that've seen it all

Working at a nightclub that was called The Avenue
The bar men used to call her ""Little Lisa, Looney Tunes""
She went down on almost anyone

From the hard time living 'til the Chelsea days
From when her hair was sweet blonde 'til the day it turned gray
She said, ""L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you're going your own way""

""L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you're going your own way""

Some people wear their history like a map on their face
And Joey was an artist just living out of case
But his best work was his letters home

Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
The chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal

From the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
He'd say, ""L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you're going your own way""

""L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you're going your own way""

On my last night on Earth, I won't look to the sky
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
On my last night on Earth, I'll pay a high price
to have no regrets and be done with my life

""L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you're going your own way""

""L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you're going your own way""

Noah and the Whale,"Well he used to be somebody
And now he's someone else
Took apart his old life
Left it on the shelf
Sick of being someone
He did not admire
Took up all his old things
Set em all on fire

He's gonna change
Gonna change his ways
Gonna change
Gonna change his ways

And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven

Left his house at midnight
Resolute and young
In search of something greater
Than the person he'd become
Threw his bags on to the back
Of his run down eighties car
Headed out to god knows where
The distance is too far

He's gonna change
Gonna change his ways
Gonna change
Gonna change his ways

And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven

Noah and the Whale,"She looks out her window,
And the stars don't feel that far away,
She watches the wind blow,
Blowing all her problems away,

But then she'll ask, as she cleans up the glass,
""Is this the line?
Is this the line?
Is this the line between heaven and hell?
Is this the line where I get up and walk out?
Is this the line where you get drunk you yell?""

She fixes her make-up,
Treading lightly on the floor,
Hoping he won't wake up,
As she makes her way towards the door,

But then she'll say, as she waves him away,
""Is this the line?
Is this the line?
Is this the line between heaven and hell?
Is this the line where I get up and walk out?
Is this the line where you get drunk you yell?""

She says ""I've lived my life like a diamond,
Bright and hard like a diamond"",

Noah and the Whale,"You sit with the man who threw it all away
And you dream of the birds that have flown away,
And you hope that you won't see it fall again,

And you will sing day by day, old joy comes back to me,
You'll sing day by day, old joy comes back to me,

You say this is the life of the influence of dreams,
Tall buildings and a wife won't be enough for me,
There is more in the world to be found than dreams,

And you will sing day by day, old joy comes back to me,
You'll sing day by day, old joy comes back to me,

Forget the things that get away, forget the things that get away,
Don't dream of yesterday, don't dream of yesterday.",Old Joy
Noah and the Whale,"There's a boy with his head,
Pressed up to the window,
Of a bus heading out of town,
In his breath on the glass,
He draws with his finger,
A map of the roads they go down,
Circles of street lights,
Are the only signal,
That there's people out there in the black,
He waves goodbye, to the town he grew up in,
He knows that he'll never come back,

The night outside is five below,
His heart is pumping blood,
On his lips a perfect smile,
His eyes begin to flood,

Because tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,
Tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,


The rumble strip clack,
And the rattling frame,
Beat out a pulse on his head,
The engine hums, a humble tune,
A melody of rubber and lead,
Under lamp light glow,
And paradise stars,
An infinity of dancing white light,
He sees that his debt,
Is to experience only,
And not to those who'd plan out his life,

The night outside is five below,
The moon is in the sky,
His heart is full of perfect joy,
He whispers his goodbye,

Because tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,
Tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,

And tonight he's not gonna come back home,
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home,
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home,
Oh
Oh

Oh tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,
Tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,
Tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,
Tonight's the kind of night,
Where everything could change,",Tonight's the Kind of Night
