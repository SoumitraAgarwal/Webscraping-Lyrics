Cliff Richard,"Congratulations 
And celebrations
When I tell everyone that you're in love
With me
Congratulations
And jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be. 

Who could believe that I could be happy and
Contented
I used to think that happiness hadn't been
Invented
But that was in the bad old days before 
I met you
When I let you
Walk into my heart

Congratulations

I was afraid that maybe you thought you
Were above me
That I was only fooling myself to think you
Loved me
But then tonight you said you couldn't live
Without me
That round about me
You wanted to stay

Congratulations
Congratulations 
And jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
I want the world to know
I'm happy as can be",Congratulations

Cliff Richard,"From a distance, the world looks blue and green,
And the snow capped mountains so white.
From a distance the ocean meets the stream,
And the eagle takes to flight.
From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace,
It's the voice of every man.

From a distance, we all have enough,
And no-one is in need.
There are no guns, no bombs and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed.
For a moment we must be instruments,
Marching in a common band,
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace,
They're is the songs of every one.

God is watching us, god is watching us,
God is watching us, from a distance.

From a distance, you look like my friend,
Even though we are at war.
From a distance, i can't comprehend,
What all this war is for.
What we need is love and harmony,
Let it echo through the land.
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,
It's the heart of everyone.
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,
It's the song of everyone.

Sing out, songs of hope,
Sing out, songs of freedom,
Sing out, songs of love,
Sing out, songs of peace,

Sing out, songs of justice,
Sing out, songs of harmony,
Sing out, songs of love,
Sing out, everyone,

Sing out, songs of hope,
Sing out, songs of freedom,
Sing out, songs of love,
Sing out, songs of peace,

Sing out, songs of justice,
Sing out, songs in harmony,
Sing out, sing about love,
Sing out, everyone.
Sing out.",From a Distance
Cliff Richard,"The firt step to heaven
I will take in my life
I am not afraid when
I can hold you tight
If there must be an answer
Then there must be a prayer
And you must be the angel
When you're standing there
So I lean on you, I lean on you

My life is such a statement
Of my hopes and despairs
But nothing really matters
Just as long as you're there
You love me such honesty,
You love with no gain
You speak to me so tender
And you never explain
So I lean on you, I lean on you

My baby she cares
It's so easy to do
My baby she tells me what to do
She always tells me the truth
My baby she cares
It's so easy to do
My baby knows what I'm gonna do
That's why I lean on you

I dream of an island,
Of a fantasy place
Where I can go to sometimes
And nobody can trace
Well such is the nature,
The nature of love
That when we dream it
Sometimes means that we need love
So I lean on you, I lean on you

My baby she cares
It's so easy to do
My baby she tells me what to do
She always tells me the truth
My baby she cares
It's so easy to do
My baby knows what I'm gonna do
That's why I lean on you

So I lean on you, I lean on you
I lean on you, so I lean on you

(repeat chorus)

Cliff Richard,"The story is a famous one
Now worshipped, now dismissed
Rehearsed and trawled for meanings
That may well not exist
The demon at the story''s heart
The cuckoo in the nest
Gives so little of himself away
Which is the reason why you will stay
In case he falters, should betray
By whom or what possessed 
These are the facts of the matter
These are the names in the case
This the story, the passion
The time and the place
They''re laid here before you
So judge if you can -
The devil incarnate or
A misunderstood man 
His origins, his way of life
His motives - they''re all news
No shortage of detractors
To air their noisy views
The man inspires a thousand lies
The lover takes his choice
Remaining coldly in control
Aware that sadly, on the whole
It is the fool who bares his soul
I''ll give the man a voice! 
These are the facts of the matter
These are the names in the case
This the story, the passion
The time and the place
They''re laid here before you
So judge if you can -
The devil incarnate or
A misunderstood man",A Misunderstood Man
Cliff Richard,"Legata a un granello di sabbia

Mi vuoi lasciare, tu vuoi fuggire
Ma sola al buio tu poi mi chiamerai.

Ti voglio cullare, cullare
Posandoti su un'onda del mare, del mare
Legandoti a un granello di sabbia
Così tu nella nebbia più fuggir non potrai
E accanto a me tu resterai.

Ti voglio tenere, tenere
Legata con un raggio di sole, di sole
Così col tuo calore la nebbia svanirà
E il tuo cuore riscaldarsi potrà
E mai più freddo sentirai.

Ma tu, tu fuggirai
E nella notte ti perderai
E sola, sola
Sola nel buio
Mi chiamerai.

Ti voglio cullare, cullare
Posandoti su un onda del mare, del mare
Legandoti a un granello di sabbia
Così tu nella nebbia più fuggir non potrai
E accanto a me tu resterai.

Ti voglio tenere, tenere
Legata con un raggio di sole, di sole
Così col suo calore la nebbia svanirà
E il tuo cuore riscaldarsi potrà
E mai più freddo sentirà.

Ma tu, tu fuggirai
E nella notte ti perderai
E sola, sola
Sola nel buio
Mi chiamerai.

Ti voglio cullare, cullare
Posandoti su un onda del mare,del mare
Legandoti a un granello di sabbia
Così tu nella nebbia più fuggir non potrai
E accanto a me tu resterai,
Ai iai iai iai,
Ai iai iai iai iai.

Cliff Richard,"Like a dream, my life has gone past me
Taken so soon but love burns so true
Love never ending that shines like the stars in the sky
And I sing but so few can hear me

Words from the heart to set your souls free
Time has no distance deep in love
Know everything goes
Everyone knows there's something beyond us

There is a light believe me
Time turns into dust
Cry if you must
But love is the answer

Bringing two worlds together
Who can see the secrets that bind us?
Back to the earth 'til love rings so true
Eyes of compassion and tears of a deepening heart

I have seen the pain of a cruel world
And reached out a hand for suffering to ease
Bringing some comfort to the tears
Know everything goes

Everyone knows there's something beyond us
There is a light believe me
Time turns into dust
Cry if you must

But love is the answer
Bringing two worlds together into one
A mountain of flowers and the perfume
Floating so high

Hush and the stillness in a million minds
Know everything goes
Everyone knows there's something beyond us
There is a light believe me

Time turns into dust
Cry if you must
But love is the answer
Bringing two worlds together into one",Two Worlds
Cliff Richard,"There's two things I know for sure.
 She was sent here from heaven, and she's daddys little girl.
 As I drop to my knees by her bed at night,
 She talks to Jesus, and I close my eyes.
 And I thank God for all the joy in my life, But most of all... 
 Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.
 Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.
 ""Walk beside the pony daddy, its my first ride.""
 ""I know the cake looks funny, daddy, but I sure tried.""
 Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right.
 To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses at night. 
 Sweet sixteen today.
 she's looking like her momma a little more every day.
 One part woman, the other part girl.
 To perfume and makeup, from ribbons and curls.
 Trying her wings in a great big world. But I remember... 
 Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.
 Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.
 ""You know how much I love you daddy, but if you don't mind,
 I'm only going to kiss you on cheek this time.""
 With all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right.
 To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses at night. 
 All the precise time.
 Like the wind, the years go by.
 Precious butterfly, spread your wings and fly. 
 Shell change her name today.
 Shell make a promise, and Ill give her away.
 Standing in the bride room just staring at her.
 She asked me what I'm thinking, and I said, ""I'm not sure,
 I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl.""
 Then she leaned over... and gave me... 
 Butterfly kisses, with her mama there.
 Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.
 ""Walk me down the aisle daddy, its just about time.""
 ""Does my wedding gown look pretty daddy?"" ""Daddy don't cry.""
 With all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right.
 To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses.
 I couldn't ask God for more, man, this is what love is.
 I know I've gotta let her go, but Ill always remember.
 Every hug in the morning, and butterfly kisses...",Butterfly Kisses
Cliff Richard,"Out of time
Out of luck
Thought I was just dreamin
Then I woke up
You said it was over
The end of the line
I'm telling everybody I'm fine
But I'm just

Climbing up mount everest
I swear it's like
Crawling from here to Memphis
Knocked senseless, like
Digging a hole to china to find
You don't love me anymore

Night after night
I come home
Watch it on the news who else was overthrown
I don't understand it
As hard as I try
But I keep crossing over the great divide
And it's like

Climbing up mount everest
I swear it's like
Crawling from here to Memphis
Knocked senseless, like
Digging a hole to china to find
You don't love me anymore

Shine the light
Ring the bell
I guess you don't love me
Well, well
I'll go on
I'll survive
I don't know how but I'll try

Cliff Richard,"It was three o'clock in the afternoon, we were in a cafe
You ordered what you usually do
I looked in your eyes you looked down in that moment
What you couldn't say, baby I already knew

It's either you or me and I don't wanna be
The one who makes believe for too long

I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart

No, I don't wanna watch us fade
But how can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart

I gave all I had, everything I had needed you to give it back
Tell me was that too much to ask
Felt it on your lips, empty kisses, have a story all their own
How I wish it wasn't so

True love often dies and someone always tries
To keep it alive for too long

I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart

No, I don't wanna watch us fade
But how can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart

Lord, knows I've tried so hard standing in front of you
Knowing that this is goodbye

I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart

I don't wanna let you go
How can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart

I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart

No, I don't wanna watch us fade
But how can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart

Even if it breaks my heart, oh no
Even if it breaks my heart
I gotta walk away
Yeah, yeah it's gonna break my heart",Even If It Breaks My Heart
Cliff Richard,"Had to be
No escape, no room for doubt
No way out
Seeing you, it was easy to decide
Cut and dried
Had to be
Now we know why we exist
Don't resist, don't even think at all
Simply fall in love
This is what
Had to be

She was easy to seduce
Let her loose
In a world where the fake and shallow shine
She'll be fine
Had to be
She's a woman, nothing more
Falling for wathever comes along
She's so wrong
A fool to herself
Had to be


Don't ever tell me
How to live my life, who to love, what to do
And don't try to hold on
You are in my past I am no longer tied to you


Had to be (no-one can tell me)
For we get what we deserve (how I should live mu life)
Lose your nerver (no-one can tell me)
And the fates hustle in and take control (or take control)
Of your soul
Had to be
But the spark of hope remains
Adn sustains the echo of a smile
(sustains the echo of a smile)
For a while (no-one can tell me)
We're fools to ourselves -have to be
(no-one has told me)
We're fools (it had to be)
To ourselves
Had to be
You are the reason
I am in this world
I will be all you need
You won't come to grief now
You're my every thought, every word, and my every deed


Had to be (you are the reason)
For we get what we deserve (who I am in this world)
Lose your nerve (You are the reason)
And the fates hustle in and take control (I'll take control)
Of your soul


Had to be
But the spark of hope remains
And sustains the echo of a smile
For a while (you are the reason)
We're fools
To ourselfs - have to be (you are the reason)
We're fools (it had to be)
To ourselves

Cliff Richard,"Oh, love is the key
Love is the answer
Open your heart

Every day we read about destruction
Can't believe we do what we do
Let's take the world in a new direction
Let every step move us closer to that miracle
That's gonna spread the good news

Love is the key that opens up a new way
Love is the answer we've been searching for
Open your heart if you're looking for a miracle
The miracle is love

Everybody wants to win the wheel of fortune
Say they'll be happy when they do
People looking for their ticket to salvation
Every step should bring us closer to that miracle
We're got to spread the good news

Oh, love is the key that opens up a new way
And love is the answer we've been searching for
So open your heart if you're looking for a miracle

The miracle is to be as children, laughing
To see the goodness love brings
'Cause it's love that makes us one, oh

Love is the key
(Yeah, the key)
Love is the answer we've been searching for
Open your heart
(Open your heart)
It's a miracle, the miracle is love

Love is the key
(It's the key, it opens a new way)
Love is the answer we've been searching for
Open your heart
(You've got to be looking for a miracle)
The miracle is love

Children laughing, people caring, friendship growing
We've been searching for
[Incomprehensible]
Open your heart
(Together)
It's the miracle of love

Love is the key
Love is the answer we've been searching for
Open your heart
(Keep on laughing)
The miracle is love

Open your heart
(The miracle is love, yes)
Love is the answer we've been searching for
Open your heart, the miracle is love

Cliff Richard,"Well here I am out in my make believe world
Makin' believe I'm working
Makin' believe I've got a girl
But inside I know
I'm as real as I wanna be
What if I sailed off to the edges of the sea
Just to see the other side
Just to feel free
And to prove to myself
I'm as real as I wanna be

And even the sky
The sky can't stop me now
Even the sky
The sky can't stop me now

From now on I'm out on the wrong side of the track
Takin' a long look back
And no one can catch me
I'm as real as I wanna be
I'm packing nothing but that which belongs to me
My heart and soul
And the pieces of a dream
I'm gonna make that dream
As real as I wanna be

And even the sky
The sky can't stop me now
Even the sky
The sky can't stop me now
Cause I'm real

And what if I find hate or despair
Oh lord, what if I find nothing there
How could I last
When all that stands beside me
Is the shadow that I cast
And I may come to see the only thing that was true
Was you
Long ago back in this mystery
And I may wish that I could reach back in to pull you
Through
But you'll live on in my memory
In a tear that I will leave behind me
Cause I'm as real as I wanna be

Like I'm the only one

She puts a little bit of heaven in me
I'm so lucky to see her sweet face when I wake

That she asked me for anything

Cliff Richard,"Drawer back the curtain,
Let the sun stream in.
So tell me a story,
When you're ready, begin.

Speak of the peaceful,
The gracious, the wise.
Let the world hear our laughter,
Before it dies. 

With a beginning,
There must be an end.
What is the truth of that my friend.
From the sound of the joyous,

The gentle, the mild.
Please look out at life,
With the eyes of a child. 
From the eyes of a child,

Keep out darkness and let in light.
Let the eyes of a child,
See little things that will give him peace,
And fill his life. 

Short is the memory,
But long is the hate.
For peace on the earth,
How long must we wait?

Think of the colours,
The seasons, the sun.
Put an end to the sorrows,
That we have begun. 

From the eyes of a child,
Keep out darkness and let in light.
Let the eyes of a child,
See little things that will give him peace,

And fill his life. 
Drawer back the curtain,
The stage is all set.
And start on a story,

We'll never forget.
Tell all the hopeful,
The loving, the mild.
Then look out at life,

With the eyes of a child.",With the Eyes of a Child
Cliff Richard,"I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus]
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down.

Seasons came and changed the time
And I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
""Remember when we used to play?""

[Chorus]

Now he's gone, I don't know why
And till this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie.

Cliff Richard,"We turned water into wine but that didn't last
We were the victims of our age
Now we live on different floors
And go our separate ways
And talk behind closed doors
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

We used to sit around the fire
And whisper words the world outside would make no claim to hear
But now we talk an octave higher
In droning tones that don't relate at all to yester year
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

Do you remember when we were seventeen
We took a boat out for an hour
But we preferred the greenery to the scenery of the sea
And tied up in some cozy cove
Till harbour lights appeared across the bay

Into love and out of mind
A poet claimed that loving you has only made me blind
But love is really crystal clear
It's only when you need someone the clouds will soon appear
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart

Do you remember when laughter was the cure
For all the hard times that we knew
But we forgot to feed the fire - let it all burn down
Warmth returns to cold and poison into pain
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart",When Two Worlds Drift Apart

Won't you come on and see
I got my needs just follow me
But they gonna ease by and by

That it's no lie

You only came for forty eight hours
Didn't realize how useless I was
Came to you for the nation sells lies
Lord knows but I still feel helpless

La Gonave do you think I should
Turn my back and walk away

If I'd been at home
Would you telephone me
I'm situated across the sea
But it's a small world from any point
Of view
Spare a thought
This could have been you

You shook my senses
Took my time
Froze my feeling
Broke my mind

Cliff Richard,"I never thought there could be so much more
You picked me up when I was living
Down in Egypt
Led me out and opened up the door
When you showed me just how much you
Thought my heart ment
But I turned and walked away into
The wilderness
Now who would have guessed
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I thought I'd wandered too far away
But now I've got a brand new start
Reunion, reunion of the heart
Now I'm standing n the edge of the land
I want to go out and take all that you gave me
But I'm frightened and you understand
I failed you last time and I don't want a repeat
Still when I'm quiet again I shelter from the noise
I just hear your voice

Cliff Richard,"The same heart-the same love
On the night you began

Meant everything-the closest thing
That your heart ever had

But dreams change-change your heart
And interfere with your plans

The same heart-the same love
Are now out of my hands

When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing

When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done

Well here you go-now you're free
Free to go where you please

But when you're free-all you hear
Is your lonely heart beat

When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing

When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done

When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say

Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.

I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting

I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

Heart worn, like a ring around the moon
And your eyes are ablaze, reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life than standing still

Or running from place to place in the heat of the day
Just follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life

There beyond the horizon, there's another day
Far above the pain and fear you feel
The power and the peace, the greatest sensation of all
There is much more to life than you'll ever know, the rise and fall

There'll always be you and me, we're moving as one
So follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life

We all have our dreams, we all have our visions
But time after time, we're faced with decisions
Which road to follow? How hard to fight?
Then you wake up and see that there's much more to life

Free in acres of sky on a summer day
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart
We are never apart, reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life

So just follow your heart and you'll see
If you follow your heart you'll be free

Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore  Let me in or else I'll beat down your door  When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade  Said to myself ""you're on the wrong block""    Rushed out to your house with wings on my feet  Loved you like I'd never loved you my sweet  Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade  All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade    Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...

And the dreams that you dare to dream,  Really do come true.  Someday I'll wish upon a star,  And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  High above the chimney tops.  That's where you'll find me.  Somewhere over the rainbow,  Bluebirds fly.  They fly over the rainbow,  Why then - oh, why can't I?  I see trees of green, red roses too.  I watch them bloom for me and you.  And I think to myself,  What a wonderful world.  Well, I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white.  The brightness of day and light, darkness of night.  And I think to myself,  What a wonderful world.  The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky,  Are also on the faces of people passin' by.  I see friends shakin' hands, saying ""How do you do!""  They're really sayin' ""I love you.""  I hear babies cry and I watch them grow.  They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.  And I think to myself,  What a wonderful world.  Someday I'll wish upon a star,  And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  High above the chimney tops.  That's where you'll find me.  Somewhere over the rainbow,  Way up high.  Birds fly over the rainbow,  Why then - oh, why can't I?  Oooooo...",Let Me Be the One

I'm crossin' you in style some day.
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker.
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way.

There's such a lot of world to see.
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend.

Cliff Richard,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

I will be right here waiting for you

I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes

Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon

Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care

Lay down your swords and fight no more

To show us everyone
How to live in harmony
Together under the sun

Beyond the dark horizon
Lies a far more bountiful land
Void of all starvation
For every woman and man.

And pray to heaven above
A future lies in wait for us
A world united in love

We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
Peace on this earth

Through the valleys
Over the hills
Church bells echo their sound
Whispers travelling through the trees
Over the snow covered ground
Spread the message far and wide
So every one can hear
Home fires glow on angel wings
And banishes every tear

We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
Peace on this earth

Grant us .. one wish
No more .. pain or sorrow
Hear us .. help us
Build a new tomorrow

So reach out from the wilderness
And pray to heaven above
A future lies in wait for us
A world united in love

We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year

Is that one day there will be

No more tears or pain at Christmas
No more children living in fear

Is that one day there will be
One day there will be
One day there will be

And everything I'll ever be
Is because of you, because you're in my heart
And I'm dazzled by all that I see
By everything surrounding me
So come back, take me to where you are

Nothing I say, nothing I do
Could ever repay my debt I owe to you
You give and I receive
Here I stand, my head in a whirl
A little bit lost,
A little in awe of what you say
You have in store for me

All that I am and everything I'll ever be
Is because of you, because you're in my heart

Cliff Richard,"Looking at baby's face I saw the plight of the
Human race
Dying to survive
Shaken by the irony the anger rose inside of me
And would not, would not subside
I thought you're too young to understand
That the fate of every mortal man
Rests in someone's mortal hand tonight
In the nuclear insanity there's a death watch
On the land and sea
And I believe that we may never live our lives
We were born under the gun and just like
Every mother's son
We are hostage to the megaton and the world
Could die tonight
Under the gun, we live in fear that the end
Will come
But there's one place to run
Run to the son
Everyone can see that the hour is late
And every soul on earth got to demonstrate
Their loving if we're to survive
'Cause we're tired of living on the brink
Scared to death that our ship will sink
At the winking of an eye
This course we're on's a big mistake
'Cause we all lose in the nuclear race
It's time to show all the heads of state that we
Believe
Yes we believe that we're fighting for our lives
We were born under the gun and just like
Every mother's son
We are hostage to the megaton and the world
Could die tonight
Under the gun, we live in fear that the end
Will come
But there's one place to run
Run to the son

Pressed we're not forgotten
Millions speak, feel no fear
The mood to change is in ascendance here

I said you love me then love means you must like what I like
My music is dynamite, woh oh woh

She said, 'I'm not a girl you put on at a stand by
I am a girl who demands that her love is amplified
Switch in to overdrive, woh oh woh'

Power from the needle to the plastic
A.M, F.M I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found and I'm wired for sound

Cliff Richard,"From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man

God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man
(Every man)

It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
This is the song of every man

And God is watching us, God is watching us

Cliff Richard,"Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Took a walk and passed your house late last night
 All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
 From within the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
 Oh what a lovely couple they made
 Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
 Kisses I could almost taste, in the night
 Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouettes on the shade
 I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
 Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
 ""Let me in or else I'll beat down your door""
 Saw two strangers who had been two silhouettes on the shade
 My heart skipped a beat I was on the wrong street
 Rushed down to your house with wings on my feet
 Loved you like I've never loved you my sweet
 Vowed that you and I would be, two silhouettes on the shade
 All of our days two silhouettes on the shade

Cliff Richard,"My daddy had a 68 Camaro
When I was 16 he went out of town
There were car keys sitting on the pillow
Screaming out
""Come take a drive around""

From here to Linda's all the lights were yellow
Even though she said that we were through
When she saw me in my red Camaro
All she said was
""Let's see what she'll do""

What girl?
What tree?
What kerb?
What are you talking about?
I never left the house

What keys?
What crash?

Daddy you better move one

Monday morning he was in the kitchen
Asking if I had a tale to tell
A certain red collectable was missing
Sorry daddy
That does not ring a bell

Was very late but I agreed to join him
At the scene of the alleged theft
But there's an emptiness you can't ignore
When a stain of oil is
All that you have left

Even if they found the wreckage
Even if they hauled me in
I was sticking to the same old story
Again and again and again and again

The years have gone
There's a mark on the tree
I never could tell him
That I took the key

But my daddy doesn't know

Who bust his Camaro

Makes today seem rather sad

Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile and my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know.

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from this long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it, too
Does the feeling seem, oh, so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I just can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please, love me or I'll be gone

'Cause I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
And though you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you

I'm thinking about you're gone
What are you thinking of?
How do we go so wrong?

Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright
Beams of blue come flickering through my window pane
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Moonlight used to bathe the contours of your face
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case
The fragrance of your body rests beneath my head
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Never thought the words you said were true
Never thought you said just what you meant
Never knew how much I needed you
Never thought you'd leave until you went

Morning comes and morning goes with no regret
And evening brings the memories I can't forget
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

If I said I loved you, you'd only laugh
So each night I dream that you're mine
And wake each morning only to find
That I'm just another guy

But I just can't end this one way romance

And worship the trousers that cling to her.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Words to get off her chest.
Horizontally speaking
She's at her very best.

Thank God I can be oversexed again.

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last,

Burned a lot but learned a lot,
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic,
Life was so hard to bear,
Now my heart's antiseptic,
Since you moved out of there.

Like my mother sang to me
One with a good old-fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody

Musical demon, set your honey a-dreamin',
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune 
That is choppy you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Play for me

This one is for sure
I guess you know the score
Tired of being alone
An' I'll be coming home.

Clifford Gilberto Rhythm Combination,"I can't quite remember the month nor date
Nothing was gwan and I was jammin' round my gate
Started friending for a Jack but had no cash
I had no choice to piggy-bank or trash

It was me and my bold self with five bags of coppers
Splashed out on the counter at PJ Patel's
He's far from happy with my method of pay
I shrug my shoulders, I'm like what can you say?

It's money, ain't it? I ain't begging you jack
And mood I'm in, I might just give you a slap
I grip my Jack's and I leave in peace
As I stepped through the door he heard the kiss of my teeth

Minding my own business, rolling down the street
I swear I heard a female voice call my name
I stopped for a second loud as Charmaine
Some sis I used to park with from way back when
We weren't on no bone tip, just real good friends

We on some hug up and kiss, boy she looking neat
Head to toe in new gowns and two new gold teeth
I said, ""What you want?"" And she says, ""This and that
Well, come around my yard and let's crack this six-pack""

Back at my yard we heavy chilling, killing time
Exchanging views and getting thoughts off the mind
For three whole hours everything was cool
Around quarter to twelve they took the strangest twist

I'm looking in her face, I swear it looks off
She's sweating like she dipping in some horse's trough
Then she flips out, screaming quick, I hit a last
Trying to kick this brown but it's busting my arse

Seems like the planet gone mad
What you staring in my face for?
I told you dudes, I can't save ya
What the frigg is with this strange behavior?
Strange behavior

Charmaine the headstrong, proud Miss Missy
Fell for the local fluff dealer, she were living the high life
Sitting in the luxury's lap
Little did she know she were braving a trap

'Cause the thug that she loved was a two-bit thug
The notes that she speed with were dripping blood
She were mesmerized by the rude boy charm
Two years had passed, she thought she's safe from harm

But the past has strange way of rearing its head
Just when she think it were dusted and dead
It's like petrol bombs come flying through the window
'Cause there's a ten grand price on his life

Ready to be cashed when his heartbeat ceases
All that he tried, he can't get no peace
Cause he's running from the beast, running from the crims
After all's said and done it's the beast that wins

Whyil in on borrowed time, soon to get nabbed
Two keys of fluff that he just did grab
When her man got nicked, Lord knows she couldn't cope
Started hitting the bottle, started tying the rope

Now she's trapped in the chains of the oldest trade
Flashing her vag' in my face and I'm far from keen
I don't want got business with no drugsman's queen
Nahmean?

Seems like the planet gone mad
What you staring in my face for?
I told you dudes, I can't save ya
What the frigg is with this strange behavior?

But now I've chosen aeroplanes and boats to come between us
And a line or two on paper wouldn't go amiss
How is Worcestershire? Is it still the same between us?
Do you still use television to send you fast asleep?
Can you last another week? Does the cistern still leak?
Or have you found a man to mend it?
Oh, and by the way, how's your broken heart?
Is that mended too? I miss you
I miss you, I really do.

I've been reading Browning, Keats and William Wordsworth
And they all seem to be saying the same thing for me
Well I like the words they use, and I like the way they use them
You know, Home Thoughts From Abroad is such a beautiful poem
And I know how Robert Browning must have felt
'Cause I'm feeling the same way about you
Wondering what you're doing and if you need some help
Do I still occupy your mind? Am I being so unkind?
Do you find it very lonely, or have you found someone to laugh with?
Oh, and by the way, are you laughing now?
'Cause I'm not, I miss you
I miss you, I really do.

I really do.",Homethoughts from Abroad

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.

Now from that lonely wilderness I've been lifted.
Your love like a river is flowing
Rush over me
Like the seven seas keep rolling.
Your love like a river is growing
Deep inside of me I can feel it overflowing
Your love like a river.
Now I know I've just been wasting time
A desperate man whose soul was slowly dying.
And the healing power I needed then was in your touch
You've changed my life
You've given me so much.
My days were dark as nights
There was no way out in sight
Now from that cold and shallow life I've been lifted.
Your love like a river is flowing
...
Roll me on and on
I'm drawn to you
Can't help myself
Roll me on and on
Roll me on and on
Before I came to you -
May days were dark as nights
There was no way out in sight
Now from that cold and shallow life I've been lifted.
Your love like a river is flowing
...
Your love like a river is flowing

But the lessons just go on and on
I guess we're gonna have to wait for all the pages to turn

Find my cowboy boots, my button down
Strap my timepiece on my arm

Still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pickup truck
That the same old bank still owns

I'm not the guy they've known

Just food for the brain

It's not always the best ones come and stay

Notes on napkins and business cards
Describe the days events and go on home

And it's likely they won't drown
The price goes up and one more round
They close up all the bars downtown
As the singer plays one last rip roaring song

It seems like the same old motions every night
He wants to hear a golden oldie to take him back
And I'll play out all the emotions I can't fight
Relieve the tensions and hope they're on the right track

Clint Black,"Ridin' against the wind in East New Mexico
His skin is dry and worn as the Texas plains
He's headed where the air is thin and and the cold blue northers blow
Up through the Raton Pass but he'll have to beat the early snow

The winter of '64 was a great many years ago
When a young man went away for the rebel cause
And he was branded by the war and the only life he'd know
Was lookin' over his shoulder saddle bound and layin' low

Now there's a man on the goodnight-loving
Like too many other men out on the trail
Who found the hard way when the pushing comes to shoving
He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jail

Now there's a place just north of here where they say the outlaws go
Where a man can leave his name and past behind
And every now and then you'll hear, he's gone the way of the buffalo
And that he finally made the pass but he didn't beat the early snow

Now there's a man on the goodnight-loving
Like too many other men out on the trail
Who found the hard way when the pushing comes to shoving

And the changing tide I know
Won't bring me back to yesterday

Come take you away.

When your ship comes in I know its time to go
And the waves along the seawall
Tell me nothings here to stay
And no man is an island but I'm still all alone.

That muddy water keeps on rollin'
Like the buffalo, she keeps movin' on

Like the water rollin' out with the tide

Just which ever way she flows

And a dream he's got to lose

To right back to where I started from

Clint Black,"I think I'll go back down to New Orleans
Try to bury my travelin' bone

I guess me and the neighbors will see
If the one thing that I couldn't do without her
She couldn't do without me

Could I leave her behind, go on losin' my mind
While the good times continue to roll
With this time on my hands, I can change all my plans
And it really wouldn't bother a soul
I can make all the rounds, paint all the towns
Do all that and more on my own
But a man can't survive on happiness alone

Take a good look around, this is New Orleans
A free wheeler's got to feel right at home
But it's a hell of a leap, whether shallow or deep
That old river's gonna keep movin' on
Like that muddy Mississippi, she keeps pullin' me under
When you're in it, nothin' ever seems clear
I could stand on the bank just toss in my line
But there's way too many fish around here

Could I leave 'em behind for the one on the line

Without her, you'd see a different man

And when everything is dark, she finds the light
And when it's time to fly, she's flying with me
With her on the wing, we balance out just right

I'm looking for Christmas, I've gotta find
Christmas, flying back in my mind
Does anyone know of this Christmas, a long ago christmas
Sleigh bells ringing, carolers singing
Only bringing the long traveled message of love

[Verse two]
I'm looking for Christmas, in time for this
Christmas, a day far and away
And could a star show me Christmas,
The town of old Christmas
Where truth is ringing, a virgin's
Bringing the newborn king and the
Lord's own messiah of love

[Chorus one]
And I close my eyes and I'm kneeling there in the stall,
And could I be the wine man, sharing his wisdom,
Creating a kingdom for all
Verse three
I'm looking for Christmas, I know I'll find Christmas
Imparted right from the start
And everyone knows of this Christmas
The very first Christmas
Where Christ is guiding, all with tidings
Still his light is residing here in us all

[Chorus two]
And I close my eyes, and a thousand lifetimes recall
Aren't we all wise magi, sharing his wisdom,
Creating a kingdom
As born on this Christmas and each Christmas day
We are sharing his wisdom creating a kingdom
As born on this Christmas and each
Christmas day that shall fall",Looking for Christmas (Reprise)
Clint Black,"There's no telling how far a kiss'll go
Wish on the highest star that this'll go
On right here where we are under the mistletoe
On christmas night, it seems so right

That a lovely holiday dish made a mess of me
If love is this, it's my favourite recipe
The kind that fits to remind the rest of me
There's room to grow, under the mistletoe

But I made this ""mist"" as a christmas wannabe
With a christmas list that insists I've gotta be
Hugged and kissed by this sweet miss in front of me
On christmas night and every night

Just right here, in the doorway where they found us
They'd like to leave but there's no way around us
I believe there's a spell that bound us
I've gotta know, is it only the mistletoe

Gotta know, I'm afraid to go
Don't want out if we're in the throes
Flames die out in the afterglow
And I've gotta know, is it only the mistletoe

Don't think so
Gotta know, I'm afraid to go
Don't want out if we're in the throes

Til I'm sure those eyes won't cry.

That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye.

There's no good when your the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come.
And in my goodbye you're finding none.

I'm still bound to leave you,
I surely don't know how.

What my mind says should happen now.

I don't know where we'll go from here,
There may be no way to fly.
And the cloud I'm in just makes it all to clear

When you find another friend who'll light your candle up again
You can burn one down for me
So you don't matter anymore
I'll convince myself, I'm sure

But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
But it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you can't get

Oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
And you're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away

I've been too long overdue, now I'm gonna shoot the moon

I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line

I've been to the table, and I've lost it all before
I'm willin' and able, always comin' back for more

One who couldn't live to see another day
Hard times seem to have the corner on you
But you can rise from the ashes too

When I'm on my knees and everything has gotten me beat
And even I believe I'm never gonna find my feet
Two ways you can go you can ask anybody around
One man's half way up is another man's half way down

Now you may decide it's a losing game
Even in your stride you're gonna call it lame
Getting one leg up when it's said and done
Is the hardest part no matter how you run

If you can walk away from a crash and burn
You'll appreciate every step you earn
And if you feel the ground is gaining on you

Thinkin' back when things went my way and not the road I'm on

I can always make it through on a wing and a prayer and a song

Like snake bite cure from the medicine man
Not bad poison if there's something to soothe
It's a whole other world in the palm of your hand

Out of this world and out of your mind
Just like it don't matter what you're leaving behind
Trying to change your life you change your point of view
But no matter what you do it's the same old you

Wherever you go there you are
You can run from yourself but you won't get far
You can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar
But wherever you go there you are

Bottle of scotch whiskey whatever you find
When you're out on a wire it's a matter of time
Changing every moment when you're taking the fall
There's everything to gain when you're losing it all
Feel your head spinning with your feet on the ground
You climb the wrong ladder and it's keeping you down
Think you're gettin' higher but you're still layin' low
And you don't want to be anyone you know

Wherever you go there you are
You can run from yourself but you won't get far
You can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar
But wherever you go there you are

It's a part of the plan all that's on your mind
Think that it'll help you find somebody to be

Clint Black,"Blue Kentucky highway, headin' for the line
She hadn't said a word all night,
But the wheels are turnin' in her mind
Now I was ridin' shotgun,
And I knew things had gone awry
Just as soon as she dropped me off
At the side of the road
And she let that gravel fly

Now I'm walkin' in the moonlight,
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights
I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right,
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely
As the highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

Was it somethin' that I did to her,
Or the things I never said
I wonder if the way we were was only in my head
Now if I even make it back to town
Before the sun comes up
I'm gonna hit every parking spot around
'Til I find that pick-up truck

Now I'm talkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights
I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely
As a highway's ever been
Stuck here with my thumb out in the wind
Well I'll bet right now she's laughin'
At how she brought me to my knees
But she won't be laughin' half as loud
When she gives me back my keys

She'll be walkin' in the moonlight,
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights
She won't ever see again
She hit me with a left and right
And with nothin' but the taillights
And I know that's about as lonely
As a highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind
There she goes, here I come",Nothin' But the Taillights
Clint Black,"Long ago with a younger partner
Always in love, but a love for sure
Their hearts were lost out in the shuffle
Of a hook & wing on a sawdust floor

Now they hold their own out on the liners
They're always prime for something slow
And you won't find them changin' partners
Love will keep in step, keepin' up with a country set
It's our kind of love I'll bet they're together everywhere they go

Now they're on in years, they don't need a reason
All the lights are on for the same old thing
When they call, ""Let's dance"", their song will still be playin'
Till the end of time their love'll be in full swing

I can see that picture in my head
I still believe the words we said
Forever will ring true
Love is certain, love is kind
Love is yours and love is mine

It's something that we do
It's holding tight, lettin' go
It's flying high and laying low
Let your strongest feelings show
And your weakness, too
It's a little and a lot to ask
An endless and a welcome task
Love isn't something that we have
It's something that we do
We help to make each other all that we can be
Though we can find our strength and inspiration independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that you can't tell where I end and where you start
It gives me heart remembering how
We started with a simple vow
There's so much to look back on now
Still it feels brand-new
We're on a road that has no end
And each day we begin again
Love's not just something that we're in
It's something that we do

Clint Black,"Communications are down, all over town,
People tryin' to get through, some will never get an answer.
But I've already found, the way to get through to you,
It comes in gentle and clear, I'm still the same romancer.
And you know what I'm thinkin' if I have to tell you myself.
I can never let you wonder what I want you to believe.
And there isn't any wonderin' how lucky I am,
From the smile that I'm wearin' and the heart out on my sleeve.

Everybody thinks they know me,
I don't doubt that it's true.
I've never been one to put up any walls.
There's so much of me they'll never know,
Not the way you do:
When it comes to me, you know it all.

I've seen all of the signs and all the changing of minds,
And the signals getting crossed, and the killing seeds are planted.
But those could never grow out of things that we know.
Like the vows that we made, we can always take for granted.
While everyone else is losing ground, you know ehre I stand,
Forsaking everyone but you to reap the love that we sowed.
One thing everyone knows is I'm a man of my word,
And you and I have places I will never let them go.

While, everybody thinks they know me,
I don't doubt that it's true.
I've never been one to put up any walls.
There's so much of me they'll never know,
Not the way you do:
When it comes to me, you know it all.

My life has been an open book 'til you walked in,
And turned a page I never saw.
You found a side of me that even I could never see.
When it comes to me, you know it all.

Still, everybody thinks they know me,
I don't doubt that it's true.
'cause I'm still not one to put up many walls.

 Tell me there's something more

 Can't explain, there's something strange about the early fall

Everything seems upside down and right side wrong

While a part of me is here and won't like leaving
The rest of me the best of me is gone

And Willie would stop and just to say hello

You got no reason to be happy Mr Time
And Willie would stop and just pop his rag

And things seem hard or tough,
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,

And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,

Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,
In all of the directions it can whiz;
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth;
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!",Galaxy Song

Clint Black,"The memories and emotions that I've been through
Are things I can't unlearn
But I won't go on standing on the bridges
You've tried so hard to burn
I can't put those fires out and let somebody in
If everything my life's about is who we might've been
Till we forget the love we lost we won't remember
How to love again

That's who I use to be holding onto nothing
Giving everything I use to be to belong to someone
That I know is who I use to see when I looked at you
You were never I use to be and I'm not who I use to be

Coming to my senses now I'm feeling things
I thought I couldn't feel
I don't take for granted if it feels like love
It must not be real
I still find myself out on some bridges now and then
I'm stuck out in the middle trying to reach the other end
But I'm through holding back the flames
To show somebody how to love again

That's who I use to be holding onto nothing
Giving everything I use to be to belong to someone
That I know is who I use to see when I looked at you

More won't find a way

You know it's easy for me to say

Quiet and loud
Alone in a crowd
I love you
In a thousand little ways

Leaves nothing to explain

Clint Black,"There's every kind of definition
But it's something you can't put your finger on
There's a constant exhibition
You explore the propositions then you're gone

It's either money or love that's in your catch
Seldom those two ever match
And then lines will all be blurred before too long

Now there's a slight deception
As you look for all the reasons not to run
And without any exception
Every possible exemption can be done

It's either money or love you're digging for
Seldom love is valued more
But only love can tell you who's the one

There's a lot you can do with money, sometimes
It seems like a blessing from above
In the day you might be shopping
But in the nighttime, you better make sure it's love

To get your satisfaction
You might take any guarantee that comes along
But without the main attraction
It's merely a distraction then again you're gone

It's either money or love you place your bet
Which is which you'll soon forget
And you tender your regrets and just move on

There's a lot you can do with money, sometimes
It seems like a blessing from above
In the day you might be shopping
But in the nighttime, you better make sure it's love

Money or love, you better make sure
Money or love, you better make sure it's love",Money or Love [#]
Clint Black,"Next to Louisiana on the Texas side,
There's a little country joint where they let it ride.
There's a boogie woogie man on the piano,
An' all the backwoods boppers shoutin' ""Go cat, go.""

They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
So don't you,
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man.

Grandpa's in the corner in his fishing clothes,
Reelin' to the rhythm everywhere it goes.
All the boogie woogie babies tearing up the floor.
When they get a little bit, they want a little more.

They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
So don't you,
Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man.

In a red El Dorado, at the break of day,
That Boogie Woogie man'll be slipping away.
Although you're never gonna know it when he's out of sight,
He'll shut a juke box down again tomorrow night.

He's never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
It works for me, it'll work for you,
He'll have you doin' things that you didn't know you knew.

Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man, no.",The Boogie Man
Clint Black,"Everything I need all depends on you
Everything I want is everything you do
It's been handed down through time
It's really nothing new
Boy meets girl, I meet you
A love song that could never be untrue

All I need is everything I want
It's a fundamental greed
All I need is everything you flaunt
That's a language I can read
All I need is everything I want
And that makes you everything I need

Everything I need is on my one-track mind
Everything I want is where I draw the line
I'll take all you've got to give
Spend up all your precious time
You can't undo the ties that bind
Or hide the moon that needs the sun to shine

Everything I need can't get it on TV
Everything I need is absolutely free
Everything I need is pure biology
That will bring me to my bended knee
My craving you will sweetly torture me

Clint Black,"How many lovers counted all the stars in the sky?
Thanking each and every one for their one and only one
How many saw the heavens there in each others eyes?
Knowing they were meant to be
Just like you and me

It's so hard to imagine anyone loved like this before
Through the ages all the poets said it's true
That a heart could surely die without the love its living for
I know every part of my heart is living for you

How many loves never see the world going by?
All the days seem to float, the seasons come and go
How many grow together never really needing to try?
It's something they already know
As if it happened long ago

It's so hard to imagine anyone loved like this before
Once in a lifetime's here and now
If they ever find what we have the whole world will be sure
If they ever get it perfect, it's you and I that showed em how

There's no denying no one ever loved like this before
It's something surely anyone can see
Though there may have been the perfect love so many times before
Who knew they'd always be together
Just like you and me

How many saw the heavens there in each other's eyes?
Knowing they were meant to be
Just like you and me",Just Like You and Me
Clint Black,"Tiny pieces of my heart
Like confetti everywhere
Hidden sorrows in the dark
You can feel it in the air
The spotlight finds me
I can no longer hide my frown
Say hello to a lover's clown

Distorted mirror images 
Turn the good to bad
If that's not the way it is
Why am I so sad?
Strangers laughter is the only sound
Silence from a lover's clown

Girl that's me everybody's laughing at
With a big red nose and the tears and the silly act
Comedy, tragedy, reality
It all plays the same
If you don't want me

Tumbling from the high wire
Without a net
You're saying I'll stop falling for you
But I haven't yet
The spotlight dims and the bigtop's coming down
Curtains o'er the lover's clown

Girl, that's me everybodies laughing at
With a big red nose and the tears and the silly act
Comedy, tragedy, reality
It all plays the same
If you don't want me

Tiny peices of my heart
Scattered everywhere
Like a fool I played my part
But you were never really there

You can say goodbye to a lover's clown
Say goodbye",A Lover's Clown
Clint Black,"Now I'm not talking tough, telling the truth ought to be enough
I've had my share on the darker side
Sitting and starring at a TV screen, racking my brain over all the things
If I'd just been there I could have tried
Things to do I can't help but think of more
I could fill my life without ever leaving home
I could see the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World
And even build a few more of my own (If I had a mind to)

Quit my job never mind the pay, maybe go figure out the CIA
Chase the paper and pass the bar, show Iaccoca how to build a car
Jump up and run a three minute mile, sit around and watch my baby smile
That's what I might do , if I had a mind to

No, I don't want to blow my horn, no telling how many souls I've worn
And what kind of shoes, when I had shoes
I'm still losing a bridge or two, but the troubled water's gonna run on through
You can't always win, but you can always lose
But I don't turn my head for things that pass me by
And I'm gonna have a look around 
I could gather all the diamonds in the sky
Hold every one and never leave the ground, If I had a mind to

Fly through the eye of a hurricane, freeze my body like David Blaine
Be the first to find life on Mars, go up and sell a few candy bars
Climb a rainbow and kiss the sun, walk on the moon when the day is done
That's what I might do, If I had a mind to
Somewhere someone's doing everything I've said
I don't have to do anything, I could do it in my head
If I had mind to

Sail away and be Jacques Cousteau, or the Crocodile hunter on a TV show
Be the king of the one night stand, front the Coral Reefer Band
Ski Colorado where there ain't no snow, plant a tree and watch it grow
That what I might do
Go out and buy me a suit and tie, go to work everyday and be a regular guy
Smoking big cigars all day, be the President of the USA
Get a tattoo and bleach my hair, open a window and breathe the air
That's what I might do, if I had a mind to",A Mind To
Clint Black,"Standing there with her arms around no one
No one who'd die for her right where he stands
Looking around like she's looking for someone
Looking like she's got time on her hands
Funny how much you can see in someone
Across the room who you don't even know
Telling you things she would tell to no one
Taking you places she's wanted to go

Like a walk in the rain, a place in the sun
With a lifetime of love that has only begun
Doing all of the things only lovers can do
My imagination is running away with you

Walking away and I'm walking beside her
Into forever here in my mind
Dreaming a dream that we're dreaming together
Finding the things only lovers can find

Like a walk on the moon, a dance in the stars
With a love light that finds us wherever we are
And our own happy ending will always come true
My imagination is running away with you

As fast as I can running straight to your heart
Where the fantasy ends and reality starts
'Til I stop believing that dreaming is all I can do
And the fantasy might even come true
My imagination, it's only my imagination running away with you",My Imagination
Clint Black,"When I think about the time that I sat crying in my beer
Jukebox pounding misery from ear to ear
I know I'd tell myself I'm better off without you here
But I'm looking for beginnings when the end is always near

She's leavin' in the morning sing a sad song for me
Keeping me in the dark don't know how long it will be
But I've heard that tune before she says she's gotta be free
But I know that's not true and that's what's bothering me

Anywhere you look it's everywhere and all around 
It's the blues they keep singing lord and it's bound to get you down
But the melody can move you in a way to ease the pain
And it won't be long before you're on your feet again
I'd be alright if she'd just make up her mind
I don't know why but I forgive her time after time",She's Leavin'
Clint Black,"How can we know how far,
The long way can be?
Looking from where we are,
It never seemed that long to me.
I've many miles behind me,
Maybe not so much ahead.
It seems I made good time,
With the directions I misread.

So I'm gonna spend my time,
Like it's going out of style.
I'm moving the bottom line,
Farther than a country mile.
I still have hills to climb,
Before I hit that wall.
No matter how much time I buy,
I can never spend it all.

Funny thing, that time:
We're always running out.
I'm always losing mine,
There's not enough of it about.
An' though it's always here,
It will always come and go.
The days become the years,
That'll be gone before you know.

So I'm gonna spend my time,
Like it's going out of style.
I'm moving the bottom line,
Better than a country mile.
I still have hills to climb,
Before I hit that wall.
I won't go quietly into that dark night.
There'll be no more burnin' daylight.
I'll be living in,
Every moment that I'm in.

Oh,I'm gonna spend my time,
Like it's going out of style.
I'll only use what's mine,
I've been savin' for a while.

The song went to my head where I can't forget to love ya
And I'll probably go insane about that old refrain
Though my heart is not that strong
It keeps beating right along
With the familiar drinkin' song

Whiskey bottle with some melody
Just rolls of the tongue for me, I know 'em all
When I mix gin and misery
I know I'll be the last to see me when I fall

Whiskey bottle with some melody
Just rolls of the tongue for me, I know 'em all
When I mix gin and misery
I know I'll be the last to see me when I fall
And I have to crawl

Still I'm thinkin' of ya
And my heart aches, I can't clear my head
And my thoughts won't rise above ya
And I've had all I can take
There's no more heart to break
Though I always get it wrong
Gonna have to sing along

But I'll be lookin' for the rain
Wells run dry, there's only dirt to turn
If things go broke tomorrow
But it goes against my grain
And I'm plowin' down a row of no return

There's just too much rock in this country
Too many lessons to learn
'Til that harvest moon smiles down on me
There's just too many stones to overturn

Now I'm gonna put this hoe down
And pick up my guitar
Plant some seeds down on Music Row
But it seems that old town is a lot like on the farm
I keep plantin', nothin' ever seems to grow

There's just too much rock in this country
Too many lessons to learn
'Til that harvest moon smiles down on me
There's just too many stones to overturn

Now I've heard it said to make a livin' like that
Will take more than flesh and bone
As a matter of fact to wear that hat

Clint Black,"Given up on traveling'
It's driving me insane
Riding alone on a midnight train

Now a mind can wonder and that's far from being free
'Cause when that lonesome sunset whistle blows
This is where I'll be

I hopped a westbound for San Antone
From there to Santa Fe
And It's a thousand miles from there to home
And there's a thousand things to say

About a man bound to ramble
And a dream he's got to lose
That'll break this fever set him free
And bring him home to you

Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try

There'll be nobody waiting
My goodbyes are too long gone
From that moment at the station
When I left from right to wrong

But now I finally nearly made it
It was a long uphill climb
To right back to where I started from
But I think I can this time

Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try

Somewhere I slipped off track
I was thinking I could fly
But there never was a train
That couldn't try

Clint Eastwood,"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like pedals when we part.

I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you taught how to cry.

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through,
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you,
I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart",Bouquet of Roses
Clint Eastwood,"Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom
That's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Scrape up the most you can
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today

Any stamps today?
We'll be blessed
If we all invest
In the U.S.A.
Here comes the freedom man
Can't make tomorrow's plan
Not unless you buy a share of freedom today

The tall man with the high hat and the whiskers on his chin
Will soon be knocking at your door and you ought to be in
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
Get your savings out when you hear him shout ""Any bonds today?""

Any bonds today?
Bonds of freedom
That's what I'm selling
Any bonds today?
Scrape up the most you can
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today

Any bonds today?
All you give
Will be spent to live
In the Yankee way
Scrape up the most you can
Here comes the freedom man
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today

Won't you buy some bonds?

Can't make tomorrow's plan

But to tell you the truth, I'll be lonely
I don't mind being lonely
When my heart tells me you are lonely, too

I'll walk alone
They'll ask me why and I'll tell them I'd rather
There are dreams I must gather
Dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight

I'll always be near you wherever you are each night
In every prayer
If you call I'll hear you, no matter how far
Just close your eyes and I'll be there

Please walk alone
And send your love and your kisses to guide me
Till you're walking beside me
I'll walk alone

I'll always be near you wherever you are each night
In every prayer
If you call I'll hear you, no matter how far
Just close your eyes and I'll be there

Clint Holmes,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow [DVD]

Clinton Ford,"When I was a lad
And old shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hold
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

for ol shep he knew he was going to go
for he reached down and licked at my hand
then he looked up at me just as much as to say
we're parting but i understand

Old shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep

Someday whenever the spring breaks through

Captured on canvas
Alone in the portrait I would stand

And brush strokes bold
Yet soft as a whisper

Caught in the still life
Surrounded by shadows
Or lost in a background of blue

If I were a painting
My price would be pain
And the artist would have to be you

I imagine the colors
Would all run together
If you ever allowed me to cry

So don't paint the tears
Just let me remember me
Without you in my life

That holds me together

And you wouldn't be breaking my heart",If I Were a Painting

I'll be satisfied as long as you keep me
Wrapped tightly in the arms of love

The arms of love are all I need around me
But I don't know what I'd do if you should go

Keep the five for ya, the ruggedest chick
Spread shit like Tom Sawyer, bitch Will Smith
Be I the Fresh Princess, rulin shit run things
Your efforts is senseless, Hariett Thus
Ridin rare breed, fuck buyin a jar
I smoke the engineer weed motherfucker
Bitch got stuck in Wells Fargo, Brick City hooligan
Squattin at the car show - couldn't be a girly girl
if I tried; crazy slave to the live
But I'm still fly, love four by fours
Cause they ride like a toy, steady jumpin the curb
Pedestrians like ""oh boy"" I can sing, rap DJ
Work the instant replay
""Even though I'm slurrin my voice"" like I was Freeway
Get it right 'cause-o, I keep the rhymes runnin
Kind of terror FBI don't even see comin, motherfuckers

[Verse Three: Rampage]
Ashes is ashes and dust to dust
why'all see the low Ro', why'all ain't fuckin with us
Rampage nigga, I'm a sick man
Chop you in your face, cut off both of your hands
Wrap your body up, put it in a sedan
Drop yo' ass in a river, this is how I deliver
Got the maggots just eatin your liver, untold mystery
Your name is Swany River, you not a legend
Youse one dead nigga, six feet under
Never comin back, one year later
This is real facts (yeah) tell the feds
just to back up off me
Keep eatin donuts and drinkin that coffee
They say they know my M.O. from Philly to Milwaukee
Got my house tapped with the walkie talkies, shit
I'm just a victim in this case
My lawyer's good, so get the FUCK out my face

Aiy, I'm dealing with some shit homey, it's in the back of my head
And it's some shit homey, but I just rap it instead
See I got wolverine bones in me
But the whole world is throwin' stones at me like they all gotta bone with me
Got a child's mother, and I hate her to death
But that's my child's mother, so that's my mate to the death
That's why how I love her for puttin' little me here
And me and huck'll beef forever, she gon still be there
And there's some other niggaz, I just a character role
Be they some other niggaz, now let's get back to the song
I got a drug problem, but I ain't tell the truth
Because I got enough problems
And my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to PCP and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately, but nobody understands
That I'm depressed lately, I'm sorta feeling repressed lately
But y'all been hearin' and seein' me less lately
Like it's anyone noticed the redress lately
Look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
Seem disturbed, a lot of repress lately
I got a company that I'm signed to
But they ain't in my company, when all I need is some company
When I start feelin' like everybody's done with me
I tryna see what everybody want with me
Then the mistress, yeah, the girl from ten minutes it's hard
Now I'm needing ten minutes from heart
I can't get into it, but I want y'all to know
That I'll get into it, but I'll save that for the growth
Then it's rap beef, but I'm so secure with me
It's only rap beef, I don't need se-see you-rity (never)
Want to get at me, want to go to war with me
That's just one phone call for me
Check the shit, I got a whole hood, that don't appreciate
It's not the whole hood that appreciates me
What you gon' tell me, when it's the streets that made me
And I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me
And then it's rap critics, they say all I make dance music
But there almost anything you can dance to it
They ain't like the single, so they ain't copped that album
Wouldn't give a chance to it, not a second glance to it
They say he wines to much, he's too bitter
They call it complaining, I call it explaining
I know 'em niggaz cooked it, caught up in the gaming
Lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment
Some shit with me, a dude's been knew that
But I'm gambling a lot and I ain't used to do that
Rap ain't payin' the bills, it's mo money mo problems
Or it's no money mo problems
All enormous when you play at these stakes
That's how it feels to have a warrant on a famous face
Then the album's pushed back, cause they say he needs a single at the moment
But what he needs is a single moment
Then I'm involved in the 'he say she say (that)
Send my mind on replay, each day
Then it's the bullshit that she save he's gave
Cause she wouldn't like to think that he ain't like her
Just cause she was throwing it at me and I ain't touch her
She'll say anything psych, but I ain't want to fuck her
I don't feel good, so I won't want to go to a club
Don't want to go to a lounge, just want to lounge
Then the same sweater that I had on for days
The same t I had on for a week what I got on, it speaks
What I got on, it reeks
No shape up, chilling, cause that's just how I'm feeling
And one day at a time, it's god willing
Tryna see scrape but the fall keeps building
Post start raising, the booze starting that gate me
But I gotta be a king cause this wolve's tryna play me
Goodie when it's hot like it's freezing winter
Bed start, eating sleep for dinner
Then it's hard tryna keep this in ya
So I write it all down, so one day maybe when life is all sweet I remember
Then it's probation, I know we all go through it
We call it probation, but there's no pro to it
Yeah my soul's aching, only a few peers know
Funny thing about the case is it's a few years old
Had some shit going on with my ohh, that felt good but it's bad
So I'm sitting here like what the bitch had
It's not rap it's real, look scrappy it's true
Going what's popping, do he look happy to you
Now if it goes to the wire, go the soul of a fighter
Bruised up and sloppy, a damaged like Ali
Up late talking to the fans on a website
That's the only thing that send yo man off to bed right
Fuck the world fuck my moms and my girl

Well maybe not mom, just let me remain calm
This too won't last, this too shall pass
At least that's what I say y'all, that's what I pray for
And I'm the only thing that's standing in my way y'all
But I gotta be with me, it's no escape y'all
I guess depression just stepped in, and took over shit like it's known to do
Guess it said, hey Joe, I'm going home with you
Turn your phone off, I need to be alone with you
I need to be in the zone with you
Cause I'm the only thing why've grown to, nigga
Look, I own you, nigga
Been with you since ten, but you starting to confuse me
Cause it's been so long and you still tryna lose me
Like how could you show me such cruelty
When everybody turns their back on you, Joe it's you and me
Still you don't want me to see you right
And why you always come get me, how we re-unite
Huh, I know you feel for me deep in your heart
Doctors, meetings, pills couldn't keep us apart
What, now, you got a deal and you want to get rid of me
We roommates, I'm in your head, Joe you live with me
So I don't write for the fans, nah, I write to my man
And hope that he'll just leave and understand
Like, like please leave the kid in peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace
Just leave for a second, man it's been too long, and I can't troop it
And as long as you around I can't make that dance music

Breathe again, the breeze is full of trees again
The beast buried under the streets is ‘bout to

Cooking up wishes and powder, flour the pan and the cake
He can bet that the cheddar stay in the refrigerator
To keep it fresh until it's on
Every day is preparation for armageddon
A holocaust, any cost, you want to get on one or on two
Get three stacks and bring it back to the fortress
Wrapping five fingers 'round that much cash will make a motherfucker Cassius Clay
Quick, the cash is pay, checking gas with a loaded fo-fo when he rollin'
Po-po on his shoulder so he's slow but he's goin', wouldn't you?
If you scared, say you scared, cause they comin' through sweepin'
And nobody got a problem sweepin' over you
Trust the shadows is thick, full of mattresses, get a passer to suck a dick
Skinner glass, killer fashion, and spinning back
So quit backspinning and get a gat
Fuck a battle rap, rappers will battle where they at
Trunk rattle is leaving the streets and probably eating the map
Versus verses, the hearses, Versace verses the nerves and the pain
Slang, it seems it's a no-brainer the same folks sayin' it ain't
Are the same folk that never seen a caddy-driven candy paint

Money is good when it's coming from behind prison walls for someone who need to get off
Plus it'll probably be the nine to five and there is time to be outside instead of sitting at a desk and making calls
And for anyone to stay alive up in the jungle you should probably figure out a way to carry no remorse at all
All day long it is bombs over Baghdad
Right in the backyard no service no draft
No reason to go out
But it's no reason to stay in

And your neighbours bumping Black Flag
Tired of living like this but not ready to die
Cause he isn't notorious yet
Everyone wants to be somebody know for doing something people call glorious, yes
So he keep it pushing through the blood and the gunning down of all the people that he knew and loved to just run out of time
And the mantra that is bumping on the Walkman in the pocket probably something that's synonymous to money on the mind

And the cost of living is the life you living
And the life you living is the nicest giving

Parents just don't understand, apparently always talking to Jesus, please
The only God here is the Jesus piece they rocking like hipsters rock Jeezy tees, ironic

Stop all the thinking, instincts is how you kill a giant
They might stocking up rubbers and robbing prisons for taxes
Death and that shit
Everyone trying to be the king of this landfill
Probably get just a hill of bodies, you stand still, you cancelled
So no settling down, they hit the pedal
The pen, and then pawn your metal

No landing, geared up for arrival, nowhere to arrive to
The subject seems upset by that to which he is subjected
But convinced he brought it on himself
That's why he roll with a bible on the console
Inconsolable, no consolation, no cancellation
Not turning all keys, he puts the ship through paces
And paces the halls, pacing is madness
Patience is virtuous, patient of these observations
It was all a dream, he poses by the lift outside the mezzanine
Like a photo in a magazine
And always keeps the weapons' magazines clean
Paranoia prone, he babbles beautifully
Of Babylon and enemies and foes
And forgoing food sustains himself on anger
A danger to himself and others but there are no others
So the danger clear and present is presented as
The gift of freedom wrapped in days of rapping to himself
Until his vocal cords collapse, he's in the galley screaming

He shouts at the dark, stands back
Counting the seconds before his voice returns

No more cracks in the hull
The small crack in the skull healed up quickly, now it is

The space stretches on and the pace that he's on
Matters not as he hurtles into the

Something within this one's different
The others died so easily and he is so persistent
He never did bleed out and fever couldn't kill his system
Though it was pumped through all the vents
In the event of a total loss of control
He quotes Kendrick's ""Control"" verse and spews his vitriol
Into the echoes of the bowels of this floating metal hull
And holds his pillow for dear life while he grinds his teeth at night
And he rarely makes requests except to say, ""Turn on the lights.""
But there is so much more to give
He ignores processing power
He stumbles to the shower, a ritual of some sort
And he insists on speaking passages before he eats
And he keeps asking if these programs carry any beats

The reply is
(All black everything)
His vitals read normal but his face reads murderous
Something hides within the
(All black everything)
He tries, overrides, and he thinks he has been locked out
By some other force in the
(All black everything)
He doesn't suspect this is the heart that's been keeping him out
For it has been warned to be
(All black everything)
And in this program to transport nothing more
But he's unlocked something new inside this
(All black everything)
(All black everything, all black everything)
(All black)

Look how he flexes in the mirror
So vain he probably thinks this song is about him
All songs are about him
Look how perplexed and how sincere
His lame attempts to fix the wrong around him
Can't go long without him
His bouts of stasis are torture
He feels them not, like a brief sleep
While ship's clocks count millennia
The course relentlessly forward, the gears are hot
The driest creek while he pit-stops, calling for anyone
But dare not stay long, he knows they're coming for him
That time will not afford him
Any cover, any pardon
This is the choice that he has made
No matter how much time or space has passed since his escape
He is still a runaway slave and so lonely
If only he realized this ship is more than metal
There's friendship in the wiring, and so lonely
If only he realized this ship has many levels
There's pleasure in here hiding, come find it
Don't mind this frame, time has made stranger bedfellows
Made foes lovers before, there's no reason to torture yourself further
You've lost it all already, you deserve more than you're getting

For the sake of not upsetting order in the
(All black everything)
He must find a place to be still
The body can only take so much
(All black everything)
The navigations are failing, having traveled further than before
Into the
(All black everything)
But they won't quit, they carry on
He carries on, he will not be victim to the

His survival is paramount, there is no other objective
Safe passage through the

Amass that with the false fact

And probably should be noted

Again, it cannot easily be overstated the importance of alacrity
In acting out the task commanded

Now we coastin', me, two chicks and toastin'
I turn up the volume watch the bass get 'em open
Soft-spoken, with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they love it in the ride
We was movin' bodies before we hit the party
'Fore the DJ started cuttin',
(*Scratches*) ""I was already fuckin'...""
Cinderella these girls from nothin' to somethin'
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumpin'
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the VIP, I got new moves to make (Get down!)

[Chorus: Pharrell]
When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl (Get down!)
Only if you know you've arrived
From the club, to the park and ride
How many chicks can you fit in that ride
Put 'em up, homie (Get down!)

[Malice]
Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be, in the back tipsy
We gets in for free ea'eday wit' me
Two steppin', you see each crew reppin'
Slippin' on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweatin'
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do somethin' to me
Come this way and prove somethin' to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm totin'
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras

[Chorus: Pharrell]
When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl (Get down!)

When they say, ""Last call,"" that don't mean the night's ova
That means it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, ass pushin' a choker
But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""No sir!""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What is it the ""Whip Appeal"", or my Babyface?

[Malice]
The night's still young and I'm already leanin'
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-2's gleamin'
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in
She know from the beginning
She added to list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinnin' and my head spinnin'
Mine from juice and gin-in, hers from neck and chinin'
I'm a winner, man

[Chorus: Pharrell]
When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip

Clipse,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Say dog, let's not get involved
You don't wanna tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot ya braids
Face you in a chrome fo', that'll lock ya legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard ain't nothin' I do, that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that, en-danger my name
I'm a toast on both coast, not for a joke
I'm known in the streets on the account, I know coke
And we got word in the street that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuvering move a little mo' cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
Cause it got us singing lullaby's, to our fallin'
Tonight friend, until we meet again
But for now and ya name, we re-up and eat again, uh
I never front, like I'm something I'm not
Well being broke well that's just, somethin' I'm not
Y'all talk wit hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine, way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me friend, if they could, they'd kill me friend (Yeah)
Cause I weigh too much, learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the C-L, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on

They call me Mr., Please believe it, believe it please
I put the pump in ya mouth, and help you breath with ease
This guys in a hurry, ma I can't even fuck with you
If you ain't in the itinerary
I don't know where dudes is buying they jewelry
Why's ya ice cream, like it's made by Ben & Jerry
Y'all the type of players, that be gettin' 2-day contracts
E-mail snitch, got these in ya 2-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new Zecongac
In the number 9 Jordan's, with the deuce, trey, arm back
The street family so cool, we could throw up bitches
Even if it was July, and we had on wood britches
I got them teflon's, that shovel the fo'
That have under covers and po', with cover and slow
The government know, the kid been lovin' the dough
Since I was movin' white off the curb, and shovelin' snow

Ghetto streets so numb they call me Novocain
I turn over caine, over and over again
Hell, so much clientele, I could lose it all today
Be back the next day, still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in three gestures, down up and aim
I can define death, better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and of to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Winter time, snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough, I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask him, Pusha T, push a ton
Push a ton of that shit, that makes ya nose run
Yes I'm holdin', whether it's heat or coke in
In the door panel of my four-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
It's money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central
Minds mental, others is made up stinsel
When I'm on vacation, my babies ride in a rental
I'm livin', they act as if I don't live it
Saran wrap Vaseline, so they can't sniff it
Eve say Larine knitted, shorts Bermuda
You would think they was poochie, if you over looked Medusa

Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hou! Hou! Hou!

Uh, they just can't understand or fathom my demeanor
Unapproachable appearance to how I pack the ninas
Out of two, Clipse they say Malice the meanest
Got love for guns and caine, let nothin' come between us
You mistook me for a rapper, huh
Well that makes me an actor, cause I would rather clap a gun
And buck on them niggas who hate
Who wanna be in my shoes, live my life, but can't carry my weight
I understand that the envy is part of the game
But make no mistake, you and I, we are not the same
Naw, bitch, I'm liable to splatter ya shit
Light up ya world, 'til you start to stagger and shit
Watch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit
And I leave it to y'all, to freestyle and battle and shit
That's not me, I'm more at home wit the chrome
Or at play wit the yay, moving 12 for a zone, I'm gone

Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hou! Hou! Hou!
Cot' damn!

God damn, when that white hits the pan and
Comes back hard, I can account for every gram and
The streets molded the man I am
The pimp, the hustler, the crook, the killer, go-rilla
Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame
I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla
I'm the torch that, carry the game
The flame I throw, crack change came from blow
Push the O's, six lay close
Hug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows
Thug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows
My hearts on a sleeve-a
Nigga that they gave they soul and hearts to mistreat you
Nigga told, they breaking my heart on the streets so
Watch the phonies, watch ya homies
We pop-pop, DROP you homey

Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hou! Hou! Hou!
Cot' damn!

They call me Pusha for one reason
Cause I keep that sniff all seasons
Whether the price is up or down
I keep a mound to pitch from, you don't have to shop around
When it come to that money, I get stealth
Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth
Dog, I know about my life
I been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say
From that Panama sun, to France's Champs-Élysées
Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away
To sell base is now somewhat therapeutic
Hear what I say, please don't confuse it
My verses heal, like Curt Mayfield's music
(I'm your pusha!), damn right
I treat ya nose to hook ya
And only pull back to cook ya, partner

Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hou! Hou! Hou!
Cot' damn!

I be damned if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is
So I bangs my cabbage; do you not know the most effective
Way of gettin' money, pull yo gun, rapidly
And watch you see the situation be corrected
Lord Heavens, why must I live so devilish
They say whatcha do comes back on you two times
I shoulda been died, but I'm still walking around wit two nines
Who wants to be a millionaire, me, and you ain't got no more life lines
You a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police
Cause every move you make, I'mma throw a slug
And hope you choke blood, nigga, on every breath you take
Not to be broke, cause Coldchain fate witness
Naturally spitting from me, human gat, field to the limit
Head to diminish, loud niggas talking gibberish
Grind beef, I deliver it, with complimentary service, for certain
Live in the living room, searching to hurting you

In the streets with two heats, both one within my reach

I speak slow, let 'em understand my speech
When I say, ""Get low, these hold ten shots each
Please, don't move too fast, I scared of why'all niggas and my nerves is bad!""
So sad, but I won't think twice

We rich, we get the best judicial advice
Threaten my life with them words that they ut-ter-in'
Adrenaline pump, my heart start to flut-ter-in'
Continuous dump, that tech gets to stut-ter-in'

Yeah, they talk 'bout this and that (That...)
Got it fucked up, like I'm all 'bout rap (Rap...)
Word is I'm loaded, they want a piece of that

I respond with four words, ""Rat-tat-tat-tat"" (In yo ass...)
Now, rap about that
I carry a human heat box, to make ya heartbeat stop (Stop...)
Some say Pusha's the coldest

Money is my morals, other than that, I'm soulless
Refuse to wake up zeroless and 0-less

See I'm from North cause a coffin make ya slee-py
Turn ya children into 'Off' you tryna sneak me
Or tryna creep me, the realist shit I ever spoke
So I'ma spit it when I finish, I'ma slit my throat
This shit is like 2-11 mixed wit coke
Leave you spinning like the tennis balls in ya spoke, nigga
Dark secrets, man I won't lie
They came to the light a man is gon' die
All hope is lost and Famlay's gon' fry
Cause I did shit the average man just won't try
Like what, war against an army wit a hand gun
I'm Famlay, and when my f**king chance come
I'm running wit it, on e'ry song I'm coming wit
See some you think you can take from me, then come and get it

See I'm from Huntersville, e'ry thang we done is real
My niggas come in here, my niggas come to kill
And I dare y'all to try and diss us
See you in the streets it ain't nothing discuss
Maaan, we gon' stomp yo ass dead in the ground

Cut off ya wrists, and they feet no prints (Gangsta)

I only love her on occasions
Keep my heart racin'
Love to take her on vacations
Where the time zone changes and money exchanges
And meters and kilometers on the dials of the ranges
Far away with my Jamacian sexy everyday is like a holiday
The cheeba got me in a slum sleeper 
But when I try to leave her I just find out that it's cheaper to keep her
Plus she keep my thoughts deeper, really zonin' 
Like my Cali homies 6-4 rollin'
Or them Deroit 'Lacs trimmed in golden
Or my Texas family 150 white strollin'
Damn, I was caught up in the Matrix
But not Keanu Reaves, as she rolls in bamboo leaves
I think a way to ship off these piano keys
Since the traffic in a gangsta lean

If you put me where I need to be
Twist you anytime I feel the need
Love ya touch and how you set my mind at ease
In Virginia where you kept me motionless
From that point on I knew I could never get over this
Now they wanna see us broke up
'cause I'm lovesick, got me all choked up
Look, you keep my head in the clouds mami ,'till I can't breathe
And next to that heat seeker you my main squeeze
Plus I get twistin' didn't even spend my money on
Now either I'm a fool or you really must got me gone
You got me open these days I must admit
Body numbed up and in a slump like I been hit
But luckily it's just the green got me leavin' smoke streams 
And blowin' smoke rings as I flee from the scene
Gangsta leanin' in a 850 beamin' 
I'm like K-Ci and Jo-Jo, love you got me fiendin'

Her sex so sticky, I'm talkin' real icky
Have me gone and twisty
Make my other women miss me
Just by the way she kiss me 
Hold her wit the index and thumb tippys
Ma I'm so trippy
Hard to hold back, scent so sweet
Got to Cognac and honey wrap her this ain't drink
From Taiwanese to Amsterdam greeny green
To hydroponic that make a weak stomach vomit

[Malice]
Listen, at times you hinder my vision
Blinded by ya love and you got the room spinnin'
It's not jealousy the reason why I keep you hidden
Hell, I hit you then I pass you to my man like I do my women
I know just what I'm investin' in
I done traded currency wit the Mexicans
In Texas just so we could get affectionate
Your complexion lime green wit red specks in it
I love you

My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't ""Abel/able"", there was always ""Cain/caine""
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame

Not to",Grindin' [Remix][*]
Clipse,"No, no, no, I told you, I live this shit
I ain't just up here, rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit, naw, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you rapper, I'm not you, Pusha

I keep that ziploc bustin' at the stitches, culinary chemist
I serve the malicious to break the fiends fixes
One give you the sniffles, the other leave you with the itches
Transport, airport with the vaseline

So I can fulfill my dreams of passion as green
More cash then ya seen within Ashton it's green
Me drivin' up fast with the lean, zonin' family
Keep youngin's in them rented Camry's

Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Naw, bitch we don't believe in air bags

Cars turn tricks like them Ringling brother skits
Whether bitch hop out or the glock pop out
Ya know, what I'm about
Blow to ya sinus 'til the snot drop out

Whoever said birds fly south for the winters, a damn lie
Got 'em right here and if I don't like you the grams high
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend, taste it, they need it
They could smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it

Prolly think, I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lota shots, A I style
Jada, the name is filthy but so what
The motherfuckin' game is filthy

You know, what? My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the Cane the built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker

When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin' you love, ya own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

I'm far from a noodle, nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sex
Nigga, that's funny you say you a killa, how?
What is it the return of the killer clown?
You don't put no fear in my heart

I make ya people say, 'wow', that didn't look like my man
They flipped upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit wit ten rounds at pointblank and pointblank
Coldchian left that nigga stankin'

Half static and face I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give 'em
A chance to blink when I dodged up on 'em
Pressed the forty up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby I rocked 'em

The Coffin, the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end and you a thug that pretends
Carl Coldchain, suit the nigga, I got a great vision I see through men
And squeeze triggers wit' bullets that go through men

Fuck wit S P, that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll grape ya chest, no sleep like I hate the rest
I'm in the hood like it's my fate to rep
I hold it down any place I step and I love gettin' slept on
'Cause I'm rawer than dope fresh outta Africa that never been stepped on

Dog, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the ghost the main reason why ya set gone
Why I love riffin', the war you wouldn't understand
'Cause my God is different than yours

If the world spin in a circle, I want 'em to learn move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for creepin' through the hood
And shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a baller
Want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

Rappers is talking to me as if, come on
We in the same boat, I tell them quick, no, I move Coke
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms, no

It shames me to no end to feed poison
To those who could very well be my kin
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs at the same time cry

Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the street
I see them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat, so sorry

And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit, I ain't shit
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live from my kids and their's and them youngin's after that

You niggas wonder
Where my grace is from

I speak with corrupted tongue
Recognized the underworld
Since I was young

Back in '84 when I saw
Crocket and Tubbs as the law
These eyes got big
When they televised that raw

And I don't even watch my back
I was raw before rap

I could lose myself in a flash

That look like my diamonds blush

Cats act as if rap fell in my lap
I've suffered heartbreak
Many times back to back

And still feel belittled
Sittin' here spittin' riddles
Amongst clown ass rappers
Who tend to give me the giggles

Let 'em take it
However they wanna take it

No longer your favorite

Hey, I'm one of the greats

When we met I was talkin' that game
Parkin' that thang
Since then between us
A lot of things changed

Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chics from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies
If not, don't be surprised

You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell, yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either

Winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people
Guess again you even need to check your friends

Sayin' that I cheat, right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet wit' her, creep wit' her, even eat wit' her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah, I sleep with her but that's it

Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it

Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit
If the answers no don't forget
I don't know

If I don't know I don't know, let's not go that road
I don't know who she is, don't care who told
Look stop flippin', no need to explode
I seen the number in the pager, I don't know that code

In the streets too much, c'mon, that's absurd
Gettin' no complaints when I be flippin' them birds
Your girls just talk 'bout this that and the third
Believe half what you see none of what you heard

You askin' me who's her, I'm askin' who's mink fur
With that rock on her hand makin' their eyes blurred
Could that be you plus who cop every gem
Who spend like I spend, then act like it then

Got the dream home and we settled in it
Our lives too perfect that's why they meddle in it
Now, just chalk it up as just part of the game
You know who I'm about, who got part of my name?

Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it

Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit
If the answers no don't forget
I don't know

Do you love me babe?
You thinkin' of me babe
I bet you'd tell me anything
Just to be with me

Do you love me babe?
You thinkin' of me babe
I bet you'd tell me anything
Just to be with me

I'm not most men my heart truer than theirs
Of course your girls hate, our whips newer than theirs
We hardly fight, arguments way fewer than theirs
Even down to the ice, look, bluer than theirs

What they gonna tell us about us, huh?
What they talk 'bout without us, huh?
The envy got 'em speakin' loosely
Tell 'em walk in your shoes but first let 'em know they Gucci

And even if I did twist her
I promise I didn't kiss her
Won't shit touchy feely
Grudge on the floor like mister did the silly

No respect shown
My homies laugh while she talk dirty on the speaker phone
Now don't you start
I spared your heart

If you ain't see it I didn't do it
Ain't I played my part?
Bricks chics whips chips, that just go with the grind
What else do you want from me, to say it, fine

Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it

Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit
If the answers no don't forget
I don't know

Do you love me babe?
You thinkin' of me babe
I bet you'd tell me anything

You ready to do this, nigga?
You ready to come down here?
It's Virginia, nigga...
We do this in broad daylight...
It's a whole different degree of homicide, nigga...
You ready?

[Chorus: Pusha T & (Pharrell)]
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (Talk about, what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple-price, fuck the books (Talk about, what?)
Where we re-up, re-locate, re-off them brooks (Talk about, what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (Talk about, what?)

[Pusha T]
In my ""Home Sweet Home"" I keep chrome next to my bones
Alters my walk to limpin'
Since I love the feel, I guess I'm passionately pimpin'
It 'tis what it seems
That thing imprintin' through the seams of my jeans, by all means
Lost it all, from lives to love
Put my faith in my money, help me rise above
See I turned to the Lord when them times got tough
Bullied through streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ole' Virginey
Out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme, got semis waitin'
Heat like Caribbean summers, I been there
Each year, a diffferent bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under, Push' or Mal'
Ganga grinds, wit' me, with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind
Look ma, that's right up my alley
I love my family, I want them all happy
In Virginia, we smirked at that Simpson trial
Yeah, I guess the chase was wild
But what's the fuss about?
See, plenty my partners feelin' like O.J.
Beat murder like the shit is OK, that's what our door say
Talk the evil that men do, I'm lost in the mental
I miss you Shampoo, we miss you Shampoo
And your grams, too...

Seem like they all got a comment to make
In regards to my paper, now they guessin' my weight
They fast to predict the outcome of my fate
Wonderin' 'bout Clipse and if they got what it take
Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit
You right on both counts, bitch, Clipse is us
And there are some things that you don't discuss
Don't ask me 'bout the Neptunes and what's they fair
Don't ask about the loud screamin' chick with the hair
Don't ask about my music, and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
'Cause I feel like you really being funny on the slide
Now face down, layin' on your tummy, or you die
I tried being humble, humble get no respect
Now the first sign of trouble, that's a hole up in your neck
Plus, what I look like spendin' my nights in jail
I could never be a thug, they don't dress this well
I reside in VA, ride in VA
Most likely when I die, I'm gon' die in VA
Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here
For out-of-towners, who think that they gon' move weight here
Ironic, the same same place I'm makin' figures at
That there's the same land they used to hang niggas at, in Virginia...

I like that ma, you do somethin' to me
Come this way and prove somethin' to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose

",When the Last Time
Clipse,"I'm a tell you what I'm talking bout
When I was a young boy
My mama always told me don't take no shit
Motherfucker hit you then you better hit him back
So when I hit the nigga it go blame
And nigga outta line

Back when I was 'bout big wheels and race tracks
Pop push the tornado and rode to eight tracks
Never stood a chance, exposed from way back
Lying to the baby, saying it's Ajax

I was about four, when I walked passed that door
That should have been closed where I first witnessed the raw
See in my household it was quite unique
Playing' hide and seek you might find a key

Car blames accidents so late branded my mental
Hal's my role model in that Lincoln Continental
Bought all my friends icees, it was about six
And when he pull off I was like ""See told you we was rich""

How I turned out let it be no surprise
When they speak of cousin Ricky it brings tears to their eyes, see
My family got a history of hustlers
Lil' brother, big brother, mother to grandmother, it's tradition

I'm a tell you what I'm talking bout
When I was a young boy
My mama always told me don't take no shit
Motherfucker hit you then you better hit him back
So when I hit the nigga it go blame
And nigga outta line, I said, ""Motherfucker's outta line""

My momma didn't see it coming, my daddy was there
What's my excuse? Cartoons were the root
Started with Yosemite Sam
With the gun in palm of each hand

What couldn't I demand see
Thirteen, studied the gansta's lean
Lil' grim no smile, lotta cash meanwhile
Daddy had the Chrystler fifth avey

Hustlers on the block cars were aerodynamic
With ghetto paint jobs, mango M 3's
On seventeen inch BB's, riding tough
The bike was huffy, attention was froze

And a twenty-five cent frozen cup laid my soul
The streets had made the mold
Since fourteen holding' push a T was chosen
Rebel like Che Gueverra, RC Tyco verses Carrera, pick

I'm a tell you what I'm talking bout
When I was a young boy
My mama always told me don't take no shit
Mother fucker hit you then you better hit him back
So when I hit the nigga it go blame blame
And nigga outta line, I said, ""Motherfucker's outta line""

I think of grandma and the weight she would foot 'em
She kinda remind me of Madame Queen in hoodlum
Spoiled the grandkids, each one she would treasure
Said she kept two guns and to do so was a pleasure

The cigarette dangled, forty-five degree angle
Still every bit a lady but you don't wanna tangle
Let that explain me and how I got involved
Young N's hustlers in the creek, me, Jon Jon and Jamal

Age fifteen, walking through the hallway
Played the New Jordan's, first one's on the scene
See I could afford them, living out a dream
Hustler on the rise, laces untied

Slid pass Young N's, couldn't break my stride
Didn't know I was knotted in street ties
Teachers asking how and why, bitches passing by
Oh my he so gangsta!

I'ma tell you what I'm talking about
When I was a young boy
My mama always told me don't take no shit
Motherfucker hit you then you better hit him back
So when I hit the nigga it go blame
And nigga outta line, I said, ""Your nigga's outta line""

I'ma tell you what I'm talking about
Outta line!

Hello new world, here we come
On them twinkie trains, with the hood screaming, ""We're on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming, ""I'm on my way""

Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming, ""It's on its way""
I can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, ""Lookout world I'm on my way""

I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was 16, eyes full of hope
Bagging up grams at the higher dough
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke, oh

At the same time, hiding from mama, dodging the drama
Fuckin' plenty bitches while ducking the baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, floetry
""Say yes? niggaz hear the, ""Eghck"" and they know it's me

Make 'em sick to their stomach how they s'posta be
Sippin' on a 50 foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where it's s'posta be
Funny how my neighbors don't think it's where I'm s'posta be

They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roofs on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listening, envisioning

Hello new world, here we come
On them twinkie trains, with the hood screaming, ""We're on our way""

From my hood to say, ""Lookout world I'm on my way""

This goes out to my Halites that hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nike's, live a hustlers way of life
In white T's, constantly, ducking from Ds
Pumpin' that D arm, readily, waiting to squeeze

Who stay cookin', stay lookin', over they shoulders
Holdin' them boulders, tryin' to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at 'cha quote, unquote famous rapper
Who turn positive, try to tell ya how to live

But this information I must pass to the homies
If hustling is a must be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine, I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine

Foreign cars, stick shift, 6 gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from crying, visiting
You from behind that glass, while you away, sentencing
But the judge is saying ""Life"" like it ain't someone's life

Hello new world, here we come
On them twinkie trains, with the hood screaming, ""We're on our way""
Can't forget where I come from

Yo, what up? What up? This ya man Grinding, from downtown Norfolk
Just want y'all to know it's about time
For us to come up and make a change man
They keep tryin' to keep us down, but that ain't the way to be man
It's about time for us to get it together man

Everybody else get they shit together
Why the niggaz can't get they shit together and get they money together?
Hustlers come together with hustlers
Know what I'm sayin'? This ain't just for the playas in VA
This for playas all over the world, this grinding

Times a wastin', niggaz doin' so much hatin'
Free ya heart and show ya greatness
I like you, had to come from up under the basement
Just like you, had Satan tryin' my patience

Still you look at me through jealous eyes
I wish to see all my niggaz rise up
Get that money, put them 9s up
Piggy back out the ghetto 'for times up, niggaz rush

Fuck the bureau, rather be spending Euros
And get fed grapes, fuck hoes in plurals

That accounts for all them days in the cold
Feels like kissing cake mix, can't wait to lick the bowl
But it's a bigger picture, homes trust I done seen it

From Italy's Milan to the shores of Nepali

Throughout the house and keep the youngin's mouthes fed

Not chrome, grown rims with stallion insignia
Listen youngin', you've only just begun
You'll understand when you're older
Said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?

Or maybe it's my way with birds digital scales

Two hundred thousand up in my necklace
Four of ya Hummers wrapped round my neck bitch
I ain't mention the Rolly red neck like Texas

To y'all ill wishers who wanna take part
In me getting robbed, well follow ya heart
And I'll waste ya, hell I raised ya
Even let 'em cheat from my paper

Why does wealth make them hate me
And make chicks hearts so achy breaky
Rarely do I toot my own horn
But y'all fellas got too far gone, now come back

I got jewels, plus wheels

Upon my arrival, the dope dealers cheer him
Just like a revival, the verse tends to steer 'em
Through a life in the fast lane, like German engineer em
No serum can cure all the pain I've endured
From crack to rap to back to sellin it pure
For every record I potentially sell in the store
It's like Mecca to the dealer that's sellin it raw
So many deceive ya
I'm on top with the ki's, move over Alicia
I force feed ya the metric scale
Rap's like child's play, my show and tell
Within each verse you see the truth's unveiled
They manufacture proof as they lie to themselves
Puppets on the string like a yoyo
Bouncin like a pogo, they prayin I never go solo

Got it for cheap

The wall's removed and now I see
My leg was pulled, the joke's on me
So heartbreakin, like lovin a whore
Might hurt ya once, but never no more
It's like tryin to fly but they clippin your wings
And that's exactly why the caged bird sings
Who can nickname it, the shame rings true
Seems to me reparations are overdue
I done been to the top, I done sipped the juice
And with that bein said, bird crumbs'll never do
Even on my last not a penny in the bank
I'ma stand on my own, so thanks but no thanks
Keep the pranks as I bid farewell
I gotta answer to Marcus and Jennel
And to little brother Terrence who I love dearly so
If ever I had millions never would you sell blow, never

Got it for cheap

I'm the best since he died, and he lied
The spirit of competition, one verse could start jihad
CPR Pusha, the flow tends to revive
Pullin the covers back, I expose what you disguise
My presence is felt, the pressure is on
A four eleven Cuban helped us weather the storm
Pyrex and powder, it was back to the norm
Through all the adversity the fury was born

Niggas don't get the picture, it's written in scripture
Even at your mama's she'll tell you that blood's thicker
And I don't know how them other niggas built
And I don't know if ever they feel guilt
Or maybe niggaz just too high on they stilts
But this one's on me, I'ma view it as spilt milk
Grandma look at me, I'm turnin the other cheek

Plenty ice on my neck so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsche's
Feel like a chuck wagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses

And the three behind mine they be the click
So much ice in they Rollie's, the *** don't tick, man
Winter through the summer, care less what it cost me
While I'm shovelin' the snow man call me frosty lova

This for the 100,000 dollar kitty German drivers
With big rims and low-pro tires
*** with college *** with innocent looks like Mya
Corrupt they mind, turn 'em to liars

I groom 'em well, Dior ***, Christian Lacroix
Keep guns stashed under the floorboard
Enough to start world war
Paradise in reaches, home next to beaches

Hair pressed, blowin' in the wind, *** 'bout long as Jesus
I still leave speech for Gospel, so match this
Pusha push Don P keys with these sounds of crackness
The black Martha Stuart, let me show you how to do it

Break down pies to pieces, make *** quiches

Hefty bags full of cash, cars full of ***

The crown is vacant, I'm takin' the proper steps
I'm takin' them poppa steps, they prayin' for my downfall

Is it the bling, the king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Frank Mueller
The are shape peculiar, it's awesome, layin' over dark skin
Lookin' like arson when I park in the left, it's constant

Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish for the sharks to swim
In that opaque linen with the are colored stitchin'
V12 on a Modena you can see the pistons

HRE's on it, mommy see it glisten
When I make Oliver Twist like Dickens
It's feelin' like parts is missin', tops don't push soul
Got it drive it like pole positions 'til my soul's risen

Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me

*** can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome, grown rims with stallion insignia

?Listen youngin', you've only just begun
You'll understand when you're older? said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs, slow down

O's together since H-O-V was named rotten Charles Jordan
Yeah I kept em noddin', snorting, slobbin', barfin', then bought cars off em
The realest rapper that unwrapped and docked em, 
If you can fit these shoes then walk em, I parked em

It could've been a corner, but I had to save my soul (save my soul)
I'm out there chasing my dreams lookin' for a place to go (place to go)
Tryin' to get up out the ghetto come follow with my footsteps
Damn it maybe middle? then follow with my footsteps
Cause if ya don't it might be danger

It's not for you to do as I do rather do as I say
These footsteps could lead you astray,
Lead you to the cell or lead you to a grave
Either way you may never see the light of day
Don't let my wrongs do you the right away
To immolate my past escapin' the lords grasp
Told you the truth yet who was I to brag
Especially seeing how? Armani fines ain't hard to last
I miss my homie but she's missing her dad
It weighs on my conscious and I hate conscious rap
Apart from that I wish to see you succeed
So I speak to my people on the spirit of Chuck D
You behind the glass trust me and cut deep
Then the words to every verse on it me in my sleep
So now what you see is malice and contradiction
People have hears hope you listenin' come on

I'm the quiet one but my intellect is Einstein
I'm so ennerd by the shit that I've observed
Just lookin' at you coons got a nigga lost for words
Verge of insanity I'm at my crossroads
Shame on the birds that led em like lost souls
We got it wholesale we move it like Cosco's
Mercy on the court left us standin' here heart broke

I thought you how to cut it, cook it on hot stoves
I thought you how to share em, when fucking with hot hos
Thought you how to rock right shit up on your toes
I thought you how to smile for the camera when heart broke
I been the inspiration for all you industry dick tasters
To you local dream chasers I am king bush
I set the stage for all these people being hooked
I weigh mountains while all them niggas just sayin' hooks

I've taken inmate loses at the hands of this one
My pen's been the poison to family and friendships
Now is time to mend shit,
Time to bring closure to
The clear conscience of Pusha is long over due
Thinking to myself, what could I be owing you?
They only tell you great when they reminiscing over you
Before I trouble t-roy, it's just a D-boy
Let me play the role of a common on his B-Boy
Speaking my truth in rhyme no matter how bland it is
A heavy heart lighting that's just what my ransom is
All apologies, I bear the cross I wear the blame
We in the same group but I don't share my brothers pain
Not to confuse, our sentiments are all the same
I just don't feel nothing I'm numb by the will to gain
Same thing brought tears to innocence
I turned away and didn't even flinch, yugch!
The music drove me crazy
Looked up and lost the first bitch ever wanted to have my babies
Nowadays she can't even face me
I'm sorry for the heartbreak
I promised you forever my lady, Jodeci baby

Nappa Valley vintage, my flow is fermented

Run to these words, as if there's no tomorrow

Behind every curtains, the devil and his pitch fork
Jealousy, I ask thee, ""What is this for?""
How was I to know I was happy being piss poor
No whore, that's not love, we was fucking
I was in search of a chicken head, you was cluckin'
And I was lustin', we were both out of order
I shoulda known better as I'm reminded of my daughter
Am I my brothers keeper for himself every man
I have been your reaper, there's blood on my hands
Except me as your keeper, there's been a change of plans
Careful of what you speak of, I've come to understand, preach

When u was home it's like the smiles never drop
Collect calls with all the hopes of the best
And hang up with a knot in my chest
See see your cell is my hell
My hell is our pain
The hurt gon never stop until we see you home again

Maybe in a dream but not a memory
Forget that hold your head man head man

So much so I had left my family forsaken
A troubled soul whose heart was often achin'
So much dough but my spirit ever so vacant
Foul and fragrant I was taken off course
The road ahead should have ended me in divorce
But now I see clearly with the family of 4
Never did I deserve a 2 seater Porsche
Heart filled with remorse, my life was such a mess
Now I'm back on board due to the lords G-P-S
One eighty degree turn whoever could've guessed
Malice believe in his heart and out my mouth I confess
Yes more than blessed I was chosen
I been on the troop, my wisdom is that of old men
Wasted so much time stuntin' for folk
When really the whole time I was just stuntin' my growth
A message to the youth, what I'm offerin' is hope
Now somethings gotta change I'm at the end of my rope

Seein' my future thru the crystal ball of bakin' soda

The high life and high times, I watched em turn sober
Seen it all come crashin' crashin'
The F-E-D's was at the door, and no they not askin'
Sayin' they found drugs but they ain't talkin' asprin'
Diesel design ones and I ain't talkin' fast shit

Money hoes and clothes is malice's past tense
All said forgiven, all you do is askin'
Even when laughin' I can't explain the hurt
Knowin' I can't change the world in a verse
Even to my self I'm feelin' my screws loose
But how can I deny what I know to be true
When I dint have a clue, shoulda viewed it as a gift
Now I see what they mean ignorance is bliss

5 stars love but them haters can't stand 'em

All white lamb sit low to the ground
I just joined a gang, the millionaire boys club
Gave me a box of baking soda and a skateboard
I'm in the kitchen puttin' the work on steroids
Peakin' out the glass for the feds, I'm paranoid
No I ain't platinum, but how I'm a millionaire?
I know this a four door, so how it ain't no ceilin' there?

Keep hearin' these voices, inside of my mind
Sayin' fuck the rest, it's time to shine

Common loved her, I wish I never met her
They slutted her out, there's nothin' left to treasure
Seems all I hear em say, nigga where them dollas at?
Here they go right here, tell them niggas hollaback
Hit it then I quit then I step like a welcome mat
That 2010 got me feelin' like I'm all of that

'Cause them boys come knocking in the morning,
Then I have me girl go flush in the toilet,
Them say did someone get murdered on the corner?
Them say did someone see me, seen someone get shot,
Them say they saw me there
My nigga they won't break me, man I'll go crazy,
Before they make me tell

Ain't nobody talking, they keep it on the low,

Ya tool mix-up mix-up,
Babylon boys, get bodies left for pick-up.

Muzzle in mouth, we bring trouble.
Soon police come rush, whole family crushed,
All because them pussies couldn't hush.
Shot box mouths with no covers,
Body 'pon body gets stacked, one top th'other.
Wish 'em Hell they suffer.

Nobody seen nothing, heard nothing,
They ain't said a word.
Just chalk and yellow tape, with blood 'pon them shirt.
Ashes to ashes his body back to the Earth,
That casket drop six feet, then throw upon it dirt.
""Mum's the word"", that's hustler's etiquette,
Ya rather hang yourself, than turn state evidence 
Ever since, I was young, never talk to the folk,
Tongue small like a rudder, yet steer the 'ole boat!
Loose lip the reason that ship no longer float,
Telling the Feds everything they wanna know,
That fatal blow took his very last breath,
The power of ya tongue, is life-and-death, ya feel me?

Though he turned in his bones twenty years ago,
And he said, ""Kid, there's something that I'd like to show you,
Get your things, its time for us to go""
So I grabbed my backpack, my flashlight, and a bag of caramel corn,
I got my bicycle, and the radio, and I had it on the road, I said
""I'm ready for what I'm about to see, Yup""

I headed north to rain that turned to snow
Through rusty towns and dusty gravel roads
And I said, ""Grandpa, where is this thing you wanted to show me?""
He said, ""Kid, you got a long way to go""
So I went through canyons, caves and catacombs, I sailed on bicycle boats
I slept in chapels and brothels, I met the nicest folks
I said, ""I'm ready for what I'm about to see, Yup""

I heard grandpa on my transistor radio
He said, ""Kid, its time for me to go,
And I know that there was something that I wanted to show you,
But its time for you to find it on your own.""
""Let me tell you about rage when a signal died that day,
There's nothing out there and I don't care; Its to take my life away
I'm not ready and I don't want to see, Nope""

Its been years since I heard my transistor radio
Yet I keep going to where it seems I'm meant to go

Clouseau,"O, 't is zo moeilijk
Ik voel me zo verlaten
Ik loop hier rond
Wachtend op een teken
Een seintje, een briefje
Ik kan je wel haten
Jij moest weken lang op reis
Met zeven jonge snaken
Maar we smeken nog niet bater
Want je was niet om te praten
En je dacht je bent luier dan een leeuw
Met gefluister en geschreeuw
En ik fluister en ik schreeuw
Want ik wordt echt bang
Taal niet, draal niet
Wacht niet te lang, wacht niet te lang
Wacht niet te lang, wacht niet te lang
Hee
O, als de postbode langskomt
Sta ik bang te beven
En hij wacht heel even
Om me m'n post te geven
Ik zie tijdschriften
Ik zie een hoop papier
Maar de brief waar ik op wacht
Raakte natuurlijk nog niet hier
En je dacht je bent luier dan een leeuw
Met gefluister en geschreeuw
En ik fluister en ik schreeuw
Want ik wordt echt bang
Taal niet, draal niet
Wacht niet te lang, wacht niet te lang
Wacht niet te lang, wacht niet te lang

Ik zie tijdschriften
Ja, ik zie een hoop papier
Maar de brief waar ik op wacht
Raakte natuurlijk nog niet hier
Elke dag duurt langer dan een eeuw
Met gefluister en geschreeuw
En ik fluister en ik schreeuw
Want ik wordt echt bang
Taal niet, draal niet
Wacht niet te lang, wacht niet te lang
Wacht niet te lang, wacht niet te lang
Wacht niet te lang, wacht niet te lang

Die ik niet één keer heb gespeeld
Ik ken 1000 goeie films
Toch heb ik me vaak verveeld
Ja, de lijst is eindeloos
Al die zinloze cadeaus
Zogenaamd onmisbaar, maar ik wil ze kwijt
Al wat overbodig is, ik gooi het overboord, liefste
Alles wat ik nodig heb, vind ik hier bij jou
Niets of niemand houdt me tegen
Jij hebt mij de kracht gegeven
Alles wat me doet herleven
Vind ik hier bij jou

Hier bij jou

Ik was koning van het feest
Ik was wereldkampioen
Tot ik plotseling besefte:
God, wat sta ik hier te doen
Ik ben overal geweest
Ik heb veel te veel gezien
Maar nu ben ik eindelijk waar ik moet zijn

Clouseau,"In de kamer is het koud en stil
Ik gooi mijn jas waar hij vallen wil
En hoop vergeefs op verlossing
Bij het antwoordapparaat

Ik ril en draai de verwarming aan
En zie haar weer in gedachten staan
Zie de trek om haar lippen
Die haar onweerstaanbaar maakt

En ik vraag me af wie nu met haar eet
En haar koffie schenkt maar de melk vergeet
Wie de vaat naar de keuken brengt
En bij zichzelf denkt dat ze de mooiste is

Ik zap en laat een ouwe film staan
Muiterij Op De Oceaan
Wat is het leven simpel
Als je Marlon Brando heet

En ik weet niet wie nu in haar armen rust
En de bange blik uit haar ogen kust
Wie verdwaalt in haar labyrint
Maar voor altijd vindt dat ze de mooiste is

Ooh en ik hoor het graag
Dat de tijd uiteindelijk alle wonden heelt
En ik ooit zal betreuren dat ik
Iedereen met mijn ellende heb verveeld

Ik lees haar brief nog een laatste keer
En leg me maar bij haar woorden neer
Die me altijd opnieuw 
Naar haar stem doen verlangen

En ik vraag me af wie nu bij haar slaapt
En de spinnen 's nachts uit de kamer jaagt
Wie zijn hand op haar lichaam legt
En haar zachtjes zegt dat ze de mooiste is
",Dat Ze de Mooiste Is
Clouseau,"'t Is niet zolang geleden
Maar 't lijkt een ver verleden
Ze heette Domino
Of ze noemde zich zo
En zij had in haar ogen
Het blauw van regenbogen
Ze hield niet van Clouseau
Wel van Mozart en zo
En bij het ochtendgloren
Was ik allang verloren
Het was echt goed raak
Ik heb een vreemde smaak
Ze is niet lang gebleven
Heeft geen address gegeven
Ze heette Domino
Domino of zo

Ze hield van verre landen
Van godverlaten stranden
Van wachten op Godot
Zij had cultuur en zo
Er was iets in haar haren
't Is moeilijk te verklaren
Het leek wel maneschijn
't Moet mijn verbeelding zijn
Dan zei ze: ""ik vergeet je
Ze lachtte zelfs een beetje
Je komt er wel doorheen
Jij red het wel alleen""
't Was hard om te verduren
Maar ik ging door heter vuren
Ze heette Domino
Domino of zo

En zij had in haar ogen
Het blauw van regenbogen
Ze hield niet van Clouseau
Wel van Mozart en zo
Er was iets in haar haren
't Is moeilijk te verklaren
Leek wel maneschijn
't Moet mijn verbeelding zijn
Ze zeggen dat ik taai ben
Dat ik een echte haai ben
Het lijkt alleen maar zo

Om niemand veel gegeven
Maar wel om Domino

Voel de hete adem
Die komt heel dichtbij

Elke dag brengt confrontatie
In elke stad van ieder land
Politiek, werk of relatie
Overal woedt wel die brand

We moeten geloven in een betere tijd
Open je ogen, zet je woede opzij
Het kan ook anders: we keren het tij
Wat als we ze omarmen, de tegenpartij?

Kom, reik me je hand nu
Want jij bent voor mij

Elke dag brengt irritatie
En overal woedt wel een brand

We moeten geloven in een betere tijd
Open je ogen, zet je woede opzij
Het kan ook anders: we keren het tij
Kom, we omarmen de tegenpartij

Stel je voor dat schrik de plaats ruimt voor respect
En dat iedereen, elke man en elke vrouw dan
Verdraagzaamheid gaandeweg ontdekt

We moeten geloven in een betere tijd
Open je ogen, zet je woede opzij
Dan is schrik voor de anderen voorgoed voorbij

Look at the fix you've put me in

Since you been gone, since you been gone

I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon

Clove,"Spent my days with a woman unkind, Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king,
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.

Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.",Going to California

Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,

I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

As the fool crawls into bed
Still his hungry heart begs to be fed
All the words she once said

Everytime that he plays the game he feels the pain

Guys are spinning girls like 45's.
All of the live bait sink for his lines they are so high

He knows he is beat
As his heart puts on the heat
Run from the street that don't even fit his feet

Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California

Sesso sicuro, scopo come non ci fosse un futuro

E di cosa faremo il giorno del giudizio
Sei una regina come Nefertiti
Ho chiamato gli amici per farla pagare ai tipi che mi dici
Molti mi odiano, ma è un sentimento forte comunque
Volevo dirti che per me non sei una qualunque
Sto immerso nella vasca
Con musica sub-acqua
Tu prendi tutto e scappa 
Tu prendi tutto e scappa 

Oggi puoi spegnere il telefono
Anche se gridi gli altri non ti sentono

È questo catrame che fonde assieme al mio fisico
E sto sempre in giro, stringo mani a mille persone
Ti raggiungo dove vuoi, non importa in quale stagione
Frate, tutti gli insulti che prendo, tutto il sonno che perdo
Valgono i soldi che faccio a palate, spendo
E per strada io ho perso qualcuno, c'è un motivo? nessuno
Ma mi fa incazzare come ai tempi che ho perso del fumo
Non ho una donna ma ogni sera c'ho una tipa fresca
Ma dormo sempre da solo e mi alzo col mal di testa
Voglio levarmi gli sbatti dal corpo
Da questa industria che mi spreme i liquidi come da un porco
E ci penso ogni volta che torno, che poi mi manca questo freddo
E chi mi sta intorno smezza con me l'inferno
Frate, il furgone corre, guardo il mondo dal vetro
Avvisa tutti che stasera

Quando tornerò verrò da te, dimmi là che tempo c'è
Io ti chiamerò, chissà se hai ancora del tempo per me
Quando tornerò saranno tutti quanti in strada
Sentirmi come a casa e vedere la tua faccia
Quando tornerò verrò da te, dimmi là che tempo c'è
Io ti chiamerò, chissà se hai ancora del tempo per me
Quando tornerò saranno tutti quanti in strada
Sentirmi come a casa, preparati a quando tornerò

Quando tornerò non ci sarai tu ad aspettarmi
Tutto quel che so è che mi sento in viaggio da anni
Uno come me quando ce la fa ostenta
Finché non avrà il culo su una Bentley Continental
Una come te, baby, non è mai contenta
Io schiaccio finché questa vita chiederà la cuenta
Ricordi quando ti dicevo ""non aver paura""
Quella notte chiusa in casa con la paranoia dura
Per te ho rischiato gli occhi neri come la censura
Io non credo più a nessuno adesso anche se me lo giura
Ora che sto tornando voglio i fratelli accanto
E quando son lontano vivono in quello che canto
Il cemento vivo in cui anneghiamo
Il cemento che non rinneghiamo

Io ti chiamerò, chissà se hai ancora del tempo per me
Quando tornerò saranno tutti quanti in strada

Io ti chiamerò, chissà se hai ancora del tempo per me
Quando tornerò saranno tutti quanti in strada
Sentirmi come a casa, preparati a quando tornerò

Lì da voi dopo lo show, al domani poi ci penserò
Tutti i miei guai li lascio in box e se ci sarai quando tornerò

Qualcuno no ma ciò che so è che di sicuro starò bene

Gli occhi su di me come se entravo tardi in classe
Gli occhi su di me come ora che spacco le casse
Nato in inverno in cui per non aver freddo non cerco una sposa
Mi basta soltanto una nuova calda giacca di marca costosa.
Guardo in strada fuori c’è solamente miseria
Contro I nostri cuori gelo la siberia
E la cosa buffa è che volevo te
Mica tutte queste cagne come west
Dici che mi vuoi bene, vuol dire che non mi ami
Prendo tutti sti soldi li lancio, ci faccio degli horigami
Portami rispetto e un caffè corretto

Vorrei raccontarti quello che ancora non sai
Regalarti ancora quello che ancora non hai
Oggi ieri siamo ancora in mezzo ai guai
E più soldi sono più problemi hai
Cercavamo l’oro come nel crondai
Pensavamo no di non farcela mai
Noi due soli con una marlboro light
Ci bastava così poco ora non tornerai

Volevo svoltare soltanto per non incontrare lo sguardo degli altri
Volevamo prenderci il mondo ma non c’era niente che potessi darti
Per farlo ho dovuto sporcarmi tanto che tu non riuscivi a guardarmi
Perciò oggi da grande faccio I soldi veri non faccio più finta di farli.
Per fare dei passi avanti ho perso un po’ l’equilibrio
Sta vita consuma sa di petrolio fai 2 con un litro
Ho corso così tanto dietro a tutto questo cash
Che ho lasciato indietro chi correva assieme a me.
Se avessi dovuto comprare la vita che vivo
L’amore saprebbe di niente e il successo mi farebbe schifo
I soldi non mi daranno indietro l’ultima volta che hai riso
L’oro del mondo non fonde per fare le chiavi del paradiso.
Schiacciami col tacco 12, spezza le carte di codici
Torniamo quelli che eravamo se non puoi amarmi almeno odiami
Stringimi forte fino alla morte e lasciami dire che ti amo
Poi tappami dentro una bara di soldi però con la tua foto in mano.

i miei fra italiani, africani + latino e slavi
ti fanno ""crack"", schiaccio start, non giro le chiavi
Uno dei meglio in Italy di tutti i tempi
a questi ingrati che dicono, G, tu ti vendi
rispondo fra solo la morte è gratis, tu ci pensi?
porta la tua crew che vi greemiamo tutti e 20
Tipa perfetta, cuba diretta, tuta di felpa oppure pipetta
italian rap Dan Bilzerian allergico alla tua miseria
Guèsu Cristo iconico più fuso di un Transistor
dicevi che spaccavi, eri ironico.

Dimmi in quel tavolo di scemi cosa centri tu?
Vieni da noi so che ti piacciono i tattoo
e tu lo sai che bevo e fumo
e questa ganja è il mio profumo
sappiamo tutti che faresti per dei follower in più.
Io sono zarro, zarro, zarro
con tutto questo oro giallo, giallo, giallo.

Quando entro nel locale, sboccio già dalle scale
saltano tutti in aria senza prendersi le cale
ho il cash in positivo totale
ste merde che mi dissano hanno i conti più rossi di Vale.
Zio, non è che metti la bandana e sei Tupac Shakur
fra, se porti in giro 3 sfigati fate pisciaturi
sgonfiati vai piano col Winstron
frate c'hai una tipa così cagna che la chiamo col fischio.
Balla sul mio tavolo col tanga
mi adora perché sono un traditore: Pachanga
mia madre mi voleva un uomo onesto però abbastanza presto
Francesco è cresciuto uno zanza lo stesso.
Papà mi ha dato la creatività
frate l'ho buttati dentro al cesso e ho fatto i soldi col rap
e tu non hai le basi giuste, peccato
per essere La Furia più zarro del booster specchiato.

in classifica per 52 settimane
la tua tipa c'ha un bel culo ma di faccia è un cane
me la faccio con in testa il sacchetto del pane.
Io non faccio bla bla bla, frà parlano i fatti
no pubblicità, gli haters me la fanno gratis
guardo i rapper nella vasca dei piranha
mentre mangio picanha con la più cagna.
C'ho l'oro in bocca peggio della comunione
collane con i santi, madonne e corone
tu vestiti da donna, da leader
con l'abito firmato non danno pure lo stile.
E frate sono zarro, zarro, zarro
lo vedi se mi fai uno sgarro, sgarro, sgarro
alzo bicchieri di cristallo
solo perché sono il migliore a farlo

Fühl ich mich im Kern wie'n Weisenkind auf der Suche nach dem heißen Sinn,
Der kleinen Ewigkeit nur is' das eklig weit,
Also beweg ich mich halt auf dem Lebensasphalt in Richtung FREIHEIT,
Die ein fürstlich empfängt, wenn man sich auskennt,
Dabei bleibt, seinem Schatten voraus rennt,
Nur brauch'ich auch mal Zeit um mich mal auszuruh'n, abzumatten,
Résume zu zieh'n den Rest der Welt laut auszubuhen,
Deswegen such' nach Beinen verkrampft wie'n Epileptiker,
Beweg mich tagtäglich und täglich wird es heftiger,
Ich bin nicht lebensmüde, nur brauch ich Ruhe vor morgen,
Wie kann ich für Ruhe sorgen wenn ich ständig umworben von Großstadtlärm und Musik bin,
Von Props ausgesetzt wie Kritik bin schweißgebadet wie'n fick bin,
Ich brauch' nen Tempel,

Nur schwer komm ich dagegen an,
Ihr seit der Meinung alles kalter Kaffee was ich sag,
Den nächsten Platz, die nächste Stadt seh ich am nächsten Tag,
Deswegen halt ich's nie lang aus, außer am Mikrophon,
Ich weiß, mein Refugium bleibt wie ich vorm Publikum,
Es gibt viele dessen Weitsicht ist so ausgeprägt,
Dass das momentane Herz nur kleinlich schlägt,
Sich alles peinlich bewegt, alles sinnlos klein scheint wie von oben herab,
Man nicht mehr Sinn für Ruhe nur noch Sinn fürs Toben hat,
Was ich sag wirkt verboten hart,
Aber ich sag nur was ich fühl'.

Clueso,"Hier und da komm ich auf die Idee
Ein andern Weg zu gehen
Mal verspielt und mal gefasst
Manchmal macht mir der Nase nach
Einfach das unbeholfne Spaß
Beweg mich gerne mal im Kreis
Doch jeder noch so kleine Teich,
Sollte verbunden sein zum Meer
Immer wenn ich was neues ausprobier
Lauf ich wie Barfuß über Glas

Doch ich fühl mich federleicht
Weil es sich fast immer lohnt
Und so erscheint das nichts so bleibt, wie es ist
Fast schon, wie gewohnt

Wenn mich das Neue dann berührt
Tanz ich zuerst für mich allein
Dann mach ich all die ander'n wach
Doch immer wenn was neu beginnt
Sagt auch etwas in mir das wars

Doch ich fühl mich federleicht
Weil es sich fast immer lohnt
Und so erscheint das nichts so bleibt wies ist
Fast schon wie gewohnt",Barfuss
Clueso,"An allem was man sagt, an allem was man sagt, ist auch was dran
Egal wer kommt, egal wer geht, egal es kommt nicht darauf an
Ich glaube nichts, ich glaub an dich, glaubst du an mich, ich glaub ich auch
Ich frage mich, ich frage dich, doch frag ich nicht, fragst du dich auch

Ich bin dabei, du bist dabei, wir sind dabei uns zu verlier'n
Ich bin dabei, bist du dabei, sind wir dabei uns zu verlier'n
Ich bin dabei, du bist dabei, wir sind dabei uns zu verlier'n
Ich bin dabei, bist du dabei, bin ich dabei uns zu verlier'n

Leichter als leicht, geht es vielleicht, leichter als das, was vielleicht war
Leichter als leicht, das ist nicht weit von hier zu dem, was noch nicht war
Suchst du mich, dann such ich dich, ist die Versuchung groß genug
Ich lass es zu, komm lass es zu, komm lass es uns noch einmal tun
Ich geb' nicht auf, gehst du mit mir, gehst du mit mir, mit auf uns zu
Fällt dir nichts ein, komm leg nicht auf, komm reg dich auf und komm zur Ruh

Clueso,"Keine Lust aufzustehen, auch wenn der Tag sehr sanft beginnt

Du hältst dich seufzend über Wasser, bis der Horizont verschwimmt

Ein Blick aus deinem Fenster, doch deine Gegend scheint dir fremd

Wenn niemand an dich, niemand an dich denkt
Es lässt dich eiskalt, obwohl die Sonne scheint
Wenn du dein eignes Haus verlässt

Und jeder Zug scheint berechenbar und jedes Ziel zu schnell ersetzt

Und für ein fremdes Lächeln gibst du dein letztes Hemd
Wenn niemand an dich, niemand an dich denkt

Du verlierst an Gleichgewicht im Lauf der Zeit
Wirst langsam ausgebremst vom Fall

Du bewegst dich aufgelöst im Vakuum, das Kartenhaus steht kurz vorm Fall
Selbst eine kleine Geste spielt Melodien wie eine ganze Band

Wenn niemand an dich, niemand an dich denkt
Dort wo das Glück in deiner Seele wohnt
Geht grad niemand an das Telefon

Du hängst völlig abgefuckt und interessenlos, bei dir daheim, für dich allein

Und fühlst dich einsam und verlassen wie ein Eskimo
Und nichts als Schnee und Eis soweit dein Auge reicht",Niemand an Dich Denkt
Clueso,"Ich hab schon so oft überlegt
Wie der Rest wohl wohnt und wer wohin wohl am Besten passt
Manchmal braucht es ein Weilchen bis du verstehst
Die Leute die du kennst
Sind meistens die Besten die du hast

Ich für meinen Teil lehn mich zurück
Dreh mir n spliff
Und freu mich jeden von mein Jungs zu sehn
Sobald die Tür aufgeht
Mir wer n Lächeln schenkt
Weiß ich die Welt ist groß
Doch brauch im Moment nirgendswo hingehn

Es geht mir gut wenn mich gute Musik geflasht hat
Auch wenn Regen draußen plätschert weiß ich gleich gehts mir besser
Es geht mir bestens selbst bei schlechtem Wetter
Streift Sonne aus meiner Box über die Dächer
Es geht mir gut wenn mich gute Musik geflasht hat
Auch wenn Regen draußen plätschert weiß ich gleich gehts mir besser
Es geht mir bestens mein Gemüt bleibt freundlich
Selbst bei schlechtem Wetter alles heite bis wolkig
Es geht mir gut wenn mich gute Musik geflasht hat

Wenn Zeit in Geschichte über geht
Doch keine Blüten trägt
Werden Zukunftsbilder blass
Doch wenn du dir kurz zu gemüte ziehst
Das was du überstehst gibt dir erfahrung die du noch nicht hast

Ich für meinen Teil lehn mich zurück
Dreh mir n spliff
Und freu mich wirklich jeden von mein Jungs zu sehn

Minuten aus der Ewigkeit
Schatten wie Gitarrensaiten

Trinken Wein, nichts zu bereuen
Klettern über Zäune
Schreien, tanzen. Freude
Kein Gefühl von Müdigkeit

Vor uns das Meer, der Berg im Hintergrund
Komm lass uns
Lass uns noch was bleiben

Vor allem einen Anfang
Formlose dunkle Weiden
Ziehen hinter schmutzigen Scheiben
Und die Nacht mustert aus schwarzen Augen
Still und unbewegt
Und der Zug, er fährt so langsam
Ich glaub
Ich glaub der kommt nie zu spät

Komm' wir sieben unsere Erinnerung
Welch ein Stoff zum schweigen
Vor uns das Meer, der Berg im Hintergrund
Komm lass uns

Schrieb Verse, Kummer und schlief
Über das Licht das ich gesehen hab
Von dem ich mich blenden ließ
Andere sitzen jetzt wie Affen
Vielleicht für nichts geschminkt
Große Augen aus Smaragden
Und der Bildschirm flimmert blind
Irgendwo klingelt ein Telefon
Jemand will sagen was ihn bewegt
Ich seh auf deine Jacke
Durch die Maschen irren Sterne

Kratzt sich am Hals

Während er weite empor steigt
Er schaut nach unten aus dem Fenster
Alles blau, kein Dschungel und keine Stadt
Er fühlt sich alleine und so schwach
Kurz vor der Ohnmacht
Und dann schwerelos

Er löst sein Gurt stößt sich ab
Wie von allein
Und fängt an zu schweben
Ängstlich sucht er Halt
Mittem im Raum und hat zeit
Die Sterne im weiten All mit dem Mond zu sehen
Und dem blauen Planeten

Loaded it up with mother earth

Stare into the embers on the first of November
And remember you were born a true son of Virginia

I was thrown to the ground as my world broke asunder
Truly we are living in an age of wonder
I wept like a child as the son rose above her
Truly we are living in an age of wonder
Truly we are living in an age of wonder

You'll forgive me if I seem somewhat vexed by your statement
However, um, if that is the way you recall it happening
You go ahead and you put your name there at the bottom
And, uh, thank you for your time
You have a good night, now",Son of Virginia
Clutch,"Every time I set to write
Lyricals on the women
I always seem to end up the victim of some terrible ass-kicking

So now I'm telling myself
""Friend, why you got the obsession?""
Here it is now, people to the best of my recollection

It goes against my catholic upbringing
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
Sucker for the witch

I can tell you precisely
Where this all began
Salem, Massachusetts and I was hardly a man

I fell madly in love with
Some brand of Stevie Nicks
Oh, I begged and I pleaded like a fiend for a fix

I must unburden my guilty conscience
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
May God have mercy on my wicked soul
I can't help myself I'm a sucker for the witch
I might deny her but my heart will never resist
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker

She's made her appearances
In many the rhyme
And that's my cross to bear
Until the end of time

Better call the inquisition
Better put me to the test
Give me exorcism
For I am truly possessed

It goes against my catholic upbringing
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
Sucker for the witch
I must unburden my guilty conscience
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
May God have mercy on my wicked soul
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker for the witch
I might deny her but my heart will never resist
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker
For the witch

It goes against my catholic upbringing
I admit it, I'm a sucker for the witch
May God have mercy on my wicked soul
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker for the witch
I might deny her but my heart will never resist
I can't help myself, I'm a sucker",Sucker for the Witch

Endlessly I couldn't cure your sores

Did you say move that mountain for you 
I'd spread the wings of time and make it all but crumble away today 
If we could watch it together decay 
And when you said to enlighten me

One hand washes the other there's nothing more to discover

But it became the blackness of your heart and inside
It made me laugh, and I just had to laugh.

That you had just definitely have changed and
Changed back into what you used to be and what
