Fuel,"Rain falls down like your alibi
Thought you held the stars in the sky 
Till I found your love
Was a lie
And I lost my life
And the days with you my love
All your lines I cannot erase
Pull your fingers from round my brain
But you put this hate 
In my eyes
But I love the scars
From the days with you my love",Days With You
Fuel,"The angels cry tonight
As the rain washed that lonely place
From their eyes
And softly as she said
You know our hearts will never get
Out alive
She made no sound
Then goodbye
She said love don't call on me again
I never want to cry like this
Die like this
No more favors my old friend
I never want to cry like this
Die like this
And so we danced alone
But pain is always so betrayed
With our eyes
But I know now
On hearts the faithless can't rely
Do reams make no sound
As they die

Remember the nights 
By the river side 
No secrets from our sins
And the world would not subside
And the worst thing
Is knowing
That ill survive",Die Like This
Fuel,"Never thought id be this way
Hung on every word you say
Scars that you gave to me
I earned all to eagerly
'Cause down inside of you
Deep inside of you
Down inside of you
Is all of heaven and hell
Everyday is all the same
Take the pleasure with the pain
Things that you put me through
Never is enough for you

So I'll fly
Find another life
I know somewhere its right
So why can't I forget you",Down Inside of You
Fuel,"I've seen you hanging round
This darkness where I'm bound
And this black hole I've dug for me
And silently within
With hands touching skin
The shock breaks my disease
And I can breathe

And all of your weight
All you dream
Falls on me it falls on me
And your beautiful sky
The light you bring
Falls on me, it falls on me

Your faith like the pain
Draws me in again
She washes all my wounds for me
The darkness in my veins
I never could explain
And I wonder if you ever see
Will you still believe?

And all of your weight
All you dream
Falls on me it falls on me
And your beautiful sky
The light you bring
Falls on me, it falls on me

Am I that strong
To carry on?
I might change your life
I might save my world
Could you save me?

And all of your weight
All you dream
Falls on me it falls on me
And your beautiful sky
The light you bring
Falls on me, it falls on me

Fuel,"I gave you all all my soul
You gave it all away
You tried so hard to blame
But there's no more words to say
Got no alibi
Now you're out of lies

Am I getting through to you
How much more should I define
Nevermore to be your fool
Am I getting through to you

I tried so hard to shake it off
You threw it in my face
Under your skin your wicked ways
The sweetness I can't taste
And all that you provide
All that you disguise

Am I getting through to you
How much more should I define
Nevermore to be your fool
Am I getting through to you

Tripping on your wires

I caught a heart attack when I heard my cousin ?
In Avenue D. in Brooklyn New York City
Ever since I used my man I moved to Jersey
But realistically, God, could of called me early
'Cause I got a big bop I'm wanted by the block
I take a ruff-neck chicken make stop in stone top
'Cause I roll with the army of sixty-eight
The Privates' don't make the orders it's the General that makes the wig-wack
Buy her back, buy a cat, I got scratched in a day to kidnap
And at night I was back and the Jeep got attacked by a gang that sold crack
But the posse was strapped it was nothin' but crap!!
I got cuffed in the back, in the jail there were rats
So I pulled out my mack to get out of this crap
Though I wish I could zap outta here but I quack like a dog
That pass gats so I put the gas mask on the mic
There were blasts cause I do it it's my task
And all the jumper the guys that I see to me pass the class
Check out the vocab, it'll get out, then get it, do it again
Gift of the guy if you're good you're good, if you're bad you're bad

[Chorus]
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I want to know, how hard do you want to it? (Hard as it can get)

One, two (One, two), three, four (Three, four)
Hardcore (Hardcore), hardcore (Hardcore)
Yo, watch yourself for your health I'll snatch your last breath
Then I left you up for another one bites the dust
You couldn't ride me if you went behind the bush, gush
Leave the style alone, don't try to follow me
'Cause a life of the hood make it a little triggery
So keep your eyes on the prize, don't be surprised
'Cause on my half I may pull out a semi-automatic sixty-eight
Watch around my back it's mainly static
Droppin' emcees like a bad habit
Here come the Pras with a new package

Mad and they ignorance, think they can test the performance of an ancient (Rapper!)
Let me break it down in a dialect (Badder!)
Easier said than what the mono said
'Cause there's more than righter rapper, paid for the rapper be-bop
'Cause he said everybody's rappin', them and they momma
So when I grab the mic I grab it like a gangster
Microphone sniper 'cause it'll be the prowler

Launch it, it's trife, no magic, the realistic maggot
Don't leave the gadget or you'll be gat it
Simple, the riddle, who's the monkey in the middle
What's the goose, um!
So let me cut his neck loose yo
I keep it positive and not so negative
These is when you diss, emcees take it
So send it to they call the battle
I'ma raw I let it rappin' now I'm more
Your ball, you're waitin' for me to fall, but I won't

[Chorus]

I gotta jump on the A-Train, I saw cat with a scat he was blowin' like Coltrane
My boys' said give him a call, I gave him a dollar, he said are you a rapper?
Kids have a seat and don't miss a beat and listen to the battle of the saxin' in your emcee

Now Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock call
(It could mean rewind the gun-check me baby)

I rock and shock the dough is show squeeze and cheese and whether pleasin'
(It could mean rewind the gun-check me baby)
I rock and shock the dough is show squeeze and cheese and whether pleasin'
Coolin' breezin' at the teas and how can emcees do was sneeze
(Flower, blow!)

Yo check it out. 
This is the boy Wyclef from Translators, I'm coming from the
Booga Basement with a roots drink in my hands. 
So put the Rotts tonics in the air, 
yeah cause I'm-a start this one off like this. 
Cause niggas are living like there ain't no tomorrow. 
I nuked this on the S900 cause I couldn't fford a 1100. 
I'm-a start this one a little something like this. Here we go.
Hey yo people you're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You get caught in the terra asside em and ga morro
Father, forgive him for he know not what he done
When the bum search for drums, the son search for condoms
He seek no, with his ring but with his head
That leave many dead in hospital beds; now you and death are newlyweds
So before I enter the tunnel I step back and shake it
Is it world the death or better life in a casket
Destruction of the flesh, new reporter wasn't coming
The devil cursed him cause he couldn't follow 10 commandments

[Chorus]
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You open up your eyes and them was ga marrow. WOO!
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up your eyes.

I called up the VP, she told me she was busy watching TV with Roxy
I told her I was coming, she said that ain't necessary
three's a crowd, so what's the philosophy?
Another girl trying to take my girl away from me, easy
Fuck the door, I jumped through the window
Somewhere over the rainbow
Paranable and the bitch still in my home
Stick stick in your socket, I sacrifice you like a live rabbit
Fatal attraction the coffin's the cabinet
Cause in the 90's girls got dicks
So keep the light on and make sure that the chick don't that back
She said that she did it with some girl named Lisa
I said what's the boot yo, she pulled the camcorder
Bust it, so what's the charge, you called me a womanizor?
I tried to say sorrym she said say sorry for Taquisha.
Chairs come flying my way like balls at basketball practice.
Call the priest cause she's turning to the exorcist
She kicked me out cause she was paying for the apartment
That's real, you got no girl, if you got no money to spend
But she had loved me for my mind and my poetic skills
But bow i'm checking magazings and getting cheap thrills
Asking myself when will it end?
Cause when it came to sex, my hand was my best friends

[Chorus]

I had a cousin like a brother
He tried to play me undercover
He said I didn't bang her
But the girl was his secret lover
But I played stupid like my brain had no minerals
It's so hard to say good-bye we singing at the funeral
Girls smash it up easy, when they know they got the bugsy
He used to sleep alone, but now he's riding Mrs. Daisy
You say all my business my life's my life my knife's my knife
So I be the lion that guards the trife
But at the party, I still move my waistline
A girl approached me and asked me for the time
I said; no disrespect, but check the watch on your wrist
And if you're looking for a hit check Charles Bronson from Death Wish
Then All of a sudden her man pushed me from the back
I turned out real cool- I said why did you do that?
The name is Clef, Clef bon
Then mark my word that I'm-a break your fucking arm
Unless you apologize and pick on someone your size
Not too cookoo-hit you-but the 4 to the 5
Point it to your nose
Now your blood turns to snow.

You want to battle swing?  I bring commanding men, like I was king.
In all your dreams I write the horror flick of Stephen King.
Cling to false, also those papers say ock.
I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera.
Ba-lang-balang-balang-to-de-man-de-rock-'cause I love thee.
If you live by the sword, you will be die by the gun,
'Cause all guys tell lies, and more girls commits it.
I was ordered to code red, but now I'm chillin' with a few good men.
Assassination on the kid from the capitol.
I never play the soap opera, but now I'm a general hospital.
Condition critical, spirit over who's the physical.
So if I die, catch me at the funeral.
I'll fly away, oh glory,
With a mic in my hand, to a land where only God knows me,
And the angels write raps on holy paper.
I said: I'm lookin for Jesus, he said: take the escalator
One flight up, is guaranteed you'll be there.
My sister'd be there, my mother'd be there.

Never had to battle with a bullet proof vest.
They call me cock-weasel, but I still cave a chest.
I don't wear Jheri curls, 'cause I'm nah from the West.
No disrespect to the West, true indeed,
I rock it to the East, the East is the seed.
To see that them days back, yo sheepskins and hot tracks.
Peace to Mr. Magic, things are getting tragic.
Now we on some new stuff, I never feared the Ku Kluk.
My own clan is actin' up, I blame it on the Phillie blunt.
Whatcha gonna do, kids are acting oooohhhh.
Hill is gettin' fed up, yo, where's the coporate at?
A mister three-piece-suit.
Check the square roots, Girbauds and Timberland boots.
Nah, that's the serpents, and know them garment tips.

If it's snake doesn't rattle,

This land's your land, this land's my land.

Put the needle to your skin, feel reality's heroin.

But what the hell was so wonderful 'bout cotton in the farm?

The harder they come, the harder they fall, so come one, come all.

Out of Motorville land of the ill kill.

Back up back up boy, don't get me started
Still the MC, hit the target, you get bombarded yeah

Pass me a SCUD missile, so I can bomb the land

Yo Pras (what?) Yo Pras (what?) Some start to wonder
Some see lightning, some hear thunder
Shades of a black man, maybe the black panther
Making MC's run when it come to rapping I'm the Darth Vader
I'm not regular, consider me irregular
From the regular rapper ones that lumber
But I come from a slum where many bum
Sometimes I cooled out, while my boys were in prison
I always told them that right, overrules wrong
Cause ever since a boy mama told me judgment they will come son
So I watch what I do, what I say, how I PLAY
And hope that I make it through the next day
Cause the streets are like a jungle, they got me say
Cause Tarzan's a black man
So I'm waiting for a break in the record company
So I could take you MC's, back to camp I mean
Cause with a flick of my wrist, I come rewind another rhyme
I got more rhymes than a church got wines 
Ever since middle school, I used to, rule
The ? mule, people called my talent beautiful
Never lost a battle, they thought I was buck wild
?
They didn't know that a ReFugee could rock so well
So here's the resurrection, of Pras, Wyclef, and L

Check me or my team as I recharge your body [Repeat: x4]

Living to be given, chilling like Bob Dylan
Like Michael I'm Thrilling, I'm not dealing to be illing
Running a mask ?, like the task force
The cause is laws, the laws that broke your jaw
Now I'm, getting raw on a thing like a mean machine
(Why you running around with the same old thing?
You know what I mean, yeah)
I search and search, I start to faint
But never never never fall in entertain
Don't beam me up Scotty, I'm Audi like John Gotti
Driving in black Caddy

[Lauryn Hill]
Success for the next man is success for myself
Vanity's vanity yet I still wanted wealth
I know there's a true God, but it still makes me think
Of Yusef, now is the notty dread dead?
Believe in the Bible because it promise eternity
Six six six, that makes you, my adversary
So I, watch my back and hopin I don't get taxed
I used to, rip the rapper cause they said we'd been said wack
I know what the critics they say, keep it commercial
I used to freestyle, but everything now is rehearsal
I miss the old school, so tell me what will I do?
I guess I'll start a revolution with the Translator Crew, so

Prim' you up, but don't mistake me for Sunoco
Cuss to get loose, now you got the micro' Joe
Who talking about hope? Poquito dinero
Means I work hard, but got no money, and that ain't funny
Hey honey when you work for free see it's hard to get a lady baby
But they say good things come to those wait
So I wait, no ego trip, and on the mic I penetrate
Elevate as I battle for high stakes
Many gamble, I eat you like an animal
Cause he gambled for the dime that he didn't have
He woke up in a dream and found his body in a body bag
Wyclef pissed cause, oh what I really said is
Is I'm that funky, big up def in pig Latin man, 
A lot of rappers try to out rap, but miss me yo
But I'm asking every teachers everything he know
There's always one trick, to make em slip
So let me predict in pure trick I'm sure the rap form will recharge

If you wanna snap (SNAP), if you wanna crack (CRACK)
If you wanna shoot, give me a second so I can lay flat
Cause this, some the cemetery's, the reality
Where the tough guys get buried in their property
Word to Sampson, the tone will get you hung
I had a friend, they murdered his father and his three-year-old son
I heard him cursin' the essence of the, the (PAUSE) committed the crime
But ah, murder got no time
The country has no law, it's either rich or poor
I'm out the back door, I got nuttin' to fight for
I'm sailin' on a boat like a goat - I clear my throat
When I got to Brooklyn, I was broke, so I selled coke
I look in through microscope, for my country and the hurt
My eyes bleed, I see Aaron Steed, the Haitian Pope
Figure or Dundee, the-riginal Malcom X
Swing like the ki's, so should I put on David Tomerfest
Though I'm humberlicious strugglin' to jump
Let me blow her upper-her bubble in your face - that'cha ego!
Aiyyo, freeze-funk, you got to stay stable
Watch out for the devil, he comes after you after the revival
When will he come, what will he do, what will he say?
That's all a mystery, but have your hand grenade
So you can blow the motherfucker away
Beep, beep, I gotta make a sale so I can eat
So Praswell, grab the mic and be complete

(Pras)
Huh, lovin' the wreck in effect, will be all in checkmate
Another style for Praswell to translate
For those who can't relate to stay down my - no-man wait
No mistake, when I tell you, your prophet is a fake

(Wyclef Jean)
You said a contract on a Haitian, three-hundred g's
Your sharpshooters are lousy, we mend to-high-be-high hoodies
So show your face-a when you waste, I know who's smokin'
The bigger that you try to put out yours just makes me Mr. Nobody
Take high wit'cha just right, it'll be like Michael get ordered, a viper you know!!
Yeah, a viper cause you might lose a life to the side by like
What did I have to in the line of the barkin' of the bright side
You tried to scare me but I won't mover-a
The bully of the block becomes the hour of the glock
So cuckoo!! The sounds I run are rollin' with the bodyguard
But don't forget the day it's sunny but it'll be foggy

And in the funeral, you'll be singin' a new tune
May your soul rest on the moon (?Jack in wood spoon!!?)
In Channel Seven, you said: ""Death before Cut""
You killed so many that your conscience ended up - whattup? (WHAT!!)
Aiyyo black men, you're dyin' by a dozen cousin
So all I do is walk away yo' Prince as if nothin' happened
You call me a punk, I gotta step cause all you did was flex
But don't get closer cause the kid still gotta keep his rep
See I'm known for the crew like the jewel was the jewel
Like the follow got the boo, like the miller got the boo
Let the fool cop the man-jewel, suck up, up the ?cool-lew?
Oh why you got the ha-ha-lew-lew?
I got the rap loose, so sci-bi-dee-bob-bob, you don't stop
You do the rap-rap, from hip-hop to be-bop, from be-bop
To beep-beep, the Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off beep-beep
I gotta make a sale so I can eat, beep, beep
The Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off, you know I got no time to sleep, so beep-beep

Watch me go back to my land and then there will be a thing
Gorillas in the mist, where everything, and the light becomes a priest
They put up they guard, they pump up they fists
Now I'm number one on they motherfuckin' hit-list...
Goin' down for first degree of manslaughter
Makin' change out of emcee's makin' them outta quarters
That's they value, that's what they worth
Cause the first shall be last and the last shall be first, yeah
What we learned was to burn, now cause you see-came
With that machette, it's your turn
It's not funny, but twenty a month is what you earn baby

(Lauryn Hill)
Well I'm as cool to ya the mic I'm checkin' comin' from my temple
With a message, to deliver, but the back is very simple
I'm the girl ""Yankee"" rollin' wit' the kids from Haiti
Coolin' as a mighty grab who gets the last laugh hahaha...
You bite size with my Haitian from they stinks as my ""Yankee""
Wonderin' who was the first to pull over girl as soon as it came out son
My history - a hypocrite, so what we gonna do?
The dope is dope is only get the man since that is true
So hip-hip with my lip as I rip with a felt tip
With a righteous situation, interpretation, a graduation
Your ventilation, and education, segregation, emancipation
A capitalization, it's agration, not separation, ya breath the Haitians...

",Refugees on the Mic
Fugees,"Check the crippled man, sitting in the church
My conscience hurts, flesh like me hits the dirt
She's paralyzed from her feet to her thighs
 
And the man who pulled the trigger didn't even lose his necktie
Hi, I check Jimmy cutting hair at the barbershop
He plays the bass guitar, like David plays the harp
His knowledge name is Greek, cause whenever he speaks

He's got the wisdom of King Solomon bags in his eyes from no sleep
Sometimes he thought of the fame in Madison Square Garden
So some seek stardom, but they forget Harlem
But seeking first of all the kingdom of God is what my pops told me

So if I fall, could the choir catch me
I flew away, on a mountain, got tempted by Satan
Got bitten by a cobra, but the Lord took my venom
So who's side am I on? I'm on the righteous
Always check the lyrics, no time to contradict

[Chorus]
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem [Repeat: x3]
They, brothers, sisters, families, people, we, brothers
Keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

Well aiyyo family I beseech you, in the hopes that I may reach you
My mother taught me one day that this mid-day would come someday
Born to talk that jive, with peaky hair grown wild
And teachers disliked me, cause I knew where my culture be

So now yeah mom I read history, I can't neglect my passion see
Rock it's kind of new to me, cause my true love was poetry
White was good and bad was black but black was just a massa lackey
Built for that B. Nimble Jack and I'd like to save you from the wicked

D-Dog clear I wouldn't be wet
The black to mourn, tomorrow's death
The evil things, glad that I, while angels wrote this violence why?
Help me make me comprehend my black berserk and why cast it

Time to blaze the angels nappy heads are braided that you make me
See what's hard for me that don't make you flee
When I enter your vicinity, you see my God ain't never after me
So yo I be wised up with Greek

To go and be, the last and good and see what's wrong with me
And through your insecurity of me and my ability
So bredren won't you let me be or has thou asked to much from thy
To tell the truth and not to lie? Oh my

[Chorus: x2]

But as I grew, I knew cause the master told me
From a baby to a woman from a woman to a baby
Life is so short, hardcore becomes hard-corpse
Step in a coffin where the money's no longer the source

There we go, there we go, there we go
I got mine now won't you get yours, we never open doors
So we neglect, and don't protect the ones that's not
People never really seem to care

And then they cry out, ""My people! Why aren't we treated equal?""
As we flee, we flee our own communities
We leave our family in poverty
And then we blame it on another, so family please recover

Oh see'mon please come now with you can come with me now and blow now
If you want to, we're through

Fugees,"Delivered straight from the temple
Hip hop ya don't stop
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, rock!
Well as an infant I was born into religion,

My mother called me Baptist
But what she forgot to mention
Was what Baptist meant.
The story goes God sent his only begotten son

To make sure that I would have one.
As I learned in Sunday school,
He's... to disrespect my mother and father would be taboo.
But as I grew I met a Jew, a Catholic and a Protestant

And couldn't figure out where Baptist fit.
Hastily got crazy that ya made me see
Brother has confronted me with such ambiguity.
Are you Jehovah, Buddha, or shall I call you Allah?

All the words for Heavenly Father.
I just like to be a scholar on the subject called theology,
So that's how mi figure,
While they call themselves Christians, usedÃ¢??a call me nigga.

And... black hole leaves no control over thought.
I leave my body to see where the pits
Go high when the physical takes control.
No communications with the inner self

The prize is the otherwise wise, who has spiritual health.
Got to explain, they had the problems visions of gettin' along with herself,
Cheap on the corner, cornered herself and becomes a mourner.
Logic, brothers -

Ah, yo sista, can Prazwel and Wyclef get some - check it out.
Delivered straight from the temple,
Hip hop ya don't stop
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, rock!

Delivered straight from the temple,
I had no time to sample,
My cousin's name was Samuel,
I wasn't allowed to use the turntables,

My dad was a preacher so rap music was your devilism,
And if the wordsÃ¢??d say ""Thank you, Lord"",
I couldn't listen.
So I used to sneak to listen to DJ Red Alert,

To check the competition.
And DJ Red Alert goes berserk,
'Cause as a young lad I had a big rap pad,
'Cause he who waited to practice would someday be the greatest guy.

So I checked them as they flippin' 
Sometimes their padsÃ¢??re not slippin'
They think they rippin' rappin'
The only 'rappin' they doing is in the room before they packin'.

You gained the world, sucker
But you lost your soul.
The devil brought you us, all you do is sell a foe.
Life after death could be eternal fire,

So some get blunted but you're back on earth when it's all over. 
Mama said that blunt was a stun to the brain 
So some say, ""I don't smoke"",
But on a [unknown] he sniff coke 

He won the lotto - now he dies of an overdose 
While the bum he picked a hole to sleep, he wanted a deep throat. 
So ask yourself the question Ã¢??Who's really maxin'?Ã¢??, 
'Cause some check in but don't check out and need a Hell or Heaven high 

But to some Earth is Hell, in Heaven's death 
So they pretend to be Hades and kill till there's nothin' left Ã¢?? ha. 
But I might hit Ã¢??em with a gun that's harder than all guns 
My check from the temple - check the text 

(It's got the news to get wreck) 
Can I get a witness? Check the text. 
Get wrecked. Check the text, check the text 
(It's got the new [unknown] to get wreck), can I get a witness? 

(Check the text), here we go yo 
Well I arrive let me tell you what I see in my third eye.
Many die they call a battle, they got crucified.
Justice is righteous in the eyes of the beholder, 

While the younger the better,
But the older the wiser 
Mama used to read in deep from the Book of Proverbs
But the bird said the word was absurd, have ya heard? 

Knowledge - I come to teach 
While I increase ya decrease 
Some say peace, but on a street a .45's my piece 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise be to thee Jah Ã¢?Â¦.

Come
On the nineteentheth of October I remember 
Startin' my life on as a natural lever 
'Cause I lick one-two-three/four-five-six/seven shots 

While any priest here builds his church on a solid rock.
Hit me! 
So feel the spirit comin' from the Heaven above.
(Hey, Pras, how could you be a hood and full of so much love?)

Hip-hop's where it starts, I tried to master the art.

The man behind the mask you thought was Batman is Bill Clinton

Connie Chung brung the bomb as it comes from Oklahoma
Things are getting serious, Kuumbaya
On a mountain Satan offered me, Manhattan help me Jah Jah
You can't search me without probable cause
Or that proper ammunition they call reasonable suspicion
Listen I bring friction to your whole jurisdiction
You planted seeds in my seat when I wasn't lookin
Now you ask me for my license registration
""WHERE THE FUCK"" do I work

Well I'm an MC, I'm down with the Fugees
Mother Mary caught a flashback like Rodney now the cops got Lolly

The subconscious psychology that you use against me
If I lose control will send me to the penitentiary
Such as Alcatraz, or shot up like al Hajj Malik Shabazz
High class get bypassed while my ass gets harassed

Eliminate then break
Navigate to rejuvenate thoughts of suicide with my nickel plate
Reconciliation came from my enemy-friend
Who said family don't bend

Now who would think that your best friend
Would be your worst enemy and your enemy your best friend
Stare into the air inspiration from the atmosphere
I think of old ghosts, that ain't even here

My family tree consists of street refugees
A ghetto land, where we talk slang
Stolen cars bang, like my chitty bang-bang sh-bang
For the heads, we ain't sellin' cocaine today
So refrain and let my family reign okay

Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family that's the code to obey

But if I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family sticks together and we never betray

Nah fuck that
Fifty-two pick up, no cops around
Fifty-two thousand in cash, I don't want no savings bonds
Have the money ready, I smell something fishy
Your wife's in my custody
One false move and you'll find her body in the sea
That's the voice of the kid, that's the kidnapper
I do my work and then I catch my ticket to Jamaica
Meet me in the alley, make sure you bring the money
This ain't the seventies I'm far from a jive turkey

My circle it can't be broken
Open, cut-throatin', provokin'
Record promotin, tokens chokin' on they words like smoke and
Cause we soft spoken, doesn't mean that we've forgotten
Your bootie smells rotten and one day you will be gotten
See joker's is scatter-brained, their focus is unrestrained
My army is trained, you never find us beefin' in vain
Cause I've seen fire and I've seen rain
You claim fame, while modest niggas remain
I can judge a character like Ito judge a verdict
And if you bringin' threats I give you sex if I ain't heard it
See poppin' shit's about your attitude and how you word it
I've seen the biggest niggas on the block get murdered
And they deserved it
Or so the beast said when they served it
That shit is nervous
So what's my purpose?
Family, we must preserve it
Your number's retired
I hope you like the hell fires
You'll be screamin' Murder she Wrote like Chaka Demus and Pliars

Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family that's the code to obey

But if I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family sticks together and we never betray

We used to jump rope
But now we gun hope
Bustin' shots off of project roof tops
Sending signals with the blunt smoke
Ock, don't talk a lot if you can't hold it in lock
If you think lips sink ships
Imagine full glock clips
I hold a glass of Remy Martin
Gettin' milks by the carton
Extortin' the light weights for thinkin' they important
The night pays and heavenly ways
Ain't nothin' free ah
Knowledge of your family and steppin' to your B.I.
You see I, stay on top of shit like a fly
My niggas reach when they got beef
Then jet down to South Beach
Yo mouthpiece is yappin'
I hear it in your rap and
My family is thick so that bullshit could never happen

Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family that's the code to obey

If I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play

Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken george became dead george stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon

How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Say me say Many moni, Say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Say me say Many moni, Say me say many, many, many

I get mad frustrated when I rhyme
Thinking of all them kids who try to do this
For all the wrong reasons
Seasons change, mad things rearrange
But it all stays the same like the love doctor Strange
I'm tame like the rapper,
Get red like a snapper when they do that
Got your whole block saying ""True dat""
If only they knew that,
It was you who was irregular,
Sold your soul for some secular
Muzak that's wack,
Plus you use that loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style
Your attempts are futile, ooh child
Your puerile,
Brain waves are sterile
You can't create, you just wait to take, my tape's
Laced with malice
Hands get calloused
From grippin' microphones from here to Dallas
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me,
I get Inner Visions like Stevie
See me, ascend from the chalice like the weed be
Indeed be like Khalil Muhammad
MC's make me vomit
I get controversial
Freak your style with no rehearsal
Oh, contraire mon frere
don't you even go there
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
I dare to tear into your ego,
We go, way back like some ganja and pelequo
Or Coleco, Vision
My mind makes incisions in your anatomy
And I'll back this with Deuteronomy
Or Leviticus, God made this word
You can't get with this
Sweet like licorice,
Dangerous like syphillis, yeah.

I used to be underrated
Now I take iron, makes my shit constipated
I'm more concentrated.
So on my day off,
With David Sonnenberg I play golf
Run through Crown Heights screaming out Mazel Tov
Problem with no man
Before black, I'm first human
Appetite to write like Frederick douglass with a slave hand
Street pressure word to poppa, I ain't goin' under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Motolla
Momma always told me ""You're one in a million""
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal, ""How does it feel?""
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal.
Cause the whole world's out of order
So at night the fiend's dance on Grease with John Travolta
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guinness Stout
Brother brother can't you get this through your head
It's a set up by the fed's they're scoping us with their Infra - reds.

How many mic's do you rip on the daily

How many mic's do I rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many

Too many MC's not enough Mic's
Exit your show like I exit the turnpike
Dice and dynamite like dolomite
double deuce delight, I don't Dick Van Dyke
Startlight to starbrite the freaks come out at night
Like my man Wyclef (I wear my sunglasses at night)
And my panache will mosh your entourage
Squash your squad and hide your body under my garage.
And when the cops come lookin'
I'll be bookin' to Brooklyn
Leave the trails broken flippin' tokens to Hoboken
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin
Drivin' in my fast car playin' Tracy Chapman

How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Many moni, say me say many, many, many
How many mic's do you rip on the daily

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby

Make him express how he feels and maybe

Putting pressure on my spine trying to get L-Boog to wind
I backed up off him then caught him with five finger to his face
I had to put him in his place
This kids invading my space
But then I recognized the smile, but I couldn't place the style
So many fronts in his mouth, I thought he was the Golden Child
Then it hit me that's Tariq from off the street around my Grams
I haven't seeen him since fifteen, when he got booked for doing scams
I tried to walk away but he wouldn't let me leave
He ran up quick behind me asking, ""Yo what happened to my nigga Steve?""
Steve was like this kid I went with back in Grammar School
I chuckled knucklehead I seen him yesterday he's cool
He's busted, ""so who you checking for now?""

I'm still at large engaged with my entourage
Me and Godfather and a 67 Dodge
I stepped out the note to post up my guard
Searching for my car that was stolen from Scotland Yard
My first instinct was to check the chop shop garage
As I rung the bell someone tapped me on my back
I turned around to look it was a rookie in a mask
He said, ""I got a itchin' on my trigger
Don't move nigga I'm taking you for murder.""

My knees knock as I step back for a clearer shot
Well did you shoot him? Naw kid I didn't have the balls

To do what you gotta do
So you'll be back with France CU

Through any contest
I'm victorious
Still keep it real, if you will and manifest
Through your skills, not by how many shells you peel

Play the nutcracker
Rough-neck rednecks make me no bother
Time after time, ask Cyndi Lauper
Boss, you don't want to fuckk with my partners

Straight to the head
With the speed of a bullet
Cuttin' jokers off at the meeky-freeky gullet
Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative
Head rushers I give to creative kids and fiends
Dreams of euphoria
Aurora
To another galaxy
Phallic-sy
Be this microphone, but get lifted
Lyrically I'm gifted
Burn on in without the roach clip (it)
Henders, mind-bender
Pleasure sender
So frequently your nerve endings belong to me
Wrongfully you put me down not receiving the full capacity of my smoke
Wack niggas choke
From the fumes that I emote
Or emit shit
See even I feel the mahogany L
Natural hallucinogen
Turning boys to men again
With estrogen dreams
Release blues, yellows and greens
From Brownsville to Queens

I creep like a theif, no doubt the man's swift
I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cleef
You stand stiff and got the nerve to let your man riff
And start flakin' like dandruff
C'mon son my steelo's tight
Cause by far I'm the best producer on the mic
Born to write, analytical conceptions
With precision and leave lyrical incisions",The Score
Fugees,"Another MC lose his life tonight, Lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

I haunt MCs like Mephistopheles, bringing swords of Damocles
Secret service keep a close watch as if my name was Kennedy
Abstract raps simple with a street format
Gaze into the sky and measure planets by parallax
Check out the retrograde motion, kill the notion
Of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation
I feel like Rockwell, somebody's watching me
I got no privacy whether on land or at sea
And for you biting zealots, your raps are cacophonic
Hypocrite, critic, but deep inside you wish you had the pop hit
It hurts don't it, a refugee come to your turf
And take over the earth

See my rhymes, are the type of fly rhymes
That can only get down with my crew
And if you try, to take lines or bite rhymes
We'll show you how the refugees do

Yeah, yeah behold, as my odes, manifold on your rhymes
Two MCs can't occupy the same space at the same time
It's against the laws of physics
So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics
Rap rejects my tape deck, ejects projectile
Whether Jew or gentile, I rank top percentile
Many styles, more powerful than gamma rays
My grammar pays, like Carlos Santana plays ""Black Magic Woman""
So while you fuming, I'm consuming mango juice under Polaris
You just embarrassed cause it's your last tango in Paris

And even after all my logic and my theory
I add a ""Motherfucker"" so you ignant niggas hear me
Crew remember take notes, as I sow my rap oats
And for you biting zealots, here's a quote

Another MC lose his life tonight, Lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

You can try but you can't divide the tribe
These cats can't rap, mister author I feel no Vibe
The magazine says the girl should have went solo
The guys should stop rapping - vanish like Menudo
Took it to the heart, but every actor plays his part
As long as someone was listening, I knew it was a start
For me to get my chance, grab my pen and revamp
Do a cameo while everybody do the dance
Quick now, cause you running out of luck-a
Playing Mr. Big, I'm gonna get you sucka
While you munching at your luncheon
I'll be planning your assassination, then hit you like the Dutchman

I compress sound sets with my rap DBX
Then drop vocals on my 456 Ampex
Bring terror to the shop of horror
As she cry, ""mi amor,"" the phantom dies in the opera
And to the younguns who carry gadgets
And kill six days a week, then rest on the Sabbath
Violence ain't necessary, unless you provoke me
Then get buried like the great Mussolini
And for you biting zealots, your rap styles are relics
No matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet",Zealots

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Cállate, no me digas ná' que yo te ví

Un amor así como tu no vale la pena si te vas que te vaya bien

She was walking down the street so I said ""Hello
I'm Kangol from UTFO."" And she said ""So?""
And I said ""So?!? Baby don't you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
Cause I'm Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I'm concerned ain't nobody greater
From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn't be upset
Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo.""
I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

I wanna go and bounce the moon

Fun Lovin' Criminals,"I was working at the club in 1995
Sunday was the night that the gay club came alive 
See, I would carry ice 
And the crowd was just so nice that my phobia drowned
While I was getting down 

[Chorus]
I met the finest girl of my life
That night, at gay night
I met the finest girl of my life
That night, at gay night
Gay night, it's all right, don't be uptight

See, half way through the evening 
I saw this women gleamin' from across the room
She was with some guys
But when they gave me the eyes 
I knew she was just their friend
We went out all weekend

Fun Lovin' Criminals,"I was a fiend (fiend) before I became a teen 
I melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream 
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated 
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated 

Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say - Yes y'all! 
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small 
Cool, cool 'Cause I don't get upset 
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet 

Back to the lab without a mic to grab 
So then I add all the rhymes I had 
One after the other one, then I make another one 
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done 

I get a craving like a fiend for nicotine 
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean 
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and 
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and 

Thought of 
Cuz it's sort of an addiction, 
Magnetized by the mixing 
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in 

The mic is a drano, volcanoes erupting, 
Rhymes overflowing, gradually growing 
Everything is written in the cold, so we can coincide, 
my thoughts to guide 

48 tracks to slide 
The invincible, microphone fiend 
Rakim 
Spread the word 'cause he's in 

E-F-F-E-C-T 
A smooth operator operating correctly 
But back to the problem 
I gotta habit 

I ain't a solving it, silly rabbit 
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when 
A fiend for a microphone like heroin 
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix 

So gimme a stage and a mic and a mix 
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of unawareness 
Beware, it's the reanamator 
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon 

An assassinator, if the people ain't stepping 
You see a part of me that you never seen 
When I'm fiending for a microphone, 
I'm the microphone fiend 

After 12, 
I'm worse than a Gremlin 
Feed me Hip-hop and I start trembling 
It's the thrill of suspense that's intense, you're horrified 

But this ain't the cinemas of ""Tales From the Darkside""(darkside) 
By any means necessary, this is what had to be done 
Make way 'cause here I come 
Fisty cuts material, material 

Call imperial, call imperial 

It's a must that I bust any mic you hand to me, 
It's inherited, it's runs in the family 
See I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back, 
If that don't slow 'em up, 

I carry a full pack. 
Now I don't want to have to let off, you should of kept off 
You didn't keep the stage warm, so step off 
Ladies and Gentleman 

You're about to see 
A past time hobby about to be, 
Take it to the maximum, 
I can't relax see, 

I'm hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one 
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke 
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke 
More than cracked up, you should have backed up 

For those who act up need to be more than smacked up 
Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber 
One on one and I'm the remainder (remainder) 
So close your eyes and hold your breath, 

And I'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death (death) 
Before you go, you'll remember you seen 
The fiend from a microphone, 
I'm the microphone fiend, fiend, fiend, fiend 

The microphone fiend, fiend, fiend, fiend . 
The microphone fiend, fiend, fiend 
I'm a mic, I'm a mic, I'm a microphone fiend, fiend, fiend 
I'm a mic, I'm a mic, I'm a microphone fiend, fiend, fiend",Microphone Fiend

So I call, your name
Cross my fingers, uncross the others
Hesitate, oh I don't think straight
With nothin' to prove

I don't wanna say I'm leavin'
I'll stay until the weekend
You can take all the things, the boxes and rings
And get goin'

'Cause I've been waitin' for

All the pretty girls on a Saturday night

Just to feel a little bit better about myself (he does)
I do (you do), baby
I do, I do, I do

Until their lips start to move
And their friends talk music
I'll say ""I've never heard the tune.""
But I have, I just hate the band
'Cause they remind me of you

Every single night ends up the same
I don't say much at all, but I bring up your name
(Over and over and over)
I think it's striking me out

Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down

But not you,
You still wear boots and your hair is too long
And then this one, doesn't wanna admit she's fallin' in love
Oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you ?

Ha !

I don't understand your reasons
Please just stay over the weekend
You can't take all those things
They define you and me
Everything we've become
You're all that I need
Please don't make me face my generation alone

And you break and take all the words from my mouth

Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago,
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.

C'mon, can you count all the notches in your belt?
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper,
I don't want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time

Oh, oh, At least I'm not as sad as I used to be.

And they said,
""Hey Nate, yeah, it's been a while,
Are you gonna sing?""
And I began to smile and I said,
""You should've seen me a couple of years ago,
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing.""

C'mon can you count all the loves that didn't last?
It's such a gas when you bring up the past.

Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper.
I don't want no savior baby
I just wanna get it out.

Oh oh, oh, at least I'm not as sad as I used to be.
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be.


And they say we would've seen you two years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show,
But youth's taken over by rock and roll,
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing

So I left, That is it. That's my life, nothing is sacred.
I don't keep friends,I keep acquainted, I'm not a prophet, But I'm here to profit.

That's s all,I'm gone! That's my life, nothing is sacred.

Fun.,"Never in all of my life
Have I seen eyes as empty as these streets of my city
On a Saturday night,
All the green of your eyes says ""Go, leave it all behind.""

But I don't need to be reminded a change is gonna come.
I can feel it on the tip of your tongue.

And I feel alive.

We met up once we'd settled the sun
Between the heat and the work week
The fear is we could use some sleep
But sleep to the superfluous man means better use for beds
And I'll bet I'm coming home alone tonight.

I don't need to be reminded that this is how it was.
I moved on, I passed a billboard down my block
That asks if I've had enough, and aloud I say ""I've had too much,""
When the truth is, I'm just getting started.

Now all the barlights are blinking in time
To Mexican music, it's taunting the pavement
And I feel alive.

One of us sings, and one of us drinks,
And one of us has nothing at all.
So he calls us all sheep
I'm the Little Bo Peep of the bunch.
(I take their tales and I'm ready to go)
The he swears he's gotta take this call
Man, I get scared he's gonna leave us too soon.

We were the get rich quick kids,
We never got it right
So we settled for the center of town
Where all the rich white kids is out looking for a fight
Got the blond one staring me down.
And I really wanna take a swing
I can't help but remember James Dean
See we are part of the few who agree
That hey, he lived life fast
But he died.
He died.
He died.

Me, I'm gonna live forever.

Now all the barlights are blinking in time
To Mexican music, it's taunting the pavement
And for the first time
In a long time
I feel alive",Barlights
Fun.,"As I walk through the streets of my new city
My back feeling much better, I suppose
I've reclaimed the use of my imagination
For better or for worse, I've yet to know
But I always knew you'd be the one to understand me,
I guess that's why it took so long to get things right.
Suddenly I'm lost
On my street
On my block

Oh why, Oh why
Oh why haven't you been there for me?
Can't you see, I'm losing my mind this time?
This time I think it's for real, I can see

All the tree tops turning red
The beggars near bodegas grin at me
I think they want something
I close my eyes, I tell myself to breathe

And be calm.
Be calm.
I know you feel like you are breaking down.
Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes.
Be calm.

I'm scared that everyone is out to get me.
""These days before you speak to me you pause.""
""I always see you looking out your window.""
""After all, you lost your band, you left your mom.""
Now every single crack, every penny that I pass,
Says I should either leave or pick it up
But with every single buck I've made
I'm saddled with bad luck that came

The moment I was baptized
Or when I found out one day I'm gonna die
If only I could find my people or my place in life
A when they come a'carolin'
So loud, so bright, the theremin
Will lead us to a chorus
Where we'll all rejoice and sing a song that goes:

Oh be calm.
Be calm.
I know you feel like you are breaking down.
I know that it gets so hard sometimes,
Be calm.
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.
You hate your pulse because it thinks you're still alive
And everything's wrong
It just gets so hard sometimes
Be calm.

I don't remember much that night,
Just walking, thinking fondly of you
Thinking how the worst is yet to come
When from that street corner came a song
And I can't remember the man,
The panhandler or his melody.
The words exchanged had far exceeded any change I'd given thee.

Oh be calm.
Be calm.
I know you feel like you are breaking down.
Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes,
Be calm.
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.
You hate your pulse because it still thinks you're alive
And everything's wrong

Fun.,"Holy ghosts,
When do you come out to play?
'Cause if the Lord is gonna find me,
He'd better start looking today.

Last week my baby hit the slopes.
I spent the weekend setting traps in the road.
I should have been cutting out my eyelids,
You'll never guess what baby did when she got home.

Na na na na
Now at least the birds are singing to me,
But what they're trying to say,
I don't know.

(you're beautiful)
I think they come from the cold
(for all your big mistakes)
I think they come from the cold
(you stayed the same)
To the city that don't snow.

So I drove until we both broke down.
I was stranded in a border town
Believing the motel TV would bring me to safety,
But between MTV and Mr. O'Reilly
I've come to find, that I can't be defined
So I turned it off, now convinced I would cross
Took one last look at the gold
As it shattered on a mountaintop

Now I believe the sun, it's like a symphony.
But what it's trying to play,
I don't know.

(you're beautiful)
I think it's come for the cold.
(for all your big mistakes)
I think it's come for the cold.
(you stayed the same)
To the city that don't snow.

C'mon, Holy ghosts
When do you come out to play?
'Cause if the Lord is gonna find me,
He'd better start looking today.

So I can rise with the river
We all float before we sink
So pray for satellites,
Pray for courtesy
And pray that it can climb mountains to me!
I say goodbye to the canyon.
I will set sail to the streets
Where I don't care to be forgiven
I want to be forgotten.
I don't care to be forgiven
When Lord I only want to be forgotten!

Now I receive a call from my family
And what they started to say
Brought me home.

All the kids have bloomed from babies into flowers in our eyes.

I don't care to beg your pardon,

We were barely 18 when we crossed collective hearts.
It was cold, but it got warm when you barely crossed my eye.
And then you turned, put out your hand,
And you asked me to dance.
I knew nothing of romance, but it was love at second sight.

I swear when I grow up, I won't just buy you a rose.
I will buy the flower shop, and you will never be lonely.

I will not leave, I will not leave 'till it's our time.
So just take my hand, you know that I will never leave your side.

It was the winter of '86, all the fields had frozen over.
So we moved to Arizona to save our only son
And now he's turning to a man, though he thinks just like his mother,
He believes we're all just lovers he sees hope in everyone.

And even though she moved away,
We always get calls from our daughter.
She has eyes just like her father's
They are blue when skies are grey
And just like him, she never stops,
Never takes the day for granted,
Works for everything that's handed to her,
Never once complains.

You think that I nearly lost you
When the doctors tried to take you away.
But like the night you took my hand beside the fire
Thirty years ago to this day
You swore you'd be here 'til we decide that it's our time
Well it's not time, you've never quit in all your life.
So just take my hand, you know that I will never leave your side.
You're the love of my life, you know that I will never leave your side.

You come home from work and you kiss me on the eye
You curse the dogs, you say that I should never feed them what is ours.
And so we move out to the garden and look at everything we've grown.

She brings me a cake we celebrate I have arrived

And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July

I never said we are

I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

I can cheat it all
To make up for the times, I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone,

May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and

But my legs are fine
After all they are mine

With everyone around
It's hard to stay inside my head
When words keep pouring out

Like starlight crashing through the room
We'll lose our feathers
Yes, I know it hurts at first
But it gets better

It gets better
It gets better
It gets better
We'll get better
It gets better
It gets better
It gets better
We'll get better

I can taste your summer sweat
It's never been so warm
So can we kick the covers off?
They're always on
It's never been so warm

It's hard to keep a straight face
When I just want to smile
Wish you could see the look that's in your eyes

Like starlight crashing through the room
We'll lose our feathers
Yes, I know it hurts at first
But it gets better

It gets better
It gets better
It gets better
We'll get better
It gets better
It gets better
It gets better
We'll get better

There's a fire in sky
Some snow in the ground
Not quite enough cigarettes
To calm me down

Oh my God
What've we done?
Oh my God
What've we done?
Oh my God

It gets better
It gets better

We'll get better

Fun.,"I'm standing in Brooklyn just waiting for something to happen
I can’t help but love thinking that everyone doesn’t get it
To my left there’s a window
Where did I go?
My reflection just planted two rows of coal
And bad ideas, but ideas nonetheless, and so

I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die


I happened to stumble upon a chapel last night
And I can’t help but back up when I think of what happens inside
I got friends locked in boxes, that's no way to live
What you're callin' a sin isn’t up to them
After all, (after all) I thought we were all your children,
But I will die for my own sins thanks a lot
We’ll rise up ourselves thanks for nothing at all,
So up off the ground up our forefathers are nothing but dust now

I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die

Maybe I should learn to shut my mouth
I am over twenty-five and I can’t make a name for myself some nights I break down and cry
I’m lucky that my father’s still alive he’s been fighting all his life
And if this is all I’ve ever known then may his soul live on forever in my song

I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die

In front of the other one

Fun.,"Growing old is getting old
I often find myself here thinking
About the birds, the boats, and past loves that flew away or started sinking
And it's crazy here without you
I used to think this all was ours
We'd stay up late, debate on how we'd find our way
Say it's all up in the stars

Some nights I rule the world
With bar lights and pretty girls
But most nights I stay straight and think about my mom
Oh God, I miss her so much

And there are people on the street
They're coming up to me
They're telling me that they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the phone
To get right back up, back in your arms
If you're out here why do I miss you so much

I feel like I had it all
Back before I lost it all
Now I just wait for you to talk to me
But you won't even look at me, baby

Fun.,"Well I woke up to the sound of silence the cars 
Were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July

You swore and said we are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are

Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground 
Carry on

Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends in the edge of the night
At a bar off seventy five 
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives

But I like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times, I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone,
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

Woah my head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how 
No one's ever gonna stop us now

'Cause we are 
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come, we will find our way home

Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got
Man when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steaming

That night over at Johnny's place
Well this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man we just fell about the place
If that chick don't want to know, forget her

The boys are back in town

Spread the word the boys are back in town

Just spread the word around

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
If the boys want to fight, you'd better let them

That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song
The nights are getting warmer, it won't be long
It won't be long till summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town

Ruined by the lack of anything to use
Of knowing what to say and what to lock away
Pay attention for detention's here to stay

It's been so long that I don't know if it's alright

Score cards for everyone, you wear them out to dress
Badge of honor, true to code and true to form
Buried underneath all these expectations

I bet you any money that the numbers wouldn't stick for all I know
I'll take some credit for myself if I can
And walk away from this whole scene a happier man

From the west coasts to the ocean
Mainline to the sunset

Heading out to mainland
Age is nothing but a number
The difference in experience that we relate

The distance from where the heart lies 
Between the words and sometimes, it's
A meaning to interpret and relate
A moment in explosions, like looking out the window 
As we're passing by the places out of state

Ending in frustration

Before it was too late

Questioning the motives
Before it turns to hate

I was one of five born to my mother
An older sister and three young brothers
We've seen it hard, we've seen it kind of rough
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that life was really tough

I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call (Ah)
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She said, ""Father, father it's for the kids (Ah)
Any and every thing I did
Please, please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong
Lord knows I meant no wrong""

Then the devil sang

""Would you like to dance with me? We're doin' the cosmic slop"" 

She was well known through the ghetto
Tricks would come and then they'd go
The neighbors would talk and call her Jezebel
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide

And Beethoven was my thing
I dug jazz, I dug rock
Anything with a swing

Find the void that you missed
There is plenty to explore

We want to take you, Cholly, when we go
(You want to take me?)

We'd like to take you, Cholly, when we roll
(Well, if you'd play me just a little bit more)
But if we play you just a little more
(Maybe I will)
We'd love to take you, Cholly, when we go

You know right about that time I started
To analyze what they were trying to tell
Me, they said: ""Come on, Cholly, we want to
take you somewhere""
I didn't know where
They was trying to take me, next thing I
Know they were saying something like this:
Funk, gettin' ready to go-
Funk gettin' ready to roll (what?)
Funk, gettin' ready to go-
Funk gettin' ready to roll
(What in the world are they talking about?)
Funk gettin' ready to roll-gettin' ready to go?
No, they can't do that

Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll-see I've Bach-I love Beethoven
Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll

I would dance, I would sing,
I could get lost in my dreams
I would fly, but never too high
'Cause my funk deserted me
Now that the door is open wide
And all my funk just can't hide
With the syndrome left behind
No, my funk just can't hide

We like to take you, Cholly, when we go
We like to take you, Cholly, when we roll
(They promise they would play one more time)
But if we play you just a little bit more
We'd like to take you, Cholly, etc

You know
It was in my hands
It was in my feet
I got it all over me
Yes, I did, I got it all over me
Got to go, got to go
Got to go with the funk

Get ready

I would waltz, I would sing
I would get lost in my dreams
I would fly but never too high
'Cause the funk deserted me

Thinking 'bout the hustle, everybody struggles for the answer
Confusion will attack in a cold blooded manner
But cancer kills my society
No need to lie to me
Real people fighting always try to be
Correct with the mental and upright with the info
Catching hell, paying dues, but could it be so simple
The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Don't worry, underpriviledged got the bullet proof armor
Surviving's just a job as they dodge caps daily
People goin crazy 
Everyone who raised me
Thanks to my moms, and thanks to my pops
And thanks to the youth rowdy on the roof top
Who warned me of trouble, so son get the bonus

Release from the pen, 8 to 10 on your feet
You're working, building, staying strong, watch the heat
Deciet lies snitching, you became a victim
The bitch sewed you quick on the phone in the kitchen
Nightmares and troubles, remembering the vision
Times is frustrating when nobody listens
Is this because they forget and regret 
To acknowledge one another, but all do respect 
To the veterns, experts, inmates in the cell 
Keep your eyes on the prize, see you soon wish you well

To my brothers doing life, rest in peace
To my man on this disc, rest in peace
To my brother Carl Capone, rest in peace
To all the lost souls, rest in peace

Serving up those rocks and keeping knots

Lets see, it started with the serpent
messing with Eve cause she wasn't certain
nobodys got a temper, a spiritual dilemma
enter in the realm where the spirits in the center
fuck perpetrating, cause they'll murder Satan
see faith broke the seal while the world be waiting
he left it all to Jesus, I'm picking up the pieces
friends that's deceased can never read my thesis
don't be resurrected and times got so hectic
demons ain't elected while the money gets collected
the gods get theirs and the word is born
I mean the signs of the future is what they saw
and the four living castles, lifes got no hassles
its all real real just one big feascal
no soul held me hostage, angels kill the nonsense
bond is my word, but first do the knowledge

If your soul loves the sun, Money rock on
If your soul loves the sun, Money rock on
If your soul loves the sun, Money rock on
If your soul loves the sun, Money rock on
If your soul loves the sun, Money rock on

I caught Spider Man jerkin off in a booth
to a Wonder Woman comic, then that Bionic
Bitch fucked the Hulk a.k.a. Bruce Banner
Did I see Santa?  No, it's the Green Lantern
Little Bo Peep cold fucked her sheep
Keep eatin that pussy, fuck Mother Goose-why
Best fuck a bitch Bullwinkle's kinda moose-why
Triple X hardcore; nigga fuck a floozy
Miss Piggy, got 'em thinkin sticky
Mickey Mouse pulled her blouse smoked a blunt fuck a hickie
Dorothy, Tin Man, the Lion and the Scarecrow
Messin with that pussy hairy just like the werewolf

Cyclops, Wolverine and the Nightcrawler
went to a bar, and yo, they had dollars
Rolled an Impala, hittin all switches
While Richie Rich riches, pulls all the bitches
I turned on the headset, like Judy Jetson
Here comes Barbie, look who she lets in
Hansel, Gretel; Gretel, fuck the kettle
Jack and Jill went up the hill to have a little fun
(It's a small world) Ready for some call girl
Wrapped around her neck a link, that was all pearls
Nice as Medusa, dancin on tables
Joker's got a lap dance from Charlie's Angels

It's night, in a secret hideaway somewhere in Gotham City
as a woman in a feline costume strokes a Siamese cat
and speaks to several well-dressed men

[Verse Three]
Twinkle, twinkle, porno star
Superhoe, tell me who you are
Catwoman in a red tight see-through
Dancin on a pole, with a do-see-do
Mosie on out, now where goes the ho they call
Cinderella, makin men jealous
Like Dick Tracy, Tweety, Sylvester

Cause Snow White's gonna be fuckin all night
Strobelight dancin in front of the mirror
He-Man's fuckin with Smurfette and She-Ra

Funkdoobiest,"Yeah, Funkdoobie in the house...
1994, representing....keeping it real...one time

I step out the door, and left undisturbed
I made the beer run and saw them hookers on the curb
Them pimps got the curls, rollers fancy fur coats
Talking to the brothes in the alley, the word
The party's at 7, and girls are with their babies
The kids are playing handball and it's about 80
I rolled out with T-Funk, in the t-bird
Pump the t-bass, hell of course, then we made that you-turn
The doobie got rolled up, the homies had showed up 
'Cause we made a left and saw the liquor store hold up
Stopped at the light, acting like nothing happened
We went about our way, brothers domino slapping
Pulled up on the side to see what girls were wearing
T popped the top and had all the hookers staring

Chorus
On the real, the real, what the deal
For my brothas who live and die on the corner
(Oh Yeah in background reapeated)
(4x)

Brothas shootin see-lo, try to meet expenses
Homies at the park tired, sleep on benches
Standing buy the payphone, make the call to Ralph Ms
(-Yo Ralph, what's up nigga?
 -Yo what up dawg?
 -What time you want to get up tonight?
 -Around 10
 -Word
 -Yo what's all that noise in the back man?)
Homies getting loud right in front of my building
The street lights came on, a cool breeze feeling
For the nights what i need, my aura feels special
What's up to my neighbors, the day had settled
Brothers want to hustle on the corner, scheming
Then i ran back and got ready for that evening

Chorus

I'm at the party drunk and my homies look dusted
The music was blasting, look here, but what's this
I hear about a hooker who wants to get with T-Funk
The room was kinda hot, holusinate and see 1
See 2 girls by the hallway, all day
Staring at my grill, these females want to play
Girls dim the lights and dance 'til the morning
My crew was in the house, saw these hookers tip-toeing
To the back with the homies, you know the rest
It was late that night, after everyone had left
Some urled in the streets, others gave out their numbers
I then grabbed my coat, had the ride home covered
Leaving with this girl from my block that i took
I said peace to the homies, now i'm out to hit the hooker

Chorus

Oh Yeah(fades with song)",What the Deal

Funker Vogt,"Ride off into sunset
Even in hours you won't reach
Seconds fade into infinity
Where the parallels will meet

The clock strikes twelve
And nothing happens
Is it real or is it virtual?
The rhthym of the time

And the sun is burning
A black hole in my mind
While the earth is turning
Feels like I will go blind

DNA replication
The system's self-organized
A virus creates fear
There's nearly no protection

The clock strikes twelve
And nothing happens
Is it real or is it virtual?
The rhthym of the time

And the sun is burning
A black hole in my mind
While the earth is turning
Feels like I will go blind

Science is it called
A synonym for industry
A new god for the world

That there is just one direction

Civil war all over the land

Hidden deep inside their rooms

Each side wants to be the smartest
In this abnormal war

But you always have to hear
Both sides of the story
It isn't just one country
Which we have to blame

I can go on with these stories
Until the last one is bored
But ignorance and stupidity
Will survive forever

I can watch the stars
Power plants and city lights
Illuminate the night

I must keep going on
Now I've reached the sea
I feel that I'm too far above
To hear the torrid waves

suddenly the landscape changes
I fly through buring clouds
One hundred miles an hour
I'm going down

underwater I travel onward
Sinking toward the ocean floor
The light fades out very slowly
On the way down to hell

I see my life in front of me
It all floats by my inner eye

Funker Vogt,"It all started with a dream
Two months like eternity
And in spite of all the problems
It was the best time of my life

We had promised ourselves
That trust and friendship last forever
But these two tiny things
Have already been too much

The second dream came way too soon
Promising an early end
But there was a second part
Maybe a chance for a new start

The first part is now fulfilled
There wasn't anything I could do
Now I just do what I can
To fulfill the second one

No more trust, I was betrayed
By a friend I thought I knew
I have lost so much more
Don't know what to do

And that single thought evoked
A pained look behind closed eyes
And I'll always wonder why
My best friend would tell me lies",A Dream

To join in this new world
I took the chance despite the danger
All I saw was",Follow Me

The creation of mankind a million years ago
Too few of them can be convinced about the truth of life
The majority of men â?? still fighting for their own ends

Chorus girls in uniform like fallen angels by my side
Celebrating the modern age
The devil wins this fight
In the end we are condemned to go down with our race
Too much destroyed already
We have reached the end of days

We have reached the final chapter
We are almost at the end
The time we have remaining is better wisely spent

Quick to toast an MC just like an English muffin
Don't worry about a thing because the Puba's never bluffing
I gets headaches from the wack, so then I take a Bufferin and I max
I wait until the opportune time and then I tax but should I max?
Now they say sinning is for sinners so I guess I'm not a sinner
Beginning's for beginners so I guess I'm no beginner
This is how I spark it, money in my pocket
When it comes to having pleasure I gets hard as a rocket
MC Grand Pu coming through all the residue
The songs remain classics dating back to the Babalu
My boys I call 'em Akh, the foes I let 'em jock
And I can think of many episodes I swung in Lincoln Park
No I'm not a phony and I got a tenderoni
Love the way she is, not too fat, not too bony
Don't drink Sanka, won't sink like a tanker
Knock the boots off a skirt in Casablanca and I thank her
Some rappers stink like Englebert Humperdinck
Better yet Dick Cavett, I got a bad habit
Similar to the girl on 'She's Gotta Have It'
I think with the brain and I whip behind the zipper
I'm living kinda good similar to Jack Tripper
A landlord named Roper did a show at the Copa
When I'm finished with this I'll be paid like Oprah
So if honey wants to act fly
I'll just play like Guy and I'm ""saying bye bye dumb bitch""
Stick out your thumb and hitch
'Cause you've been cut off like a light switch
See I'm programmed to slam winter, summer, spring or fall
Before I do a show I get some kicks out the mall
Then I get my gear and I give Trev a call
'Cause he works in the barbershop, right behind the mall
Other rappers tried to rob me but you know they got did
To put it blunt, honey I shrunk the kids
So bookers back off break North here comes the regulator
Betcha that you find none greater

On file is a style, that's why you caught a clip
My suitcases is packed and I'm going on a trip
To Mic-a-delphia I go for self and still be slamming
The school bell is ringing and I caught somebody cramming
For the test, oh yes, my study guide was thick
I cut you with my verbal, didn't hurt you just a nick
Off your face, don't play possum watch me and I'll blossom
Like a rose and get some new clothes
And a fresh fade from Rob
Jump on the phone and dial the Now Rule Mob
Now come one, come all, we about to get hectic
If my crew don't get in, then the X makes a exit
To the rear, I'm outta here, don't front on my brothers
I take care of them before I take care of others
Now wood bats is doomed, in the 90's it's aluminum
Step to the stage with a mic and I'm doing 'em something awful
I'm a citizen and I'm lawful
I go to Hunter in the fall, rip the policemen's ball
I got the power to make a car stall
I get some drinks from Glackens, and when the crowd slackens
I stop drinking and then I start thinking about
Days in the past when Derek X was last
But now I'm on the top, damn, news travels fast
'Cause I'm like that, they can't see this
Read my book, it contains many pieces of verses
I took the time to delete all the curses
So moms reach deep in your purses
And buy me take me home and try me and do me well

Well, while I reign rhymes pour
You suck it up like a straw and jump on the dance floor
'Cause every time I step in a jam
I make like a door and slam
But then girls try to turn my knob 'cause I'm a heart throb
I guess it's just a hazard that comes with the job
'Cause every time I rock a rhyme that shows Jamar is intellectual
Girls want to get sexual
Well I guess I have to cope with being so dope
You want to be me, but can't see me with a telescope
You seek and search but still you can't find
You're weak and it hurts to be deaf, dumb and blind
A supreme mind will take you out of your paralysis
I grip the mic so tight I get callouses
And your analysis is that the Lord
Whips rhymes into shape with a mic cord
I do it good 'cause I'm a positive black man
Eating up suckers as if I was PacMan
Not a Dapper Dan fan, I stay casual
To rock like the J it comes gradual
You got to know the ledge to wise the dumb
And understand your culture of freedom
Power equally with the Gods
So you can build and born your cipher
All your life you must teach truth
Of the true and living God, not a mystery spook
And when you do that, pursue that goal
Which made the student enroll and only then you'll prosper",All For One

Funkmaster Flex,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnetize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking until I hit my last note
My mind remains refined, all kind of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Say indeed and I'll proceed cause my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
His fingertips sew a rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it cause it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
Cause I'm better than the rest of them
Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must have got you too hot and burned off your wings

And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessin, 
So listen to the lesson I preach,
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem,
Full of knowledge, from my toes to the top of my dome,
I'm kinda young, but my tongue speaks maturity,
I'm not a child, I don't need nothin for security
I get paid when my record is played, to put it short,
I got it made,

I'm outspoken,
My language is broken into a slang,
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang,
I play it cool, 'cause coolin is all that I'm about
Just foolin wit tha girlies, yes I'm bustin it out,
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use,
I'm creatively superior, yo, I never lose
I never lost 'cause I'm the boss,
I never will 'cause I'm still,
The champion, chief one, won't lose until,
I choose,

Which I won't 'cause I don't retreat,
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street,
You're invitin me, a titan to a battle, why?
I don't need your respect 'cause I,
Got it made,

I'm talented, yes I'm gifted,
Never boosted, never shoplifted,
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin,
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and,
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Ever other week I get a brand new car,
Got twenty, that's plenty yet I still want more,
Kinda fond of honda scooters, got seventy-four
I got the riches, to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies,
Even got a little island of my very own,
I gotta frog, a dog with a solid gold bone,
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti 'cause I own a percent
Got gear out wear, to everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A.
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent,
So it really doesn't matter, how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes, daily
You burn me, really?
Think, just blink and I made, a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked, a million times
Damn I'd be paid,
I got it made,

I'm kinda spoiled,
'Cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear, got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted lead, I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growin too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me,
I got the army brigade,
I'm not a trader,
If what you got is greater I'll trade,
But maybe later 'cause my waiter made potato n' alligator souflee,
I got it made",I Got It Made

Funkmaster Flex,"Now Peter Piper picked peppers, but Run rapped rhymes
Humpty Dumpty fell down, that's his hard time
Jack B. Nimble, what, nimble, and he was quick
But Jam Master was faster, Jack saw Jay's dick
Now little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice stilled her hunger in Wonderland
Jack Jill busta in his hand
And Jam Master Jay is making out our sound
The turntables might wobble but they don't fall down

I got the juice and Mother Goose both did that thing
Jam Master's gettin' loose and DMC's the king
Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator
Jam Master Jay, king of the crossfader
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest
Perfect timin' when I'm climbin', I'm a rhymin' apparatus
When he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts
And on the mix, real quick, and I'd like to say
He's not fat, but he's fast and his name is Jay

It goes a one, two, three and

Jay's like King Midas, as I was told
Everything that he touched, turned to gold
He's the greatest of the great, get it straight he's great
Playing fame cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay to see him play will make you say
""Goddamn, that DJ made my day!""
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were his, he would be you
I'm not lying, y'all, he's the best I know
And if I lie, my nose will grow
Like the little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story goes!

Tricks are for kids he plays much gigs
He's the big bad wolf and you're the three pigs
He's the big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good!

There it is

We're Run-DMC, got a beat to settle
D's not Hansel, he's not Gretel
Jay's a winner, not a beginner
His pocket gets fat, other get thinner
Jump on Jay like cows on moons
People take Jay like dish and spoon
Hands like all, first hails aim
You'll see Jay again my friend!

Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course

My voice is your choice as the hottest wax
True as a wizard, just a blizzard, I ain't taken no crap
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J.

We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam

Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers want to do this well

Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader

He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed
I go to the store and get Old Gold
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked
Rock the bells

The bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince
Rock the bells

So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time
He'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ look blind
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop
All you gonna-be(s), want to-be(s), when will you learn
Want to be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned
Six-g (s) for twenty minutes is the pay I earn
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze
Do you like Michael Jackson, we like Cool J.

Bounce to this, you don't want to miss this, get into this 
This is that shit that make em all flip 
They all want a piece 
Some keep a steady mind, some get geese 
Now what be the shit that make them niggas think 
When they ship come in, they ship won't sink 
Everybody you meet on your way up, you meet down 
So if you burn a bridge how you gonna cross town 
Think about it now and cry later 
A mothafuckin money maker so I die greater 
And everytime I get them visions in my head 
Everything is red, gettin high from the stimuli 
Very blurry-eyed dred 
Said to me, Buck da be	-D-be	 
When you smoke your ?sensity? I hope you take out your seed 
And watch your back for them bitches who act shady 
Wit another lady friend that try to serve you wit gravy 
Menage, I almost got caught, what can I say 
Fallin for the lust, I almost got bust Friday 
But safely so, got em by the most high 
He's out yo, into some next bullshit, I'm like

[Buckshot] 
Hip-hop, set out in the park 
Niggas comin through wit they heaters to bark 
I always have to be around some shit 
Showin mothafuckers I be down for shit 
Real quick to do my justice 
Walk the streets and stay close to my musket 
Bust this, everytime I hit the corner I notice at night 
Niggas always want to see a fight, crowd around it like 
Cause a scene, some dumb nigga might pop off a shot 
In the air for props, followed by the cops and the ghetto bird 
Swoop down and hit them niggas while they standin on the curb 
What a herb, kick off a shot in the air 
Make the crowd shatter, kid you should've splurged 
Now all I see is a fleet of DT's 
Comin in the direction of be	-D-be	 
Kick up dust, can't get bust, duckin darts 
See they want to shoot the god 
Fuck it, they want to hit all of us 

[Q-Tip] 
Bounce to this, in your Pinto 
You can bounce to this in your 5 double-0 
You can bounce to this in your Mustang 
You can bouce to this, let it bang let it bang 
You can bounce to this on the block that you on 
You can bounce to this, polyin on your horn, come on 

[Buckshot] 
When a finesse pulled up in a GS 
Double-breast to protect the lungs that I blow cess from 
Yes, now I got time to press 
Early visions in my head seein you in that red dress 
Back door, it's the VIP 
For be	-D-be	, classic '83 type jewelery 
Sport gold nugget, fuck it 
Rugged individual and make a profit from it 
That's why I love it and I get mine 
Promote the bump and grind, sippin liqour to a lime 
Every girl'll be a dime, see it's showtime 
And every mothafucker online want to hit something 
Niggas need to stop frontin

Bounce to this in your 5-4-0 
Bounce to this in your 7-4-0 
You can bounce to this blazin on hydro, ooh

In the club you bounce to this 
Up inside your sheet you can bounce to this 
In the projects you can bounce to this 
Fuck it, in the suburb bounce to this

 Tote the toast on low, business never personal 
 Just some words to know, if you from the streets, come in piece 
 or leave in pieces, even Jesus was killed by the polices 
 They crucified him now they inject us refuse to fry em 
 The pendulum state of death is my fate, cool I'm dyin 
 If that's my destiny it's meant to be, just remember 
 to bury the motherf***in that bent me right, next to me 
 Aight crew? (No doubt Pun!) Aight then 
 Let's fight then, I'm hype blend, comin with the thunder 
 and the lightening, inviting the comp, ice on the arm 
 Nights on the storm, put knives in your moms, right up in the Bronx 
 Mic in the palm, it's the Ghetto God 
 I tear a n**** heart, out his frame, when I scream, Terror Squad 
 We larger than life, my initials carved in my wife

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to

You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You've got to make him

Ya niggas slept, twenty girls panties wasn't wet
I'm a star, double the dick, the double are
Never score hard to leave the bubble scarred
Not the car, it's the man, daddy cool put it down
No comparin' me to y'all, nigga is such a clowns
L.A. worth paper, ask Russell Simmons who put 'em up in that skyscraper
Ask my dogs up at Fubu, who made them major
LL nigga, now who's next that need a favor
Drop a bomb on 'em
Remain calm on 'em
Peirce the nipples, throw the LL charm on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumping through my system
When my strobe lights flash you can't miss' em
Listen

[Chorus]
Call my name, ooh
Call my name,
Call my name, aw yeah
Call my name

59th street bridge up a roadway, do about a buck
Pumping Mobb up in the Cadillac truck, don't give a fuck 
Gold tint, goldiggen broads getting bent
We can fuck, but you ain't getting 10 cent, Who want it?
Lay the facts out until the cats out
Set 'cha back out, sweat 'cha tracks out, blow out your weed 
You wake up in the morning to a note, ""Nigga had to leave.""
Be easy, you should of teased me, instead of being sleazy
I wouldn't do a threezy, come across more floss than gold teeth
I learned you can't eat, if ya hold beef, with niggas underneath
Still I'm a lyrically hold it down 
L back in town, 'case the bell sound for second round
Some of these old cats is funny, fuck who's legendary
I'm trying to get this money 
Drop a bomb on 'em, and pour a dom on 'em
As soon as the track come on, I transform on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumping through my system
Strobe lights flashing can't miss' em
Listen

[Chorus]

Rappers don't really want it, they might claim they do
They know I'm catching bodies, go 'head name a few
After I blaze you, I get a doughnut
Don't want no blood up on my chrome shoes
Lord have mercy, this rookies got it confused
You thought you caught me slipping, I was falsely accused
Sleeping with my eyes wide shut, like Tom Cruise
They wishing an impossible mission to see me lose
Lay up time to choose, all I hate is on the left
You hoping and praying you get to hear me take my last breath
Lyrically, but I gang bang the track, chop sling like Cracker
Hundred keys a month, you fucking up G backs nigga
Invincible, unstoppable y'all niggas ain't ill your illogical
This is L, the pigeon thriller, dream fulfiller
A little something for ya ice guerrillas
Drop a bomb on 'em
When its time to attack Quiet Storm on 'em
Hold ya nuts and keep ya palms on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumping through my system
When my strobe lights flash you can't miss' em

That why'all (that why'all)
That why'all (that why'all)
It's like that why'all (that why'all)
That why'all (that why'all)
That why'all, It's murda

Respect a thug, or accept a slug
Or accept the death of somebody you love
That's the rules we live by, ways I kiss by
We all murderers in the eyes of all ours
So when I pull a bubble up and back in your car
When I spit sixteen's you gonna wish they was sparks
Can you hold something, you can hold heat you can keep
Slugs in your sleep while I'm plugging your freak
I'm the thug of the week, the killer of the millennium
Spitting like mack ten and a nine ??
Blasting off like Flex on New Years
Who cares how many slugs why'all spit in the air
Niggaz over here got glock nineteen's, P89's, hollow points, and M16's
Three fifty-seven's and mack11's 
We clap you come to the funeral...

Motherfucker if your holding them ?? nigga
Then I'd advise nigga, we rip the high niggas
Don't matter the size niggaz
Ever since I popped up, a lot of niggaz done got stuck
While I'm laying the cut, meant that's rocked up
Believe it's murda
Niggaz get popped up, buried and chopped up
We don't give a fuck if the cops get touched
A ?? and a baby blue drop
With a stash box holding a fifth and two glocks
And every sixteen I spit I ??
And won't stop firing, firing until I got, a four full of money
And playboy you bunny
Yo you get us a clip of hollow tip slugs from me
Bitch nigga, acting out the life of a thug money
I hustle and, grind those block for drug money
And make sure, kept counting every stack
We drop bombs like Flex and Big Kap

[Chorus:]
Fuck that

Oh why must children die
I guess the lil' nigga want the piece of the pie, let 'em die
Oh why must thug niggaz snitch
I guess the lil' nigga thought he'd get a lil' rich, lil' bitch 
That's why we don't talk quick
'Cause niggaz who talk quick get killed for the bricks
This is it, that's why we walk with our guns
'Cause those without guns get killed by guns

?? the one that will kill you son
It's the same where ever we from, it's the slums
We spit guns, lay you down for the 1
I love when niggaz talk slick with they tongue
You ain't buying no one, you talking shit
I'm from the place get killed for shit
So fuck where you from, better start from day 1
It's amazing...


Murda mommy in every song
You was warned, should of listened when I told ya
It's coming to a closure
And almost over now
Go to war like a solider now
And you rat broads running my style, I'm shutting you down
From N.Y. to L.A., Vi-ta from Jersey
More of a bitch then a lady
Chase chips, slick bitch
With flows that's sick, and it only gets worse...

[Chorus:]
Fuck that

Murda, is the way of the walk
And since I walk a thin line, I'm looking at niggaz with dead eyes
And I'm baptized, my body has sinned
A lil' weed, a few hoes, and a whole lot of head
Got me hollering, I don't give a fuck!
About nothing at all, front
I'm blasting off, killing you with probable cause
'Cause you probable of thinking that you hotter then I
It will never be until I die, and touch the sky
Hells angel, fly
I feel like I'm at war fighting for my inner self fighting for my life
This world made me a, Murderer
May the lord take you, before I murder ya
Bodies turning up, and who you think got 'em all touched
Murderers, is on your block catching the rush

Catch me in the mic room if you want hits 
So what you want bitch I know you want this

A yo A yo A yo
I know the roaches get big, the showers stay cold
The clinic stay packed, the power stay sold
Niggas showing off no matter how much they sold
Fuck the cops, they fowler than us and they know
They just pick a nigga, cuff a nigga
Run em in do the same to another nigga
Once again it's a I S bill, we need Cockrine fierce(?)
Yo we gotta do something Cause they not gonna fear us.
Fuck that, my man Jay used to play for the Dogers
Hurt his hand string now he watches
Got hoes topless and other hoes totally nude
But he keep them to his self and me supposed to be schooled
Type of nigga that I'll show me the wolves and try to pet them
Getting to hot I perspire venom I put the fire in them
Make it so they never cool off 
And when the snow clears tell them who lost
They don't hear me though

Never been afraid, nigga never once told
Catch me in the projects in you want cold
Catch me in the mic room if you want hits 
So what you want bitch I know you want this

You'll end up missing more than Shaq when shooting free throws
They packing and bout to open up the dope spot
My neighborhood is stopping cars like a roadblock
They moving weight like Atlanta was moving boat rock
And catching ums like seeun Muslims eating pork chops, never happen
And meanwhile I been thinking man
Niggas been slanging tapes like they slanging 'caine
Cause in the hood its getting ugly like orangutan
So if you trying to stop the hustle get the dangalang
Okay, we trying to make our own White House
Paint it black and start yelling our fucking pipes out
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out
They can't fuck with us niggas you think they dyked out, so

And tell your sister get the fuck up off the telephone

Straight Y.O. mother fuckers

Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick
Niggas talk real slick, but that's about it
Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through?
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you got me, got me? And you can't live without me
If I wasn't DMX, you wouldn't give a fuck about me
Ain't about ""Dog I want to be just like you""
How about you wanting to be just like you?
You can do what I do, just in your own way
Shit, I get niggas that ride big every fuckin' day (I-ight?)
If you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine
And it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine
Let me hit 'em with the rewind
Do you and I'll do me
To me you'll see how real you'll be

Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable fo ryou
Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley

Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (Word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like
But if we all see it through the eyes of the Lord, we see a light (c'mon)
Just let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something
Now the good things that go wrong because of a little frontin'
Express yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star
You don't even know what you got inside
How the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride
Hey yo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more
You're best to go for what you know
Can't do you, then what you flow for
You ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog
Look through your eyes, see what you see

Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable fo ryou
Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley

Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley

Like fuck it, you want to be me? Here's what you do
Grow up neglected by both parents and still pull through
You gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit
Then have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch
Turn into a killer, don't carry shottie
'Cause the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody
Get a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn
Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes
Let 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine
In time, everything you hear will come true
But you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you

Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable fo ryou

Uhh, you see that Brooklyn

Bullshit, I'm on it like Big was

And yeah, I play shit with gambling heads
Or I'll have your bitch scrambling eggs
Either or it's me, RC, the outdoor outlaw
Type to throw my guns up southpaw, let's get it on
See the waves under the rag, the rims under the Jag
Guns cover my waist, no wonder you mad
Fools call it gangsta but we call it gutter
Cold War, I bring the heat to you summer to summer
I'm the criminal that'll leave your condition critical
My dogs bloodhounds, it's nothin to get at you
El Dorado red, drink until the bottles dead
Feed my clips hollowheads, please you cowards better

[Chorus x2]
Duck down
This one is over your head boy
Duck down
Out fool, you'll be a dead boy
Duck down
You heard what I said boy
Duck down

Summer fade, winter time I'm in the blow out
BK stompin which one of you fools would start somethin
Y'all don't want me to turn best out of Compton
We don't need Destiny's Child to get it jumpin

Unattended for your double breasted, bulletproof vest kid
Time is money well invested, burning your press kit
Ya HEARD me, chic-ow, bless it and pass it leftwards
Never protested, the living proof manifested
Winkled your face, you better press it, menage-a-trois
Put fist in thought, care to test it?  If you dare I swear
Motionless, I throw a stare in the eyes of uncommon wise soldier
Rise like Nike, shares growing older, snowball effect to snow boulder
Show you love nigga, I'm iceberg with cold shoulder
No time for your manic, hazy rap attack partner
Future darker than black permanent black... marker
I part you from existence on solid ground
Only twelve inch but long distance, that's all I frown
Is we hell or is we heaven bound?
I bomb the target without a sound
Ain't nobody left around to hear it
Sipping fine wine and spirits on summer days
By the South Pacific, cheddar sound better when specific
Cheddar look better when explicit
Cheddar get better when statistics rise like mama biscuits
All 'n all, I'm having fun with gun
'Cause world gave me gun, detonate the shells with my tongue
I'm young plus I'm well hung
Threat to intellect, also got your prize possession sprung
I ride the fine line between yours and mine, check the design

Peep my shines coming from behind
I'm high beaming in your rear view
Get out the left lane before I steer through
Ain't even trying to hear you
It was important 'til you thought I feared you
Naw, loosen your bra bitch
Never rest until I'm considered, the high exalted
Even then I'll still be bitter, sipping on malted
Through the speech, now it's time to walk it
This potent poet, who only spit it if he know it
Prefer to show it to the hardest of hip hop artist
If you a baby making baby, finish what you started and be a MAN
God damn, resort to plan be	 sucking on candy
For delicate procedure, no time for leisure
The fine line between yours and mine, freak the design
Bre-X cats wondering how rhyme turn sublime
Peep my shines coming from behind
I'm high beaming in your rear view, CRASH
I stop at nothing, my blood stream pumping nothing but utter destruction
Towards cats I describe in this rap production
Suffering from mal concussions, you head bangers catching repercussion
First impression had you lustin'
Now the name Saukrates ringing more than bells
Double X-L quote me well, bringing the future
Double X-L quite me well, bringing the future

although I hate I have to go
And face another day
I'm gonna get my groove on and party, party

Forget about your worries
Save your problems for tomorrow
Tonight just try to have a good time
Let the DJ make it easy
Let the music help you do it

Ginuwine, Funkmaster Flex
In your earhole, whoo!
Drop a bomb to this, what?
Let's do this, listen

Saw her in the club
As she was about the finest thing I had ever seen
I was so addicted cause she was like a drug
And I was a fiend
I wanted to walk over
Imagining her body was calling me
I had to get with it and make it quick
I had to hit cause baby girl was a dream
I wanted to say

1 - How would you like it if I...
Touched a little
Felt a little
Grabbed a little
Could you handle if I...
Licked a little
Taste a little
Ate a little

Repeat 1

Yo second verse
Kept staring at her hoping that she would see
And maybe call me over
I was gifted but my confidence wouldn't let me
So I sat back and thought things over
(What I get?)
Got a bottle of the Cris (Oh)
Got a bottle of the Mo (Oh)
Now I'm looking like a Don Juan
So I know she gotta notice me
Over all the others
Cause they be singing all the same songs

Repeat 1 (2x)

Finally walked over to her
Told her she was the finest woman I had ever seen
She told me why'd I take so long
Cause all night she was already peepin' me
She said she likes a man who knows what he wants
Never fronts and ain't scared to ask
She was down for whatever
So I took her to the floor, got together
And I tapped that ass, yeah

Repeat 1 (2x)

Yo Flex take em there
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

With bitches that'll snipe you where you buy your hash at
I even give daps to niggaz I blast at
And why'all gon' give me my ASCAP, or get your ass capped
I take the clip out, and hit you with the back of the gun
Then put it back in and shoot you in the back if you run
Call me Jada, I love to clap the shit out a hater
Give my lawyer seven then give him another three later
Cause you know it cost a hundred to beat it
And I lost plenty fights, but my gun is still undefeated
Cause I'm tryin to be around like Boston Baked Beans
Gave so many samples out, that it's hard to shake fiends
Since a young boy, I was taught to mind my neck
And since a grown man, I was taught to sign my checks
And I don't want drama, but if you do I'm killin your children
Go to any project in the world and chill in the buildin
Hit me later, I think not, I keep the glock
And drive around with no coat cause my seats is hot
Fuck buyin a Range, if I ain't with my son I'm gettin high
or either with my niggaz, at the firin range
While why'all clown niggaz keep jokin, and get treated like ashes
I clip why'all off and keep smokin

They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage

Let it out today or watch these bullets spray

From these ten black fingers huggin' these deadly millimeters
That'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
See I'm dirty, so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater

You gets whipped with it, tell them motherfuckers, Swift did it
You packin' somethin' special in your crib, then bitch get it
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile
With this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils

You get splitted and guess what, I'm blowin' up the hospital
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe

Findin whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em

Stupid trick got my dick startin' to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch

One on one in this bloodsport, I'm in divorce court
Sold my bitch off a pack of Newports

If you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested?

Or just carry this weight
Without objection
So weight become lightness

Well, I'm still crawling, I'm still crawling

But I seem to forfeit all my findings
It's not easy to take these steps
Or to fake these breaths but the urge is blinding

And you can deny this but I won't let you
And you can defy this, it's not beneath you
And we can try this but were we meant to?
And this will define us and then we'll be through, be through

Found out about everything
And you can deny this all you want
And you can pretend that you weren't caught
But this is more than you and me
This is about being deceived, being deceived

You should have waited 'til you ended this
Then you'd have nothing to confess
I thought you'd leave me next to nothing
But now you're leaving me much less, leaving me much less

And I will get through this until justice prevails
And I gave you this, for nothingness and lies

I see flesh and blood and I don't know why
I've seen fathers and I've seen them die
I've seen mothers and their daughters cry

Surprised soldiers with holes in their heads
Smiling presidents sweating in their beds
Dreaming of the land where the black gold flows
Where the sun always shines and the desert wind blows

It's always one step forward and two steps back
They stumble and fall and break their necks
In the land of the killing fountains

Once it was God's land in the middle-ages
Now blue helmets try to stop the rage
While rocket launchers burn the sand
That's what you call the promised land

It's always one step forward and two steps back
They stumble and fall and break their necks
In the land of the killing fountains

You can kill bodies but you can't kill religion
This is the truth and peace is the fiction

And millions die with a silent smile
Seven days a week and the years pass by

Fury in the Slaughterhouse,"When I'm standing on the stage I see a girl in front of me
I don't know what she wants but I know she cries for me
She's too young to start a fire but she can't hide her desire, oh no
So she turns away and cries covering her face with her hands
In her dreams I kiss her eyes and this moment never ends
But she knows that dream 's not real and I know what she will feel

Cause she's missing me
Teardrops in the dirt
Oh she's missing me
We all know love can hurt
Cause she's missing me
Well I'm a poster on the wall
Yes she's missing me
Buy our records, we love you all

Well a hundred million dollars that's exactly what we want
Little girls are little victims and we're always on the hunt
When the horn blows ""hunting's over"" there's no lonely girl to see, oh no
I'm a little bit confused 'bout the letters that you write
Seems you think I'm a hero and everything I do is right
You know I've tried to explain but it seems that was in vain

Cause she's missing me

In a fresh grave someone dug last night

",Goodbye So Long
Fury in the Slaughterhouse,"A million dollar baby
Has lost its father today
The fallen angel stays in bed
With a bullet in his head
Success makes you horny
And pills calm you down
No more excuses silent cries the clown

Your wife will light a candle
To guide you on your way
Hope that you'll find
What you've been looking for
On a rainy april, rainy april day

The public wants answers
They don't want to hear
And every kiss of yours is public property
You gave it all
But no one wants to own your fear
And fear is all you've left for your baby",Rainy April Day
Fury in the Slaughterhouse,"This is the anthem of the handsome ransom...

We didn't want to cause any trouble
We just wanted them to listen to the band,
So we gave 'em a fax that said:
We have hidden a bomb in your women's toilet
If you wanna prevent the desaster
Come to the club
On the 25th to see us, but they came not
We paid 500 marks for that
Some people never heard anything 'bout jokes

This is the anthem of the handsome ransom...
Hello hartwig!
We've got the tapes of your new, fantastic band
So if you want them back
You gotta place 50.000 bucks in
The women's toilet of the teldec,
You know,
Otherwise you won't hear your band again
Cause we will erase everything
Come on hartwig
Come on

Come on...

This is the anthem of the handsome ransom...

We thought musics got
Something to do with instruments and feelings
This is not the truth!
Lawyers and money that is what counts
We sat in a boat with sharks all around us
We've tried to get rid off 'em
But when they smell money
You can't hold 'em back
So we've invented our own kind of kidnapping
We're kidnapping ourselves
And you pay the ransom
That sounds good, ha

That sounds good...

This is the anthem of the handsome ransom...

That sounds good...

You came the long way home
Coming with a dream
And going back alone

Oh Eleonore
You have left this place
So there's no warm embrace
Just a short hello

Then turn around and go
Oh Eleonore

Oh Eleonore
Friends are hard to find
And you've left yours behind
You don't known where to stay
But that's the price you pay

Oh Eleonore
It shouldn't bother me
You wanted to be free
I've known it before
Since you've closed the door
Oh Eleonore

And if you turn around you see
That there is no one else but me
I guess we both know what's best
So forget about the rest

Oh Eleonore
You came the long way home
Coming with a dream
And going back alone

When the winter came
He forgot to order coats so he shivers
Just himself to blame
And the market wives covered with blankets
I hear them shout in vain
They try to sell their southern fruits
In the icy rain

Slowly comes the wintertime
Snowflakes melting on the engine hood
And all the young girls put on their scarfs
Before they haunt their neighborhood

So sorry that I'm romantic
So sorry that I'm romantic

Hot grey steam out of the drains
I can't see the traffic lights
And the smell of cookies and candles
Ice cold stray skies
Snowballs fly around my head
And Linda's laughing bright
The saucy little skater falls on his nose
And cries soon he's outta sight

'Bout troubles with turks and troubles with Jews
Gallons of beer stream into my mouth
They've shot a prime minister somewhere down south

Murder in the east and murder in the west
The girl on page 3 got an over sized chest
Germany's united and Fergi's got a new dress
And the man in the tele says it's blue

I should have known better
But no one told me
I should have known better
But no one told me

I'm not interested in the political scenes
Just when they raise my taxes 'cause I know what it means
But how can they say that there's not enough to eat
Look in my fridge it's filled with meat

Cut the women's liberation, cut the women's education
One iron lady was enough for this nation
Might be that I don't know what I'm saying here
But I'm just interested in tele and beer

I believe in keepin' it one thousand and stayin' humble
New route I chose to take through the jungle
Keep the same mentality when I was standin' on the corner
Hit the studio and split that crack and have you on it ( My folks done told me)

You deserve it

You deserve it, Future

Just the other day, my lil' cousin call me from school and said

You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
You deserve it (Turn it up)

I go so fuckin' hard, till my heart skip a beat
I always been expensive, ain't nothin' about me cheap
I'm the realest nigga you have seen
Since Michael Jackson, Billie Jean
All this pain, I can't even rap
Sometimes I feel I wanna sing
My passion (My passion)
It goes without me sayin'
The fruits of my labor, I laid down a solid foundation
You water a seed too long and it will grow
You stay down and grind for long and it's gon show
It brings water to my eyes just to hear me on the radio
You wouldn't understand the route I had to take to get here so
I worked for this (I worked for this)
It didn't come easy (It didn't come easy)
Most people hit me up and say these rappers cheezy, 'cause

You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
You deserve it

Have you countin' money goin' duffle bag crazy,
Sippin' on Pink Floyd an puffin' Wayne Brady,

Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,

Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,

I palm the game like its a Splading ball and take flight,
From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this goin' be a great night,
Look at all these posers bite, our swagger like a great white,
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long,

U-G-K an Young Money too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, 
So what the fuck is you on?

Soo woo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
An' I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel bitch

So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?

I just wanna take you out and show you off

Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy

Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent I was too far behind

Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can

All my angels watch over me, I bag it like groceries
Keep this cash going over me
Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me

You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for ‘em, they just say it's wack, they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it’s dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
bring me back to life, bring me back to life,
I need (a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the crackers' ass, little crack a jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags and as I’m leavin'
I’ll guarantee they scream, ""Dre, don’t leave us like that man!"" cause

Tethered to finding a rope,
We walk in precarious ways.
And go alone at night
To Misery's bed.
In Misery's bed, we stay.

So far away

Here in the tremble and pulse,
With the rush and the weight of the world.
I am a cannibal, known,
Begging the lashes to break.

You find me awake in a dream,
A scream in the dark, so it seems.
Or is that just how it leaves?
The shadow I cast now the breeze.

So far away

So this is how it goes,
With the loss of our canopy home.
That falls with the leaves from the trees,
As we pass.

I keep the crush
And the weight of the world.

There passes a stranger every eve
Who walks himself on a silver leash
And in his head the world's asleep
Awakens in his hands believed
When he was young
He had a dream
To be a star on the movie screen
But now it all seems a silly lie
As he walks alone in the days on fire

Future Islands,"Seasons change, and I tried hard just to soften you
The seasons change, but I've grown tired of tryin' to change for you
Because I've been waiting on you
I've been waiting on you
Because I've been waiting on you
I've been waiting on you

As it breaks, the summer awaits
But the winter washed whats left of the taste
As it breaks, the summer awaits
But the winter craved whats lost
Crave whats all gone away

People change, even though some people never do
You know when people change
They gain a piece but they lose one too
Because I’ve been hanging on you
I’ve been waiting on you
Because I've been waiting on you
I've been hanging on you

As it breaks, the summer awaits
But the winter washed whats left of the taste
As it breaks, the summer awaits
But the winter craved whats lost
Crave whats all
Crave whats all gone away

Future Islands,"Been a long time, in a low place
Surrounded by what I have made
Need to get away
Get away from what relates
And what was done

Cuz it's all over now

Through the woods, I come running to loose leaf
And carve my name
In the lines, there's not a trace
I hear the ghost whisper, and those old eyes watching me
But I feel safe

Grandfather looking over me

He said:
Don't make them wait
Gotta go a long way
Let's be brave
Don't make them wait
Nah, don't make them wait

I sat down, with a coffee on my bent knee
Looking out, at the burnt land, looking back at me
These used to be green crops
And high on a summer breeze
No it's fallow fields and clear-cut barren weeds

They said that if I stared
The abyss would stare back at me
So I did...
And I felt it slowly creep in me
Save for the smoke, that danced when I took a drag
It made me think about the way it all came to be

Grandmama watching over me

And she said
Don't make them wait
Gotta go a long way
Let's be brave
Don't make them wait
Nah, don't make them wait

Don't make them wait, nah
Don't make them wait

And those old eyes watching me
But I feel safe
I feel safe",A  Song for Our Grandfathers

Come through the sea
To share

The light inside of you

Don't cast away, Don't cast away

Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
Open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives--to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you

Be more than strength and kind
Be love and blind

Yet, loves the most of what we do

My phone blowing up as soon as I get in town
That's 20 calls that I missed now
Women that I meet, they all on my dick now
Prolly 'cause they know that I'm getting rich now
I hit, don't kiss it, I get it then get out

I walked a lonely road before with no one to call
Nobody in my sight
Now everyone is on that same road, searching for me
Trying to stay alive

Getting paper from words I write on my iPhone
Long flight, might land in a different timezone
They talk about me, got tough skin like a rhino
I hit the stance and I hit the man with that tybo
Oh it's me, tryna get up on my team bruh
Tryna be up in my family, that's Venus and Serena
And these girls put on their speakers cause they been dying to meet us
If they bust it then I'm running - running faster than a cheetah
No flex zone like Rae Sremmurd
On the radio check the antenna
I've been have bars like San Quentin
This me, KodeBreak, and Quinn
Ball so hard, mothafuckas wanna fine me
Sale so good, all these labels wanna sign me
I'll get back to you on that right now

The radio is terrible they sent me here to rescue you
My album dropped and got the best reviews
I'm a teacher, got an F for you
But got so little time to lecture you
You can catch me at the local bar goin' hard
Spittin' fire like I'm Charizard up out the Pokeball
My flow is just like drunk sex you know it's raw
All of my girls gettin' spoiled like they Oprah's dog
I'm on the same mission, I'm tryna ball like Blake Griffin
I'm traveling more than LeBron I change pivots
I ain't missin', I may switch it, they can't get it
It ain't cool if I ain't did it
And I may visit the nursing home
Make sure that the curtains closed
Brought the urkel flow
Dipset and leave the nursing home
Hit it from the back til she collapse and catches vertigo
Send her boyfriend a text and make sure he's the first to know
All this fire spittin' can hurt your throat I need to chill
I don't need a deal but I'll take one for a couple billion
I'm tryna eat, you lookin' like a bum just walking around the sidewalk 
Lookin' at someone's lunch to spill, fuck how you feel boy I'm speaking the truth
Clark Kent when I sneak in the booth
I'm Superman
Go to the party grab a bottle of Baccardi
Then roll out like Luda fans I got stupid plans

Attention shoppers I get it poppin' I'm sippin' vodka
On my break eatin' Benihana's in my freakin' boxers
I've been a problem like a kid at six that gets adopted
You like a parent that works a lot only wishes stop 'em
I been obnoxious but never cautious I been spittin' lava
Like a volcano in Guatamala
I'm the fittest option to replace 'Pac, mix him with Eminem
And Nas and Common and Kendrick and Cole and maybe my nigga Hopsin
Stop lying about your job, that's a false start
Everybody knows that you still work at Walmart
Read the hallmark cards and pushing all carts
Tryna save up for a golf cart pushing a seg' like Paul Blart
I'm off-kilter, post a picture without filters
I make hits these, people catch em like outfielders
I'll have sex with a milf, and her son watching Bob The Builder
Don't unleash the beast it's Jumanji I feel like Robin Willaims
Who you know that do it better than I
Tuck Everlasting with the flow because it never could die
I'm on a flight, you the caterpillar on the Bug's Life
Even if I gave you wings, bro, you never could fly
I'm the truth I never would lie, Liar Liar
Jim Carrey, they been scary I'm Michael Myers
Y'all should retire, I pay the phone like Mekhi Phifer
Please don't step into my cyphers
Somebody gon' pay the piper
If Petey Piper picked the pickled pepper
He'd be sweatin' I could eat a ghost one
And flow somethin' hot as ever
I'm Allen Iverson, I was born with the talent
Talking bout practice, you could have it and
Still not be better
You like the three blind mice, you never see the cheddar
Albert Einstein with the flow because everything I speak is clever,
There's ten things that I hate about you rappers

So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel
Nuts, yes, I'm Siskel, yes I'm Ebert
And you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch,
You want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered,

Let me be Pacific, I want to be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean,
Means small craft advisory
So if I capsize in your thighs, high tide, be minus five,
You sunk my battle ship please turn me on,
I'm Mr. Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours I'll show you mine ""Tool Time""
You'll love it just like Lyle

The poor niggas sling crack, real raw niggas that bang gats
Crazy lady jumped on the train tracks
Know if you owe somebody dough you better bring that
Them kids is live, put five where your brain at
You walk the streets of the slums
Know to spot beef when it come
Reach for the guns or feel the heat from the ones
Never know who your killer be (Yeah, speak to no one)
Just put a Desert Eagle beak in his lung
Leak em and run, some guys light the blunts up

Chopped up bitch inside of a dumpster

(Yo, he's a cold blue) victim of the vultures
Block sizzlin' hot, flooded in the middle with cops
Innocent nigga topped, riddled with shots
Kids up in rock spots clock knots, fiddle with glocks
Ready to die for what little they got
Tricks, hoes and thugs (That's right)

Waitin' outside for them ones that pose in clubs
To that strange nigga knockin' on your do' with gloves
Let the .44 blow for grub, it's no love

You got uniformed cops, the D's when it's hot
TNT knockin' down the door of your spot
The feds come get you once you think you on top
They just been buildin' they case, they got you on tape
The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep
Your money's that long, you ain't that strong
Informants'll bury you under the jail
They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin' just like you
That's your competition, them niggas tryin to eat too
They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength
Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this

You gotta watch your front, sides and your back (Damn)
You gotta keep your eyes on your bitch and your mens
You gotta keep your mind sharp livin' so fed

울려라 라파파팜팜 너무 깊게 빠져서 헤어나올 수 없어도
내일이면 돌아갈 거야 그녀에게

So today, I don’t care, 'cause we wild we rolling stones.
Today 난 바람처럼 자유롭게 I’m rockin’ my life away

Yeah, hey baby, I got something to tell you, you know
내가 봐도 해도 내가 너무했지
첨엔 뭐 순했지 나중엔 즐겼어 죽였어 but 허무했지
그녀는 억울해했지 사실 알고 나니 싸늘했지
그것도 아주 많이 변명만 늘어놔 어눌했지
내 말투가 난 머뭇댔지 솔직히 말해 그걸 어떻게 말해?
너 하나론 부족해 뭐 이렇게 말해?
내 맘 속 가득한 사랑방 today, 손님은 for free

So today, I don’t care, 'cause we wild we rolling stones

Chase anything you have the passion to do
Only a dream 'till it happen to you
Finally seeing money now I'm acting a fool
Never thought touring the world all year
Would be something I might actually do
Friends came through got me so high
I forgot who I was passin' it to
Party in a mansion splash in a pool
Reminiscing those days back in the school
My whole crew would come through and rap with us too
Couple of them big goes packin' it too
Go ahead try and talk shit on me
I squad up come back with a crew
Call me a bitch see what that's gonna do
Fights in the streets like that shit was cool

Yea, we used to do dumb shit daily
Dreamed since I was just a baby
Now I'm here it's ""Fuck you, pay me""
I just had enough of waiting
I worked hard the ? Were lazy
If I stayed I just went crazy
People change, everything's in constant motion
My old girl's across the ocean
Some stuff stay well that's devotion
Some folks stay some come and go
And what you think is what you know
I must run fast you're running slow
Smoke, break down some Kush and roll a dutch
Right now my vibe is so alive so please
When we smoke just hush
Me and some of those who's closest to me haven't spoken much

I know I should keep in better touch

Even when we chill I never said that much

Everything is hella plush
Get caught up in all the girls I get them stuff
Meanwhile I see some girls I used to know and get her wet and stuff
Having kids with full salary jobs while I'm just getting jumped
Missing every birthday and anniversary
Yesterday my moms got out of surgery
Wasn't even in town
Shows and after parties what I've been 'round
Finding out the news late

Sit down priorities are all over the place and shit
Stress levels rise and that J gets lit
Try on shoes that Jay Z fit
Fuck all that complacent shit
I'm just dropping crazy shit
Trying to outdo those fool who think they can spit
But I can't even lie
All this real life shit is passing me by
Talking to myself and I'm asking me why
Would I feel better as an average guy
But I know that's just a lie
Pour up a glass and get high
? Rockstar life taking a toll on me like I'm asking to die
Going on tour for 6 months
Help mom ? After she sigh
Look up wish me luck

No Stress bullshit gets passed to the side

Yeah yeah yeah
Back when the first time we met I was thinkin' 'bout sex
but you told me not yet
I meant no disrespect I was just being honest, my only regret was
Never letting you know how I felt or what was up
That was too much Maker's in my cup
I was faded, too fucked up
And you probably think I'm an asshole
Read your facial expression
But it's not everyday someone comes and leaves an impression

I ain't really tryin' to fly out

To fall in love real quickly
But it's usually a phase I fall into in every city
That passes away instantly
When I leave it's over
I come to my senses when I'm sober, yeah
But I thought about you, no lie
When I left, you stayed on my brain
Then we finally got to fuckin',
That shit was all the way insane
Now I know that you're havin' a thought

Party in the penthouse, atop, passed the fuck out
Reminiscing being broke and hoping I would luck out
Nowadays I pull hoes, Swinging, never struck out
Reinvested everything, just trying to get a buck out
Will I ever make it? Felt fear on my life
For a while I was going through a nervous patch
Then I had the most insane year of my life
Crazy, cause I only saw the surface scratched
Yeah, waking up next to a random girl I never knew
Goin' after Marilyn's instead of Sue's
Tryna bring her backstage then see what she let me do
Till security was like, ""wait up, who the fuck are you?""
Sent back to being almost done
Opening up to shows I'm trying to get noticed on
Labels calling the telephone that I wrote this on
But I press decline, hit notes, and keep on going on
Take a look at us, it's what you call a team
Freight train, I'm leading everybody, full of steam
Drinking simultaneously, rolling collard greens
Maybe I was higher than a bitch and this was all a dream
Still killing shows with Blizzy
'Member being in this Jeep riding through the city
Played them Endless Summer said get used to staying busy
'Cause you'll never get a fallback, let's go and get a milli
Brought 'em on tour just to live it
Poppin' after parties with some girls who wanna to give it
All my close homies keep me grindin' like a pivot
Talkin' about a way to get it, we already did it!
Switchin' lanes when that Porsche shifts
Homies movin' weight just like a forklift
When my album drops, Jedis can feel the force shift
Meanwhile, you lyin-ass rappers droppin' horse-shit
Only pay attention if you pay me
Chilling with a Sarah and a Vicky and a Jamie
Just a young man living life, could you blame me?
Overcast is snowy but the titty bar is rainy
Dreaming of a million wifes asleep on satin
Homies always telling me to just keep on rapping
I'mma blow the fuck up while you sleep on napping

Always comes around when weed stinks
We fuck off and on, off and on
Only ever really fuck off and on
Never see her these days 'cause I'm often gone
When I'm home off tour never stop for long
Back this week from across the pond
Noticed I was close to the block she's on
Elevator to the floor her loft is on
Drinking whiskey, she likes Vodka strong
But after we fuck it's over
Walked out the door, that's closure
No I can't stay here and hold her
Tomorrow act like I don't know her
Wouldn't ever be here sober
Can't tell which one is colder
My clothing's on, we both did wrong

Sexy body she shows it

Pops a bottle won't close it
Fills a fifth then she throws it
She pops a bar now she's dozing
She's hot and cold, hot and cold
Homie I don't know she's hot and cold
Truly the bullshit has gotten old
Superficial with a rotten soul
Fucking off and on, always stop and go
Probably got someone, choose not to know
Head to her place then we lock the door
Making bad calls when I'm off the blow
'Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish
Want every girl, can't help it
And it's tough for me to shelf it
It's you I see myself with

I touched her then she melted

But where I used to see beauty, now I just see pathetic

Wants to party, thumbs through a roll of decks for the dealers yeah

The first time is when she kept on searching trying to find
Scared to lose it all but everything was nothing inside
Couldn't face the truth but everyone's got something to hide

Just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
I know you think that it's my fault we're fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault, we fall apart
And now I'm missin' your love

Contemplating just who I could've turned out to be
If I'd stayed and weren’t heard, what would amount to me?
If I had looked and ain't found, would I have founded me?
I mean inside, would they loved me, never looked down on me?
They say, ""You know if you loved her
Well then you would have stayed
You could have made a perfect pair that people wouldn't trade""
Trade for nothing, I did though, I had to chase it
Face it, I wasn’t born to live a life basic
They say, ""you turned your back on us just to go and be an artist
What's a promise anyway when someone breaks it?
I bet he finally gets a shot and then he wastes it
I bet he don’t come back for us when he makes it
And if he do it be too late, you gotta face it
'Cause by then there's someone new you've been replaced with
Old friends I grew up with, the girl I fell in love with
Love or hate me depending on how you judge it

I had to wander, I had to go tread my own path
If you don't step through no mud well then it won't last
The years pass it's crazy how they go fast
Ask myself questions that you have but you won't ask
Like, ""you don’t even come home enough
Where were you when she was in the hospital, huh?
It was only us,"" and that’s deep and yeah I know it cuts
But if it gets you, then you’re weak
'Cause we were here and it ain’t broken us
Still as close and stayed by her side when no one was
Like when she lost her job and everything, how broke we was
When she was sick and she needed some taking care of
A fifteen year old shouldered the weight
And when he was scared of
The worst, I know that you stayed strong
Don’t say this enough
But you made me just as proud as you made Mom
Yeah, you got some anger but I don’t blame you at all
I know I don't call, but you're my brother, I love you

In that first grade class they came and got me
""Your mom's outside, say goodbye now to everybody""
U-Haul's waiting with all of our things
At least what she could pack
In the time my dad's at work and before he came back
Way too young to comprehend what was happening
""Are we going to grandma's? When are we coming back again?""
Little did I know that we were leaving him by himself
And ten years would pass before Mom sees anybody else
Just us, in middle school I ain't understand
Who Melissa was and why she wasn't another man
Biased and confused they try to explain but nobody can
Wanted what I thought was normal, she had another plan
Such is life, even if it took time for me to accept it
No longer Dad now, but a woman with whom she slept with
Or for the years when a secret was how she kept it
I ain't get it, admittedly I was skeptic
I came around, happiness I see's what you may have found
And that's what's most important
I don’t wanna see you breaking down
I wanna see you smile, I don't wanna see you make a frown
If she loves you, then that's all anybody needs maybe now
By '05 things had gotten worse
Moved to the basement, deep depressions a rotten curse
Hiding in a dark space, her mind and her body hurts
Becoming more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts
So the worse it got, I became more and more afraid
Until one night, I went into that room, on the floor she laid
I shook her she was blue, her skin was cold, she wasn't breathing
Screamed, ""Melissa wake up"" couldn't fathom that she was leaving
Mom and bro was running down, I screamed ""somebody help""
Try pumping her chest, CPR, but it didn’t help
Toughest pill to swallow, but we lost, that’s forced reflection
While in her life you made her happy, thank you for the blessing

Had faith in the journey

Where everybody way up in the stands is

Woke up in NYC today, don't think we're in Kansas
Anymore, but sometimes it's hard to be sure
'Cause if I dreamed that it happened, did it actually or?
Am I just still asleep, and none of it's real

Last night I sent a message
Drunk when I sent it, pieces of a fragmented sentence
Essentially along the lines of saying I'm in town
And cross the line just saying if you're down
Let's chill and get a drink
I sip, hoping I would hear again
The text bubble popped up and dissapeared again
Like I don't want it getting weird again
And I don't wanna fight
And I don't want you shedding tears again
It's not a big deal, but don't think I don't think about you
Just 'cause I ain't spoken about you
I'd asked how you feel but already know I won't get it out you
You'll probably tell your friends that I wrote this about you
Whatever, I know I can be jealous and crazy
The voices in my head have liked to yell at me lately
I still can't believe what they've been telling me lately

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers
Before I let this police kid harass me

It's not of my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe
What she doesn't understand catch attitudes when I leave her
My other relationships just make it harder for me to accept her as my own
She tries to tie up my phone and
I'm not at home she's thinking I'm not alone
Probably out tryin' to bone anything in the street
I let her know she can leave I ain't tryin' to tie her up
But see it's hard to fuck wit somebody after she touches me
Mami I'm not your regular nigga I know the game
But I don't play by the rules I'm focusing on my moves
That way I will never lose
See I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Bentleys with 22's
You say I confuse you play little trick with your head
Catching feelings ever since the first time I slept in your bed
I'm not here to tease you mislead you with so your dreams
I can't say I love you I don't know what that means
I'm a pimp

Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

When I first met her, I did anything to get her
Paid all her bills and filled her frigerator
Reminiscing on late nights when I tried to lay up
But couldn't get off cause your baby would stay up
She even crashed the whip tryin' to switch in the third lane
That's when I realized this bitch was a bird brain
A pigeon writing her baby pops in the box in prison
Sing-Sing is where he been in
She in the Gucci tights and Fendi high heels
Baby wipes and cans of Enfamil
Motorbikes and grams of fish scale
So 9 to 5 niggas was no frills
Turning young niggas with principals to old men with debts
And all the prank calls was death threats
That bitch got the best sex, all across the globe
And the bitch head game was out of control

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

I wonder when I'm gone if you miss me
Or do you miss that Don Perignon and that Christy
I'm fuckin wit you
I'm feeling your shape I'm feeling your eyes
Later on I'm feeling your ass and feeling your thighs
Sweetheart you book smart and street smart
I knew you was my type from the very, very start
I'm in to tongue kissing, foreplay all day
Momma ain't home so the noise is okay
ODB you know we like it the raw way
Latex, safe sex, no hickeys on the neck
Now you're learning
The lords blesses make me wiser as the worlds turning
My tongue touch the right spot I'll have your toes curling
Whether we just kicking it or we sexing
I'm a pro baby girl I spit game to perfection
So when niggas make mistakes I correct em and
When niggas get out of line I check them man

Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

Just tell em you my boo, and show em your tattoo, oh

Cause these other niggas that rap ain't on the shit that I'm on
Cause 50 this; 50 that; 50 stay with a gat
Thirty-two shots in the clip, hollow tips in the MAC
But when I come through, shh - the talking stop
My money long now, I can make the Pope get shot
Now, we can blow an hour talking bout the stones I rock
Or the hoes I got - catchin' stunts in the drop
Now, Nas, you love the kid, 50 on that killa shit
That big mobster bad man; BGF guerrilla shit
I'm marking my music like diesel on the block
So if you with me you gon' eat, and you gon' starve if you not
Weed smokers love me like they love Buddha
I'll turn your kids to a shooter
Crip niggas love me like they love Hoover
They tell me see careful good, cause niggas wanna see like you

Shooting these niggas lights out like LeBron James
Holla my name; give me a reason to see you bleeding
After you feel these hollow tips, nigga, then we even
Full of anger until there's no more bullets in the chamber
Ain't nothing like when you get popped and don't know who to blame-a
Nigga told me, ""Do your dirt all by your lonely""
So I go hit them niggas 'fore 50 could even hold me
I'm waiting, anticipating to put a nigga under
Smoking like we some Jamaicans, fucking with this ganja
Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must
Bad as I want to, some shit I just don't discuss
So point him out and watch I knock him off
Everywhere you bitches go, I got a nigga watching ya'll, motherfucka!

Lean out my bucket for niggas thinking they Rambo
You get one warning, so I suggest you let your man know
These rap niggas portray to be tough, nobody acting soft
Til they laid out in the hospital, eatin' apple sauce
Usually for yapping off and turn apologetic
Waving a white flag, for danger they might have
My niggas buying so much ammo
If you reach in the couch for loose change
You'll probably feel on the handle
Holding sixteens to get your bandages and broke bones
So I suggest you get alarm systems in both homes
There's only one team on top; we number one with a Glock
Fuck around and get your dumb ass shot

They, they talking that

General, I salute you
I'll put a hole in any nigga tryna shoot you
It ain't nothing 'cause loyalty is what I'm used to
And what I don't do, I'll have one of my troops do
Nigga we'll kill you

I'm ready for combat, a solider on the front line
Take me to the streets, nigga motherfuck a punchline
It only take one time, for you to send a death threat
And watch these bullets have that ass singing like Keith Sweat
You ain't met me yet
I been camouflaged in the bushes
And I'm co-signing Fifty, 'cause them niggas all pussies
Bustin' shots at ya convoy
You don't want war
No surrender, no retreat, this is Vietnam boy
Check my war wounds, I done took a couple for the team
Only niggas that been on the battlefield know what I mean
Take cover we coming, pulling pins outta grenades
You won't make it to the general, without getting sprayed
Might as well say ""Hello"" to my brand new little friend
Only time he come out, to put holes in grown men
You continue troops and get 'em all blowed back
Walk up on 'em with a deuce-deuce and nigga all that, what!

[Chorus: x2]

Look nigga, I suggest you go home
Cause I won't hesitate to let the chrome touch ya
Nigga I'm never scared like Bone Crusher
Stand alone, provide my own supper
Tell ya baby mama stop coming around here or I'm gon' fuck her
Don't trying to pick up for them lames around you
You get shots for free, like I fragrant fouled you
I'm on the road blowing grade A haze and brown
Got niggas running like the KKK's around
My album's coming, a new year's approaching
My buzz getting bigger, my few ears is open
Can ya team play in the game without you their to coach 'em
There's a very fine line between a pool and the ocean
Sometimes I'm in Atlanta where they make head bounce
And you can come, but after you give Banks head, bounce
These niggas really want war, 'cause if so
Get on your vest, 'cause all you gotta do is say that

Niggas done heard about my click how we stay wit the toasters
Blood in, blood out, la kostra nostra
You don't want to bang wit the best
I'll have Doc removing fragments from your chest
They say God's a forgivin' man, I hope he forgive
Thirty shells I let off don't curse my kid
They say Fifty done blew up, Fifty you changed
Nigga you stunt, I pull out
And you see I'm that same nigga that when he start to roar
I think he's flying
Eight outta eight on moving targets
You run? You still dying
Check my resume, I am oh so loco
Mama ain't raise no chump, I don't talk no pocco

[Young Buck]
There once was some niggas that tried to murder me
I hit em up, put em in plastic surgery
This 4-5 has made a lot of guys apologize
The truth come out, 'stead of hearin' a lot of lies
Some niggas catch a case and then claim they hard
A couple chest wounds will make a nigga change his heart
I just play my part, and while you shooting up cars
I'm smokin' niggas like a Cuban cigar
Let's get it poppin'

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
I'm tired of you niggas with your maybe beef
We gonna be here forever, you're temporary like baby teeth
I'm in and out the night clubs, A-D-D
Dark blue Benz, navy seats, eighty sneaks
These niggas tellin' out the blue
So you hang em off the bridge
At least they'll have to helicopter you
The Jimmy lived in the bags, the Bell or Hop will do
I rap for the neighborhood niggas that failed in high school
You can tell I came a long way in my sense, home grown
That's why them little niggas in the projects love me
You provide the beat downs for free, I paid my dues
I don't even freestyle for free
I gave em a break, flew over seas
But it's kinda hard to get homie-sick when there's blue in the trees
Sit back and try to play your role wit the copies
I put more staples in yo ass than a telephone pole, Yea

If, you don't know, who I be

Oh, you wanna be tough nigga, a look is enough
I put that snub nose to ya and bust nigga
If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me
And they'll tell ya I'm a soldier boy
And I done told ya, over and over boy

I come from a big city, the streets corrupt
Now I'm rollin' with snub-noses to heat you up
Out here niggas'll do anything to reach a buck
Cause when you broke you can't afford to fuck ya sneakers up
I take my time, keep my mind on my bank funds
Learn how to separate the real from the fake ones
And on my heater nina rep what could I carry on
My nigga just lost his momma, and his daddy gone
From now on I can provide cause my paper's straight
Family losin' his legs, but I can take the weight
Some niggas hate but I'll be damned if they hold me down
Front niggas didn't know me then, bet they know me now
Blunt and a smile, eventually it'll be a frown
Cause every time I turn around a nigga locked down
While I'm in the world, tryin to bring my loot through
Hopin' one day we can kick it like we used to, my nigga

If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me
Oh, you wanna be tough nigga, a look is enough
I put that snub nose to ya and bust nigga
If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me
And they'll tell ya I'm a soldier boy
And I done told ya, over and over boy

Uhh, they never seen 26's on a Hummer
My goal is to try to fuck Trina by the summer
Some niggas hate me, but they only made me
Go and put mo' ice in my mouth than Baby
G-Unit and Shady, them dudes is crazy
Next time, we only usin' Dr. Dre's beats
Fuck you, pay me, take your magazine flicks
This ain't no Nelly hurr, take a good look at this
Got the wrists of a chemist and the heart of a hustler
Plus I probably done robbed mo' artists than Russell
Always in trouble, you can blame my mother
Gave birth to a gorilla and raised him in the jungle
I ain't crawled, I stumbled across the Mexican with birds
Papi had coke and new plates and pounds of herb
Keep my hand on my Glock, and my ear to the streets
I'm a country boy, you can hear it when I speak
G-Unit!

If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me
Oh, you wanna be tough nigga, a look is enough
I put that snub nose to ya and bust nigga
If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me
And they'll tell ya I'm a soldier boy
And I done told ya, over and over boy

Bentley Azure dreams, G-5 agenda
The hood had made a nigga heart colder than December
Don't take much to make my gun go off
One shot'll make a hardrock look oh so soft
If you don't know you better ask who I be
Or end up in ICU gettin' fed through a IV
Down in the Lou', they say they feelin' me dirty
In New Orleans they say I'm that nigga, ya heard me?
From them Southside blocks to Watts, Westside don't front
You know about them Grapestreet Gangstas, G'd up
Rollin that weed up
Nigga get outta line, get shot stabbed jacked
Hit with a bat or beat up
Fuck that, we're on that same bullshit
Same forty-cally Glock, same full clip

Not your buddy, not your pal, not your homie
There ain't a government around that can control me, oh no
I'm on that doggy style shit, man I don't love a hoe
Pappa wasn't around so I had to let my brother know,
Never stay in center, play the back and let your money grow,
Most them nigga wouldn't be around if you was bummy yo,
South side Jamaica nigga yeah that's where I come from,
If you see a nigga with me then there's more than one gun,
Five straight soldier ain't that tired of being the dumb one,
Or even satisfied being another niggas dun-dun,
We all know friendships turn sour when you getting it,
Some niggas hate me in the hood but I don't owe them niggas shit,
Smilin' all up in my face like I don't know them niggas sick,
But I can care less, I'm on the album and I'm gettin' rich.

Walkin' and talkin' spit it how I live it nigga,
Came from the country, dirty south get it nigga,
Feds trying to question me, they run up in my hotel,
They said there wasn't shootin', but they found no shells,
New york city, hell they throwin' niggas under jails,
I got love for them and I ain't even from there,
Now bust a shot for them boys on the block,
I can feel your pain nigga,
I'm still in the game nigga,
There somethin' bout the sound of a trey-pound,
That make me pull up, hop out and make a nigga lay down,
See every time we round' ya hear some shots go off,
And niggas get there chains snatched when they try and show off,
Shoot outs in broad day we do it the mob way,
And come to find out these niggas is softer than Sade,
I'ma keep living my life with a pistol in my palm and a wrist full of ice,
You can call me the don.

We got the Hei-ny
So make one wrong move and you're dying
Ain't no time for coppin a plea and crying
Cause my niggaz ain't gon' stop ridin'
So you gone

I got a hand gun habit, nigga front I'll let ya have it, 
When the shots go off cops saying 50 back at it,
I'm allergic to the feathers on these bird ass niggas,
Front and I'll put ya brains on that curbed fence nigga,
I ain't a marksman my spark and I'll spray shit,
Enough rounds for the Hk I don't play bitch,
Move like I'm militant back on that gorilla shit,
Moody, disrespectful, I'm ruley but niggas can't move me,
I squeeze till I run outta ammo, if it's a problem it's handled,
I'll have your people pourin' out liquor and lightin' candles,
You fuck around I'll blow your brains on my new york times,
Run home turn to the sports section and read your mind,
It's crystal clear you should feel when that gat bust,
First it's crime scene tape then you end up in that black hurst,
We don't go to funerals but we'll go to your wake fam,
View your body all banged up, you made a mistake man.

Hey if you hear me out there
I get down on my knees every night and pray

Little kids get to running 
Old ladys get off the block
When the pops hit the truck music comes to a stop
Niggas get on the floor with their front doors locked
Syringes and sirens the only thing on the street
People act like they don't know who did it but they know its me
Every days a death threat but I ain't dead yet
So I go put a whole in the nigga from the next sac
Don't know where I slept at just know where my check at
Its the first of the month
My bitch ain't got her check yet
Juve left me in California I don't respect that
I love him to much to beef so I'ma except that
But I'ma just step back
And focus on buck
I'm tired of riding in yours I'm bout to buy my own truck
Gotta try my own luck
Get rich or die trying

Then there was one set of footprints in the sand

To get what I done got
If you look through a scope
You couldn't hit what I done shot
Couldn't flip what I done copped
Couldn't dip what I done topped

Like a clip without a glock
When you holla g-unit on some other shit
You need to do the research and see who you fucking with
I smoke all ya weed up 
Go run up ya visa

I don't want that skeezer
She scratched my bima
But I ain't Seen her
When I catch the bitch 
I'ma gangsta lean her

As long as the check come then fuck the award shows you know me nigga

Half of these kids never read the bible
But they can tell you how to kill a man better than I do
The reason they fucked up they all been lied to
I know what It feels like
When a nigga misguide you
My momma stay in the projects
And I been having money
I went bought her a house
But she told me she ain't want it
Right then I understood that the hoods in my blood
So I holla Cashville Let them know where I'm from
Niggas know I got a gun
When I come to the club
And If It go down you better tell your people to Duck
Why should I slow down
I just got started targeting artists
Wait till the bullets start hopping
Out the closets
I come to get it popping
I pray to god the news watching
So when they see him his niggas will know who got him
We came from the bottom to the top
From hoopties to a drop
Killer be killed
Is the attitude I got nigga

My fingernails still filled with cocaine residue,
I still got the heart to go bust me ahead or 2

Until you wake up and you gotta here about these shootings,
I take a bullet from my vooz and put the clip in my pocket 
Before I take another bullet I'm gonna pull it and pop it
And if its beef my nigga then let your guns do the talkin'

Gimme 8 days in the 8th hommie I'm straight
Have a church girl on the bus move an wait

I got birds in the hood so I'm in to birds with Mary
My writing methods got me more hoes than tice and betha
Icy necklace on the tour bus ass naked here straight jump
Bitch say how high and flag down a car when the shit drive by

If the bitch don't like me the bitch must don't like men (like men)
I say what I want cause I can
If I didn't id be a liar 
Mommy I'm on fire
Come ride with a rider
The crowd say you might catch the king with a singer
For touching my doorbells the only way ill put a ring on your finger
Give me a convo with two cups an 
I'm in your bedroom fucking up your sheets like the ku klux klan
I shook hands with my fans and fuck em
I'm in the hallways trying to duck em
So i can climb in to something
My names B-A-N-K dollar sign bitch
I'm a bigme to make that switch
Now come gimmie that

Groupies come and groupies go

The Lunatics the Lost Boys cheap shit is wack now
Country boots shrowden crackers got him on his back now
And Sean runnin' round with his gat now
Up in niggaz cribs sayin' where that money at pound
And Saundra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch travel the world she runnin' round boostin'
And Toya got these bad ass kids they a nusince
Their baby daddy's never come around they useless
Everynow and then I come through on some new shit

I'm fin ta Crip walk and put some motherfucking khakis on
No that's alright man I ain't got nothin' to prove
I'm rich but I still live like I got nothin' to lose
Look man, I don't know what you been drinkin' I don't know what you been thinkin'
But get outta line and it's oops upside ya head
The media they write whatever they choose
And the cops stay on my ass so I stay on the news
These other rap niggas couldn't walk in my shoes
Went through a bunch of bullshit while I was paying my dues
They say my music make a gangsta want to pop somethin'
Well tell them niggas to get poppin' & stop frontin'
You heard of me but do you know how I get down
Stay with a vest on, roll wit a couple tre-pounds
In case you motherfuckers want to jump bad now
I'll start some bullshit and I'm a lay ya punk ass down

Hittin' niggas from long range for writin' the wrong things
My name Young Buck but I look like a old man
Just 'cause I like ice don't compare me to Lil Wayne
I make rap niggas disappear like Lil Zane
See Buck been shot, but not more than 50
I don't dance, what I look like signin' wit Diddy?
I got plans, grenades and the G-Unit wit me
And on command, we spray give a fuck who we hittin'
What's in my hand? A tan 'bout a hundred and sixty
Hollow tips, four-fifths with the rubber grip
Crips and Bloods they show me love like I'm claimin' a set
These industry niggas know they better pay me my check
I get a kick outta seein' these broke ass rappers
Ten people showed up that's why your show got canceled
50 whatever they did to the kid is handled
Niggas callin' for these features but they get no answers
Fuck y'all niggas

A bitch know it's a privilege if I stop to check her

And I don't mean a soda

Your fuckin' wit a soldier
I'm selling tickets for a first class trip to a hospital folder
So please keep talkin'
So we can spread your feet, and have you on your boulevard Walkin'
The birds keep hawkin', why?
'Cause I'm burnin every CD and Walkman from D.C. to Boston
I laugh at a snotty chick, bitch I don't argue
I'll leave a print in your ass from a karate kick

And if they pull out you'd prolly shit

I lay your ass out motherfucker is simple
Stay in your place I recommend or say hello to my little friend

Everywhere I go I gotta tag along
Cause my buzz gettin' strong And they mad I'm on
They ride with me when I'm past the mall
Don't wait for me on the bench when I'm running a game of basketball
One squeeze will make a bastard fall
Gasp and crawl
You need a bulletproof vest mask and all
Bring your buddy when it's time to roam (why?)
Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home
My hand bling full of platinum the shine is chrome
He even got closet space inside of my home
He ain't never been broke he glitchless
So reliable I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas
Infrared beam in the scope for distance
The best company wouldn't proach in business
He who ride with me to the end
We all gotta friend
And mine is a G-you-N.

She meet him his destination hell or heaven
Cause I only bring em out for that 187
He don't have a heart I just keep feeding him shells
He get it poppin' in the hood so his name ring bell
Ms. Jones stay on the third floor she call the cops on me
They came I ran I had to toss my Uncle little homie
Niggas they all got new friends so they stay in there place kid
I stay screamin' on niggas and beatin' up base heads
These niggas sayin' doley just like they pretend
Keep fuckin' around they goin' say hello to my little friend.

We been through it all yet we both still livin'
We been in a box but we both still spittin'
And when there was beef you even played your position
Got under the seat until we spotted our victim
At first they wouldn't listen to they heard you go off
Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York
And little did they know we was ready for war
Bet that nigga wished he'd never stick his head out the door
See whenever you come out something happen on the block
You the reason that nigga done stop rappin' like Pac
People see you ain't run and you even say shit
They just know you ain't nothin' to play wit
Stay wit 16 homies and one in the hole
When the first one get out the next one go
To know where your headed you gotta know where you been
The glock stay with me we friends till the end.

I kicked her ass, we back friends like Puffy and Steve Stoute
Cut the grass around my crib so I could see these snakes
You see 'em back in the hood, it's cause I see they're fake
I preach a sermon ‘bout the paper like I'm Creflo Dollar
I pop you punk niggas like I pop my collar
I'm confused, I like Megan, Monica and Mya
Missy's freaky and Brandy's shy (uh)
Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up
I'm on now, God damnit, I done came up (what?)
Now you can find me with the finest hoes
Choosin which whip to drive by what match my clothes
I got a fetish for the stones, I'm heavy on the ice man

Nuttin but bling bling in your face boy, that's why my neck
Shine like one of the shirts that Puffy and Mase wore
I done found a nympho as soon as I pop a broad
She at my balls, head first like a soccer star
You can only stand next to the man if you proper

'Cause a nigga thuggin' don't mean he don't
Wanna see you smile baby

Woo, I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes

I'm gettin' the feelin' you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch, ahan
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic but the hearts in tact
So everytime we separate, somebody's marchin' back
You're amazin' in the sack
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black
God bless whoever gave you all of that
If you seen her from the back
You'd understand why dis feel like that
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes
Up and down

Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be
Be the reason you smile
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be
Be the reason you smile
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be
Be the reason you smile
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be
Be the reason you smile

The main reason I been lookin' at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tip toed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though you're busy boo, the evenin's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, 'cause I see niggas
When you tease 'em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left
Wild drama, section eight princess
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed
'Cause it's hard to communicate
'Cause she don't speak no ingles
I been around the world from state to state
But now I'm back bustin' in your bathroom
Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on
Cause I'm leavin in a hour flat, really don't matter, she's mad
Even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And, I bet you I can make you smile
(And)

Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be

I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown

I'll teach you how to stunt
Nigga you can't see me
My Bentley GT got smoke gray rims
I'll teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man
I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans
I'll teach you how to stunt

Seven series BM, Six series Benz
Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims
All on one wheel when I'm on one of them
Ma, that boy out there acting a fool that's him
They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy
They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me
And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say Fifty man your sneaker look white yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho
Banks is a sure thing, y'all niggas might blow
I'm fitting to drop that, so I suggest you lay low
Buc, he from Cashville, Tenneckee nigga
Getting them ten of keys, save ten for me nigga

I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rapping
But the kids used to look up to you, what happened?
Me on the corner contrary hand covered with platinum
Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, 'cause you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the mack in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
'cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stuntin' there's nothing you can teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us
No, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt
Come with me out front, I'll tech you how to stunt

Chain so icy, you don't have to like me
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback Nikes
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days
The only thing changed is the numbers on the range
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold
G-Unit homie, actin' like y'all don't know
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes
They never seen doors lift up on a car before
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know
That's how to show these fougaisies how it's supposed to go

I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman""
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted half fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
Bitches be frustrated with the baller
Wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town
Hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear down
Next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground
Just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' n' moving cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with a frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more
Watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man
I sweet talking her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
Look I'm legit now used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours
Big house big Benz girl it yours
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
Cause their be some honies gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night
We can have a balla night

Niggaz want some get back, I know it so I get strapped
Suckas took they laws off, these hoes want my draws off
'cause tried to foul me, but I had to steel back
In fact when I hit him he was bloody in the bilz-nack
His buddy tried to peel back, but I had to kill that
Real niggaz from the turf, shit I know y'all feel that
We won't talk, ain't no need for that (fuck that)
The word on Snoop is I'm a G for that
A 'G' for what? Fuckin niggaz up with no talkin
See the best way to leave a nigga's off in a coffin
And now I'm back on the set and I'm walkin

Hangin outta the back of the black Cadillac window
Adrenaline pumpin, the infra-red on his temple

Got a cherry lowrider in the N-why-see
Eve took me to Philly, never been to the pen
Been to Uptown with 50, seen niggaz in Timbs

I done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force One's
In Cashville, but Compton is
Where it's just me, my son, and my bitch
She graduated when Notorious B.I.G. dropped ""Me and My Bitch""

She get them birds past, I put her in first class
And tell her to carry on that Duni and Burke bag
She from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag
And only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags

'Cause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin'
I lay niggaz out like creased khakis

Midwest, money make the world go round
Down South, money make the world go round
Southside, money make the world go round

Some people want nothin' out of life
And some people want it all
Some people ain't livin' life right
But fast money make God call

I'm prayin' to the angels, but worship the devils
Yeah a nigga rich but I'm livin' like a rebel
Ridin' with my strap on, foot on the pedal
Them silly beef raps, now they on another level, level

I grew up on a crop side, the New York Southside
Stayin' alive was no jive
Standin' on the strip you get stuck like velcro
Jake jump out, you see heads and elbows

Run nigga, run nigga, here they come nigga
Throw that pack nigga, toss that trigger
Kid I'm still in the P's, girl I love the Audi
If yo' ass pregnant girl, leave the party

My stashbox so big, it could move the shotty
God it ain't my fault, if I shoot somebody
I ain't in it to lose, I'm in it to win
Sex, money, murder, take the safety off my sins (yeah!)

Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars
Money make the world go round so get yours

Buckle down, do anything for the dollar
Enough bills'll make your blood spill
Kill for bread, anyone will from Queens to Gun Hill

Shiny trey-pound, black 9-mil
Magucci leather got me shoe crazy
Quarter mil' vehicle and I'm a oops baby

And if I'm wearin' my chain it's 380
Like Fat Joe, nigga you crazy?
Man fuck friends, this T-dot-O-dot-S
Have it how you want, speed knot or pop chess

Police stompin' niggaz by the twenty
And shootin' by the fifty, ain't a damn thing funny
Matter fact, man I'm a do anything for the dough

I love that money, I need that money
It gives me shelter, it's there when I'm hungry
It feeds my kids, it fills my fridge
It pays my bills and the mortgage on the crib

It keeps me icy, it make hoes like me
It gives me, seats at the Garden next to Spike Lee
It made me rich, it made me change
I seen a lot of places and bought a lot of things

You got me haters, you got me drama
You paid for the lawyers, you paid for the llamas
You make niggaz goners, you rule all the corners
When somebody dies, you gotta pay the moroners, moroners

9 millimeters and we ball in arenas 
If you hood then you seen us who would in the beamers 
I'm that new name 
They older than Adidas 
When they see us they talk talk shit 
They wanna be us

When we're pressin' us
Why the arrestin' us
They want up in [unknown]
You're stressin' us
The moon eclipse, is a mess you know
Lil' punks can't do nothing you know

[Chorus]

Don't fuck around and start a fight

I'm [unknown] Hip hop goin hard 
FEDS ran in the crib swat all in my yard 
Im the high school drop out crack game genius 
The mack will turn ya back into gilbert arenas 

I'm 'criminal minded', you've been blinded 
FEDS lookin for my bricks but can't find it 
Banuga wit the rouga my grip is rubber 
My frank muula is 5th and them rainbow colors 

Being broke is a disease I need that groupe and that cheddar 
I learned that in a maybach wit fif and Mayweather 
Mix the milk with Armaretta my 
Armaretta's in my leather 
My tiger striped eagle, make you people need [unknown]

When we're pressin' us
Why the arrestin' us
They want up in [unknown]
You're stressin' us
The moon eclipse, is a mess you know
Lil' punks can't do nothing you know [Repeat: x 2]

G-Unit,"[50 Cent]
This is the Unit
The mighty mighty mighty Unit
This is how we do it
Ayy (ayy, ayy)

I make the airline and pop to it, N.Y. bop to it
No frontin' here shorty, niggaz know how I do it
For the paper let the gat pop, jackpot
Find me trippin', ridin' slow through the back blocks

Red Coupe switchin' lanes, top down, party frame
Diamond rings, diamond chains, diamonds on everythang
Mo' flows, mo' dough, money come, money go
New straps, new clip, stack chips, don't trip

Play playa, go hard, stunt nigga, oh God
Party ain't never over, niggaz hardly ever sober
Different day, same shit, different city, different chick
Show you how I do this shit, you notice how I do it kid

[Tony Yayo]
Bitches recognize when I'm walkin' in
Smokin' that piff, goin' where dolphins swim
44-Colt, that's tossin' him
And that four-do' car is what I'm flossin' in (YEAH!)

I'm in the black, you in the red
You owe your label money, I'm gettin' bread
Can you feel it, feel it? Nothin' can save ya
In my purple tag Polo and neon Gators (break it down now!)

Bitch play cute, I don't get upset
'Til her ass get a facial and a washin' set
I'm in a private jet, but before the deal
Hoes was like, ""He's all right, but he's not ill!""

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You might see me yawnin', four in the mornin'
But the party ain't over
Then it's back to the crib, to cut shorty that's how we on it
The party ain't over
Shorty move like you wanna move, work it shorty
Gon' do what you wan' do, twerk it for me
Now get low, shorty work that back
Now get low, yeah just like that
Now get low

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, they love it when I pop round, doors up, top down
Seat back, keep that, motherfuckin' glock round
Nigga this is my town, my block, my crown
My sound, peace to my niggaz on lockdown

They don't really want that, they know we get it poppin'
Six-four droppin', you still window shoppin'
I'm ridin' round rockin', knockin', Rakim
Slick Rick, Rick James; big stack, big chains

I'm so sicker, the flow liquor, you're broke nigga
I toast with ya - if ya got a cup
Hold your fuckin' bottle up, I really want a model but
You can get behind the truck, if you swallow nut

I'm just playin', unless you goin' do it
You put your back into it, the rest is all fluid
Don't pull that thing out unless you gon' use it
Ain't nobody bleedin', I guess it's all music

[Young Buck]
Shawty the kush still burnin', Aston Martin wheel turnin'
Higher than Mount Vernon, the passenger she German
Bottles is still poppin', clubs is still rockin'
Feds is still watchin', but fiends is still shoppin'

I got vitamin water money like I signed a deal
How would you feel if you niggaz just got 400 mil' (like me)
My bad bitch do her thang in her Vera Wang
She let me have a brain, I let her wear my chain

I'm on the plane smokin' on that Mary Jane
Listenin' to Trina while she run game on Lil' Wayne
My Ten-a-ki' timepiece shinin' like a light bulb
David Brown t-shirt, dressed just like a thug

G-Unit,"Disrespectful, anythin?
I let you breathe, now you're dead

there's no war without casualties
End up in a wake when you fuck with me
You got beef with my man, you got beef with me
I got this semi on me motherfucker, you'll see
Devil ?round the corner

Is that my dawg that slapped that cat?
Now how did the chicken give birth to a rat?
Now how did the rat learn to sing like a bird?
His pops is a OG, this is absurd

My gun game right, my knife game right
Fuck around, I?ll get right in broad daylight
Spin the barrel on a nigga, pin the tail on the donkey
It?s a zoo out this, bitch, I put a hole in the monkey

Got the gemstars to rip 'em, hundred shots to clip 'em
Body bags to zip ?em and we don't know a thing
You hit, nigga you trippin?, you think it?s over you're trippin?
Reload, slap the clip in bang, bang, strapped

there's no war without casualties
End up in a wake when you fuck with me
You got beef with my man, you got beef with me
I got this semi on me motherfucker, you'll see
Devil ?round the corner

Uh, I drink like a uncle, smoke like a Rasta
Ball like a superstar, talk like a boxer
Fuck like a rabbit, shit like a dinosaur
See you like a sniper, lil? nigga eve?why night is war

Drive like a Lambo, stunt like I'm out of town
Strapped like commando, be A N K dollar sign
Give everythin? up, I won't change like the other, nope
Switch overnight I can't, I?ma side his camp

I'm 'bout a dollar boy and dollar bills'll kill
Kill that bullshit, I'm famous but I'm ridin? with the steel
Will throw it all away, I see you later today
You'll see I'm fadin? away, that's all I'm able to say

there's no war without casualties
End up in a wake when you fuck with me
You got beef with my man, you got beef with me
I got this semi on me motherfucker, you'll see
Devil ?round the corner

Yeah, it?s the enforcer Yayo
We can do it in broad daylight
In front of the White House for all I care

I?ll blow your heart out your body sucker
Then jump in the Aston blastin?, burnin? rubber
Black ski mask, the Aston tinted
Ditch the gun, burn the car ?cause my DNA in it

Next day it's the GT, stunt off of a G.P.
Fist full of stones, fingers glowin? like E.T.
Fake O.G., O.G. Bobby Jones
Do your son like J-Rock, Mausberg pumpin?

I'm stuntin?, focus like a digital camera
Got that P-95 with that invisible hammer
Nigga who you tryin? to ride on, I'm a icon
Heart made of steel, balls made of iron

there's no war without casualties
End up in a wake when you fuck with me
You got beef with my man, you got beef with me
I got this semi on me motherfucker, you'll see
Devil ?round the corner

Girl what's it gonna take to have you close to me
Right by my side where you supposed to be
They start to notice you when they notice me
And you can have it all free of charge

I know you like European cars
Take, take a look at my garage
Make, make and we can all ménage
Me in the middle when your legs to the side

I've got that Bentley, Ferrari, that Lambo lean
My car game crazy, I can't be seen
The Aston, Bugatti the Range and the Rolls
Got me freakin? off with some high class hoes

You know with me man, anything goes

Jesus, I bet you won't believe this unless I let you see this
She deep throat my whole cock

I gotta take her to my hood let her blow my whole block
Yeah, I just happen to be what she likes
She said I'm special I'm like, ?Yeah babe, you right?

Turn her into a rider, rollin? with a roller
Hold up like a cobra, bone her till she sober
Fold her in positions till it's hard to bend over

I'm a very special kind, I can't let you shine
These rappers out their mind, don't compare to me combined
Take a look at my design, my Louis fittin? fine
My jewelry might blind, I'm a walking white line

You can't get on my level that'll take a lifetime
Man, I got it at 25 it'll take you a life time
I don't care about crime as long it's not mine
I'ma be fine, I'm stronger than white lines

If ya girl ain't home till the early morn
She's probably with the G-Unit gettin? it on
I told her she's miss right so it can't be wrong
And we went at it all night long

Me in the middle when your legs to the side

From 1 to 10, baby girl, off the Richter

Shake that ass drop it low like a stripper
