Art Van Damme,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!
Till everything he's got belongs to me!

And everything I've got belongs to him!
And everything I've got belongs to us!",Ev'rything I've Got
Art Van Damme,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Art Van Damme,"Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo,
In a garden fair where roses grow,
In the tender light
Of a Summer night,
I can see her wander to and fro.

For she said, ""I'll wait
By the garden gate"",
On the night I said, ""I love you so!"",
And in all my dreams it seems I'll go
Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo.

Oh, she said she's gonna wait
Down by the garden gate,
On the night I said, ""I love you so!"",
And in all my dreams it seems that I'll go
Where the moon swings low
On the Alamo.",On the Alamo
Art Van Damme,"Funny, you're a stranger who's come here
Come from another town
Funny, I'm a stranger myself here
Small world, isn't it?

Funny, you're a man who goes traveling
Rather than settling down
Funny, 'cause I'd love to go traveling
Small world, isn't it?

We have so much in common
It's a phenomenon
We could pool our resources
By joining forces from now on

Lucky, you're a man who likes children
That's an important sign
Lucky, I'm a woman with children
Small world, isn't it?
Funny, isn't it small and funny and fine?

We have so much in common
It's a phenomenon
We could pool our resources
By joining forces from now on

Lucky, you're a man who likes children
That's an important sign
Lucky, you're a woman with children
Small world, isn't it? Funny, isn't it
Isn't it small and funny and fine?

",Small World
Art Van Damme,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone
Art Van Damme,"Deep night, stars in the sky above
Moonlight, lighting our place of love
Night winds seem to have gone to rest
Two eyes, brightly with love are gleaming
Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, be mine alone

Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love

Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own
Vow that you'll love me always, and be mine alone

Deep night, whispering trees above
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer
Deep night, deep in the arms of love",Deep Night
Art Van Damme,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry 'Bout Me
Art Van Damme,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day",I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart
Art Van Damme,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Art Van Damme,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love
Art Van Damme,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Art Van Damme,"They're writing songs of love, but not for me.
A lucky star's above, but not for me.
With love to lead the way, I've seen more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee.
I was a fool to fall and get that way.
Heigh ho, alas, and also lackaday.
Although I can't dismiss, the memory of her kiss.
I guess she's not for me.

She's knocking on the door, but not for me.
She'll plan a two by four, but not for me.
I know that love's a game, I'm puzzled just the same.
Was I the moth or flame, I'm all at sea.
It all began so well, but what an end.
This is the time a feller needs a friend.
When every happy plot ends with the marriage knot
And there's no knot for me.",But Not for Me
Art Van Damme,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day
Art Van Damme,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town
How can you face them?

What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town, hm
 
It's the talk of the town.",It's the Talk of the Town
Art Van Damme,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me"
Art Van Damme,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Art Van Damme,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Art Van Damme,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Art Van Damme,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye

Art Van Damme,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Art Van Damme,"Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you
 
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
'Round wonderful you!","Just You, Just Me"
Art Van Damme,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Art Van Damme,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?

I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,

Art vs. Science,"In the beginning

And we were never told
That the fountain was a trophy for the kingdoms of old
A treasure a plaything a trojan in disguise
And in the last great war the secret burned up in the fire
While the peasants stood on mountain tops pretending to be kings
And the king holed up and never losed was doing idle things

It was a magic magic magic magic

But I just can't get there
I just sit in my room alone
And stare
All the things I do in a day
I just can't get there
I should use that time to pray
That time to care
All my life I have been trying to find
Something to keep me occupied
I guess I've known all along that it was you
I'm so sick and tired
Of running away
When I know that the good times go
They never stay
So sick and tired of dancing
The night away
I've forgotten what it's like to wake up
Early and greet the new day

All my life I have been trying to find
Something to keep me occupied
I guess I've known all along that it was you
All my life I have been trying to find
Someone that's always on my side
I believe that what you said is true
And God has shown me
That he won't turn away
No matter what I do
No matter what I say
It's just so hard to let go
And simply let him in
I've got to make the choice
Or be back where I've been

When you see a fire burning inside your minds eye
Breathe the meaning of the flames before you let them die
Let them burn you through until you know that you can fly
Twisting, turning, falling, burning
Roaring balls of fire
Eyes that see them have no need
Of guides to span the wire
Let the flames burn you right through
To low the burns through higher

Come and see
Come and buy

I can sell you the love
I can buy you the morning sun

You can buy sun from the morning
From suns to the set in the morning for tea
Pockets of love but nothing to buy
Crystals of beauty, the mountain, the sea
Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free
Come and see
Come and buy
Come and buy, buy my love

Sleeping sunsets sweat their beauty
Melting at your feet
Take your mind through sacred fire
Leaving you complete

Let the flames burn you so hard
There can be no re-treat
Floating, drooping, looping, turning
Roaring balls of fire
Light the pathway you must take
To drag you from the mire
Sooth the darkness from your feet
Burn down your funeral pyre

Come and see
Come and buy

I can sell you the love
I can sell you the morning sun

You can buy sun from the morning
From suns to the set in the morning for tea

Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free

Come and see
Come and buy
Buy my fire
Buy my fire

Eyes are glaring on your face
Watching you below
Take the sun that sweats at midnight
Burning you below

See the sun as it sweats with beauty
Burning through the fire
Feeding on your soul, so deep

Naked as we stand in the golden light

Where we are joined one and the same
And Nature's every face now

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Sweet Soul Music [Single/LP Version]

Strength to go on and on

The old car I drive runs funny
And I don't have much to offer
A sweet fine girl like you

But here's my heart, please take it
You see, I need your love
If I'm gonna make it

Come on, take me
Oh, darling, take me
Take me, take me as I am
Just as I am

I've tried and I've tried
He found someone to love

But I believe there's different
Strokes for different folks
And if you give your woman
What she wants when she wants it
How she wants it, where she wants it
And every time you think she wants it
You won't ever have to
Worry about anything

And that's why, darling, to you
I can stretch out my arms
Baby, I'm yours and yours alone

Arthur Fiedler,"Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon?
Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away

We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Arthur Fiedler,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura

Across the sands so I may keep

Resting in my arms
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms
You beside me here beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert Caravan
This is so exciting, you are so inviting
Resting in my arms

Take a sad song and make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day

And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest

They possess a gift or two
One of them is this

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

And we're dancing to the tango we loved when first we met
While the music plays, we recall the days
When our love was a tune that we couldn't soon forget

We used to know not long ago
So just hold me tight in your arms tonight",Blue Tango

That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

That you can't see

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Arthur Fiedler,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Arthur Foxall,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

And these few precious days I'll spend with you

Arthur Godfrey,"1955 in Boston down at St.Elizabeth's
My momma took me home
To the three decker
across from the playground
Where the townies slept
their wives were kept
In the Whiskey Point part of town

My old man was a fire-fighter
station house #4
In 69 our close friend Joe
drowned on a dare
Swimmin' across the reservoir
Everybody sit out on the 
schoolyard steps
Dealin' Jacks or Better
while the older cooler guys
Survived high school
went to war in Vietnam

I could have been a mystery writer
A singer in a rock-n-roll band
Floored you for a ten count
like a prize figher 
Take it deep in Fenway for a grand-slam
Oh no! I'm just a simple man

The Simple man finds a simple girl
They do the right thing
down at the V.F.W Hall
And everyone dances till midnight 
My Uncle Walter starts the first fight
When its all done and over
Down to St.Vincent's to confess
That Whiskey Point hangover
Good for ten Hail Mary's I guess
Stick to the game plan
Im just a simple man

All roads down Harvard Street
Lead over High Street Hill
Little Stevie takes your action
At Foley's Bar and Grill
He'd look you in the eye
Said always understand boy
You were born to carry on
You're just a simple man

I could have been a mystery writer
A singer in a rock-n-roll band
Floored you for a ten count
like a prize fighter
Take it deep in Fenway
for a grand slam
Oh No! Im just a simple man

Arthur H,"Mes illusions donnent sur la cour
Des horizons j'en ai pas lourd
Quand j'ai bossé toute la journée
Il m'reste plus pour rêver
Qu'les fleurs horribles de ma chambre

Mes illusions donnent sur la cour
J'ai mis une croix sur mes amours
Les p'tites pépés pour les toucher
Faut d'abord les allonger
Sinon c'est froid comme en décembre

Quand le soir venu j'm'en reviens du chantier
Après mille peines et le corps harrassé
J'ai le regard morne et les mains dégueulasses
D'quoi inciter les belles à faire la grimace
Bien sûr y'a les filles de joie sur le retour
Celles qui mâchent le chewing-gum pendant l'amour
Mais que trouverais-je dans leur coeur meurtri
Sinon qu'indifférence et mélancolie
Dans mes frusques couleur de muraille
Je joue les épouvantails

Mais nom de Dieu dans mon âme
Brûlait pourtant cette flamme
Où s'éclairaient mes amours
Et mes brèves fiançailles
Comme autant de feux de paille
Aujour'hui je fais mon chemin solitaire
Toutes mes ambitions se sont faites la paire
J'me suis laissé envahir par les orties
Par les ronces de cette chienne de vie

Mes illusions donnent sur la cour
Mais dans les troquets du faubourg
J'ai des ardoises de rêveries
Et le sens d'ironie
J'me laisse aller à la tendresse

J'oublie ma chambre au fond d'la cour
Le train de banlieue au petit jour
Et dans les vapeurs de l'alcool
J'vois mes châteaux espagnols
Mes haras et toutes mes duchesses

A moi les p'tites pépés les poupées jolies
Laissez venir à moi les petites souris
Je claque tout ce que je veux au baccara
Je tape sur le ventre des Maharajas
A moi les boîtes de nuit sud-américaines
Où l'on danse la tête vide et les mains pleines
A moi ces mignonnes au regard qui chavire
Qu'il faut agiter avant de s'en servir
Dans mes pieds-de-poule mes prince-de-galles
En douce j'me rince la dalle

Et nom de Dieu dans mon âme
V'là qu'j' ressens cette flamme
Où s'éclairaient mes amours
Et mes brèves fiançailles
Où se consumaient mes amours
Comme autant de feux de paille
Et quand les troquets ont éteint leurs néons
Qu'il n'reste plus un abreuvoir à l'horizon
Ainsi j'me laisse bercer par le calva
Et le dieu des ivrognes guide mes pas

	
My illusions overlook the courtyard
The horizons I have not heavy
When I worked all day
It m'reste more to dream
Qu'les flowers horrible my room

My illusions overlook the courtyard
I put a cross on my love
The p'tites pépés for touch
Should first lengthen
If it is cold as in December

When evening comes j'm'en back yard
After miles penalties and the body harrassé
I look bleak and hands dégueulasses
To encourage what beautiful to the grimace
Of course there's the girls on the return
Those who chew chewing gum for love
But what I find in their hearts bruised
Otherwise indifference and melancholy
In my frusques color wall
I play scarecrows

But the name of God in my soul
Brûlait yet this flame
Where s'éclairaient my love
And my brief engagement
Like so many fires straw
Tomorrow I make my way alone
All my ambitions have made this pair

J'me left'm overwhelmed by nettles
By the brambles of this bitch of living

My illusions overlook the courtyard
But in the suburb of troquets
I slates musings
And the sense of irony
J'me let the tenderness

I forget my room at the back of the court
The commuter train early days
And in the vapors of alcohol
J'vois my castles in Spain
My stud farm and all my duchesses

To me p'tites pépés pretty dolls
Let me come to the small mouse
I slap what I want to baccara
I slap on the belly of the Maharajas
To me nightclubs South American
Where we dance empty head and hands full
To me these cute under which capsized
The need to shake before use
In my feet-hen my prince-wales
In fresh j'me rinse slab

And the name of God in my soul
V'là qu'j 'feel this flame
Where s'éclairaient my love
And my brief engagement
Where is my love consumaient
Like so many fires straw
And when troquets have turned off their neon lights
That n'reste plus a trough on the horizon
Thus j'me leaves soothed by the calva
And the god of drunks guide my steps",L' Alcool

Que la vida va y viene y que no se detiene
Y, qué sé yo

Es corazón que no siente
O corazón que te miente amor
Pero, sabes que en lo más profundo de mi alma
Sigue aquel dolor por creer en ti
Qué fue de la ilusión y de lo bello que es vivir?
Para qué me curaste cuando estaba herido
Si hoy me dejas de nuevo con el corazón partió

¿Quién me va a entregar sus emociones?
¿Quién me va a pedir que nunca le abandone?

I felt so sure you'd be forever true
Now everything I counted on has crumbled under you
What now, what next, where to?

Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise

There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Arthur Lyman,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Him Was Easier

My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far
Carried your books from school
Playin' make believe you're married to me
You were fifth-grade, I was sixth when we came to be
Walkin' home ev'ry day over Bonnicut Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far
Headed for city lights, climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone made myself a name
Funny I seemed to find that no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss and the love I left behind

My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

You have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things
Your hearts can rise above

Once in a while he won't call
But it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet
And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your hearts will fly away

Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet
Then he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your hearts will fly away",It's All in the Game

Arthur Prysock,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You
Arthur Prysock,"I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!

above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!

You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

Arthur Prysock,"Back in childhood days, 
I can remember loving caresses showered on me.
Mother's eyes would gaze at me so tender, 
What was their meaning? Now I can see.

One bright and guiding light, 
That taught me wrong from right,
I found in my mother's eyes.
Those baby tales she told,
That road all paved in gold,
I found in my mother's eyes.

Just like a wandering sparrow,
One lonely soul.
I walked the straight and narrow,
To reach my goal.
God's gift sent from above,
A real unselfish love,
I found in my mother's eyes.

When I'm all alone, no one around me, 
I find the future dark as can be.
Sorrows I have known, always surround me, 
Then through the shadows, I always see.

One bright and guiding light, 
That taught me wrong from right,

Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

But you don't care how many tears I cry

I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

I told myself it's best that I forget you
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet, darling, I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts but I come running back for more

You'll know how much this heart of mine is breaking

Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife

So keep on looking for a blue bird, and list'ning for his song,

Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

Oggi see'ho in testa te, non so perché, domani chissà... perciò se ti va senti qua: i ricordi sono in fila e non mi mollano, ad uno ad uno salgono e mi tormentano. Sono in para, noia dura, dolce tortura, paura, come quella sera indeciso sul baciarti o meno, a parlare sul divano ore, la prima volta che assaggiavo il tuo sapore e già ne ero strettamente dipendente, shhh, cotto immediatamente. Ed era tipo ""che see'importa di domani?"" , stringimi le mani, ma i baci non risolvono i problemi, e ora non ci sei, domani è già arrivato, e brucia dentro sai, anche se ero preparato, e cadono parole come pioggia sulla strada, forse verrà domani il sole che le asciuga. 
Non so dove mi porterà questa marea, a largo o a riva non ne ho idea, se con qualcuno o se con te, non so domani neanche se sarò con me.

Se domani un pensiero di ciò che era ieri ti chiamerà (domani), tienilo con te perché dopo un giorno ancora forse se ne andrà. 
L'autostrada scivola veloce, sto mangiando quel gelato che ti piace, che ti fa ingrassare, tutte le menate quante volte le ho sentite, mi gira in testa ancora la tua voce, dolce musica, pure quando isterica, quasi psichedelica, senza dubbio erotica. E penso a quanto spesso son finito nel tuo letto a smaltire quel gelato, a restare impigliato nei tuoi capelli con il mio orecchino, a fare casino, per farmi stare zitto mi schiacciavi sulla bocca il tuo cuscino. Fumare sigarette, raccontarti barzellette fino al mattino, e mi divertivo quando mi correggevi se sbagliavo un congiuntivo. E come t'incazzavi quando t'abbracciavo e non m'ero tolto l'orologio e ti graffiavo, cento volte buonanotte e non dormivo, ti fissavo, poi mi muovevo e ti svegliavo: ...E lasciami dormire Ale ti prego..."", ed eri così bella che non ci credevo... 
Ma se domani un altro sole il tuo corpo riscalderà (domani), però domani un altro bacio dimmi che sapore avrà (domani). Se domani un pensiero di ciò che era ieri ti chiamerà (domani), tienilo con te perché dopo un giorno ancora forse se ne andrà. Forse domani un nuovo vento la mia passione soffierà via (domani), chissà domani quale fuoco ecciterà i peccati miei (domani), perché domani non ci sei, perché domani non see'è ""noi"", perché domani, see'è solo domani (domani), domani. 
E ancora cambio umore se ti penso, è un bel po' che non ti sento, ma non mi frega cosa stai facendo, dentro ho un'immagine di te che non parla, l'ho fatta per guardarla e non voglio rovinarla. E tengo solo il buono, come il tuo profumo, che mi ha sballato più di ogni cosa abbia bevuto o fumato, e mai nessuna foto renderà giustizia al tuo sorriso quando esplode all'improvviso sul tuo viso, lascia stare, domani avrò un altro posto dove andare, e un'altra rima da inventare, e neanche so dove saranno i miei pensieri, forse sarai solo una luce che illumina il mio ieri. Ma ancora rido se penso ai soprannomi che mi hai dato, li sapesse anche il mio amico, sarei rovinato!! Non credi?? Sono ancora in piedi, e lontano che non mi vedi, ma oggi tu sei la mia musa, baby, fata benedetta e strega maledetta insieme, faccio di te le rime mentre domani viene, la notte muore schiaccio l'acceleratore, oggi sarà un giorno senza te, domani pure.

vestita in verde con quel suo profumo buono 
stava con un mio amico che mi ha chiesto: me la tieni ! 
Devo andare all'aereoporto e lei non va d'accordo tanto con i cani.

Con la Maria ho fatto il the e l'ho baciata , prima 
l'ho conquistata con un tubo Perugina

m'era venuta una fame immane da pescecane, mi sono fatto 8 panini col salame 
ed un tegame di pasta al pesto, del resto dopo mangiato Maria si bacia con piu' gusto. 
Mi sono addormentato poi verso sera, mi sono svegliato e lei era finita 
finita chissa' dove, volevo tornare al parco ma piove-va e gia' il mio cuore si struggeva 
dopo da allora l'ho sempre cercata continuamente 
ma purtroppo ha dei guai con la legge e' latitante

come Caruso schiarisco la voce e intono un canto.

e per Maria restare e' un rischio, e' ricercata dai pulotti e dai caramba 
ha pure dei casini con la guardia di finanza. 
Ma comunque sia ho visto che qualche agente di polizia si fa le sue serate in compagnia di Maria e' una condanna della mia vita e' il dramma, 
perche' non potrà essere io Maria Giovanna e una capanna.

Sento il tuo sguardo su di noi che ci protegge e giudica, a volte a mente lucida sento la tua voce dentro 
certa musica con il tuo esempio in testa in questa città che mi snerva che vuole che mi perda tu l’avevi 
fatta tua serva. Tutti i fratelli che hanno oltrepassato la linea ora ti stanno accanto, la nostra strada 
continua fino al punto d’incontro, oltre la soglia del vivere dove la preghiera non serve saremo ancora 
insieme a ridere, dove la parola chiave è condividere, ma come e quando non saremo noi a decidere, 
intanto qui si balla e a volte è bello e sciallo a volte stare a tempo è un macello allora mi ribello e 
martello impegnandomi al massimo finché mi riesce, come mi insegnavi dalle rime si nasce, bella 
SAB;

E ci vedremo di là, so che un di là ci sarà, e so che di fisso si starà meglio che qua, non me l’ha detto il 
prete, che mi guardo attorno ci deve essere un paradiso per chi vive un inferno la giorno, se non è così 
ditemi il senso di ‘sto viaggio meteore di passaggio, no, la risposta sta nel ricordo del tuo abbraccio, 
la certezza che rivedrò il mio amico, un istinto antico mi fa sentire la tua mano guidarmi quando sono 
smarrito, aiutarmi a trovare le armi per ogni nuovo nemico, invito a indicarmi chi mi ama ogni giorno in 
cui mi sento tradito, ci sarà il castigo per i codardi che ci han portato via un guerriero e sarò severo, 
zero leggero quando t’alzerai dal trono dipinto su quel muro e giuro che quando arriverà quel giorno 
l’aquila volerà in testa per il tuo ritorno avrai i tuoi fratelli pronti intorno quando sguainerai la spada e 
saremo anche noi dall’altra parte della strada;

Articolo 31,"O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè io devo mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto e non così. 
Sono in preda a una psicosi, rischio una nevrosi. Mami, non posso continuare questo andazzo da fuky gigolò, ogni giorno sul mio palco recitare lo stesso show di pupe a gogò, cristallo e Pinot, dolce vita, però spesso in stile Peppino e Totò. Le mie ex dicono che sono un bastardo bugiardo, ma io gioco d'azzardo la mia vita è un casinò. Ogni sera nel night di King Mauri, con i ragazzi della banda, cospirando manco si trattasse di una rapa in banca, per cacciar la tipa da portare in branda, seppur la compagnia di pupe non ci manca, trattasi di avventuriere straniere, amori che si rivelano chimere, le puoi vedere sparire alla luce del mattino come un sogno. Adesso basta, ora so di chi ho bisogno. 
O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè io devo mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, prima o poi io devo metterla 'sta testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata. Magari una che mi contraddica qualsiasi cosa dica, che non mi faccia uscire con gli amici e poi mi porti al cinema io, lei e una sua amica. Che mi ripeta che sono disordinato, che mi chieda se ho bevuto, che quando sono affamato sia a dieta, che non mi creda se sono sincero e se mente lei pretende che me la beva. Che mi telefona mentre sto lavorando, e se le dico che al momento sono occupato: "" Ti richiamo"", quando la chiamo dice che non l'amo e fa l'offesa. Che abbia la pretesa che ogni giorno io le faccia una sorpresa. Si, mi ci vuole un pò di disciplina che mi obblighi a svegliarmi presto la mattina, che mi faccia stare un'ora a esaminare una vetrina, che quando danno un filmone in TV inviti gente a cena, che mi svegli per chiedermi se sto dormendo, che tenti di cambiarmi e poi mi accusi di stare cambiando. 
O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè io devo mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè io devo mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, una che mi faccia vivere nel modo giusto. Ma in fondo la mia vita non è poi malaccio, con i casini che faccio, i guai in cui mi caccio. So che non è serio cambiare ogni sera, ma preferisco un'overdose di libertà che una dose di galera. Cattivo coi nemici e con le bimbe un agnellino, ho più pupe io del gangster di Chicago; perfino al bar del Giambellino dicevan che ero un mago, mi chiamavan drago ma aspetta che ti spiego, forse la fidanzata non mi serve come prima ti dicevo. Continuerò a fare zig-zag fra soubrette e vedette e tete a tete con ballerine di tip-tap, ad essere infantile, ma con stile, fidanzare me è un'ingiustizia per la popolazione femminile, quindi una alla volta, avanti see'è posto, questo è il modo che mi da più gusto, quindi è quello giusto. 
O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, così le faccio mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè sto già vivendo in un modo giusto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, nessuno mi fa mettere la testa a posto. O mamma, mi ci vuol la fidanzata, perchè per uno come me questo è il modo giusto.

Io sono il frutto di una strana mutazione che sconvolge a ritmo la composizione di ogni mio gene. 
Sopra la cassa passa ogni pulsazione, sul campione si edifica il mio DNA mattone per mattone, affina 
la mia tecnica sparando la mia anima attraverso merda e poesia, è questione di bioritmica a rendermi 
diverso immerso nella disciplina che ho studiato, imparato e adesso fatto mia, sono tornato, rinato, 
uguale e cambiato, angelo beato e demonio reincarnato, artista arrivato e buffone alcolizzato, bagnato 
di un successo meritato, rubato in quanto fortunato, riuscito fallito, la folla mi resuscita come in un antico

see'è la voglia e see'è che see'è la storia e see'è che, che che se nevica sono giorni di fuoco e non solo di 
gloria, io rappresento per l'infame quello che per un computer rappresenta un virus, il microfono 
rappresenta per me quello che la coperta rappresenta per Linus, il risultato rappresenta ciò che per un 
mago rappresenta un ocus focus, e tutto è ben studiato e ben documentato come un articolo su focus, 
quindi passa a me, diffida dalle imitazioni, le ali sulle scene e mani strette sui coglioni, dove trovi i 
campioni sukeroni infamoni, io so solo che un purosangue non fa gare coi pony, senza rivali in quanto 
non è una sfida, ma è la vita che decide quanto vali e come peli see'ho più stili che Jack vinili, che

qua un italiano per quanto in tecnica capace di tradurre la capacità dello statunitense rapper sarà 
sempre un blues contro un poker, chi se ne frega si essere Zucchero se see'è Jajjo Cocker, DJ Jad 
attacca il cavo, manda il ritmo di gusto lo schiavo, scatta il funk pure se il senso è Lady Patty Bravo,

Siii sono qui l'ultima stella sola, ora vieni su da me con nuovi sogni che crederemo veri insieme, oltre le mediocrità, oltre le mezze verità, sopra nuvole come prigioni sulla vostra libertà, pregando di credere a quanto grande puo' essere io resto qui finchè quando qualcuno crede in me. 
Ci vede piccole creature strambe, qui si inventa l'areoplano poi lo si usa per gettare bombe però di noi conosce anche la parte migliore ma so che poi non riese a trovare come fare a curare chi rinuncia hai sogni con la scusa di diventare gradi ma con l'accusa di adorare I bimbi contanti ignorando I pianti dietro voci lontane di una stella che vive di sogni da sempre più fame.

Articolo 31,"Se hai comprato questo disco vuol dire che hai problemi 
E se lo tieni vuol dire che bevi rubi e bestemmi 
Visto che il cantante non raccoglie premi 
E ha i reni pieni di veleni come bassi di Miami 
Guarda che qui sali su treni sprovvisti di freni 
E rischi che sti dischi ti portino fischi di amici e colleghi 
Qui zero santoni o soluzioni cè poca cultura 
Ma l’istinto separa i cattivi dai buoni 
I rumori dai suoni le eccezioni dall’assioma 
Dalle definizioni fuori la divisa non mi dona 
Ne il senso del pudore dello stato o del comune 
Neanche il nome che ci danno sulla rubrica di costume

E non ci ammazzerete mai (ai-ai-ai-ai)

Scarafaggi coi tatuaggi

In the mix di roba mista 
L’alternativissima rivista resta qualunquista 
È che se ne infischia di destra o sinistra 
E mischia a mo di minestra una miscela mai vista 
Al giornalista che intervista rispondo alle domande 
Tanto questa musica leggera è pesante come un elefante 
Non ho mezza misura o stai vicino o stai distante 
Se la fischi scende dal palco e ti spezza le gambe 
Lasciatemi cantare sono italiano 
Sul terreno tra il Mediterraneo ed il Tirreno 
Con il suono alieno che fa 
A cazzotti con l’orchestra di Demo non va 
Da Pavarotti e nemmeno a San Remo 
Sotto influenze negative di cannabis attive 
Hey mamma, qui ci sono canzoni nocive 
Generazioni recidive, registrazioni proibite 
Mentre l’alcool e le sigarette legalmente uccide 
Veleno quotidiano ma facciamo finta che non fosse 
E ci chiediamo perché se accendiamo una jolla e fumiamo 
Un ministro ha la tosse…. 

RIT. 

Non te lo potevi aspettare potesse tornate 
Quella canzone popolare stava per affogare 
E invece torna tipo zombie costruisce ponti 
Se ti interessa definirla meglio che ascolti 
Qui non ci sono fessi solo brutti ceffi tutti messi 
A fare casse a pezzi come le tasse e i prezzi 
È musica dalla metodica caotica qui non si medita 
Io c’ho la palla fuori come edika 
Mutazione genetica della tradizione melodica 
Non è colonica ne americofonica chiamala comica 
Ironica ma se suona cronica nella scatola cranica 
È un asso nella manica e carica la forza delle braccia 
Se quest’Italia vale una medaglia siamo l’altra faccia 
Fegato stomaco cuore e istinto gomito a gomito 
Col rumore che vomito ora dimmi che ha vinto

L’acqua per strada l’inchiostro sul foglio lo stesso colore 
Guardando un quaderno di rime del ‘93 
C’era una foto di un pezzo s’un treno con davanti io e te 
E allora tanti perché dimenticati sono tornati amplificati 
E più complicati insistono su come e quando ci siamo lasciati 
Su perché oggi sento il blues dopo gli anni passati 
Giro la televisione corrida di idee banali 
L’amico mi propone movida per locali ho scarica la pila da 
Tempo e non ha senso divagare penso a come mi facevi 
Stare spengo il cellulare… 

Sarà la pioggia la notte che 
Saranno solo rimorsi fumo e caffè 
E sarà ancora buoi la luna non cè 
Cara mia ex la luna non ce 

E guarda come un uomo matura senza premura 
Perde la misura poi giura scusa che valgono spazzatura 
Prende a pugni porte sveglia il vicinato 
Fa a botte con che era appena sgarbato 
La notte ti chiama ubriaco 
Ci vuoi fare il progetto di una vita 
Lui si fa trovare a letto con una tua amica 
Pensa solo a se stesso divide l’amore dal sesso 
Ha belle parole ma mantenere ciò che ha promesso 
Non gli è mai successo troppo egoista per un compromesso 
Così ero messo e adesso confesso ascoltando il tuo pezzo 
Preferito tra i miei dei miei vecchi dischi 
Bevo una birra che vorrei fosse whiskey 
Ho una cicatrice nel cuore con sopra il tuo nome 
Ma voglio che tu sia felice anni luce da questa canzone 
E dal male che ho fatto lui saprà curarti 
Mentre conto i miei errori realizzati tardi…

La luna si dice muove marea e cuore umano 
Invece non ne ho idea vivo a Milano il mare è lontano 
Quando uscivamo era diverso sempre luci intense 
Ora vedo opache insegne e pioggia di novembre 
…Mi manche guapa manca ogni litigata 
Manca il sapore di tornare e ritrovarti a casa 
L’odore di una maglietta prestata 
La tua voce che mi consola fare la pace in una 
Piazzola dell’autostrada 
E quante cose non dette micro vendette 
Appendi la mia foto al muro e gioca a freccette 
Sarà che infine maturo col delay 
Che le regine non scelgono i plebei 
Sarà che ti vorrei…

Quando scrive o legge non è mai roba di scuola

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Night winds breath her sighs here's the Japanese

Just as silent as we came we'll leave the land of the painted fan

He will take every sorrow of the day that is through
And he'll give you tomorrow just to start a life anew

Artie Shaw,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

Artie Shaw,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Artie Shaw,"They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied ""something here inside cannot be denied""
They said ""someday you'll find all who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say ""when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes""

I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

Bésame tu a mí
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó

Qui mi locura te dió
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Why la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir why amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón

And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.

Artie Shaw,"I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair. 
 The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air. 
 The walls of my room fade away in the blue, 
 And I'm deep in a dream of you. 
 The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend; 
 You come to my arms, may this bliss never end, 
 For we love anew just as we used to do 
 When I'm deep in a dream of you. 
 Then from the ceiling 
 Sweet music comes stealing; 
 We glide through a lover?s refrain.

 That I'm soon revealing 
 My love for you over again.

Artie Shaw,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Artie Shaw,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Artie Shaw,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know

In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one

Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine

You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Artie Shaw,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street

Here we are, bidding the stardust adieu

Yet, my lovely one, strange as it seems 
 
I'm afraid to dream
Afraid that you may not be there
Afraid to dream without you it would seem so bare
With open arms I call to you, I want you, dear
Just as I reach for you why do you disappear?

I'll see you there with someone new
Afraid to find another one caressing you
Although you promised me that this could never be
It's the thought of losing you that makes me so

Artie Shaw,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin

When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away

Artie Shaw,"It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl you better try to have fun no matter what you do
but he's a fool
'Cause nothing compares 2 you

All the flowers that you planted mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares to you",Traffic Jam

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Dreaming of you I composed a tune,
So will you listen to it, dear?

Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you

Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

To be sure when day is done
That the hour is coming when you'll be kissed

c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down (4X)

Verse One: El Da Sensai

c'mon and get down with that Artifacts sound
Where kids get wreck and, the beat's bound to pound
We're strollin through the industry be	, see we gotta be
the next shit that kicks, cause brothers ain't got it
In this rap shit, ain't no time for the dilly-dally
pally throw a match in the Gasoline Alley
Blew up mad spots, kids were jealous for the props
See the shit never stops Hobbes, just lookin for my dillz-knot
Styles we make, never fake, broke breaks in every crate
Old freestyles and dirty ass copied-over tapes
Notified that, the Artifacts never slack
While crews is on stage wack, we just play the back
Now, the flip tripper ripper slits ya wit da mixture
All crews, who never paid dues, watch it 'fore I get ya
Cause nowadays, it's da ways, of the underground
but they're wack now, so c'mon wit da git down

Chorus

Verse Two: Tame One

You know the stacks, if not, then ask some niggaz who heard of me
The half on the Artifacts of Jersey
Cause brothers be buggin not givin love to the nuccas
Sayin fuck us, cause we be shinin brighter than the suckers
Shootin me prison nobody listens to your dissin
Cause yo my shit's legit and as a lyricist I'm hittin
the high note, so why don't, I smile when I take pictures
Cause now that I rock I got more niggaz on my jock than bitches
I just want to do my jams with fams and slam into some hypeness
But biters and backstabbin rappers don't even like us
But props due, peep The Source RapPages and the Billboard
And read about the tours while you be flappin your jaws
I freak techniques, cause talk is cheaper than beepers from Broad Street
Punks talk junk, Tame and the Sensai leave em all beat
So peep how deep my technique freaks and how my shit sounds
c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

Chorus

Verse Three: MC El, Tame One

Hold up, you rap sucker duck, buck, the track's rough enough
to prove a point, that the niggaz is the joint
Magazines where we're seen, now pop the tape in your deck
I got the Heavy Ammunition 'cause I'm Flexi Wit Da Tech
Niggaz, can't believe the Artifacts achieve
Got, tricks up my sleeve so bow down on your knees
Yo, we ain't got the same lame, ordinary plain game
Put to shame any crew who wants to feel the flame
So bring submission to the rap recognition
My right hand is itchin from the shit that I'm scriptin
So pass the baton, to the next runner up, Tame
I give a pound so, c'mon wit da git down

Aiyyo, word to my grandma's tampons, I drop bombs, but since
our demo tracks had gaps some said my fat raps was half-assed
Watchin others rock and clock we shocked em like a robot
with our props, so now the Notty Head Niggaz got more knots yo
My pockets are lumpy chump, my drunk style is trunky dunk
My disc in crisp, put funk in funk like Humpty Hump
'cause I'm comin from the underground I'm down wit da git down
MC's who used to diss us, get pissed cause they ain't shit now
The Artifacts, represent on every stage we step on
The days of gettin slept, are dead because we keep on
peepin these weak MC's, who cheese with their bologny
Cause they're phony as fuck, and couldn't pull shit off a tow truck
So yo bro, now you know my flow so go and sit down
or c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

In comes the ones from Jeruzalum slums
Knockin bums out for clout, Jersey rules without a doubt
On the real, keep it kinda fat for the brothers
from the Wrongside of Da Tracks, and it goes like that
Since the beginnin of time, the Artifacts kick rhymes
straight tape after demo tape in eighty-eight
It's so dynamite, shit's outta sight
Snatch up a G and demonstrate for the night
Sip on the brew, me and you can do the do
and you know this, flow with this, Polo, you know kid
Tame, what's the status on the blunt meter homey?
(Yeah I got three dimes, six Phillies, and some Olde E)
Yeah G you know the program, it's so damn ridiculous
Kickin this mix for all the niggaz and the tricks

and word to life he rhyme with spite and so dynamite

Yo this flow goes to all the hoes I ever fucked with
Kids I smoked blunts with, and my ex-girl that sucks dick
Niggaz takin shorts in weed spots because they know me
And to my moms, because she makes good cheese and macaroni
And to the stores that'll sell three Phillies for a dollar
To Afrika Bambaata for makin me a rap scholar
And MC El for rhymin with this notty headed lunatic
You always knew we had the crew that had the mad drama kid
peep it, all my peeps from 12 Block to Broad Street
And backstreets in Jersey where the niggaz first heard me
It took a long time comin with more cuts than Jason
Since the days I had a fade and used to rock in Redman's basement
I do +Poetic Justice+, like Janet played the role
And now I'm makin suckers swoll with the dynamite soul

""Dynamite soul!"" (8X)

[El]	Remember them joints, we used to rock at the spot?
[T1]	When we stepped on stage with fat gear and it was mad hot?
[El]	Kids in competition was scared at the sight
[T1]	Of these mad motherfuckers who rock the mic RIGHT
[El]	Then we was ""That's Them"", gettin all the action
[T1]	Fuckin niggaz bitches and just leavin them in traction
[El]	Ask who the hell was them niggaz that's rippin it?
[T1]	You better get hip, cause Artifacts got the shit
[El]	For about four years, people said we couldn't hack it
	but the track's got ?, and rhymes got the knack
	See, we'll never fall we got support from the fam
	Jam after jam, here we are but there we stand
	It took mad time, but here we is, in the music business
	Press record when you hear me on KISS
	Brothers talk shit, but yo, who really cares?
	Tame's who all I need 'cause, the brother's right there
	And if you're swoll, say it's all in control
	The Artifacts, we got, the dynamite soul

Ya gotta excuse me, I was just scheamin on a cutie
and I knew it was my duty cause the honey had a booty
I up jumped the boogie to the boogie the beat
Cause I'm a hellafied nigga, you can call me T.D.
The black Lil' Raskal, with loot like Waldo
I make Oprah rhyme by throwin chairs at Geraldo
Rivera, I joke around like, Hanna Barbera
But mirror mirror, Tame is a terror
My hair got the knots, my name got the props
I'm the coach of a rap note cause I call the shots
Tamedy Tamedy, I'm showin the mad me
Damn style flam and T why?  We ain't family
Keep that real, I smoke buddha and pack steel
Check the rap deck, cause this is the last deal
Good God, baby pah, give it to me check it
BRARABRARABBAHHH bust it, BRARAHRABAHABA wreck it

[El Da Sensai]
Comin back, to cap, two with the fat rapture
Intact to Tic-Tac, my style you can't catch-a
Why?  Let's see, I'm not ordinary
Kind of impossible, unstoppable, brothers pop a lot of bull..
..skip to my loo, I'm never ever to do
hot tamale oh golly I'm wicked with the folly
All types of sneakers fo' the freaker of the speaker
Bass for the bottoms and the highs for the tweeters
Sample from The Meters, check it how I speak the
words pound for pound, fuck ten ounces and the liters
I won't sniff Blow, even if you said his name was Kurtis
My style can go through changes, from Latin down to Turkish
So keep slippin cause that ass I'll be kickin

Boom Skwad in the house

I lower da boom when I do the cypher dance
With naps and saggy pants as I romance the plants
I take puffs on stuff, rough enough to give a buzz
To my 'cause, even though he don't touch the stuff
See this blunt in my front, some say might stink
But yo the skunk helps me think
I'm a boom smoker joker with the knack because I'm gifted
Some say misfit, but fuck it let's get lifted
I get a box of 50, get nifty with a spliff G
And tick tackle new jacks who tried to diss me
I walk through the rain for dimes at the sess spot
Not hot with cops, cause I'd hate to get popped
I'm a terror to a trey bag, son you'll soon see
But I gots to get, higher, lower the boom G

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Ahh, I just catch the fumes
I consume, bend the room, with the ? tune
Spark another L for the cypher
Sit back and light the, five inch adventure that's alrighta
Lower the boom, for the sess bags thicker
One's a flight to Phillie, while the other one's the liquor
Off to the weed spot, the bags better be fat
Or else you catch the speed knot, and holmes you don't need that
Spark the indo or the L, sniff the weed
But I never get splits mista cause Tame's been hip ta
The baby of the blunts, so I'm down to catch the contact
Here's the rap chat, it's a fact that I react
Smooth from the boom consumed a zoom zoom a zoomin
MC El the leaner cleaner thoughts dials tune-in
Into, the matter roll the blunt bunt batter
Pass the shit quick, don't flip, with the chit chatter
I never puckered once, my lungs got jammed
My man said it wouldn't kill, but I choke, god damn
The sess starts to cloud the room
The Artifacts, commences ta, lower the boom

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Ohh I hope I live to see the day they make it legal
To all the people can't see what I'm smokin ain't evil
Stop callin me a pusher cause I take pulls and take tokes
Cut snakes, cut breaks, and I hate fake folks
So pass the cheeba senorita cause I need a
Fat fuckin Phillie just before I funk a freaker
Creatin from the milk crate with hooks and riffs
I can lift em, and shift em makin jams like this
With the blunt in my left hand and the Phillie in my pocket
MC El, at my right, with the mic so I can rock it
Sess makes my eyes red, but shades only cost three bills
In Hooterville, so I'm chill
See the bigger the blunt, is how I feel about my indo
Because my moms would never throw my shit out the window
I puff herb til noon, chill and watch cartoons
Yes once again, I lowered the boom

Are you weeded?  Nope see, I'm doper for the session
Catchin wreck, check the tec, cause I'm sober for the sketch
If I'm caught smokin blunts, I catch a bad one from my clan see
I'm higher than a messiah so you know I'm handy dandy
Legalize it holmes cause the zone's gettin bigger
From the whites, to the Ricans, cause they learned it from the niggaz
So who's the first to kick it real, for the, cypher
Eight Phillies so you know you gots to pass the other lighter
Pass the incense gents, it smells out in the hall
My groupies think I'm stunnin cause I'm six feet tall
No need for the sheepa cheeba cleaner than, Beaver Cleaver
Though I'm down to pitch, with my skit like Tom Seaver
Either, or my jaw speak of true features
I must be, the freaker of this doper class teacher
So pass the Visine, so you can keep your eyes clean
Look to Looney Tunes, we lowered, the boom

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Lower da boom.
Spark that blunt
Lower da boom, ya got to lower da boom.
Spark that blunt, represent, don't front.

Artifacts, check around my fuckin BLOCK, I X-Men like Cyclops

But as is, my ad-libs, are more wicked than bad kids
Ask Biz if Tame leaves marks like a shit skid

[El Da Sensai]
It's the Mister, on a mission mixer of the rougher
Mix the snuff that get you up ? but no style is tougher
I dismiss crews, I bruise, snooze ya losin
Groovin provin I can do in men who went out smoother
Artifact chart, my rap gat starts to battle
Tracks be fat so who dat?  Nigga I be through black

I get biz on bitches, puff izz with my cousins
Tame shit so wild, honies roll they eyes like Teddy Ruxpin
I hit mad skins, then roll up bills on the reals
My skills mad ill, but chill kid, everything's real
from naps up top, down to the wrinkles in my Reeboks
I'm up late like Leno playin demos from my toolbox
My crew rocks, two blocks away from the buddha spot
I'm out but don't get it fucked up, cause I wsnt you to rock

[El Da Sensai]
I come from the slums of New Jeruz I do bums
who can't adapt no haps son, you know I close on caption
You know this, boss niggaz like Lex to Mr. Otis
You can't hold this BITCH I'm swift like a lotus

Well it's the wiseguy, who never did a driveby
but I fly zones, and shine like chrome, on 7:35
I, play my Hi-Fi, volume up sky high
Talkin buddha thai, don't bother tryin to fascinate my eye
I got 20/20 like Baba Wawa on a Friday
Buy my tape, so I can put a Cruiser in my driveway
Say hi Tame, pass the dutch so I can take a puff
of Born Cypher Cypher Master, I never get enough
No curls, no braids, peasy heads still get paid
Smokin sassy-frassy, that grows free, in the Everglades
and get lit, trip up on the phone and talk some sex shit
But that's some next shit, yo peace I'm out to the exit

It's the funky Mister Ripper split your ass
Quick-fast, you never outlast the outcast
I'm stompin weak-ass niggaz, so ready let's go
I gas up a skit, I got the snaps on the petrol
I'm never fake I break the funk breaks I'm breakin
MC El create the styles that brothers ain't makin
To go past the end I run you over like a semi
Remember I be the guy, who's fuckin up your shit I,
be the one to call myself def in any program
Scan my battleplan before I step into a jam
I cross the major diction when fixed I'm a rap magician

What goes on?
What goes on baby what goes on? (7X)

[El Da Sensai]
What goes on girl, you riff and you riff about
Brothers callin you a bitch, but tell me would you switch
Into shame, how one dame, can make a name for all
I guess it's like that when all the chips fall
It's critical stereotypical how they diss you
It ain't you that chill cause you know your status is true
Girls be trickin, on a mission listen what's it for?
All you get is people dissin callin you a whore
But I guess you don't stress it cause you just keep goin
Hoein and hoein thinkin you're sinkin kids for dough and
At the same time you whine how we call you this
Or that, it beez that way, givin me no play
Kickin facts and all that, diss em about the schisms
Who riff, when brothers call em hoe or a bitch
And if you think we're wrong, give me a gong, word is bond
And all I gotta ask is what goes on?

[Artifacts]
What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

[Tame One]
I call em as I see em
Steamin on the scheamin as I kick this
Fitness with the quickness bout the gutter snipe type bitches
Flippin like switches and don't be knowin niggaz pedigree
You better be ready, I like +Sleepin With the Enemy+
My remedy is any G, fuck em and flee
I shoot the breeze at the skeeze, just because +The P is Free+
Don't try to play me baby yo, you must be crazy
Tryin to fade me with no clippers when I know you got some other niggaz
Just keep it real, word is bond we'll get along fine
I know that you're on mine, I peeped it for a long time
High saditty bitties, that's out for the price tag
? get bagged, and be the victim of a right jab
So if you walk like a bitch, talk like a bitch, it's on
But what goes on?

What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

[El Da Sensai]
You in a relationship? Aight, well cool, we can do this
We start with a kiss and go right down the list
Analyze this, check it how we always spend time
Hittin all spots, bend it up every time
I give you what you want, even more if you ask
Just a small task, any spell you cast
But on the down low, you're hittin that bro, doin the same thing
Skeezin, but what's the reason for the treason?
That's why you're left all alone and you say we're wrong
Sing the song along, tell me what goes on?

[Girl]
This shit here, this is bullshit (hold up hold up hold up)
This is notty for a girl got gats too (I'm sayin)
All you hear now is bitch this bitch that

What the fuck is goin on? (the fuck you want from me? yo)

[Tame One]
Don't catch offense when the gents call you names
If you ain't one, don't sweat it hon, it's just one of them thangs
In my slang, unless you catch a fit from hearin bitch
If the shoe fits, then wear it, I'm not dissin for the ?, get it
Not every girl's a bitch, yeah that's true
Like my Ma Dukes, but oh yes, the rest I seem to talk to
Are shady and not really the ladies they claim to be
It's crazy, everywhere I go, it seems the same to me
That's up until I'm gone
But on the way home I'm still thinkin, what goes on?

What goes on baby what goes on? (8X)



",What Goes On
Artifacts,"[El Da Sensai]
I calculate that eighty-five was the year
I first grabbed the pen, daydreamin of the cheers
Ahead from rockin shows, no Girbauds that sag
The windbreaker suits and backspins that was mad
I stress progress roll joints at my rest
til the ill wee hours, and I knew it was the best
I hit mad spots, many crews got dropped
While I was gettin props niggaz was dealin on the block
Stayin in crib on the weekends was Marley Marl
was freakin the cuts Mr. Magic was speakin
That's how I got my first taste, makin tapes
til the rhyme skill was great and my style would escalate
Practice made my perfect tactics
Now my dap gets clap, cause I'm the rap snap fanatic
But now in nine-trey I got the T-Ray track
And my trunks, my roots are growin styles from whayback

..

[Tame One]
I flash back to fat Kangol hats, with plastic
Back when steppin on kicks in eighty-six got your ass kicked
Bombers and sheepskins, were common when I first started rhymin
Still I found time to go bombin
Me and my pals rocked Cazals with no glass
Dark flavored Clarks, Lee Denims off the ass
Back when Mr. Magic had it goin all the way on
the beat with BDP, added flavor like a crayon
Indeed MC's would represent with the skills
But now in ninety-three a lot of them can get the dillz
It seems like a little sumthin missin in the mix
But now I got a deal, so it's up to me to fix
When niggaz put me up on, with funky raps to cut on
Word is BOND, if I hear another wack rap song
I might snap and it's an actual fact
that I'ma kick it like that, cause this is strictly bout the whayback

..

[El Da Sensai]
Aww man damn, whayback, things was kinda fat
Had the Godfather knot, a Starter hat, things are kinda wack
now, packed up, my cardboard and stepped away
I didn't have a choice, the culture was slayed
B.D. had died, and things were dissapearin
The West coast was here and all these wack beats appearin
DJ's were breakin down record store doors
to get the Biz Dance and the Chante Moore's
Peace to Buck Four, Rocksteady on the floor
New York and Dynamic crews plus many more
Remember the time when you didn't pack a nine
Niggaz just came to hear some, funky ass rhymes
But all of that's over, cause brothers want to act up
No clubs to go to, they'll just pack rap up
That's how the media wants it to stop
So peep the verse and last showin of Graffiti Rock
So check it, the brothers want to wreck it
To get what's expected, cause hip-hop, should be respect
Gotta get it back, to get it on track
Artifacts kickin styles illy on the whayback

[Tame One]
Like back when my Timberlands were only size sixes
I used to take pictures shootin spitballs at bitches
Cross New Jersey Transit just to see a rapper kick it
But now I ain't with it, cause niggaz just ain't worth the ticket
Shit man, I remember jams that were slammin
Gettin me and my man in, was harder than backgammon
DJ's would scratch back to back from boom baps
And rappers with real raps, could drop shit real fat
But now kid, as I recollect, rappers out who caught wreck 
respected, just got stuck up in my tape deck
Real deal hip-hop, when Biz used to flip-flop
His fat ass, on stage'd do a dance, in busted Reeboks
Niggaz musta forgot, when real rhymes was hot
Cause now if you ain't gold, you ain't got no props
But fuck that, I'm above that, I don't play that
The Artifacts staff drops math about the whayback

Artifacts,"My off the hook look, leaves my competitors shook
No matter what groups you book, I still jam like Sam Cooke
Took a whole click out, and had the soundman flippin
kickin wicked freestyle to shit on niggaz with the writtens

Check my computer type graphics, niggaz get they ass kicked
quick if they try to flip like ashes, I'm
never passive, as is, yo you see the flow yo what happened
Check out them niggaz rappin

The clap of the crowd be showin me love like Cupid
Loop it back, shit slams like I dished off to Shaq
My crew stay strapped with battle raps on cap
We ready to clap on chaps who make up half you sucker rap acts

I'm intact with facts, MC's can't compete with these treats
And Shawn J P. with the beats, unleash
talents, balance, styles extra-ordinary
with the vocabulary, no other buries

We know schematics on rapper's theatrics
Only a few can freak status, Artifacts techniques
can freak from here to Dalls, leavin you to clean up
like Alice, shit's thick like smoke from out the chalice
The weak we em-barr-ass, showin no pity on your city
We either play you live or have you taped in like MIDI (who)
The Brick City Committee comin through a nigga soundset
This round's for all our niggaz that didn't get down yet

        Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
        From off the back of the bus, the 31 Bumrush

        tell the soundman, don't touch nothin but the EQ

Deafenin, lethal weapon steppin with the props
Seekin through your sale racks and peepin all mall cops
In to win, tall like, Paul Bunyan, the bass line's drummin
Meanin that the Notty Headed Nigguz comin

Lights, camera!  Act like you want to bring the dra-ma
I make it hotter than all of Atlanta, ready to act up
My Hooterville upbringin is swingin upon ya son
Gunnin for your under the name of Tame One

Yo, eyes focused, lips ready to toke it
You'll choke on my skit, your dilemma is to quit
flip scripts, who's the winner takin out all beginners
in an instant, my style's polished and stain resistant

The E&J sipper blunt ripper nigga flips your bitch ass
With better effects, we go to war like George Lu-cas
Toucan Sam and we be the Mister Man simply put
Your twelve inch could barely make a foot
We got bombs, my momma told me no when I was younger
but I told her, ""I don't cry on no shoulders I'm a soldier""
Let me show ya, how we can rock a crowd like Ayatollah
Check the folder (here we go check it out right now)

Now you got the scoop, check the Guess troop low
On the chest, niggaz still use the word fresh blessed
You see the structure, builder, constructer
Bust a, nother with the skills that I muster
Up touche you check the rhyme forte

Kick a rap out til I black out, check out when I wreck out
Throwin' backs out, laughin' out loud when niggaz crap out
Me I want more G's than the LAPD
From when I wrote my first rhyme in eighty-three
With each speech released I reach mad blocks
Analyzin' more spots than Matlock
Now I got this rappin' shit on padlock
You only half-rock, my shit returns like resurrections
In religion, was fuckin' with the fact we only bullshittin'

One two, yo
Start takin' notes, statin all quotes

Who's this?  Kickin in your Benz why box crisp

As long as the Boom Skwad is hearing me clear
There ain't another rapper here that's gonna G this year (yeah)

Makin' you wake up early, tell your girlie turn my tape up
Wait up, let me lace up the place like boots
Make loot, and Proceed to rock like Roots
I tear the roof off, and when I fuck don't take my boots off
I shoot from the lip, and make your nose glow like Rudolph
You soft, so let me hit you off with all the hardness
Artifacts shit, we got the hard shit regardless

Many ask how I be makin' up my shit
Like the format and how it don't match or fit
I just, dig into the X-Files of styles
Hittin' while you're missin' I'll prove that the child
Be on the different angles strangle those who want to tangle
With the, Flexi With the Technique ripper
El the, Sensai what the men say in the back?
Thinkin' that we can't battle rap in combat
Cease that, realize that the Facts don't mess
Around when we bless sounds down for any test

Battle the top man, and shock fans like I'ma rock band

Tracy Chap raps I laugh at, half-assed rappers 
Who lack fat tracks get capped at, fuck that 
Destroy the masses, niggaz in classes tryin to catch the math 
As I sit and think the ink begins to craft 
My blueprints instruments workin as I'm jerkin 
Your style hurtin in the club your crew nervous rehearsin 
In between the cut I run amuck with mad stuff 
Niggaz can't touch, escape wack cyphers like handcuffs, so 
C'mon and get down with that Artifacts sound

If I had it my way, every wack MC would die Friday
Makin Saturday a better day
Sunday wouldn't start your week off til Monday
One day tunes I wrote yesterday will be tomorrow's scriptures for today
At high noon, Boom Skwad Gods with knowledge
Holler at apostles, who squalor in despair, despisin those who follow
Swallowin pride like St. Ide's while you stare... take a drink
Don't think in a eyeblink I won't start my hijinks
and hijack a flight [Yeah right, when?]
Tomorrow night, cause off the record with the treble and the bass
I chase my lyrics through the rap race
Last place is simply not an option in my case
Waste not want not because I front not
The Notty keeps his lyrical shotty cocked
and locked up at your temple, over instrumentals
(""It's all in your mind"") you No. 2 like the pencil
The Boom Skwadron, Godson, who got the Bop Gun
The top gun, from the jump like Datsun
I got one, candy-coated rote rhymes skits I shit on when I get on
Then flip the scripts like I had Zips on
It's on like electrical, my symmetrical
alphabetic keeps my competition ridin on my testicles
(""he ain't shit, you ain't shit, ain't nobody shit"")
You to the rescue, let me test you
Who the best crew, most definite
has to be the Skwad cause I'm the President
All you misrepresenters with your twelve inches need pinches
Wake the fuck up and check out what this is
(""he ain't shit, you ain't shit, your momma ain't shit, ain't nobody shit"")
I can't see nuttin but victories
MC's think they can get to me, then bring it
Cause once I pass the blunt to my Lieutenant then we in it
For the infinite, no play play
The notty headed Newark nigga from NJ and the Sensai
represent fully, playin bullies out for yappin
Thinkin you'll be rappin, get tapped and say you scrappin
While I been waitin hatin fake MC's that make they bacon
with passion, rippin up they stickers for reaction
Practicin on rap has-beens, I'm down with the Biz like Backspin
Dissin Mikes like the Jacksons
Thick like the lips on that Fugee chick
Hard like the dicks in booty flicks
Dissin niggaz like a snooty bitch (trick)
I only pop a coochie if it smells Gucci
Get the lucci hit it for months and then smoke blunts with the hoochies
(""What's the flavor Dunn"" - Tame)
You know the flavor like blue cheese
on how I make crews bleed and school MC's who try to do me

(""He ain't shit, you ain't... ahh motherfucker"")
        ""Do me baby, do me baby""
(""he ain't shit, you ain't shit..."")

My characteristics be mistic, you ask who is it
doin it, with the next type of tecs running through it
The bullshit, I mean, rap style clean
while I lean my 6 foot frame, Tame's the other being
Seeing that niggas wack, time to take it back to basics
Like saucony sneakers or a pair of Asics
Don't hate this- analyst, hip hop activist
battle tecnician who be on a mission now listen

[Tame One]
Tame One got more grip than gore tex
I'm comin through your set like CBS 
writing my name up in your projects
Who want to test me when I'm sess-ted
Pushing the paragraph like it's a Lexus
I come off hot like Texas
My west disrtict predicts that I'm the shit
So I walk through the bricks and shoot the gif like it's a full fifth
I bring the ruckus filling dutches with dust
I spread love like Take 6 until the whole spliff bust

[El]
We wish to diminish MC frauds who need to check
into a rap clinic, thinking that they all in it
My message to those is right down to the core
kick your best MC and all his niggas through the door
3-point offense, defense level's high
Stamina a hundred, leave your team ass dry

[Tame]
It's still our nature to hate ya
play you out like Las Vegas
cause my crew's got more game than 16 Segas
with adaptors, battling wack rappers and actors for all their stacks
and keeping my family fucked up like the Jacksons

[El]
Yo, you couldn't find my dap if you tried to use a map
or instructions, the number ones sold, guns be bustin so
Best to recognize, eyes is on the prize
watching for spies who want a piece of the lyrical pie

[Tame]
Crews be flippin like they really want to die
but when I ease up, they freeze and can't look me in the eye
I got folders on the jokers who talk trash
They never walk past, cause I be checkin for they're hall pass
Haul ass and let me shine like glass do
when I die make a statue, I get in you like a tattoo
I pay homage to all the bombers that I'm fly with 
enduring politics and getting paid off of some side shit

[El]
I push niggas back who lack skills to hold their own
Jackin other brothers' styles way  that they can zone
Prone to dismantle your insides like Mickey Mantle
My form lasts long, like trick candles
You see the work of these rhyme experts
that hurt niggas in cyphers to make the other states liver
Survivors of the fittest light the graf then ASCAP
Sen-S-E-I peep the next paragraph

[Tame]
In all actu-al my style's wilder than a crack spot
I'm illin, using the putas you buildin as my backdrop
I paint a picture perfect with a thousand pencils
From the back of Continentals, Lincolns, drinkin, thinkin mental
You better look through your girl's tape collection
cause this next subject might have a nigga second-guessing
I want to do raps and get fat like Apache
so I can get nasty and dis a nigga like a taxi

[El]
My exquisite exhibit has facts in this specific
Most niggas boast how they represent and come with it
But whose the rudest boys, coolest with poise
Artifacts be stickin them with rhythm poise
Is on the biz, taylor skills like Liz
Tryin to save the culture, vultures want to run the biz
You hear my voice more clear, intact
peep the lyrics, trap my sectrets
Ill like the film called the Curor

There's no denying that you're spying -- trying to see the graph
but you're knowing that can't fuck with the mathe-matcian

My theoretical medical rhetoric is terrible, but bearable
Instead of sheddin wool, I'm takin sedatives
MC repetatives, think they competetive
but I'm the Exodus, of executing
all of my et ceteras, my Book of Revelations
speak of hesitation, but I got the longest lines
in Newark since Club Sensations
Haitians, request me on the station like I'm Lauryn
But if I ain't touring there ain't no rapper on the street scorin

Chorus: Artifacts

It's gettin hot -- it's gettin hot MC's y'all know the steez

And I got some fast assed styles, so go and chase one
Hah, you lose from takeoff, so break off your shake off
cause here comes the payoff, for Ferris on his Day Off
Hieroglyphic, mystic, misfit rips shit, toxic Mr. Rock

To my, do or die, stature bound to catch ya
Those who try and match the, master not an actor, poseur
Wet with rap caliber, challengers
Wonder how I handle the, dates on my calendar
Using, verbal assault to insult
those who wish to diss the first born is catchin fault
Self taught, not many can say that
So put the needle to the groove and listen to real rap
So I'ma come to a close, it be the pros, y'all know the steez

I was out to bomb like Vietnam, but in this rhyme, I'm the prime suspect
Handcuffed for stuff that I ain't hit yet
It seems the neighborhood block watch got open like a box top
Wanted they're props and called up the cops
While Momma Dukes is in the kitchen flippin
Trippin cause spray caps is missin and I left without permission
I got bagged with the darkest black marker I had
An easy target cause my tag is on my bookbag
As I was shadowed they musta heard the bag rattle
Tipped the cops off, and ran up, before I popped the top off
Got interrogated bout crews I never heard of
Got my face wrote on, and treated like I did a murder
Heard sermons, on property value and city workshops
Slapped with a fine, now in my record there's a new notch
The misdemeanor catcher comin back at cha
for the long ride, as we return to the wrongside

[El Da Sensai]
Out to burn, rackin paints by the sack to provide
tracks as we return to the wrongside
Art programs and more hip-hop jams, must arrive
as we return to the wrongside
More better styles and wack writers step aside
Aerosol ride, as we return to the wrongside
Newark, New Jers - Brick City we reside
Big up, to BS, as we return to the wrongside

Once more, we have in store graffiti folklore
in depth to score points, what this joint for?
All graffiti writers, we bring justice, to this
Art we take to heart but they missed
the actual Facts, paint with fat caps, artistic
gestures, flat or gloss be the texture
If you measure the amount or count TV, shows on graf
Galleries, droppin all the skill calories
They crackin down to make us back down
but we still wreckin, who remember King 67?
Peace to Insta, buildin a mad tag in December
Protective shell los for the winter
Get in the subject, on how they say we suspects
Harass me for a marker, there he goes with a Tec
Blind to see wreck, cause they ignorant to check
the true art so, they pass laws just to catch
Certain writers, most bite us anyway
L-S-be	-S, L-T-D is on the path subway
Try to bring an understanding, respect we're demanding
Wrongside tales, we never fail with the plannin

Fatter jams on the air must arrive
The weak can't slide as we return to the wrongside
More joints on tape, less compromise
Better in size as we return to the wrongside

[Tame One]
Toys bite my tags, throwups, and old pieces
Thowin crews up, they can't be down with, and catchin beatings
Me and my crew stay close-knit
Make niggaz say 'Oh shit!' about our dope shit, takin cities in doses
With a tag here and a tag there next year
it'll be everywhere, catch me if you dare
It's rare for me not to have a marker after dark
Cause I've been in this to win this since niggaz used to say spark

[El Da Sensai]
Yo, I got the black book designers and the bag
Make sure I got the uni for the on tour tag
Saying that we cause mad terror in the city
Kids ain't got shit so, we feels no pity
on any surface, hurtin it, experts in it
Create with the Krylon, crafts be fantastic

[Tame One]
Artistic misfits, gifted wicked with the sketchbook
and the paint, maintainin the status top rank
With ink stained hands, I masterpiece master plans
with cans we came across diss some toys who crossed me off
Lost in my thought, I can walk a mile on style it's
been a while but I keep mechanicals on file
for every new jack, and non-believer not knowin my background
from jump, sleepin cause they only see me with blunts
My ghetto cartoons just express how I feel
Representin my culture, and not off it is the deal
I'm so ill with skill and I'm still up to par
Not your everday rap star, just who we are
Like conquering lions, we do our things with strong pride
for the long ride, tellin tales from the wrongside

[El Da Sensai]
KRS keeps the stage show live
Sharper than knives, as we return from the wrongside
PNB Nation, no hesitation
Blazin, as we return from the wrongside
Peeps sleep, while these brothers coincide
Keep in stride, as we return from the wrongside
Comp hide, toy niggaz take a dive
Kickin skills live, as we return from the wrongside

Uhh, it's like that
Layin shit down on the map

like this like that, so whatchu want?

Black little rascal dissin dips at White Castle
Got love doctors baffled why bitches ride me like a saddle

Or uncanny, playschool the days who misbehave
Pray their handy, MC's wreckin' niggas with the dandy
Style so peep the tech, X be the brand called seb? and
These niggas from New Jerus is next on hand
Formulate rhymes, create lines, collaborate
With the DATs and mind state, that makes your braincells ache
Niggas get dissed in the cut, now they finished
Advantage to the victor all crews be diminished

You will continue rolling your blunts, in a counter-clockwise fashion
(wack MC's, they all get the dick)
Gripping it firmly, yet loosely at the ends, twist it
In a counter-clockwise motion

You will be based to rely your skills on pure instinct

Phone me home I'm in the middle like I'm Monie (E.T.)
Love to do dubs on deck without a mic check 
Collect no checks (huh) but catch wreck on sets
(Deuce deuce nigga!  What?  L.O.D. too)
Deuce deuce is loose PPP represent see
Def Squad, Boom Skwad, and Artifacts make three
like Dennis Scott droppin one for the wisdom
Cause when I gets em, I'll be fuckin up they system
or temperature cheer when I appear from the mist
priceless, ice-diss and never see another Christmas

You play Risk when you dealin with the New Jeruz two blitz
Without the use of two clips, niggaz styles still be fluid (still)
The cat, darer with the terror off hands (hah!)
Without bands we rock spots in all lands (all lands)
Nigs be playin and we stand for the susbtance

Cause all that Russian/rushin save that shit for the dressing

Test me, the best be, checkin for my recipes (mmm)
Mess with me and I'll be drainin all your fuckin energy (boo-yaa!)

I used to catch a switch from any walk-by bitch (bitch!)
But now I'm to the break like disc jocks, dis rock is hot

Don't sniff shit but snot hops, you better watch your snotbox
I'll diss you, then I'll clear the air like Scott tissue 
The issue got a barcode on funkmode
So now I pack a trunkload of skunk, for the underground chumps
(Hoo-wee!) Cause I bumps in any system, who dissed em?
Watch me back them up from all the way from New Jeru
to Manhattan (Manhattan) satin and silk, kill the best built
I guess the milk was no good, so now I'm classified a true hood
Check this nigga, live on Kodak tits
or bust a pimp, cause I'm not a boogaloo shrimp

For all reasons, number one you're sleepin
Speakin like a deacon catch the drops my props leakin
(Praise the Lord) Seekin on the deep end, sinkin while I'm thinkin
of ways, to slay my competition without blinkin (hah!)
The ink's on the sheet with rhymes that are unique
complete batter, astoundin feats yo it don't matter
(Don't matter) Capi-talize, while I'm, categorized
The G-L to the Tame to the O-N-E

Chorus: repeat 4X",The Ultimate
Artifacts,"One two, once again
Who be the next man to get wreck and
Artifacts, remix, Showbiz, D.I.T.C.
One, one, one two three four five

Verse One: El Da Sensai, Tame One

We bring forth the swords in rap sports
Niggaz play the bench for us, overtime if niggaz want to shine
But I'm, the rhyme don taking out imposters
Proper with these fat tips, practice good posture
Not a, liquor sipper drug-transacter
Rapper-turned-actor nor be a lyrical slackard
Rapper for today's youth, check the attribute
Name Sensai, AOF, make niggaz regroup
Scoop these, ramsacked tracks like jewel thieves
Break it down to the matter cause the chatter's on squeeze

LADIES AND GENTS!!! We represent and take offense
to all the nonsense, here to resurrect like Com Sense
We rhymin fresh, nonetheless, don't stress the messengers
Boucning to the beat like big breastses
After this rap skit, kids go back and practice, lackin this
lyrical tactics when they match wits, who the?
captains over the boom bips
Rippin over the music when I use
just before I black out and I lose it
Able to stable a turntable
Raping record labels for papers, press record, tape us

Chorus: repeat 2X

You know the time when we rock the spot
Artifacts, New Jeruz, catch wreck and get the props
You know the time when we rock the shit
Tame One and MC El we be the ultimate

Verse Two: El Da Sensai

The fly style terrorist, blitzed to fits
Different vocals for the locals tricks for the remix, pick
notes, quote, still fresh when ass-broke
Past Go, when I move rap you in my lasso
Flow, pro-fessional, casual, on point, New
Jersey niggaz with the shit that's natural
Put words into patterns scheme plans for any man who think
He know the time and his rhyme don't stink
We be the ultimate (Ultimate what?)  Plus
Lyrical performance making sense a must
Bust back, with compositions paragraphs on your phonograph
as is, producer credit under Showbiz
That's Them blend lick shot, movin with strategical
lethal, rhyme style, considered unbelievable

Chorus

Verse Three: Tame One

Picture this like it's a cinema flick
We in the midst of taking over this, half of you
crabs don't even notice this, scope this
We know the risk and still take it, we could make it
We've already been the underrated
If I shine I shine, if I brick I just brick
If you diss, we can take it to the curb like dog shit
I'm not in it for the gimmicks, satisfying critics
I just want my own like the Hasidics
Mine on the sidelines, MC's Hail Mary
But I be in the box kicking my commentary
Quick to bury MC crews who lose at my circumfrence
And hit em with the spit I roll my blunts with
It be the ultimate, fuck the dumb shit we run it half-blunted
or crazy drunk off the eight hundred

Artifacts,"[El Da Sensai]
Artifacts be the best in this MC fest
Rest any intentions we here to mention we the fresh
Newark natives, Polo king bringin the zing
to your Walkman, check it how we talk and sing
Breakin that thing, lyrical jackin, mackin
All so-called cypher rappin niggaz I'm smackin
No tricks with fits inflict the hurt like Frank Thomas
To never make the wack jams, to my peers I promise
Atomic, yet, niggaz gonna have to respect
what we're bringin to the table check my dialect
Alphabeta, wetta, than your man who says he can
take a whole block, we put that ass on lock and
Styles be groovy, fake niggaz can't fool me
cause I'm a fly brown brother and you can't school me
Tools be, always sharpened for MC's that be startin
up shit, and can't fuck with, this rap sargeant
Bluffin, talkin bout nothin, in fact
These crews be wack, so may I ask, where yo skillz at?

Chorus

[Tame One]
It's no doubt what I'm about bustin yo shit out with my lyrical
Smokin botanicals I be the man that makes the miracles
Invisible if need be, see me on TV and on CD
smokin beadies in 3-D doin graffiti
My mechanical style, interlocks rocks and shocks
cause I'm hot, X marks the spot like Sadat watch
I'm so tight with mine, nickel and dime rhymers
are smokin one quarter pushin off the corner from foul line
Prime time teams rewind and can't find mine
They all left behind because my rhymes lack guidelines
Wings get pushed back from hairlines to asscracks
So check ASCAP, on Artifacts soundtracks
So act ill, I can peel a skill like fresh bills
Crack a rapper like a Phills I smack more ass than Benny Hill
but chill a minute, I'm all up in it infinite potential
Newark, Jew Jersey resedential areas I turn to burial plots
for MC's, who don't believe what I conceive
Or leave a whole team speechless, gettin jives to Chucky Cheese
I'm like Jesus to the mic, write My Life out like Mary
I'm oh-Blige-d to J. any ghetto queen that's sanitary
Don't play me too close, you'll get roasted by the human torch
from Newark, I'm blowin up spots without tour support
I distort thoughts, with izm sticks and quarts
Laughin at rappers who come at me in soft packs like Newports
I walk that talk, get down and dirty like New York
That's why I'm still fat, beef kill that, nigga where yo skillz at?

Chorus

[El Da Sensai]
But, back to the subject at hand
Peep my battle plan and I'll be forced to chop that hand
off soft brothers yo they can't withstand
the pressure, prepare the stretcher and the Dristan
Cause in nine-six, these MC's can't miss
If you purchase this, then you see why brothers kinda pissed it's
the Mr. Flip Lipper always stayin dipped
Always talkin shit, always hittin hallways and shit

[Tame One]
I play the parks after dark and spark L's until my head bust
and then bust, plus when I get dusted you'll get messed up
Rollin with razors neighbors hate me cause I'm famous
Tame is accurate back with battle raps fat like battleships
Constantly open like a hood rat that's smokin
Got bitches in Hoboken overdosin off my potions
Wet like oceans, my notebook looks atrocious
Be dissin vocal coaches I don't let them hit my roaches
I handle my Biz like Warner
Brothers be on the corner talkin gossip, hot cause they ain't got shit
Watch this... where yo skillz at nigga?

Chorus",Where Yo Skillz At?
Artifacts,"Who's this?  With the vocal pitch, I blitz
We be the top choice, moist, voice my script
Significant, different styles on instinct
Make sense, when rockin' rhymes over instruments
Known for the graf, although the crowd comes first
Activist, specialist, of the ultimate verse
All subjects correct, image is the key
If you want your peers respect show versatility
Type strange, how the whole sound is rearranged
Changed, so many players entered in the game
But not these two, we past dues, smash crews
You ask what's the task slash we bringin' the news
Dialogue, strong, not your average cabbage
Savage on the mic while other crews can't manage
Cause in these times the rhymes pay all things
Rent, bills plus your diamond pinky ring

[Chorus]
Comin from the Bricks, all mics we rip
(Who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
With the fat penmanship for the championship
(Who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
Fat tracks, lyrics, New Jerus click
(who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)
We comin from the back with the ultimate blitz
(Who's this? Kickin in your Benzi box crisp)

Holy Moses, I'ma come down like drug doses
With a voltage, cause I'm ready to shock whoever's closest
Bold enough to dismiss tricks, up in the mix
With my rhyme skit, bad with the ad-libs behind it
Time it, the rapper's precionist, ain't no dissin' us
It's just, another rap attack for your to discuss
It's us, fresh in the flesh, up in your session
Wildin' out like sex without protection
Right before your eyes I'ma rise up and size up
The status of the rappers while I sit in the back, smokin' my cabbage
Managin', not to get involved with the petty
We ever ready, cuttin' comp like a machete
Not the one to glorify guns, I'd rather drop it on the one
And make the funds for my late night weed runs
Dumb dums, want to do bids and start they static
They better ease back like Craftmatic

[Chorus]

Superficial rhymes on top for y'all to see
How we react on wax, DJ included exactly
Autographs in black books, dodgin' from the crooks
Recognize the stats, don't act for ill looks
But I keep a straight path like the subway stay
Underneath from deep in the depths of NJ

I be the one to get the job done, Tame One
Got funk like the Bop Gun, burnin' with the powers of a hot sun
Makin' my mark after dark like I'm a criminal
Break hard rocks to minerals like, ten star generals
Is it the way we slay the stages, that make these neighbors hate us
We fillin' up the pages with the game like Las Vegas
New Jersey native, ten minutes from the Money Makin
Stay rooted with the Buddha like Jamaicans

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Arturo O'Farrill,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Verse 1: Fermín IV
Si crees que se le está acabando el vuelo, no
Esto está comenzando
El danzón ya empezó a tocar (pararara) 
why no ha terminado, no
El paso del tiempo va imponiendo el respeto
why la calidad va mano a mano con la cantidad, viene 
(Viene) viene marcando la pauta why el sentimiento
Mi vida empieza desde adentro
Siempre brota lo que siento
Es verdad lo digo why me comprometo
Responsable soy why lo lamento
Pero creo que es el crecimiento
Por ahora está en el mejor momento
El amanecer siempre aparece corrigiendo al anochecer
why las cosas que se ven nacer
Hay que verlas madurar why crecer

Verse 2: Pato
Viviendo por suerte why clandestinamente
Más no estaba muerto solamente ausente
Si paré de pronto, nunca indiferente
No acabó el danzón why sigue igual que siempre
Si continúa el corazón
Ritmos unidos sobre ilusión
Noche a noche se escucha la voz
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Ruben Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón
Songoro cosongo songe be
Songoro cosongo de mamey
Que se está bailando en cada rincón
Que está sonando en tu corazón

Verse 3: Fermín IV
Suena que suena las cartas sobre la mesa
No hay quien detenga esto nadie se mueva
Así es, todo tiene su tiempo why si estás dispuesto
A sembrar why cultivar hay que ver el fruto madurar
Hasta donde puede llegar sólo hay que desarrollar
Ampliar, solamente crear es inmenso el lugar
Espacio suficiente como para cohabitar
Escucha mi tierra hare eco
Entre las montañas se hare camino el concreto
Señales de humo que van creciendo cada día más
Tratando de comunicar
Exponiendo los adentros a la luz como van
Sin borrar nada sin tapar nada sin ocultar nada
Se presentan testimonios reales
El sentimiento no es más que puras verdades

Verse 4: Pato
Reuniendo por suerte why discretamente
Más no estaba lejos respectivamente
Si lo que se mueve proviene del vientre
No acabó el danzón why ha de seguir pa' siempre
Si se ha dado la ocasión
Ciertos sonidos de imaginación
Día a día que visita el sol
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Rubén Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón
Songoro cosongo songe be
Songoro cosongo de mamey
Es guardar silencio de movimiento
Ayunar de color why sonido
Ser mujer viejo why niño
why dejarse llevar...

You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together

You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
     
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

Arvid Paulsen,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland

And my youth left for a distant land
And I was watching the smell turn bland
And the candy in my hand

Stick my head in the garbage can
Skin the kat, turn on the fan
Put the choice cuts in the pan

Could this be the kind of love?
That my mum use to warn me about How will I know
that this love will last.

Asa Harris,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland
Asa Harris,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some

To my heart he carries the key

Asa Harris,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Asaf Avidan,"My life is like a wound
I scratch so I can bleed
Regurgitate my words
I write so I can feed
And death grows like a tree
That's planted in my chest
Its roots are at my feet
I walk so it won't rest

Oh, baby I am lost
I said oh, baby I am lost

I try to push the colours
Through a prism back to white
To sync our different pulses
Into a blinding light
And if love is not the key
If love is not a key
I hope that I can find
A place where it could be

I know that in your heart
There is an answer to a question
Which I'm not as yet aware that I have asked
And if that tree had not drunk my tears
I would have bled and cried for all the years
That I alone have let them pass

And oh, baby I am yours
I said oh, baby I am yours
And oh, baby I am yours
I said oh, baby I am yours",Different Pulses
Asaf Avidan,"Long are the days when you're turning away
From the reasons you strung
Long is the way, when you're aching to say
But your teeth bite your tongue

Loud is the wind in your ears as you spin
As you look for the sun
Loud are the skies as you thunder your cries
When your prayers are sung

Hard is the floor as the waves pound the shore
Of your wounds
Roll up your sleeve it's hard to believe
But it's you

Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it you got to believe it

My oh my! It hurts sometimes
Oh my oh my! It hurts sometimes
I think I’m running out of time
Before I’m gonna lose my mind

My oh my! It hurts sometimes
Oh my oh my! It hurts sometimes
I think I’m running out of time
Before I’m gonna lose my mind

Slow is the night when you reach for the light
But the dark lingers on
Slow is the bite of the words that you write
When it’s finally dawn

How can you swim when the waters are streaming in you?
Roll up your sleeve now love it or leave it it's you

Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it
Love it or leave it you got to believe it

My oh my! It hurts sometimes
Oh my oh my! It hurts sometimes
I think I’m running out of time
Before I’m gonna lose my mind

My oh my! It hurts sometimes
Oh my oh my! It hurts sometimes
I think I’m running out of time
Before I’m gonna lose my mind

Before I’m gonna lose my mind

Asaf Avidan & the Mojos,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

To make my own destiny
To make my mark in history

That all I know is true

Is well worth fighting for

Are well worth dying for

The end of the line guaranteed

The coal catches fire and I'm down the wire in a flash 
That big old smoksack is belching out black smoke and ash 
So sad to think of 
Hurting the one you love 
But surely that's what leaving does 
You'd know best.

I gotta pick up speed 
Just to get what I need 
The end of the line guaranteed

So this is where old yellow-hair's ghost-dance begins

Cursed or blessed

Man verschiebt die Deadline
Solange man noch Zeit hat
Solange man noch Zeit hat

Geboren in einer großen Stadt mit kleinen Erwartungen
Entdeckte ich in jungen Jahren meine Begabung
Sammelte reichlich Erfahrung suchte geistige Nahrung
Wusste irgendwann klappt es niemals Zeitpunkt und Datum
Hab die Worte Fick dich in jeder Sprache gelernt
Und nichts außer den Mülltonnen der Sesamstraße geehrt
Nennt mich Oscargewinner Rockstar für immer
Hock' da im Zimmer vor 'nem Bildschirm der flimmert
Mach' Beats schreib' Zeilen paff' Weed bleib' high
Aktiv Lifestyle krass wie die Zeit verstreicht
Sah viele kommen sah noch mehr gehen
Viele verirrten sich auf der Suche nach noch mehr Fame
Überzogen ihre 15 Minuten
Setzen hohe Ziele aber nahmen den günstigsten Flug hin
Auf diesem Weg helfen keine Wünschelruten
Und wenn man nicht voran kommt dann nützt kein Hupen
Jeder will ein Stück vom Kuchen jeder will Rapstar sein
Keiner will dafür früh aufstehen wie der Bäcker nein
Ich rapp solang es noch ne Deadline gibt
Und'n Publikum was sich meine Tracks reinzieht
Bis man auf den kleinen Monitoren 'ne Flatline sieht
Ab jetzt schreib' ich jedes Lied als wär's das letzte Lied
Bis man auf den kleinen Monitoren 'ne Flatline sieht
Ab jetzt schreib' ich jedes Lied als wär's das letzte Lied

Das ist meine Deadline
Es geht immer weiter
Wollt es wär so einfach
Man verschiebt die Deadline
Solange man noch Zeit hat
Solange man noch Zeit hat

Mit 15 glaubt man dass man für immer lebt
Nichts zu verlieren denkt dass immer nur das Gewinnen zählt
Will die Welt erobern niemand stellt sich in den Weg
Und auch wenn alle nur den Spinner sehen
Mit 25 auf dem Gipfel dacht' ich es war keine große Sache
Und trug den Kopf hoch denk' jede Chance am Schopf zu packen
Mit 30 lern' ich Zweifeln war alles bloß ne Masche
Lügt mir doch weiter in die Hosentasche
Mit 35 die Einsicht dass nichts für immer bleibt
Erkenn' die Endlichkeit und auf einmal rennt die Zeit
Denk' mit 40 muss die Karre aus'm Dreck sein
Doch nach der Deadline ist vor der Deadline
Und deshalb tu' ich was ich tu'
Mit 7-Meilen-Stiefeln auf die 80 zu
Und wenn mich jemand fragt danach was ich such'
Sag' ich das Leben ist wie'n Buch am Ende klappst du's zu
Und wenn mich jemand fragt danach was ich such'

He passed on worried and warning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.
The trees that whisper in the evening,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Four a.m. in the morning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night,
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to terms with me this night,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.

Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.

You can dance in the dark
Cause you're never there alone
Once in every hour

Should happen once in every life

There's nothin' else you can do
You stop asking why, just let yourself fly

Love should feel so good you cry
And your only release

Some days I feel fine!

And I wish away my time.

When you come to me
I realize how wonderful my life can be.
With you...You and me.

Some days make me blue.
Some days I stare out through my window
And wonder what the world will do.
I wonder what the world will do!

The darkness closes in.

You remind me that I'm alright.

Some days I think I just fell from the sky.
Some days I have to ask the question 'why?'
But everyday I try!

Some days I am virtuous,
But some days I'm just bad.
Some days I just can't get enough
Of the sweetest things I ever had.
The sweetest things I ever had.

But when you telephone,
I realize that I am never really all alone
And dream that I am home, I am home,
I am home!

",Some Days
Aselin Debison,"Wish I could whistle down the Northern Lights
And send them dancing all across the night
Maybe then when all the sky was blazing
Maybe then I'd feel you somewhere
Gazing at a star,
And you could feel me too
As I say goodbye to you

It breaks my heart in two, to say goodbye to you
Wish time could turn us back to yesterday
The gods above would look the other way
Maybe then we still could laugh together
Maybe then it could be spring forever and a day
But I must face the truth and say goodbye to you
It breaks my heart in two, to say goodbye to you

Wish I could whistle down the Northern Lights
And send them dancing all across the night
Maybe then in my memories for saving
One last time you're on the hill waving from afar
One last glance or two and I'll say goodbye to you
It breaks my heart in two, to say goodbye to you

Everything's so blurry
In a world that's bigger than me 
When there's no one to talk to
I can lay mine on you
You will always comfort me 
For every step that's held me back
For every second chance I've had 
You always seem to, to find a way
To tell me 
That you love me
That you need me
That you'll find me whenever I get lost inside my head 
That you'll save me
Completely
From a world that's bigger than me 
In the blink of an eye
You make everything right
No more dark cloud following 
When I've got empty pockets
And when I'm stuck in traffic
I can tell it's you just by the ring 
For every corner cut too fast
For every time that I came last

To tell me 
That you love me
That you need me
That you'll find me whenever I get lost inside my head 
That you'll save me

Stories will recall",Leather Rebel [*]
Ash,"In the midday heat I gave a sigh
Cruisin' through the garden district I was out of mind
The star of India's in my hotel room
In a brief combination 3,2,1, (which only I know)
And I've just seen by mentor Dr No
California sun is on the radio let's go

I just want to reach the radio star
I just want to reach the radio star
It's a satellite of Venus and it ain't to far
I just want to reach the radio star

I was shooting up in my hotel room
When my phone started ringing oh no
It was Dr No he gave me the password
He said hey man haven't you heard (I said no)
The worlds been invaded by alien life forms
Meet me at the airport, we've got to get out, let's go

I just want to reach the radio star
I just want to reach the radio star
It's a satellite of Venus and it ain't to far
I just want to reach the radio star

I ran to the window and looked out
There were dead people all over the street man
Within two minutes I had all my stuff together
I jumped in the car and was speeding down the highway past all the deserted cars
In five minutes I was at the airport but there at the gates I saw what I suppose was one of them Alien life forms
I pulled my bazooka out of it's bag in the back of the car and blew it to hell
As arrange Dr No was waiting for me in the terminal
We got a private jet plane and took off
Two hours later landing in Zaire
Where we met up with Fu Manchu, Hannibal Lector, the hooded claw and all the rest of the gang
We boarded the rocket and soon we were shooting off for the stars
And as we approached the space station I looked down and observed the earth
The US airforce being annihilated
And swarms of Nu-clear weapons soaring through the stratosphere destroying the earth
And I swear to god I laughed",Day of the Triffids
Ash,"Kung Fu do what you do to me 
I haven't been the same since my teenage lobotomy 
Full on, I moved to Hong Kong 
With Bruce Lee's brother and Johnny Wong 
I think its strange, he's friends with Fu Manchu 
And he thinks he knows you 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
Oh Daniel San made in Taiwan Come on Jackie Chan 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
Last night Jackie Chan came 'round 
I played pool with him and we hung out 
Mr. Miagi and the X-men 
Called in for a while as well 
Kung Fu do what you do to him 
I can't live without my Kung-Fu movies 
'Shanghai Killers' and 'Deadly Road' 
My life was ruined when the Green Dragon closed 
I think it's strange he's friends with Fu Manchu 
And he thinks he knows you 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
Oh Daniel San made in Taiwan 
Come on Jackie Chan 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
I think it's strange he's friends with Fu Manchu 
Uh uh uh uh uh oh 
He's in love with you

Ash,"There's two things I like, really like
One's kicking migs, the other's thumping birds

First I'm gonna kill 'em all
Then I'm gonna fuck you
Oh baby, I want to fuck you up the ass

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna gamble
I'm gonna fuck you
Oh baby, I want to fuck you up the ass

Oh boy
Tonight, I'm gonna do your brain
I'm gonna kill you in
Oh baby, I want to fuck you up the ass

Ash,"He spent the week at his friend's house
It had been ages since they'd been in touch
The weekend passed in a drunken haze
It felt good, like the old days

I lied you're not so different today
Don't go so far away
And without you my life is boring anyway

They went down to the station on Sunday
He felt sad as the train pulled away
He wished that it would never end
He knew he'd never see him again

I lied you're not so different today
Don't go so far away
And without you my life is boring anyway

I lied you're not so different today
Don't go so far away

Don't go so far away",Different Today
Ash,"Get your money out for me,
If you get it all out you'll see,
You've got so much to give, you've got so much to loose
It might seem a little unfair, so now you see you cannot choose

Take a time out for me,
Get it all out for me,
You've got so much to give, you've got so much to loose
It might seem a little unfair, so now you see you cannot choose

It might seem a little unfair, so then you'll see that you cannot choose",Get Out
Ash,"Now it's too late to be using my mind
To reason with you would be far too kind
It's all coming down like the dark on the town
The cold stings my tearstained face
So now it's all over , It's much too late to say 'Oh no'

I try not to echo everyone's dream
But they don't exist or so it seems
They just like inside of me
But it's too dark I can never ever see you
And now it's all over, it's much too late to say 'Oh no'

Oh, she looked so lovely, standing on her own,
Oh, she looked so lovely, standing on her own,

She looked at me as she closed the door
A stare so cold, but what for?
I fell in love as she crossed the floor,
I need her now but she hated me more
And now it's all over, it's much too late to say 'oh no'

Oh, she looked so lovely, standing on her own,
Oh, she looked so lovely, standing on her own,",Intense Thing
Ash,"Late summer you walked into my life
I remember the autumn, I remember that night
That smile on your face, the pale pale moon
All good times still left to come

I remember the autumn, I remember that night
That smile on your face, the pale pale moon
All good times still left to come

Awoke by a phone call one cold night
In my dream you had been going to die
I felt so scared that I was going to loose you
When I answered the phone I already knew

I cried bitter tears you had been taken your own life

Down the corridor to the bedroom
I sit there in silence all alone
Alone is all I'll ever be
Except at night when you visit my dreams
It tears my mind I can't see you tomorrow.",Season
Ash,"I sent off this morning
Down the road along the river
Which I take but once a year
My walk will take me by the shore
Then inland for a mile or more
From the cold sea spray

A small wood stands upon the hill
An old house near it lies in ruins
Forgotten long ago
And here in a clearing, 
overgrown with moss and ivy
Is your lovely grave

A dusk I will make my way
Along the lanes and through the fields
To where my cottage is
But before I step inside for bed
I'll look up at the stars as we had
All those years ago

So here's for Uncle Pat",Uncle Pat
Ash,"Remembering the warm summer nights 
When everything is gonna turn out right 
When all the answers lie behind your eyes 
And everything is gonna turn out right 
All I want is to see you smile 
All I want is to see you smile

You give me feelings that I used to get 
And remember things that I had forgotten

And all had been said 
In the kitchen laughing with you 
Before I went to bed 
My face in the light illuminated 
Untroubled and safe 
As your face is shining upon me 
A love that would never cease 
Out where the cold wind blows 
It rocks my childhood sleep 
And up in the starry skies 
And further out to sea 
Late in time when it will come 
I see it in my dreams 
At night with the cold wind blowing 
At night with the cold wind blowing outside 
Gone the dream, it's all faded now 
Gone the dream, it's all faded now 
Take me home 
Hours pass ticking slowly 
Lying wide awake 
All across the land the lights are out 
Under an open sky 
I feel for you and everybody 
Dreaming in your beds 
I'm feeling lost, there is nothing 
Nothing more than this 
Going out where the cold wind blows 
It rocks my childhood sleep

And you feel like you're losing your mind 
I tasted the danger 
And went south of heaven tonight 

I didn't mind she wasn't into letting go 
I didn't mind 'cause she still was nothing like you 
How can you lose when it's waiting for you 
You should come on when 

It's there for the taking 
Waiting for you 
The days seem the same 
And you feel like you're losing your mind 

I tasted the danger 
And went south of heaven tonight

Just like you I want to wake up 
Feeling alright",I'd Give You Anything

I knew a girl from mars? 
I don't know if you knew that 
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards 
Henri winterman cigars 
Though she never told me her name

Sitting in a dreamy daze by the water's edge 
On a cool summer's night 
Fireflies and stars in the sky 
Gentle glowing light 
From your cigarette 
The breeze blowing softly on my face 
Reminds me of something else 
Something that in my memory has been replaced 
Suddenly all comes back 
And as I look to the stars.
I remember the time 
I knew a girl from mars 
I don't know if you knew that 
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards 
Henri winterman cigars 
Though she never told me her name 
I still love you girl from mars 
Searching through the darkness 
And over the moonlit stand 
Electricity in the air 
Twisting all through the night on the terrace 
Now that the summer is here 
I know that you are almost in love with me 
I can see it in your eyes 
Strange lights shimmering 
Over the sea tonight

I knew a girl from mars 
I don't know if you knew that

Though she never told me her name

It felt as if you'd returned 
I thought that you were standing over me

I knew a girl from mars? 
I don't know if you knew that

Oh yeah it was the start of the summer 
On warm June evenings 
She would come to my house 
Still in her school skirt 
And her summer blouse 
Talking too long as the night came on 
It was the best time of my life 
Her bee stung lips 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
The things she whispered 
With breathless sighs 
The summer air was soft and warm 
Her eyes were making silent demands 
And as her hair came undone in my hands 
Oh yeah she was taking me over 
Oh yeah it was the start of the summer 
Driving her home after midnight 
I felt so good everything was alright 
Her thoughts seemed lost in the night sky 
I remember everything 
I don't know why these things ever end 
I sometimes wish it was that summer again 
I still see her in my sleep 
And hear the sighing of the summer wind 
Still I don't regret one thing 
Oh yeah she was taking me over 
Oh yeah it was the start of the summer 
It felt just like it was the start of forever

The cars stop outside, they all stay inside
The house is drenched in light, 
But what have I done wrong?
I quietly climb the stairs, 
I remember all the years,
I check everything is right I need to hurry-now!

I know exactly what to say

They'll all get in back in the cars,

Feel it coming in the air
Times the living is easy
It won't be long till the summer is here

Days when you wake in the morning
&127; With the sun shining through the blinds
Days when the living is easy
And you know things are going alight

Coming up following the feeling
And the night is young
Let it go following this feeling
Let it come

On nights when the music ignites you
And you come to understand
That all that you ever looked for
Is sitting there in your hand

When the air is alive with magic
And you feel it in the summer breeze
When the stars are aglow and burning
And it's all setting off your dreams

Coming up following the feeling
And the night is young
Let it go following this feeling
Let it come

Burning up following the feeling
And the night is young
Let it go following this feeling
Let it come

No more nights sitting feeling blue
Even the rain reminds me of you
Just let it all fade away
Just let it all fade away
Like a bad dream in the night

Burning up following the feeling
And the night is young
Let it go following this feeling
Let it come

Burning up following the feeling
And the night is young
Let it go following this feeling

I stayed up all night to see the dawn

She takes me under stormy waters
Cradles my head as sleep comes on
I'll drown in her eyes, dream in daylight
And wake again in her twilight

am I under a spell?

fighting for my life?

so far gone

can't turn it round

for the innocence we lost will not return

we know we can't go on

but we're still holding on

don't let me be the one to drag you down

in the lonely night

when you're frozen with fear

when you're paralyzed

too delicate

your fragile mind

it's so hard to stay

in love with life

for the innocence we lost will not return

we know we can't go on

but we're still holding on

don't let me be the one to drag you down


I was fighting at your side

a knowing partner in this crime

a beating heart, a distant star

we lost all we were fighting for

all the hurt I kept within

I blamed myself for everything

for all the regret that remains

for all the pain


Terror in your eyes, your heart is breaking

for the innocence we lost will not return

we know we can't go on

but we're still holding on

don't let me be the one to drag you down

When you break down

What doesn't kill you
Will make you stronger
When it gets you, you'll discover

So take courage
Take your chances
And one day you will find your answers

Ash,"I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
You started something
Won't you see
But ever since we met you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Love has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance
Now listen honey

I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
You started something
Won't you see
But ever since we met you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance
Now hear it honey

I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
You started something
Won't you see
But ever since we met you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you
Oh no matter, no matter what you do
I only want to be with you",I Only Want to Be with You

So romantic
So bewildering

I followed the rabbit and now I am lost and alone
Please, Caught in a dream
Locked in a nightmare that's all closing in on me

Can't stop the fire burning in my head
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna know anymore

Paranoid visions of two things becoming unclear

Whats the latest? am I supposed to be here?

Who's said they're better when they haven't started?

I meant to tell you but the race had started 

Who's shooting this pilot it will never get made? 
Who wrote this song it will never get played?

It looks as though things are never gonna change 
So if the moment's hard to find 
Or the perfect place to hide 
I'm building me my very own getaway car 

So introduce me while I'm floating 
My smile feels tired and I think its showing 
Please excuse me the water's shallow 
I hear what youre saying though its hard to swallow 
I'll fight the courage treading water 
Why sink or swim here when nobody bothers 
I meant to tell you but you looked too tired 
I meant to tell you but the race had started

That don't make me a prisoner

And I've kissed your demons and I loved the taste

Bulletproof, we're thick as thieves
What we got is unbreakable

Keep setting fires just to feel the heat
It’s better when it's bittersweet
Yeah the burn's inescapable

If dark goes light, if day turns night,
Then may be wrong could be all right

Don’t look down 'cause we’re on this high
We can’t go back 'cause we’re on this ride

And never the truth now as for me I'm moving on
You'll always be my baby.

Baby I just got to let you go for now,
Thought I could take it for a while maybe.
You'll make it back around baby I just got to live my life.
And now can't see me changing for a while hope I could make it back around.

Anything that I want I can get it boy.
You know you turn me on and on that's why I switch my
Frame of mind of being there when you call always on time.
I'm looking to spread my wings and party,
From everything and for everybody,
Need my space my time alone its like our hearts don't match no more,
Still everything that you want you could get it boy.
You know I still got love for
You in court I plea the fifth my baby.

[Chorus]

When you was cheating you was probably thinking I won't sense a thing
But love got funny way of catching up
To lies and your lies can't look me straight in the eyes I'm not surprised that you
Would hurt me baby but why me baby just let me breathe
And I'll fly free babe.

If you were me what would you do always a lie,
And never the truth now as for me I'm moving on
You'll always be my baby.

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
Yo Yo
Why in the world would you wanna leave me girl is there
Something I did that you feel is better then whats here at home
And I know a bitch could do bad on her own you're not alone
The way you hurt me baby shit why me baby
I be in pain a little but I know that love is real and as
Long as it lets you go you feel the need to come back to me baby
Who else would hold you and sex
You crazy R.U.L.E come on back holla at me baby.

Ashanti,"See my days are cold without you (Here's Another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
See my days are cold without you (Here's Another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I won't keep running back to you
(And another one, what? what?)

I think I found my strength to finally get up and leave
No more broken heart for me
No more tellin' your lies to me (And another one)
I'm lookin' like I got my head on right so now I see
No more givin' you everything
There's no more takin' my love from me (what)

See my days are cold without you (Here's Another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
See my days are cold without you (Here's Another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I won't keep running back to you
(And another one, what? what?)

Glad to wake up every day without you on my brain
No more waiting late up at night
No more havin' to fuzz and fight
I'm proud to say that I will never make the same mistake
No more thinkin' about what you do
There's no more of me runnin' back to you

See my days are cold without you (Here's Another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
See my days are cold without you (Here's Another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I won't keep running back to you

Biggie
Some say the x make the sex spec-tacular
Let me lick you from yo neck to yo back
Then ya, shiverin', tongue deliverin'
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright wit' you, we fuckin' (that's cool)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot next to yo sister
Damn I really miss the way she used to rub my back when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Caribbean
But tonight, no ends

You must be used to me cryin' (And another one)
While you're out bumpin' and grindin
But I'm leaving you tonight

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
You must be used to me cryin' (And another one)
While you're out bumpin' and grindin'
But I'm leaving you tonight (And another one)",Unfoolish
Ashanti,"What's up you've reached Ashanti leave me a numeric message or a
Voice message and I'll get back to you lata [beep]
Hey girl what's up it's me, yo man remember
Your friend and I've been calling you for the past three weeks
You've never returned any of my
Calls, what happened I thought I was going to see you
At the spot last night yo everybody's
Askin' for you, and you know who be looking for you like crazy,
Man what's going on, what's come
Over you?

[Chorus]
I don't know what's come over me I don't know,
I don't know what's come over me, I don't know
What's come over me, I don't know I don't know what's come over me

Because I never felt like this, (I don't want to be wrong cause I like it)
Thinking about the way you kiss,
(I don't want to be wrong but I like it)
I think you stole my heart from me, (See I don't want to be wrong cause I like it)
Cause I belong to somebody (even though it seems wrong I
Can't fight it)it almost feels as if I'm not myself,
I'm nervous bound from someone else I think
I'm falling for somebody else and I can't control myself
It's like some kind of hex is on me
Controlling who I love and how I speak
And when it's gone my heart won't beat tell me what's come
Over me. 

[Chorus]

Because I never felt like this, (I don't want to be wrong cause I like it)
Thinking about the way you kiss,
(I don't want to be wrong but I like it)
You got me thinking I should leave, (see I don't want to be wrong cause I like it).
But I belong to somebody (even though it seems wrong I can't fight it)
I know that I already have a love, he's all I know and all I trust but lately
I've been falling out of love I find myself so deep in lust
And every time he's here with me I
Look into his eyes so desperately but now it's not his face I see,
Tell me what comes over me

[Chorus]

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
(I just don't know) I don't know (what's come over me),
I don't know, I don't know , I don't know, I don't know, I don't
Know, (it's like something is taking complete control over me)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

Who indeed took over my soul, (understand)

Get on my knees till they bloody red, (baby please)
See I don't know if you get it yet, (just don't know)

(Didn't know) can have the power to take over mine,

Baby,baby baby,baby, I love it when I hear
Ya name, got me sayin' baby, baby, baby,
Baby, baby,(baby I love you) baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

See, I could never feel alone with you (in my life),
I gave up everything I own for you (won't
Think twice), almost a shame how I'm mesmerized (such a shame),
I loose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why)
Because your kisses make my lips quiver and (that's real) and when you
Touch me my whole body shivers. (I can feel) now,
I can see how another life(nother life)could
Have the power to take over mine cause your my.

Baby, I can't see my worth (I can't see) living here on
God's green earth, you don't know what
You've done to me, (done to me) I never thought
I'd need you desperately,(desperately) it's kind
Of sick how I'm stuck on you(stuck on you)
But I don't care cause I'm needing you (I'm needing you)
And how I feel will remain the same (remains the same)
'Cause you're my baby, (cause your my baby)
Listen and when the world starts to stress me out,
(Where I run) it's to you boy without
A doubt (you're the one) who keeps me sane and I can't complain
(Can't complain) you're like a
Drug you relieve my pain (may seem strange)
You're like the blood flowing through my vain, (oooo)
Keeps me alive and feeding my brain,
(oooo) now this is how another human life (nother life) could
Have the power to take over mine cause your my

Pourin' rain outside
And I was ""knocked out""

'Cause looking at you made me feel kind of crazy,
Now what you asked I almost did it automatically
But it was nothing compared to the joy you gave me.

Although I know that what we had it wasn't perfect babe,
You fooled around, but see back then it didn't phase me
I thought by staying, trying to change you would be worth it babe,
But now I see that trying to change you only changed me.
All these tears,and all of your lies
All these years and now we're saying goodbye, it's over babe.

Now I'm thinking that I never should have dealt with you,
All this screaming and this yelling
That we go through raining late at night I'm sitting waiting up for you
Just to tell you how I hate who you turned into,
See ain't no way I'm gonna sit and take this shit from you,
I'm never playing another day of being your fool,
I wasted all my time on something that just wasn't true,
I should have known I could never ever change you.
All these tears, and all of your lies,
All these years and now we're saying goodbye it's over babe.

It's the one that brings me to my knees and gives thanks

Snapped my fingertips, then I licked my lips

As we rolling out the lot he said he wanted to chill

As we go along,

Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,

In a long time it brought out
All these feelings that I never
Knew I had inside seeing you
With another girl it didn't sit
With me too well and I'm mad
At myself cause I love you and
With or without you I'm going through hell

I never thought that I would see it 
Now there's holes in my walls and there's glass on the floor
And you said you didn't mean it.
You went from zero to none in these past three months on your level of affection
I don't want to be that girl that cries herself to sleep putting up with your rejection cause

I can't carry on living life like this, living life like this,
This can't be what it is, I don't want to live my life like this.(2x)

When I try to make sense out of what we have I also fall into depression
Because I know in my heart that we both grown apart ain't no use in us pretending
We never talk on the phone and your never at home and if you are there's always tension, I ain't gonna be that girl that ends up staying sitting around just regretting cause

[Chorus]

I'm tired of fighting, I'm tired of spiting, my life is a storm full of raining and lightning my insides are pleading from all of the screaming sometimes I just feel like I'm no longer breathing.
I look in your eyes all I see is a demon, I'm tired of wearing my heart on my sleeve and I just don't know why I stay cause day after day I continue to say

Ashanti,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Intro/Medley

I never knew what I went through
But hoped everything'd turn out right
I'm rememberin' the days that I was holdin' my head down
When people came around I always pretended to smile
But I knew
Deep in my heart
That I was slowly
Fallin apart
Some days
All I wanted
Was to hold my mother's hand
And hear her say
""Baby...
You're gonna make it""

It was easy for me
It took a while just to get down
Too many people just didn't believe
I'm remembering the sacrifices that I had to make
I would cry myself to sleep and say that it would be ok
But I knew
That if I prayed
That I would be on my way someday
Some times
All I wanted
Was to hear my father say
He would say
""Baby...
You're gonna make it
And I don't care what people say""

Hello baby, one day you're here 
And then you're gone

One day you're here and then you're gone
One day you're here and then you're gone
One day you're here and then you're gone
One day you're here and then you're gone

Listen everyday we complain about little ups and downs
We need to be thanking the Lord that we are still around
You'll never ever know when it is your time to go
And I know it's hurting so bad to lost people that we love
We got to use that example and try and straighten up
You got to live everyday as if your last one
See one minute you're here and then the next day you're gone

[Chorus: x4]

See lately I wake up in the morning wanting to cry
I bend my knees and I raise my head up into the sky
And sometimes I just can't fight my feelings I have inside I
See I always wish that you would be here right by my side
I'm glad I told you I love you so much before you died
I knew you couldn't and wouldn't be here for very long
See one minute you're here and the next day ya gone

[Chorus: x4]

Sometimes the world that we live in don't seem so fair or forgiving, 
These streets are hard to survive in cause all day you see people dying 
And I pray that one day we all see that life ain't promised to you 
And life ain't promised to me, 
Never forget this and be clear

Ashanti,"If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

Wanna keep you flawed with no dough
Pimpin' ain't easy
Trust me I know
When gangstas and hos
Go go go go go go together
Like chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, chedder and glamorous things
Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
'cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness
'cause I want the p-you-s-s-why
Got a lotta niggas wonderin' it ain't just I
Gotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
Shit, she probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy
Sip seraphin
Who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-n-see

If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

How many girls does it take to get to
Mack status
Player status
Pimps that get
Ya boy half rich fore we hit show bis
But show bis brought next level chicks
Pull up in them hot cars go and buy the whole bar nigga
I came from the dirt what you want me to say
I'm at the top of the world and life's a pussy buffet
And that's why I get m-I-a
Shut the game down so the busteras can't play
Hell yeah I splurge money
Hell yeah I act funny
Look at you like fuck you
All the shit I been through
It's a wonder why I'm still here
Said I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its mighty strange how you right back here

If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

I wonder why love is about money
And why you wanna take it all from me
Honey
My life is dark but its lovely
Crimes cars cribs ain't that right Kelly?
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Y'all bitches don't know
Money ain't a thing
Mami need a lil change
Girl I'm pitchin' quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New Benz's new Porsche's
New cases new lawyers
I'm becoming the infamous notorious rule
Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggas don't possess the heart that I do
And it's a wonder that I'm still here
Thought I was gone but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its kinda funny how you right back there

If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)

Why don't you holla at me man

If it ain't G's no I'm not there

Let's keep it real, I cant lie to y'all
My eyes are now something like binoculars
You put a Dollar on my hand, I'ma part of any plan
I'm focus, y'all niggas need to holla at me, man

He use to touch me, love me
Hug me, kiss me, hold me everyday
I never thought that I'd be finding out
That you gave your love away

Now how do you expect for me to stay
Wake up everyday with this on the brain
So I'ma say thanks and I'ma be on my way

Now I've got my head right
I can finally say good bye
To all the lies and the lonely nights
So focused

Now I've made up my mind
You were just a waste of time
But now I'm fine
'Cuz I'm focused you out of my life

I'm focus now
I'm focus now

I never thought that you would treat me
Like I'm just another girl
Thought, I was something to you
Something new

It's me and you against the world
But now I see this wasn't real
Just another game tryna play the field
So I'ma let go and Imma move on my own

I'm focus now
I'm focus now

Not concerned about
What nobody else gotta say
Just do what you do
'Cuz they gonna talk anyway

Yea, just stick with what you do
But remember to do it just for you
So don't even waste ya time
Keep it out cha mind and stay on ya grind

Now you all should know I'm focused
So boy don't try to tell me in that four door
Bentley, it's oh so pretty
They call me a gorilla when I'm on my grizzly
And I don't need a honey to be all that I can be

Last seen on the cover of King by the way name's Free
But y'all still gotta pay, those ones I'm making it just explains
That I'm focus and that's an under statement
And I don't know what someone was thinking

If I'm not mistaken, I heard his little heart was akin
He ain't sleeping the same the people done changed
You dead nigga, the reaper came and now sad nights
But we can have a bed fight, get the head right every night
Do what you supposed to do playa, I approach you 'cause
I'm so focus now nigga

Was searching for love unconditionally (yes I found it in you) 
I needed someone I can live my dreams through (and I found it in you)

There wasn't nobody just to take serious no
I use to hurt inside from a broken heart (you changed that)
You took the pieces and now my love increases oh yea

Your my everything,
And no one can compare
To the joy you bring

I love you 
I love the way you can always make me smile 
I love you 
And wherever I go you're always in my heart 

Nobody ever bring the joy you bring to me 
You make me feel the way you do 
And there ain't nothing like your love 
That sometimes makes you stop and think like 
Do I deserve such a love that can now move heaven and earth 
For my lovin' I could never surround my life without the things 
That you provide ever since you came into my life 
And it feels like my whole world is happening 
I can't stress how much I've been blessed 
See what you came and done to me 
You make my life complete 
I know sometimes I might forget 
That even when I don't say it 
You know that I mean it I

See I don't minding wake up everyday and see your face 
And wanting to lay inside your arms 
Cause there ain't nothing like your touch 
It's so good never seems like enough 
I didn't know that a love could grow and take over your soul 
Don't advise much more 
Only when you're apart if feels like living life is hard 
Your entire world just seems so dark 
Then it lights up 'cause you are my shining star 
And I don't know what I'd do without you 
See what you came and done to me 
You make my life complete 
I know sometimes I might forget 
But even when I don't say it 
You know that I mean it I

When you love somebody 
You can share everything 
Because you understand that you'll be right there

[Paul Wall] 
(Paul Wall, What It Do?)
It's the Houston Hard Hitter out the 713, it's ""The People's Champ,"" Paul Wall, yeah that's me.
Come take a ride with a playa out the 'Lone Star State'.
I'm just a hustler on the grind known for gettin' that cake.
I came up from the bottom, now I reside at the top.
I used to run away from cops, but now it's benzes I cop.
I used to post up on the block like Yao Ming in the paint, 
But now I pimp the parkin' lot, drivin' slow n sippin' drank.
With Ashanti on my side as I glide like Clyde, 
and nothin' less than 24 inches of chrome on my ride.
It's just somethin' bout the way I tip 4s and grip grain 
And got these boppers on the sidelines goin insane.
I got 'em moanin', my mackin' game is outta
Control, but I don't know if it's my looks or my big bank roll.
I'm 24 years old with my mouth all gold, my games cold and now the stories been told.
It's Paul Wall, baby (baby).

[Ashanti]
See I don't know why (why)
I'm feelin' just the way I do (do)
It's been a long time (time)
I thought that I was over you, but now you're coming around again
I'll be remembering what you said
I just can't take it, and I don't wanna go back, oh no.

[Chorus:]
What is a girl to do, if she's still on it, yes
If she done been there before with you, and now she don't want it, yeah
We've spent time and time again.
I just wish this thing would end.
Tell me, what is a girl to do, if she's still on it.

Whenever we talk (talk)
It feels like we had somethin' strong (strong)
And knowin' it's wrong, we tried to do this thing before, but when you coming real close to me
Bringing back all of them memories
I just can't fake it, but I don't wanna go back, oh no.

[Method Man] 
(uhn, yeah)
Auntie Ashanti's a problem, this track here's a problem.
The best thing rockin' since that cotton came to Harlem.
Meth darlin', I'm like that Hershey with the almonds, and I don't pay for nothin', but your pardon.
They start and I finish.
My animals is starvin' for dinners
Straight up menace, y'all don't get involved in my business. 
Look, I witness, spotted like a blemish, off gimmicks.
I'm 59/50 authentic.
Tilted with that NY on it.
There's money to be made, and I want it.
See, my palm been itchin' for the longest, so scratch that, paper like NASDAQ.
We laughed that life, roll the dice, get the cash back, I'm nice.
Plus, I got the juice, so I goes well with ice.
Been drug tested 3 times failed it twice.
Ashanti, you doin' it big, don't hurt 'em auntie.
Matter fact, you killin 'em girl, you're murder mami.

That you were the one that was meant for me

You manipulated me did it so creatively

Slowly took away from me, most of my integrity
Used to say that I could be
Everything and all you need
Started doing little things back then I couldn't see
But now that the rain is gone, yes I'm still here

And I see you for who you are
And you're not far from the devil babe
So I pack my heart and run away
So far away
Yes I'm still here

They use to tell me I was nothing and couldn't make it there
And so I made and they hated, 'cause I'm staying here
I put my trust into my faith everyday
With all the blood and sweat and tears
All the passion all the years

Now its crowds and love and cheers
No more crying no more fear
Used to cry myself to sleep thinking it could never be
Then I pick myself up and stood on my two feet
And now that the rain is gone yes I'm still here

That I thank you and I love you and
I will never place anyone above you,
Said I thank you and I love you,
And I never place no one above you
You have given me life and I just want you to know,
That your the reason im here today I will never let go,
To everything that we shared and nothing can compare
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you is what I'm saying.

I remember waking up early Monday mornings,
With my new dress and my new shoes, with the buckles on em
And you would kiss my face and say I love you baby,
And you would be right there to take all of my fear away.
And when he broke my heart you said it was his lost,
And not to think about about your better off with out him.
Remember when they said that I was never gonna make it,
You said it Shows and all you gotta do is go and take it.


Said I thank you and I love you,
And I will never ever place no one above you.
Said I thank you and I love you,
And I will never ever place no one above you.
See you have given me life and I just want you to know,
That your the reason I'm here today I will never let go,
To everything that we shared and nothing can compare
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you is what im saying. x2",Mother

Busta, bus, karma music

But What about my pride
You're never satisfied
You made me feel like I wasn't worth being by your side
Out of sacrifice, all of my damn time

You see me dying inside

Trying to see
Trying to find
Trying to be

Tried everything
But it just don't seem like it's enough
Hey baby, tried to believe
But I'm tired of being tired
Trying to love
Trying to fight
And I'm running out of tries
You're just no good

But everything that I think
And all the love that we make
It never should took place
I gave you my heart,
You've been trading I know
I should have let you go
Cause I'm back where I was before, baby

They'll be gone to trivial tribulations, yes
It don't matter how difficult it'll get
I love you regardless the situation
I see you drew a line in the sand
You ain't gotta leave me home, I hand
Every time I get up and I think about that we're feeling, I say is damn
I know at times I really hurt your head
I've been, I've stressed you out
And really get you fed up
I will never ever gonna let up
Unless it makes you happy for me to shut up
But I ain't shutting up, because I really wanna give it to you
I can't replace a feeling when we get up with each other
And I ain't trying to lose you
Now what you expect me to do, let's take a of trip with you to Honolulu
Come on, maybe we can spend some time together
Tried to make a better girl, I choose you
But if you admit it that we really done
I respect it, and baby I'm a go
But once I walk out the door,
I ain't never coming back baby
Hell no

If you on it like I'm on it then come on it, we gon' flaunt it
I'mma stand on top off the globe
I don't, I don't think you're ready, but this thing is dripping wet
Tell me what you trying to do
I could have you floating higher than what you got in that cup
I could tear that thing up, I could tear that thing up
Got you creeping up behind as you feeling up on mine
I wouldn't make it up

If you want it, I got it
That body on me, I got it
Then wake up, I got it
Think heavily and I got it
Got this body on lock and we can take it there
Anything that you'd think off, I got it, got it, take it to the air
I got it, don't know if you've got it
Bottles on a few bodies, spending millions like you got it
Cause you may never get another night like this
So push it to the limit if you about to stack the limit",I Got It
Ashanti,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world",Intro/Braveheart
Ashanti,"You were, all that I wanted
I fell in love with, all of your heart and your soul
From that moment, couldn't imagine
You ever hurting me, or mistreating my love

I should have known

These rivers of tear drops
These sharp pains in my heart
If this was the way that you loved
You never should have loved me

You never should have loved me
You never should have touched me
You never should have, never should have
Told me you loved me and you would never leave me

‘cause everything that you would do
To make me fall in love with you
Until you left and you made that mistake
Now I can't take it back if I wanted to (wanted to)

Balled up, laying in my bed
Thoughts racing through my head
How did we start out in love and end up here?

You said you loved me, and I believed you
Seems like you don't even mean what you say
These rivers of tear drops
These sharp pains in my heart
If this was the way that you loved
You never should have loved me

You never should have loved me
You never should have touched me
You never should have, never should have
Told me you loved me and you would never leave me

You were all that I wanted, I fell in love with
You ‘cause you loved me and I thought that you were ready
I thought that we were gonna be a family
And if you weren't then you should’ve let me
Keep all of my love to give, to someone worthy",Never Should Have
Ashanti,"Don't matter how much we fighting
Don't matter how much I cry and
It don't matter how much we try to leave each other alone
It won't last for long cause we got something they want
I'm sick when you're gone, waiting up 'til you get home

And I ain't gonna sleep 'til I see your face
Even though I'm mad I'mma fix your place
Ain't no other man that can take your place
Believe me

I ain't going nowhere, you ain't gotta worry
Ain't nobody perfect, but what we got is worth it

It don't matter if we hit had times
Cause I got your back and you got mine
And when the break comes I'mma be the main one
Holding you down through the storm
It won't last for long
I tell you I'mma leave, but I don't
I'm sick when you're gone and I be waiting up 'til you're getting home

And I ain't gonna sleep 'til I see your face
Even though I'm mad I'mma fix your place
Ain't no other man that can take your place
Believe me

I ain't going nowhere, you ain't gotta worry
Ain't nobody perfect, but what we got is worth it

I swear if you keep loving me like you loving me I'll keep loving you
Can't nobody do the thing you do
And even if we don't get along for a minute
Can't nobody else come and break this commitment
We ain't perfect, we worth it so I

I ain't going nowhere, you ain't gotta worry
Ain't nobody perfect, but what we got is worth it",Nowhere
Ashanti,"Time and time again I convince myself that we ain't over
Don't listen to my friends when they say I'm the fool cause they don't know love
Then you go and do some shit that proves them all right
Each and every time

I try to make it work
I try to make it work, but I just end up hurt
I tell you it's okay cause I don't wanna leave
But you make it so hard for me to stay so I run away

Every time I try to ignore it my mind just reminds me we're through
And even if you try to move on ain't another you'll find that'll do what I do
You lied to me so many times I just can't take no more
You're dragging my heart to the floor

I try to make it work
I try to make it work, but I just end up hurt
I tell you it's okay cause I don't wanna leave
But you make it so hard for me to stay so I run away

So here's what I wanna do, baby
Instead of me fighting with you, baby
I'll leave, I'mma let this shit free
Usually I don't run from nothing
Losing me with your lack of love hurts
I had enough

I try to make it work
I try to make it work, but I just end up hurt
I tell you it's okay cause I don't wanna leave
But you make it so hard for me to stay so I run away",Runaway
Ashanti,"Yeah, he's a walkin', talkin', living regret
I wish I never met him, never slept wid him
Never been by myself

If I would have known better
I would have never stayed together with you

He knows that I'm gone
And I ain't coming back
Wish I could be vindictive
So I can hurt him back

And I'm gon' make sure 
I'm drop dead gorgeous everytime he see me
So he wanted more

And I'mma make sure everything
Is successful

He fucking his ego
He lost when he let me go
I was probably the best thing
That happened to him, he know
Crazy, can't find, there ain't nothing like mine
Oh, man, you was just tough,
I guess he couldn't man his own balls
Gave you everything, all of me
All my heart, and I leave it, the start
These scars, these scars
You could have left the game
My heart is lame, nothing remains
Under these scars

Now, I can barely make a stand in here
Look in your face
Though you disgrace, to who we were and what we have
Know we was on it
Like Usher, we both had it bad
Everything you thought that we stood for
I'm taking all that back

He knows that I'm gone
And I ain't coming back
Wish I could be vindictive
So I can hurt him back

And I'm gon' make sure 
I'm drop dead gorgeous every time he see me
So he wanted more",Scars
Ashanti,"First off I'm a say it like this
I don't care where she's going 'cause I'm that, I'm that chick
I know I got what it takes
Ain't never been the hardest chick, I'm a particular make
And I ain't tryin to be happy with it
You gotta know how to pizazz, you got the business
You gotta let him know what he got on his hands
And if he tryin to forget better remind his ass
Yea, yea

You told me you love me
You told me you care
You said there'll be no more mistakes
Yea, you said
You said you were sorry
It won't happen again
And you came runnin back
'Cause you know

I got that oh
She can't love, she can't touch you like oh
She won't 'cause she won't fuck you like oh
She ain't got a body like mine
Face like mine, the brain not like mine
Oh no
She can't love, she can't touch you like oh
She won't 'cause she won't fuck you like oh
She ain't got a body like mine
Face like mine, the brain not like mine
Oh no

So you don't have to wait for a million times
Been through thick and thin and everything between the twines
Aye, said I've been holdin it down
You ain't gon find nobody built like me around
I will give you all the respect in the world
No need to keep me on a pedestal
And nobody never made you feel
Like I make you feel, let's keep it real
Yea, yea

You told me you love me
You told me you care
You said there'll be no more mistakes
Yea, you said
You said you were sorry
It won't happen again
And you came runnin back
Time to play

I got that oh
She can't love, she can't touch you like oh
She won't 'cause she won't fuck you like oh
She ain't got a body like mine
Face like mine, the brain not like mine
Oh no
She can't love, she can't touch you like oh
She won't 'cause she won't fuck you like oh
She ain't got a body like mine
Face like mine, the brain not like mine
Oh no",She Can't
Ashanti,"Oh yeah she was taking me over 
Oh yeah it was the start of the summer 
On warm June evenings 
She would come to my house 
Still in her school skirt 
And her summer blouse 
Talking too long as the night came on 
It was the best time of my life 
Her bee stung lips 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
The things she whispered 
With breathless sighs 
The summer air was soft and warm 
Her eyes were making silent demands 
And as her hair came undone in my hands 
Oh Yeah she was taking me over 
Oh Yeah it was the start of the summer 
Driving her home after midnight 
I felt so good everything was alright 
Her thoughts seemed lost in the night sky 
I remember everything 
I don't know why these things ever end 
I sometimes wish it was that summer again 
I still see her in my sleep 
And hear the sighing of the summer wind 
Still I don't regret one thing 
Oh Yeah she was taking me over 
Oh Yeah it was the start of the summer 
It felt just like it was the start of forever 
Oh Yeah it was the start of the summer",Oh Yeah
