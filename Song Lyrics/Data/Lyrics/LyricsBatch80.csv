"Earth, Wind & Fire","[Repeat: x5]
Got to get you into my life, into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there.
Another road where maybe
I could see another sign there.
Oh, then I suddenly see you.
Oh, and did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You know I want to hold you.
And had you gone you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you.
Ooh, you were meant to be near me.
Ooh, I really want for you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day.

[Chorus]
Got to get you into my life.
Got to get you in, got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life 
Got to get you into my life

Oh, then I suddenly see you.
Oh, and did I tell you that I need you
Every single day of my life?

[Chorus]

Got to get you in, got to get you in
Got to get you in, got to get you in
Into my life
Got to get you into my life",Got to Get You into My Life [Single Version]
"Earth, Wind & Fire","Challenges to the sky
Man took his first moon ride
Genius masterminds
Conquered changing times
And thought he'd done everything
When he walked on the moon, they sang

Here I am, down on earth
And baby for all it's worth
Meaning the world to me, lovin' you faithfully
We got a better song to sing
Let's make the love bells ring

Wanna take you on a moonwalk baby
Wanna take you on a magic carpet ride
Forever my love, you'll be mine

We can have a little moon talk baby
About our future plans together
In this life ole fashion love will make it right
Computers on the rise
Our feelings are synthesized
Makes it hard to feel
The touch of your love that's real

We never take time to love
We thing one love is not enough
Million stars in the sky
But one star that shines in my eyes,
it's you

Wanna take you on a moonwalk baby
Wanna take you on a magic carpet ride
Forever my love, you'll be mine

We can have a little moon talk baby
About our future plans together

Million stars in the sky
But one star that shines in my eyes

It's you, baby it's you

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get

Bringing life to the kingdom of doing

"Earth, Wind & Fire","Get away, let's leave today, let's get away! 
So you say you've tried but just can't find the measure
People around you are giving you pressure
Try to resist, all the bad things all around you
If you taste them, they will haunt you
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah, get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
What ya, what ya, what ya, what ya know?
Watch all the stars, they lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land

"Earth, Wind & Fire","Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

"Earth, Wind & Fire","{Look man! You're botherin' me G
I got shit to do right now, aight?
This is for De La Soul, you know what I'm sayin'?
Word up I got shit to do you test tube baby}

Check one two, check one two
De La Soul, is now back on the map
Long Island, is now back on the map
Good rap music, is now back on the map
Yo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav
And I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin' nowhere
Old school is here to stay boy

On the outskirts, of what works
Live those who go for broke, and merk to get merked
Live by the sword and die by the semi
Not part of my ways, but stays right in my
N Y mentality for me, to be the best
The current, the ones who weren't
Pressed, to confess lies over hot joints
To sell to all who wanna hear some
(Young Guns these days got fireproof eardrums)

They don't give a shit who's hot
Just long as you're not, pussy and be the would-be king
But once crowned, the same wanna pull you down
(And what makes the world go 'round)
And I be the world renowned wonder why
Wonderin' why you can't stand me?
Is it because I'm the main Jackson?
And y'all just Titos and Randys? Yes it is
Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last

At the same time, I want respect and cash
And a few paragraphs in them books
Tellin' you how us native tongues made hits with no hooks
Rapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88
No disrespect to Diddy, just settin' it straight
Instead of zig-zaggin', got a degree in raggin'
My daughter says I'm a teen, 'cause like a teen
My pants always saggin' and I walk with a bop
The sex part of my time, I walked from my pop
No longer on timey and was never on loud
But cooked rhymes that make the chefs of Wu proud
I'm top cloud to rain on your show
And still anything goes when it comes to hoes because

Make you shake like, sunshine, naked shoe was once mine
Had bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids
Fix your playground player or
Some kids'll come stomp in your sandbox
Swollen hands cocked back
No knives, no drama, no guns
No disrespectin' your seed of Ma Dukes
I puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff
Of these fricaseed raps on Carribean riffs
See last night's change was today's doe money
No time for your freestyles so roll money
No more whack albums with two joints
No more ballplayin' rappers who shoot ya two points
(No more G, 'cause I'm sick of your hip-hop!)

Your flows bore like seashores with no bitches
Switchhittin' niggaz will receive no pitches
No diamonds on the field, just keep the game real
Simple, see the God flows healthy
Wealth in the mind is like money in the bank
Exchange cash like thoughts in conversation
Thank you for your purchases, we doe out
And roll out the Kool-Aid, come and crop to see us pimp strut

And pantyhose your whole style and start runnin' it
You dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello
The mush in your room son, we stay portobello
Can't settle for the same picket white fence

Still push the truck with the factories pa

A few short words, and whaddya know?
Oh, whaddya know? He comes

Down, like water, fresh out the clouds clown
Drown you like terrible weather
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon
Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin'

To all, rise and shine, give God the glory
I already give a percent of mine to Bert and Cory
And still got bills and employees to pay
So excuse me Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days

My ways of control is hard to swallow
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind
Sorry to disappoint, but dis joint's mine
Display your indie but say no

More or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo
To the dirt and edit the clip and lost Kano
My mens wear problems like Timbs
See it all in they face, ask Mase, he got wars to win

Scores to settle, crews to crush
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile
It's Long Isle y'all, longevity sustainin' my celebrity status
From AM to PM, you see him on file y'all

I was told to step righteous, so when it's done
Everyone will say I stepped right
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop
shinin' his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light

A few short words, and whaddya know?
Oh, whaddya know? He comes

Aiyyo, I'm up against these walls, here's my back stiff straight up
Dazzle and razzlin' broads like I'm little Juan Magic
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop
Top drama every time these commas don't drop

Pop spots like lint on your shirt, the net worth
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six
I circumcise the track, you just a dick

Overlapped and hooded
Skin repeated like Stutterin' John
I repeat like yesterday, it don't stop
George of this poor life pop, put to Scarlet
In a place she believes, much better than your lies

She say she lookin' better in my eyes, bullshit
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin' to fuck
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby
I tried to speak my piece in court but Judge Mills paused me

Bifocusedly die hopeless sometimes
Yo cry your poker face, you oughta try it one time
When God is an non pos', you stand to download
Demanded like slaves on trial, we want free

Man cock aim ready, it's time you MC
So you rappers bust bee-bee guns, graffiti runs
Through my veins since cable with the wired remote
Woodgrainin' like you wired his float

C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul
We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old
Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow
A group of kids so original, you heard?

C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul
We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old
Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow
A group of kids so original

Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners who got 'em
We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew, and his whack dancers
Bitin' is forbidden pah, pay that tax
And don't you ever look at us funny, boy, we'll bring rap back

And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in
For you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn
Hula hoop all bitches crew full with brand new Keds

Cutmaster kill 'em, make sure we cut classics
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the PA
And just lay whooptay, whooptay?

Use the ruse, sport beads and snatch a dude's toupee
Since tunin' into T-La Rock'n AJ
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed like a glass of OJ
Girls you can go cruising' in my OJ

In hope, to feel safe and sound

In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,

Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink

When we discovered romance, like we never knew.
My head was in the clouds, My heart went crazy too,
And madly I said: ""I love you.""

Too soon I heard you say:
""This dream is for a day""
That's Portugal and love in April!
And when the showers fell,
Those tears I know so well,
They told me it was spring fooling me.

Eartha Kitt,"I've been through clouds and stormy skies
On different worlds, all filled with lives
I've traveled through the steams of lovers
And wiped my tears upon their covers
I've lived a life of rogue and queen
And died my hair to fit the scene
I've had my ups, I've had my downs
And sipped champagne with worldly crowns
I've been as honest as I could
And ashamed, the shame that knows I should
I've been loved and I've been lied to
And found a few shoulders I could cry to
And all those years I thought life naughty, ah-hah
Should make me beautiful at forty

For life's not been so bad to take
For now I've cut life's golden cake
Into a million tiny squares
And with each piece recall the years
The taste of life has not been so bad
Between the tears and joys I've had
But with some good and a little singing
She always allowed me to get a grin
And all those years I've spent on my youth
Thinking knowledge brought the truth
I know life has her games to play
And puzzles it, crackling play
So, graves are dug and wars are lost
But life goes on at any cost

I do think life has made me wiser
So there is no reason to disguise her
Even tried to rearrange her
She has been fair, I would not change her, hah-hum
She presents me life so simply
In a cup that's almost empty
With a little wine to tease me
But not enough to really please me
And if I drink, and let her take me
She is wise enough to wake me
But only after dreams and visions
Allowing me to see these decisions, ah-hah
All those years I thought life naughty
She made me beautiful at forty",Life Made Me Beautiful at Forty

And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway

I did it my way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way.

I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Eartha Kitt,"I lost myself on a cool damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Like my love

Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn’t that she, coming to me, nearly here

Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where’s my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Where’s my love

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy
Isn’t that she, or am I just going crazy, dear

Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready, for my love

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.",I Wish You Love
Eartha Kitt,"The one who has me for his own
Is on the town and I'm alone;
In his blue suit and his new tie
He slammed the door without goodbye!

Tonight my eyes are jealous green,
Tonight I'm melancholy mean!
He meets, in secret rendezvous,
Some dame to tell his troubles to,
The heel!

He'll promise her most anything,
A sable coat, a diamond ring;
She'll find him out when it's too late,
And all she gets will be a date!

But while the dawn's a distant thing,
In his embrace her heart will sing;
Her dizzy head will spin with lies,
And all too soon a woman cries,
""The heel!"".

The neon lights that flash below
Ignite my room with double glow;
And in the room I hear a laugh,
It's coming from his photograph!

I ring my hands and walk the floor,
And swear to even up the score!
For where a kitten cried tonight,
A panther waits to claw and bite
The heel!

I dare not play my radio,
One more complaint and out I go!
I'm sick of playing solitaire,
The ace of spades is everywhere!

There'll be no sleep for me tonight,
The sheep I count are never white!
They all turn out to be jet black,
And who's the leader of the pack?
The heel!

At dawn I know he'll stagger in,
Demanding coffee black as sin,
And as I take it from the tin,
I slip a little powder in!

He'll look at me and start to cry,
And cross his heart and hope to die!
And mumble ""I know how you feel,
But I've been on a business deal!"",
The heel!

Then as the pot begins to perk,
I know my plan will never work!
But when he starts to drink it up,
I'll grab his hand and break the cup!

It's only jealousy, I know,
That brought my thinking down so low!
Why must I wait for him and grieve?
Why don't I just pack up and leave
The heel?!

But no he's really on the stair,
I'll try to act like I don't care!
For in my heart's arithmetic
I find it takes two heels to click!

We're in a web of love and hate,
Where it will end is up to fate!
I'll let him have his little fling;
I'll be the chewing gum that clings
To the heel!

Boom boom - before she blows
Not bothered about religion
Not bothered about belief
in the house of love - everybody's free

Everybody in the house of love ...

Born to live - we live to die
Our eyes can't see they can only cry
But our mother's tired of crying she's had enough
She's gotta surely blow 'cos we're giving up
Build the house oflove while we've got the time
Too many bombs in the world it's like a living mine
The house of love is what we must build
The past won't last
If the present is killed

Like comets they collide

He said, I can tell you something 'bout most anything

[Chorus]
But don't ask me about a woman
All I know is boy they're something
They're tender and they're tough
Can break it down and lift you up
Don't ask me about a woman
That's some complicated stuff
They ain't made to figure out
They're just made to love

He said, boy I've lived nearly eighty years
There's a lot of know how, between these ears
But when it comes to your grandma
I'm still your age
It took me a long, long time to learn
Loving a woman is full of left turns
The more they change, the more they stay the same
Son, it's been that way since the beginning of time
We're behind the wheel but just along for the ride

[Chorus]

Fast forward ten years it's Saturday night
She's changed three times, says her hair ain't right
My mind reels back to the time and place
When I heard my grandpa say

Don't ask me about a woman
Boy, that's some complicated stuff
They ain't made to figure out
They're just made to love
Now I know what he's talkin' about
They're just made to love",Don't Ask Me About a Woman

Easton Corbin,"It was Sunday afternoon, I was sunk in my recliner
Football game was on Tampa Bay and Carolina
I wasn't payin' much attention
The volume down, not watchin' it at all
This house was like an ice box, had all the curtains drawn
I had it more like a hotel room and less like a home
It's been so quiet around here lately
I wasn't thinkin' anyone would call

Let alone you
All the way from Dallas
Out of the blue
Sayin' that you missed us
And time and distance made you see
You were lost without me
How did you know
I'd finally hit the bottom
An all time low
Was suddenly forgotten
The sound of your voice on the line
Made fate turn circles on a dime
Just when I thought I'd never find somebody new
Let alone you

Now here I am at the baggage claim
A nervous wreck waitin' on your plane
Wringin' my hands, checkin' my watch
I never dreamed forty-eight hours ago
I'd be standin' here waitin' on
Anyone, no not anyone

Let alone you
All the way from Dallas
Out of the blue
Sayin' that you missed us
And time and distance made you see
You were lost without me
How did you know
I'd finally hit the bottom
An all time low

Easton Corbin,"Stepped off the plane down in Cabo
Just meaning to stay for a week
I got a funny sensation about this vacation
The second the sand hit my feet
Taxi driver took my two bags
He saw me looking at my watch
He said, you won't need that here cause time disappears
In paradise there ain't no clocks

You got a lot to learn about livin'
It's a different world down here
Our biggest problem's decidin' what fish
We're fryin'
Does it go with tequila or beer

He dropped me off at the hotel
I took a u-turn into the bar
I sat down on a stool out by the pool
Next to a lady smoking a Cuban cigar
I ordered a drink and took out my cell phone
I tried to make a call to L.A.
Dang thing wouldn't work, I started to curse
Bartender said, I bet it can wait

You got a lot to learn about livin'
It's a different world down here
Our biggest problem's decidin' what fish
We're fryin'
Does it go with tequila or beer

I, yi, yi, change is in the air
Now, I, yi, yi, ain't got a care

Six months later, I'm driving a taxi
I got a Hawaiian shirt and a tan
Pick up some guy in a Brooks Brothers tie
I say, it's time to loosen up man

You got a lot to learn about livin'
It's a different world down here
Our biggest problem's decidin' what fish
We're fryin'

Easton Corbin,"Someday when I'm old
I'll pull up to the store
And park wherever the hell I want to
I'll buy a box of Moon Pies
And flirt with the cashier
Yeah, like I was still twenty-two

I'll bitch about eighteen dollars for a
Gallon of gas
Down at the Texaco
Someday when I'm old

Yeah, someday when I'm old
I'll keep chewing gum in my front pocket
And cold Dr. Pepper in the fridge
I'll let my daughter get mad
Say I'm ruining their supper
When I give that stuff to my grandkids

And I realize that some things,
They just don't matter
And how fast it all goes
Someday when I'm old

That clock just starts ticking
Oh, the day that you're born
And no matter how much time you get
You always want more

Someday when I'm old
I'll be the only one
Who remembers you young and beautiful
Your dark hair falling on that pillowcase
All the secrets we shared, all the
Love that we made

And I'll hold onto those precious moments
Like pieces of gold

Mediocre band playin'
Old familiar songs, hit after hit

Two Bubba's standin' toe to toe about to get it on

I just crawled in my truck
Set my mind on Miami

Ain't a man deserves to hurt like this
It's a lonely place, it sure is
Guess I never really knew the blues
Ever got this far from Memphis

All the night life and the beaches
Couldn't soothe my achin' soul
And how I ended up in Key West

Is to trade this truck for a boat

I ain't even had one beer
This sweet thing's got me buzzing
From whispering in my ear

Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best

And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road

Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say ""girl take it easy""
She laughs, says ""it'll be fine""
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines

Yeah I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
And all over the road

Something 'bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go

And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go

Man this whole crazy life is moving way to fast

I wanna dance real slow
Put your arms around me
Let me hold you close
Girl I wanna hear you tell me
Don't let go
I love it when we dance real slow

We can go out honky-tonking or stay here where no one's watching, me and you
Light a candle in the kitchen, I can clear a spot out if you want me to. Put on a record, find a station on the radio
If it's too rocking all we gotta do is close our eyes and

Dance real slow
Put your arms around me
Let me hold you close

Easton Corbin,"She was workin' a summer job
Sellin' t-shirts towels and sunblock
A Midwest girl who couldn't live without the beach
I was a local boy who worked next door
Never seen a smile like hers before
She put her feet up on the dash of my old Jeep
It was henna tattoos tank tops and ray bans
And hearts drawn in the sand

Cause summer flings ain't meant to last
They always burn too hot too fast
Ya don't talk about it cause you both understand
Ya get drunk on those boardwalk days
That pretty buzzed look on her face
And it fades away just like a seaside tan
And hearts drawn in the sand

Sit out on the St. Johns pier
She drank wine and I drank beer
And when we saw a boat light blink we'd make a wish
Then we'd take a walk where the waves hit your feet
She'd lean right in close to me
And I could taste the sun and salt on her lips
And that day would wash away when the tide came in
Like hearts drawn in the sand

Oh summer flings ain't meant to last
They always burn too hot too fast
You don't talk about it cause you both understand
You get drunk on those boardwalk days
And that pretty buzzed look on her face
And it fades away just like a seaside tan
And hearts drawn in the sand

I think of you and it all comes rushing back
All the good times that we've had, I think of you
I know you're better off where you're at
And there's nothing I can do to change all that

When I wake up in the morning and before I fall asleep, I think of you
When I hear that song, oh I can't help but smile and think of you
Wonder if it makes you think about me too

I don't like to use this kinda language
'Round a lady

But damn girl you're looking good from where I am girl
And if I could I would take your pretty hand in mine
This ain't just a pick up line
Damn girl what I wouldn't do to be your man girl
If you only knew what you're doing to this heart of mine
Only two words come to mind
Damn girl

No we don't have to drink at all
We can just sit here and talk all night long
We can take it on the floor
We can take it out the door girl, your call
It don't matter what we do
As long as I can do it with you

Damn girl you're looking good from where I am girl
And if I could I would take your pretty hand in mine
This ain't just a pick up line
Damn girl what I wouldn't do to be your man girl
If you only knew what you're doing to this heart of mine
Only two words come to mind

Oh damn girl you're looking fine from where I am girl
We lost track of time and now we're watching
That ol' sun come up from the hood of my old truck

A couple cold Coronas and four bare feet
And off in the distance you can just see 'em big boats dance
There's some Buffet coming out of the coconut hut
I guess some of them boys are catching a buzz
And some Joe with a pick-up truck stuck in the sand
And Jenny's got on that little teeny two-piece bikini I bought her

Draw blood with Four-Four snubs

Drain 'em out, set up for the wet up, bang 'em out

Where all the L puffin' niggas dwell
And fell 'cause of a loss of blood cells
Bullet shells, glass is shattered
Shit gets torn and tattered
Niggas brains is splattered on sewage drains when they be goin' at it
Static over addicts, revolvers and automatics 
It's illmatic how I seen one catch two in the cabbage
From an initial, official shiny nickel played pistols
Sparklin' like crystals, launchin' missiles
Domes get blown like whistles
Ain't no jokin', niggas will leave you and your Momma soakin'
And smokin' and blown open
Bodies found in Hoboken
Kids comittin' murder after murder
Shit is real so I feel for the ones that don't pack steel and burners
Bodies be droppin' down around Queens

Stay stackin' papes, plus my Fam flip cakes
While some of us rap, other fellas flip 'caine
Rock big chains, what ya'll think this a game?
Murder incorp. slash open cases with cartels
We do things that make the Mob tell
The way we go outta state and flip more cakes then Carvel
Ya'll play the cut, and watch this lil' nigga prevail

I pay ya'll no mind, but violate and speak to the Nine

That bitch roll of you smackin 'em was just insane (sucker ass)
You got snitch niggaz that run back, and crush your name
You hustle a lot, just like a rat, from the parkin lot
Bust a shot - you kickin raps?  Naw stop
What you don't want me to gave I already got
Property acres the lab the Ac' plus the queen spot
Once you see me drop this 100, miles and running
Blow me out the spot, not, but quite cunning
You're dumb and, young and restless, I'm makin you wait
I was givin you time to get the last one straight
Most of ya over, while I celebrate, like Sammy Sosa
Toast with Griff the Nation, soul survivor 'til it's over
I'm Hot like 97, the year's ninety-nine
Return like Makaveli but still hard to find
It's a conquest, so hard, but yet they still try
to defeat this black brother comin out of Bed-Stuy
I rebuke you like a devil, my head to the sky
That's cute, but not forever, don't ask why

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
It's now or never - if you down, whatever
If not, stash your frown, pass ground forever
Mo Bee pound for pound, the sound is better
Mo beats in class clowns, no time for ghetto

It's now or never

Yo, you suckers is playin' a role
You niggaz is out of control
This world could swallow you whole
The evil could snatch your soul


Yo nigga put the gun away, or you get done away
If not today there'll be a bullet for you one day
The gun play used to be the forte
As a youth, bustin' shots off the roof for horseplay
But once you get a glimpse of the shots, flyin' at you
You think about the possibility of dying and that's true
You won't be stressin' the gun my son
You'll be askin' the Lord for a chance, just one
Trials and tribulations, critical situations
Read it in revelations, check the configuration
They poison our population no matter your occupation
No matter your congregation, this is a troubled nation

[Chorus x2] 

I've seen the worst of the worst, I've seen the best of the best
Seems like the weight of the world is ridin' on my chest
A universal pain, my soul has absorbed
Don't respect no phonies, don't pay attention to frauds
The Lord only knows the depths of my sorrow
And some don't follow because their brains are hollow
So swallow these words and observe the signs
Yo turbulent times, are disturbin' the minds
of the youth, and ghetto life, is the proof
The only skills that's taught, is how to cock and to shoot
Poverty crack guns, hustlers stack ones
Take money is the motto cause we all lack funds

[Chorus x2] 

Nobody owes you nuttin' so you better get yours
My desire flows like sweat, from my open pores
My sores heal, but still the scars remain
A lot of niggaz gonna feel, much more pain
But yo I guess that's life, it don't make things right
Been through a lot of fights, cause ignorance makes me uptight
And cats be thinkin', that us rappers ain't real
And other cats be thinkin' street life is all about steel
Some of this may be, but yo, look in my face
Cause can't none of why'all bitches ever stand in my place
Pop the Remi, some for L, Tah, 'Pac and Biggie
Really? Niggaz want to stop the jiggy?
Fuck a willie, still you know you gots to dig me
The city, rotten to the core, no pity
The crowds roar, scavengers are out to get me
I want to live, I'm tryin' hard to stay positive

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired

When all the citizens retire to take their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultra-violet rays

The natives grieve when the White Men leave their huts
Because they're obviously....definitely....Nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one
But Englishmen detest-a siesta

In the Philippines they have lovely screens to protect you from the glare
In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englismen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a 
tree

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth

The English garb of the English Sahib merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run

There’s nothing serious
Enough for this

It’s easy to count your blessing
It’s easy to soldier on
It’s easy to make the best of the bad situation
It’s easy for me to smile and say hold on

There’s nothing serious
Enough for this for this
There’s nothing serious
Enough to lose tomorrow

I wish for a choir of angels
I wish for a second chance
I wish for an opportunity to have said something simple like don’t leave
Or to catch you at the last time of asking

There’s nothing serious
Enough for this for this
There is nothing serious
Enough to lose tomorrow",Saddest Song

This I understand, too well
Failed to make you mine
Heart attack in line tastes
A thousand broken hearts
Littering your path, through here
Oh tell me that you lied
Say you never think, of, me

But tonight, before you sleep
There will be a you and me
And I hope I'm on your mind

Its worn away in time
The fingerprints are mine, still show
This chance as good as blown
I don't wanna be alone, tonight

You kept me hanging all these years

So why are you holding onto misery?
Don't you see there's nothing left to fear
Cos if you're chewing something ugly, just spit it out
When you come back I won't be here

Dear leader I am but a nothingness
But you're good at looking all sincere
But you've been getting everything you want for long enough
When you come back I won't be here

There are no prizes here for tolerance
We cannot all be insignificant
And if they still don't understand I'll just spell it out
When you come back I won't be here

So long 
You have been here

So long

Don’t try and explain to me 
How the truth wore you down 
And how the insecure strain to be 
In the best seats in town 
For a future so grey to me 
Guess I won’t see you there

Eater,"Standin' on a corner,
Suitcase in my hand.
Jack's in his car, says to Jane, who's in her vest,
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Eazy-E,"Good evening, and welcome to eazy's playhouse
You stupid muthafucka

Now that you got the album
What the fuck are you gonna do with it
Bitch

Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it, and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
'cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the hoes are attracted
Because when I'm on hard, my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old, I was a nut
Now I need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'cause I do a check, nut 1 nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it I'm still talkin' shit

I told you that nigga was crazy
E boy, that's my boy, godamnit

I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's sharon and the other one shaun
I want to nut but which one do I want?
Shaun said eazy let me fuck you blind
And sharon said e I want to blow your mind
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the
Other pussy put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Yeah that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
Here's what I'm gonna put inside
Grab it like a rabbit, grab it let's work it
But I won't love you when I'm done I'd still be talkin' shit ...

That boy'z good
Yeah that boy's good
That mothafucka'z talkin' all kinds of shit
I used to get pussy like eazy eric every day
You're mothafuckin' lyin'
How you know I'm mothafuckin' lyin'?
You're lyin', your dick can't get hard ..
Oh, suck my dick mothafucka
Nigga you lied
Who you're talkin' to..?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut that shit
Hey yo yella boy! wantcha rewind it!

Niggas don't see I'm a 100% legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho'
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move, to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by eazy""
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
Oi might be a woman-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about?
All of ya'll can just suck my dick
You can quote me now cause I'm still talkin' shit

The boy's good, I told you the boy's good
The nigga has talent
You don't know a damn thing
Yeah, I like that part, bring that shit back one more time, maestro
That's that old z.z. hill, huh?
I can do the mashed potato nigga, what can you do?
I can do the bugaloo

You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?
We haven't spotted them yet
But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity

A 100 miles and runnin
Mc Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a muther f**ker and it's done in.
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a f**k.
Chances are usually not good
Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood.
And getting' jacked by the you-know-who.
When in a black and white the capacity is two.
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers. Now wearin' 
my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, muther f**kers. They're out to take our heads 
for what we said in the past. Point blank - they can kizz my black azz. I 
didn't stutter when I said ""f**k tha police"". Cause it's hard for a nigga to 
get peace. Now it's broken and can't be fixed. Cause police and little black 
niggas don't mix so 
Now I'm creepin'
Through the fall. Runnin' Like a team. Well, see, I might have slayed y'all. So 
for now pack the gun and Hold it in the air. ?cause mc ren has a 100 miles of 
runnin

""Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run.""
""FBI sources tell us that the four are headed""
""100 miles to their home base, Compton.""

Lend me a muther f**kin' ear.
So I can tell you why...

Runnin' With my brothers, headed for the home base.
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced.
The road ahead goes on and on.
The shit is getting' longer than the muther f**kin' marathon. Runnin' on but 
never runnin' out. Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out. 
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do. But nobody's pickin' up a nigga witta 
attitude. 
Confused. Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose. One of the few who's been 
accused and abused Of the crime of poisonin' young minds. But you don't know 
shit til you been in my shoes. And Dre is back from the c-p-t. Droppin' some 
shit that's d-o-p-e. So f**k the p-o-l-i-c-e! And any muther f**ker that 
disagrees. Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass. 'cause I'm a nigga known for 
havin' a notorious past. My mind was slick - my temper was too quick. Now the 
FBI's all over my dick.

Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock. That's 
when the e jumped off the startin' block. A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a 
long stretch. A little sprintin' muther f**ker that they won't catch. Yeah, 
back to Compton again. Yo, it's either that or the federal pen. 'cause niggas 
been runnin' since beginning of time. Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my 
muther f**kin' mind. Runnin' like I just don't care. Compton's 50 miles but, 
yo, I'm ma get there. Archin my back and on a straight rough. Just like Carl

Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm A straight up nigga that's done

This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton.
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you: ""nowhere to run 
to, baby. Nowhere to hide."" Good luck brothers.

Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused.
I know it was a set-up.
So now I'm gonna get up.
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up.
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong.
They got everybody singin' my ""f**k tha police"" song.
And while they treat my group like dirt,
Their whole f**kin' family is wearin' our t-shirts.
So I'mma run til I can't run no more.
'cause it's time for mc ren to settle the score.
I got a urge to kick down doors.
At my grave like a slave even if the ren calls.

Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherf**ker's are ridin'
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.
The number's even - now I'm leavin'.
We're never getting' took by a bitch with a weave in.
Her and the troops are right behind me.
But they're so f**kin' stupid, they'll never find me.

One more mile to go through the dark streets.
Runnin' like a mutherf**ker on my own two feet.
But you know I never stumble or lag last.
I'm almost home so I better haul ass.
Tearin' up everything in sight.
It's a little crazy mutherf**ker dodging the searchlight.
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherf**kers goin' crazy with
A 100 miles of runnin'
Stop! stop! stop! stop!

Eazy-E,"Yo man I don't think they heard you
Why don't you tell 'em what ya name is

My name is eazy yeah this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is eazy or just call me e
But it doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I could get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope
If the rhyme I'm dispayin'
And the beat that's playin'
Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the ruthless p.o.w.
'Cause eazy's doin it compton style
That's the city and you say you could get some
Yo it's eazy-er said than dunn.

Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

Now it's easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the E-a-z-why-e comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third demention
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the e on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
'Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on ruthless and that's my label
To get the money, the women, and co bust the fat cable's
Boy, master rhymers of toys
I mean straight while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gonna diss me if ya don't even know me

Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin ya cap
To let ya know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall be dunn

Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

Radio jams are the part of the cycle
Eazy-er said than dunn yeah that's the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know
(M.C. ren: but would if she's lucky)
Eazy come eazy go
Don't ask to battle me home boy what's that
You want to battle me boy ya better be strapped
'Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
Now that's what I'm sayin'
Sevy thought that I was born in '73
Now everybody want's to know the a-g-e
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only fifteen
The fellaz would annoy me
The ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do
I wishin' nothin' lady's do
'Cause the ladyz I luv 'em
Nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real eazy cause others be fakin'
Tryin' to game fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some
Yo home boy its eazy-er said than dunn.

Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!",Eazy-Er Said Than Dunn

Bitch, step back and don't try to jack

No, hoe but you can get my duck sick...

But let me finish my story as I was sayin'
I told you lil locs ain't playin'
Gotta roll with the bunches
can't help the travellin' bunches
Now ain't that somethin'
Just a case a few niggaz try to trip
Bone-out, put on my skimask
And come back blastin'
Cause niggaz my height don't fight
My name is Eazy-E
You're mothafuckin' right
They must to thought I was a busta
Wearin' your bullet-proof vest
So what's next?
I got my nine fitted up with deadline
And don't let me hit the wetbomb
So watcha want to do?
The red, white and blue, I got some for you too
Cause it gonna be on when i'm kickin' down my dough
So say hello to my new 44...

I'm a type of nigga...
That smokes mothafuckaz...
That smokes mothafuckaz...
I don't give a fuck fuck...
Smoke mothafuckaz...
I'ma smoke mothafuckaz...
Cause I'm the ""E""

So you can kiss my black ass
Fuck the white house, it ain't my house
So you can burn the mothafucka down for all I care
Cause t-shirts and khakies is all I wear
I'm from the city where they show no pitty
For a punk ass mark in the park
Blow his brains out, stuck him in the bushes
Take his gat, leave his ass for the rats
And let me hit that cisco, I got a 187 on my pistol
Warrant by the LAPD
Key for puttin' in work out my trade
Because the president never simp
One dumb dog to my residents
I'm goin' crazy like 1980
I need my ends, fuck you, pay me
Or I'ma have to get the strap
My nutty O.G. buddy Big Black
I make you shit in your pants
And shake like jelly
So tell off my homie said hello...

I'm a type of nigga...
That smoke mothafuckaz... 
That smoke mothafuckaz...
I don't give a fuck...
Smoke mothafuckaz...
Smoke mothafuckaz...
Like it ain't no thang...

You can't check a checker
But when you want to try let me know
I got the strecher on stand-by
Starvin' for a nigga like you
The things is much bigger 
Than the trigger
So I can show how to put in work:
The Ruthless-network drive-by experts
Straight outta compton kickin' up dust
The place where guns don't get a change to rust
I warned them and they still approached me
Now I got two more golf-hats for my trophy
I got a brand new trend, it's killin' men
Who is that? That's my little friend...

I don't give a fuck...
I don't give a fuck...
I don't give a fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck...
I don't give a fuck...
I don't give a fuck...

Eazy-E,"We're sitting here with Eazy E
Believe that 
How are you doing?
All right
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?

Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin' , I specialized in gankin
whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangster havin fun)
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin, and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
(Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?)
Hell no! Just trippin' off eight-ball
And girls ain't  nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
out anybody gettin' on my nerves 
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
and if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" somebody?

Wait for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Look then all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
Cause you know it's no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get, front and center
or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shht, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key, and I flee
out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall don't fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?

Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two hundred eleven ?
Yeah

There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
(Were you slick?)
Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
so he came out to test his stamina
against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I ran
back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it"" 
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
(Is all that true ?)
I don't lie
You see I'm not mister nice guy

Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?

Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my hit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
thought, and damn so what?

Stoppin at a light on the latenight
Fire up a phillie blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin at a burger stand
And in my mind all I'm thinkin is a murder plan
Creepin through the drive through kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the .4
Yo , smokin on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin I'm about to lay their ass down
Reach for them fools make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the nigga's dome now he's sleeps
One shot to the top body flopped on the seat
Peep , I dumped on the lil' skinny passenger 
A bitch is screamin in a rage so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about 5 blocks

I knew this muthaphukka named Louie
Every day the nigga talk shit but today he tried to do me
He rolled down my block with a pistol and a stare
a black khaki suit and dooky brades in his hair
The muthaphukka think I'm slippin
But I got my gat and a 40 and I'm sippin
Waitin for the fool to get out the car
The stupid muthaphukka thinks I'm a star
But I'm not, I'm the type that kick the niggaz ass
Fast ! Eazy E's a nigga that'll blast
Hold up, wait, the nigga started to load his gat
I grabbed my bat and ran around the back yo
He's at my window, thinkin I'm playin Nintendo
But the stupid nigga don't know I'm behind him so
he dropped the gat like a stupid muthaphukka
So I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger

She's butt-naked with my dick in her hand, yo

nigga behind the car, and he was duckin
So I told the bitch to hold on [Hold on]
You stupid bitch, put yo muthaphukkin clothes on
I wonder if this nigga's tryin a jack me
Coz I ain't got my gat with me
Shit, the nigga started runnin up fast
I thought he was gonna blast, so I hid behind her ass
She started howlin out ""wait"", I banked her in the face
But the punk nigga pulled out [?? mace ??]
He asked the stupid bitch did I mug her
So I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger

[CHORUS]

I'm a muthaphukkin psycho and I don't give a fuck about'em
I kill the nigga and cut off his dick, so you know I got'em
coz [?? huh ??] ate his brain, left the nigga for dead
Now it's a gallon of blood, drippin from under his bed
[Oh, no ! What happened to my lover ???]
Bitch I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger
Bitch tried to call the cops, fuck that
I gotta take the girl out with my muthaphukkin bat
Coz I ain't doin 10 in the pen
for a bitch and her dead-ass boyfriend
So...I gotta kill the ho
I'm reachin for my weapon slow
That's when I notice some nigga standin by the door
The little nigga sayin ""don't kill my mother"", so

Eberhard Schoener,"San Francisco, July 27
A 40 year-old accountant had lost his bid to collect 38 dollars in damages from a cocktail waitress
Who broke a date with him

Judge Richard Figoney ruled yesterday in small claims court against Tom Hosley
Who sought the money from Alison Cheeselet, 31
because she had backed out on a date to accompany him to the theater
Mr. Hosley said he drove 35 miles from his home in Campbell to San Francisco
To pick up Ms. Cheeslet and was upset that she had not called him before he left home to tell him the date was off

Judge, explaining his decision, said:
""The promise to engage in a social relationship for one evening in exchange for affection and all one evening at the theater
is an impossible [?]
[?] involving a contract.""

Mr. Hosley had presented the cardboard
broken heart at the theater
And Judge Figoney took note of it in his opinion

Quintilia
in the first century A.D.
observed that faint hopes are often like the dreams that waltz away

Above the Rhine
The clouds gripped of the drifting mists
It was useless

[Chorus: x2]
And who over the ruins of his life
Pursued its fleeting, fluttering significance
While he suffered its seeming less meaninglessness
And lived in seeming madness

And who walked in secret the last turn of the labyrinth
Ruination!

The golden trail was blazed
And I was reminded
Of the eternal, of ship men and their stars
For a day I could breath once more and live
And face existence
Without the need to suffer torment,
Fear, or shame

Eberhard Weber,"Well I've strolled across some dance floors filled with girls all dressed in red 
Pulled my foot from my mouth, answer back the things i've said. 
Wander through the valley of the shadow of the dead 
Stumbled on this old sun dial, then these words I read.
I only count the sunny hours, brightest hours of day. 
I never count the gloomy hours I let them slip away. And I realize I'm away.

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
I'm alright ya'all. 
Alright y'all. 
Ya want to be alright you gotta walk tall.

I'm alright y'all. 
Alright y'all. 

Ya want to be alright you gotta walk tall. 
Well I woke up in to many beds with girls I didn't know. 
I seen lots of brothers at top and I watched them come & go, 
Tell me why I'm not dead with them in the valley down below. 

I give thanks everyday for these words they save my soul. 
I only count the sunny hours, brightest hours of day. 
I never count the gloomy hours I let them slip away. And I realize I'm away.

That the trouble's gonna come in all shapes and sizes 
Well ya gotta stay strong don't let your knees buckle

With rags around her feet
Clutching ancient shopping bags
Destitutions beat
Burned out like a frozen matchstick
Screaming at the wall
A helpless hungry lady
With no friends to call
Chorus:
I wonder
Where she goes when the night falls
What thunder
Has made us deaf to her calls?
Bag lady...
Oh gloveless, shattered frailty
The damp wind bites her hands
She shuffles by a restaurant
Towards their garbage cans
She eats the rotten refuse
Like vermin on the dead
Screaming at the passersby
""Get it through your heads!""

Sometimes on my way to work
I give her my spare change

And every time I play an ace

Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

If you ain't gettin' dough, what the fuck you in this for?
I see you chasin hoes, and all your fancy clothes
You say you hate the music, then why you at the show?
What all that yappin' mean?
How the fuck that fit the plan?
Where the fuck you from homeboy?
You ain't from my land
I see you in the club, in the corner mean-mugged
With all your little thugs, go pop a bottle of bub
And think about it first
And drink away your problems
Before a nigga out here on the streets help you solve them
See, I ain't mad at ya
I'm just tryin' to relax you
And teach you somethin' homie, before them killers snatch you
I try to keep it thorough
Keith done been around the world
And never understood how a man could act like a girl
But see I'm just a squirrel
And this is your world
And I wish you the best
So get it off your chest

Well, he ain't write this verse
Some people put they money first, and don't care who they hurt
Always talkin' bout how they, finna do this and finna do that
Finna get that new Benz and finna buy they girl a Cadillac
I try to mind my business, they strike at me with a vengeance
Don't know I'm young and visicious and know how to throw them fist-es
Say I don't keep it real, (what?) say I ain't got the skill
(we) mad cause I got a deal, give a fuck bout how you feel
I represent the streets and that's the way you gotta be
And when my album drop, some people gon' be mad at me
Bitches don't wanna listen, don't wanna play position
Ain't got a pot to piss in, but they call they self dissin'
Your next move should always be your best move
Never follow what the rest do, and they'll respect you
Cause money come and go, don't front like you don't know
And when it's all spend up and gone, you ain't got shit to show

Now my baby mama hate the fact, now that I'm gettin' scratch
So she go and react, hold up man, matter of a fact
Now that I'm thinkin' back, when I ain't had no scratch
No ice, or no 'lac, hold up Kwon rewind it back
Now was you gon' react?
That's when I hate the fact, I laid her on her back
(hold up man, don't say that)
Nah, let me spit the facts
Y'all know I love my son, but she only care about if he got some air force ones
Now ain't that shit dumb? Now where we both come from
Like all your life, you grew up running around spending funds
We was broke as Hammer, t-shirts for pajamas
Cribs small as llamas, eating corn flakes and bananas
Now it's vests and Hummers, we fucked the whole summer
The only reason, cause your man be tryin to take me under
So now I sit and wonder, like I ain't got no clue
And yes it's true, that the money might have moved you

When I used to fall asleep. 
Playing army in the fort, watching Star Wars on the floor 
Looking up to so much more 
Take me back to that place where the sun shined on our face, 
Where our memories never fade 
Take me back to the day where we could always slip away 
Being cool under the shade 
Camping out under stars in the backyard with our cars 
We could stay out here for hours 
At home watching Scooby Doo in my He-Man underroos 
Telling me I have the power

What one won't do, bet the next one will
Might swoop through and holla in my Coupe Deville
But that's only if I got some time to kill

See this one name that's hip to the game
Never been the type that would stick with a man
You ain't tryna be committed, well, we one in the same
You say my attitude is shitty and at times I'm vain

I mean what else can I say I guess I'm guilty as charged
Caught a felony from the way I'm spittin' these bars
I'm from St. Louis City and I claim it with pride
Ain't no shame in my game, this is where I reside

And I done seen a lot of things
So I'm hip to how they plot and scheme, it?s not a thing
Tryna get me out the Prada jeans, yes, I'm not a lean
Girl, you gotta have a lotta green, know what I mean

Just left from the mall, bought a new outfit

And I'm tired of these hoes runnin' off at the mouth
Thinkin' they dos knows what they talkin' about
Oh ya?ll done fucked up you don't know what your in for
The way I fuck tracks you can call me a nympho

I'm drivin' down the block now ridin' with the top down
Rollin' wit my kin folk, they smokin' that indo

And err city I here them yellin' out biatch

I'm the thing they be claimin' to tame
I met him but I can't remember his name
Fuck the fame, I'm in this for the change

Now I've been known to murder tracks like Roberta Flack
Give a nigga head and they don't know how to act
And I be known to get around when I'm in ya town
Call ya baby daddy, he ain't no where to be found

To hell with being lady like call me promiscuous
And yeah, it?s true they maybe right, but fuck 'em
It ain't nobody?s prerogative if I like to dress sexy
Act seductive and provocative

This dude approached me slowly and
Told me his name was Jody and
His homies say he know me cause he used to flirt with Toni
Say, he wanna get to know me, got some things he wanna show me
Would I be his tender-roni?
Told me call him when I'm lonely
Then I took a couple pictures, feeling tipsy off the liquor
Yeah, my titties might be bigger, but my ass a little thicker
And they like 'em: my weight, my shape, my size
My height, my lips, my hips and my thighs

[Verse 2]
I see my cousin coming, he probably up to something
Look at him, with some chicken head face, know he frontin'
I ain't the one to gossip now, you ain't heard it from me
But that chick that he was mackin' is really a 'he'
And look at her, came out the house looking that crazy
Talkin' bout she got on ""Baby Phat"", that's just fat, baby
You had a cup or two, well that's enough for you
But let him buy you one more drink before you cut him loose
So, gon' flirt a little bit, and make him think you feelin' him
Then smile at him, wink your eyes and make him think he gettin some
Before he know you by the door, see you already out the door
You won't be home till after 4, won't probably stop at Calico's
Pull up on the parking lot, and by this time it's dark and hot
You circled back around the block, and take the handicap spot
And yeah you might just get a ticket, hell with it, you tryin' to kick it
More than likely if you get the digits, she gon' let you hit it
DROP IT

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
After the club you probably tryin' take somebody home
I guess you betta keep it on the low, don't want your cover blown
So you betta make it known, before they play the last song
Cause you ain't tryin' to spend the night alone, right or wrong?
Got money in your pocket, then take it out and throw it
And put your hands up in the air, if you the shit and know it
This cat up in my face, breath smelling like some shiiit
Teeth lookin' like he been bitin' a bag of bricks
He talkin' bout 'girl'.
You think I told that nigga
If you don't get your funky breath up out my face
It gon' be some shit, don't make me tick
Don't ask me for my name..
And you don't NEED to know my numba..
And don't worry if I got my big ol' booty from my mama
It's the last call for alcohol, and I'm just tryin' to have a ball
Ain't worry bout nothing at all, I almost triple play it off
The DJ spinnin' the last records, by this time they half naked
Same place, same time tomorrow they'll be back at it

See I don't fuss and fight, if he ain't acting right, I just tell him
(say hello to my little friend)
See I don't bust or spit, if he ain't home yet, you better tell him

[Verse 1]
Now ladies, listen closely to the shit I'm bout to share with you
See, I'ma show you what it take to get the perfect screw
Since, ain't nobody speakin' on it, I'ma be the first to say it
And let these niggaz know, they sex is highly overrated
I ain't never been the type, to sit and wait on some nigga
Especially, when I know I can make me cum quicker
No, I ain't really interested in how much you packin'
Cause, I got something that can guarantee me satisfaction
And see my tatics, safer than using some pro-ka-lactic
Safer than using any other code of action, really though
Don't get it twisted, tryin' to think I'm on some right shit
The right dick can turn me on, faster than a light switch
Guess I got a fascination when it comes to masturbation
Nothing like the sensation, penetratin', got me shakin'
Now I caught the midas touch, give me the slightest rush
Something bout it makes me blush, the only one I trust

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now here's something that women do
That I just can't see to phatom, now why the fuck
We walkin' round faking orgasms
Ain't nobody speaking on it, ima be the first to say it
And let these niggaz know they sex is highly overrated
I ain't never been the type to waste my time with amateurs
Cause ain't nothing worser than a nigga with no stamina
And then got the nerve to go and run and tell your home boys
Well, did you tell them, I had to cum off my own toys?
Know a lot of niggaz, gon get mad and say I'm male-bashing
And yeah I know they probably hate this song with a passion
Instead of attitude, you should be showing gratitude
Tryin' to show you little dudes, an avenue you never knew
A lot of ladies walk around frustrated sexually
When it comes to fixin', they don't know how easy that could be
Follow my instructions carefully
I promise you for surely guarantee
That it will make you come faster than a speeding bullet

Say hello to my little friend....(4x)

Of a sermon that no one will hear

Was my one intention
And an ugly beauty
Was my own invention
Pride a proud refusal
And I refuse
To need your approval
Too many seekers
Too few beacons
But through the fog
We'll keep on beaming

Through the crying hours
Of your glitter years
All the living out
Of your tinsel tears
And the midnight trains

'Cause I'd already
Played the game

Got their own good reason
Why their favorite season
Is their favorite season

And those summers sons
Aren't good for everyone
Aren't good for everyone

And autumns well done
So well done

And it's a better thing
That we do now
Forgetting everything
The whys and how's
While you reminisce
About the things you miss
You won't be ready
To kiss goodbye

The earth is a world
The world is a ball
A ball in a game
With no rules at all
And just as I wonder
At the beauty of it all
You go and drop it
And it breaks and falls

I'll never understand
Why you thought I would
Need to be reassured
And be understood
When I always knew
That your bad's my good
And I was ready
Ready to be loved

Born under mars
With Jupiter rising
Fallen from stars
That lit my horizon

I'll never understand
Why you thought I would
Need to be reassured
And be understood
When I always knew
That your bad's my good
And I was ready

Under sliver studded skies
In a forest burning ashes
On the bonfires of our lives

Saw my world spin round

Come to tell me of a change
In the darkness that surrounds me

The right to teach us our direction
But I found out on close inspection
True imprefection

Kissing the spires
Higher and higher
Higher and higher

Inside of my head
I heard what the good lord said
""beware"" he said
If you don't you might end up dead


You suck the air right out of me
But though you suck you cannot see
That life and living are not free
Though you live you do not breathe


I'm looking for a new direction
Where in the world am I?
I took the word the word was resurrection
And then you took me out to climb

I have changed
But still my heart
Remains intact
And true love stays
But will our hearts
Retain their lack of


No sense and no direction
Who in the world am I?

And then you took me out to climb

My instincts are to kiss this train
I hear it coming

Your ulcer still says no

That may not work again
My fortunes wax
My fortunes wane
My senses sunder
A cup would cheer
The cheerless heart
The path I dare not chart
I look askance, not quite the part
Someone has blundered
The normal rules do not apply
And mine is not to reason why
Gone, gone, gone
To all this scoundrel scheme of things
To all the pain it brings
To all those who pull the strings
I said good riddance
So pass the time to coin a phrase
I'll mint a million ways
To counterfeit my salad days
And split the difference

To the ground to the ground to the ground
Speak to me speak and give my calling
'cause I'm going down going down going down


It's only lies and alibis
Alibis and lies
We know something dies every day


I've lost or I've forgotten
More than I'll ever know
Born just a someone with some kind of nothing
I let it go let it go let it go


It's only lies and alibis
Alibis and lies
We know something dies every day
Here it comes the morning sun
Another hit and run
And we're just the ones in the way


Coming down with you


Give me a hope I can lean on
'cause I'll bend in the calmest winds
Give me one more than dreams for me to dream on
My jury's in coming in coming in

Just when you think it's done
Out of every nowhere

Take my darkest fears and play them,
Like a lullaby, like a reason why,
Like a play of my obsessions,
Make me understand the lesson, 
So I find myself, so I won't be lost again

I won't stop to cry
He may be caught off guard
But he won't be surprised
This is where I usually let him

But I won't say goodbye
He knows where I'm weak
And what I can't resist
And how to make me second guess

Skip to the healing
He won't hear me say it
But he'll know what I was feeling

I could make those people dance 
And maybe they'd be happy for awhile

And do you have faith in God above 
If the bible tells you so 
Now do you believe in rock n roll 
And can music save your mortal soul 
And can it teach me how to dance real slow 
Well i know that your in love with him 
Cause i saw you dancing in the gym 
You both kicked off your shoes 
And i did Gods rhythm and blues

With a great carnation and a pick up truck 
But i knew that i was out of luck

And i asked her for some happy news 
But she just smiled and turned away 
Well i went down to the sachet store 
Where i heard the music years before 
But the man there said the music wouldn't play 
Well now in the streets the children screamed 
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed 
But not a word was spoken 
The church bells all broken 
And the three men i admire the most, 
The father, son, and the holy ghost

Eclipse,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

When life was slow and oh, so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender and callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember then follow

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
And dreams were kept beside your pillow
Try to remember when life was so tender
And love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember then follow follow follow

Deep in December it's nice to remember
Although you know snow will follow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
Without a hurt the heart is hollow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made us mellow
Deep in December it's nice to remember and follow

Ed Ames,"Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

From the canyons of the mind
We wander on and stumble blindly
Through the often tangled maze
Of starless nights and sunless days
While asking for some kind of clue
Or road to lead us to the truth
But who will answer?

Side by side two people stand
Together vowing, hand in hand
That love's imbedded in their hearts
But soon an empty feeling starts
To overwhelm their hollow lives
And when they seek the how's and why's
Who will answer?

On a strange and distant hill
A young man's lying very still
His arms will never hold his child
Because a bullet running wild
Has struck him down and now we cry
""Dear God, oh, why, oh, why?""
But who will answer?

High upon a lonely ledge
A figure teeters near the edge
And jeering crowds collect below
To egg him on with, ""Go, man, go!""
But who will ask what led him
To his private day of doom
And who will answer?

If the soul is darkened
By a fear it cannot name
If the mind is baffled
When the rules don't fit the game
Who will answer? Who will answer? Who will answer?
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

In the rooms of dark and shades
The scent of sandalwood pervades
The colored thoughts in muddled heads
Relining in the rumpled beds
Of unmade dreams that can't come true
When we ask what we should do
Who, who will answer?

'Neath the spreading mushroom tree
The world revolves in apathy
As overhead, a row of specks
Roars on, drowned out by discotheques
And if a secret button's pressed
Because one man has been outguessed
Who will answer?

Is our hope in walnut shells
Worn 'round the neck with temple bells
Or deep within some cloistered walls
Where hooded figures pray in halls?
Or crumbled books on dusty shelves
Or in our stars, or in ourselves
Who will answer?

If the soul is darkened
By a fear it cannot name
If the mind is baffled
When the rules don't fit the game
Who will answer? Who will answer? Who will answer?
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There`s a rainbow for me to follow

Ed Ames,"All my love's laughter
And all my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms

She's following after
The king of all places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
She walks without shining a light now

She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know till it's night

All my love's softness
And ll my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove

She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says, everyone says
She's searching for sweet love

But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
She stands with her flock
All alone on the hill

Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning and you never will

Ed Ames,"A way out here, they've got a name
For rain and wind and fire
The rain is Tess, the fire is Joe
And they call the wind Maria

Maria blows the stars around
And sends the clouds a flying
Maria makes the mountain sound
Like folks were up there dying

Maria, Maria
They call the wind Maria

Before I knew Maria's name
I heard her wail and whining
I had a girl and she had me
And the sun was always shining

But then one day I left my girl
I left her far behind me
And now I'm lost, so God damn lost
Not even God can find me

Maria, Maria

They call the wind Maria

Out here they've got a name for rain
For wind and fire only
But when you're lost and all alone
There ain't no world but lonely

And I'm a lost and lonely man
Without a star to guide me

Weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him cryin' like a little whipped pup
Because of love

Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hand
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
This thing called love

It can lift you up, it can let you down
Take your world and a' turn it all around
Ever since time nothin's ever been found
Stronger than love

Most men are like me they struggle and doubt
Trouble their mind day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about
A word called love

But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young one close to her breast
I thank God that the World's been blessed
With a thing called love

Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hand
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man

It can lift you up, it can let you down
Take your world and a' turn it all around
Ever since time nothin's ever been found

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

Or summer is last robin in winter's first snow
Lonesome is a little dog lost out in the street lonesome is me
Lonesome is an empty bottle a half filled glass of wine
The sound that a clock makes when all you have is time
Lonesome is a heart that breaks when love has turned to hate
The dying sun at the close of day
Lonesome is a jail of tears that won't set me free lonesome is me
Lonesome is me lonesome is me

Crying softly in her loneliness and pain
Knowing no one needin' someone bad as me
And she told me as I held her trembling hand
Walking slowly how she'd never known a man
Living lonely in her cottage by the sea

When the morning came her tears had changed to laughter
And before the night her heart beat close to mine
And I thought as she lay sleeping of the secrets she was keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind

In the morning as I wakened with the dawn
Without warning I could feel that she was gone
Leaving nothing but her silence next to me
And lonely footprints that I followed in the sand
Walking slowly for I knew where they would end
Disappearing in the silence of the sea
And I sometimes hear the echo of her laughter
As I search for what I know I'll never find

Like any man I'm afraid to die, but I'm hurt too bad to run.
I ran with her to Walker's Woods with him close on my heels;
I knew he'd kill to get her back, and I know just how he feels.

Oh, the sun never shines in Walker's Woods;
I doubt if it would want to come in even if it could,
'Cause the gators and the cottonmouths, the sand that pulls you down
Makes Walker's Woods a haven for the damned.

By the quicksand over there my dream came to an end:
She said it was a big mistake, that she'd return to him,
So I gave her to the hungry sands, now all I loved is dead--
And all that's left is the scarlet rag that she wore upon her head.

Oh, the sun never shines in Walker's Woods;
I doubt if it would want to come in even it could,
'Cause the gators and the cottonmouths,the sand that pulls you down
Makes Walker's Woods a haven for the damned.

I've no regrets; I loved her; five more minutes I'll be free--
I'd have made it if that cottonmouth hadn't made his strike at me.
But I have to laugh when I think how mad old Emmett's going to be
When he finds out he never got to take one shot at me.

Ed Bruce,"There was a time I really thought it did some good
To get down on my knees to you and I would
But baby now that's all changed today's a brand new day
You ain't worth the price I had to stay

Just because you're the best looking woman that I've ever seen
Ain't reason enough to have to treat you like a queen
There's a harder lesson you need to learn and it might as well be today
Baby you ain't worth the price I had to stay

I'm tired of tryin' to turn the other cheek to you
And never knowin' which way to turn cause you've made up a brand new set of rules
Somewhere I picked up a little more pride than I had yesterday
Baby you ain't worth the price I had to stay
[ harmonica + guitar ]
I'm tired of tryin' to turn...
Baby you ain't worth the price I had to stay




",The Price I Pay to Stay
Ed Bruce,"Were there never quite enough Sundays
Did I leave out a birthday or two
Did I make too much of mere holiday fluff
When a rose just on Tuesday would do
Did I say often enough you look pretty
Did I tell you you meant everything
Did I ever say you still take my breath away
Or did he say it better than me

Did I always say I'm sorry I hurt you
Did I always know when I did
Were there some signs, if I'd paid more attention
Well, I'll pay for it now, long as I live
Did I ever say you're my heart
That I couldn't live without you
As long as there's breath in this body of mine
This old heart will keep beating for you

Now, did he say it better than me",Did He Say It Better Than Me?
Ed Bruce,"At the door at five a.m.
Off to bust my back again
And here you are, kissing me goodbye
Suddenly the day at hand
Doesn't seem to be so bad
Once again, you make things alright

[Chorus]
How do you do that
You find diamonds in the drops of rain that fall
While I just get wet
You let the sun shine through it all
It's a wonder to me
How do you do that

You call to say ""Honey, hurry home""
You've thought about us all day long
Baby, tonight we're staying in
We'll count the stars on a moonless night
Watch the shadows by candlelight
And you'll love me like the first time again

[Chorus]

You're a wonder to me
How do you do that",How Do You Do That?
Ed Bruce,"If you want to hear a love song
I could sing one
If you want to feel the fire
We could build one
If you need to catch a rainbow
We could chase one
If you want to be together
We could be one

Now, you talk about tomorrows
I can see one
There's no mountain we can't climb
If we reach one
If you believe in forever's
We could start one
If you want to be together
We could be one

One and one, I've always heard
Adds up to two
But one and one is only one
When that one is me and you
If you believe in forever's
We could start one
If you want to be together
We could be one",One
Ed Bruce,"This old hat's hung on the bedpost too long
Forgotten like some used to be remembered like a song
Where all the words are so easy to recall
Hmm, this old hat

It's seen day fade to night in an open sky
Beneath the fury of the heavens
Kept the rain out of my eyes
Yet, somehow don't look as weathered as I
Hmm, this old hat

This old hat's been down some dusty trails
And may not look as good as it did new
The crown is stained, the brim is torn
It's even been walked on a time or two

This old hat's just like an old friend
Misplaced from time to time but it still fits
They don't make 'em like they used to

There was a time, this old hat was in style
But it was different then
It turned a few heads for awhile
But what the hell, I might try it on again
Hmm, this old hat

This old hat's been down some dusty trails

Ed Bruce,"Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
They'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold

He'll probably just ride away

Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone

Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do
Sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him
Do things to make you think he's right

It starts to rain, it begins to pour. 
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin. 
I feel a shiver run up my spine.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 

After a while we run under a tree. 
I turn to her and she kisses me. 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.
Sharing our love under stormy skies.

And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause thats about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

Everyday ?for supper time, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.

When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.

It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide,
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Jazzman take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.

He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Oh lift me, won't you lift me with ev'ry turn around;
Play it sweetly, take me down, oh jazzman.",Jazzman

With dark eyes shut and whiskey breath
You hadn't taken off your black dress
The curtain fell from it's rail
I shut the window so it wouldn't shatter
But it was nothing it didn't matter

To me our lives are barely built to last
How did you creep up on me so damn fast my dear?

I've had a few knocks here and there
Was mostly my fault so I don't care

Wishing for a dangerous life
Cut the leash some slack
Run into the morning light
Race the trains by the track
Until my mouth feels dry

Is all that's left in the empty house
Must've left it when they moved out
In a hurry to flee the town
Armoured tanks 
Broke through all of the soldier's ranks
You can be sure they weren't shooting blanks
From bodies laid out on the ground

There's a song your father had sung 
When you were just knee high
Now a soldier plays the same tune
From the toy you left behind 

Something to remind you
Something to remind you

Burnt to black 
There's a face you don't recognise
Just a doll with hollow eyes
And a feeling you can't describe
In factories
Toys are made by the companies
Who create our killing machines
So the planet can rest at ease

There's a story you had to hear
When you couldn't sleep at all
Now the pages are burning in some 
Sad unholy war

Something to remind you
Something to remind you
The ones you left behind you

Of friends who sit and think too much 
Too fragile for the cold outside 
Too proud to say what's on their minds 
This is for the broken fools 
Whose flames are gone before their time

But my oh my oh my this one's for you
My heart is on its sleeve
I need you to believe
That the dark times will fade

So crack the shell of the hardest heart
Slip inside when they're caught off guard
Kill all the urgent lies that stain their blood

Out in the fields where the grass snakes hide
Six years old, tall as a chair
Found the trapdoor hidden from sight

Fell into the blackness, seemed like hours
I hit the ground on a sea of skulls
There was no treasure, just stolen souls
Taken years ago down this endless hole

Man must kill to live or quench his thirst
Let's go back to the source where it first came from

Looked death in the eyes, falling stalactites
Then burnt by a light as angels flew by
Who pulled me back up to the moonlit sky
Covered in dust, it was hard not to cry

Man must kill to live or quench his thirst
Let's go back to the source where it first came from

Falling through trapdoors wherever I go
Kicking and screaming 'cause nobody knows

Ed Harcourt,"Anything we should know about your change? -- I need a brain lift since this heart sank 
So sick of morons who left to the bank
Sometimes I'm guilty of losing all pity 
Of boys with guitars who milk every lachrymosity

Out on a Friday I prop up the bar
I watch all the primates who never get far
With every delusion they strut round the city
They scratch in confusion overcome with lachrymosity 

Why so sad, so sad, so sad, so sad? 
So sad, so sad...

I'm a recipe for disaster 
I'm a has-been no-good bastard
You're much too good to me 
I'm wrapt in lachrymosity

You're much too good for me

Nails in that sorrow is nigh on the riven tree

You'll get some lachrymosity
You'll have some lachrymosity, too.",Lachrymosity

One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

Till one dream appears and love is its name

Make one dream come true, you only live twice

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Tells me that you are my own.

Protecting the lives of twenty-two million Afro-Americans
Then all of a sudden, Uncle Sam becomes very conscious, of legality

Here's the reason that, I've been upset for a while
'Cause if you're black you get life, but if you're white you're on trial
Ain't nothing to it, just like that chump Charles Stewart
They're always claiming, that the devil made me do it
For insurance, he killed his wife and his child
And blamed it on a brother, and racists got buck wild
He had the media, believing the, aesop fable
And all the whites were like, ""I can't wait 'til
They catch the bastard - I hope they fry him""
They were sure that he did it, there was no need to try him
And Willy Bennett, who was in it to win it
Got bassed and harassed cause they was sure that he did it
And the thing that really pissed me off and truly offended me
Is the suckers wanted to reinstate the death penalty
For a brother man, but not the other man
And when they found out, he killer her himself, hmm on the other hand
Now it's inhumane, bring it back they wouldn't dare
But his brother confessed he was with it, so give HIM the chair
But that won't happen with that punk Dukakis
Flynn and Mickey Roach, you better just watch for us
I don't want to hear that you're sorry to me
After you tore up, and started a war up in the black community
It's out of the news, but it's still in my head
Charles Stewart still lives even though the sucker's dead
I'ma speak upon it

He is trying to wipe, you, out
Trying to eliminate your total existence
With falsehood and lies
And he's succeeding in doing it!

Now here's a verse about a relative, that coulda lived
But killed by a cop that thought negative
Shot in the back like a victim of Jesse James
Tell them his motherf***ing name!
Phillip Pernell, murdered by a devil
That never saw a cell, so I'm here to raise hell and tell
About a child that was left to decay
And the next couple of days the pig was suspended with pay
Receiving support from cops and superior courts
And all we receive is a bullet inside a corpse
Now tell me, what type of justice has been done
What woulda happened if I shot his son?
I woulda been killed, taken to a chamber and filled up with gas
But yet nothing has happened to ?
So I had to take two extra steps
And put it on wax, cause I couldn't let it rest (why?)
'Cause I can't stand to see Satan smile
And get away with taking the life of a child
You meant to do it, so now your motto is (tell 'em)
The more bullets, the less blacks live (you better)
Watch your back you murderer because you're wanted
But for now, yo, I guess I gotta speak upon it

We've got to come together
Pool our efforts, our strength, our finance
And build our own nation
The Chinese did it, it's called Chinatown!

Let me speak upon this with a radical take as I take
Time to talk about the systematical break-down
And deliberate destruction through mis-education
Of the Nubian Nation
Starting in kindergarten, continuing through college
They continue to kick you trick knowledge
And call it education but I call it training
Washing your brain into gaining and maintaining
The American dream, but to me it's a nightmare
Because they keeps ya right where
They want you to be, mentally, physically, and monetarily
As you go merrily merrily merrily
Down the stream but it's more like up s***'s creek
Without a paddle and the boat's got a leak
We start drowning in all that s***, getting deeper
Mind's in a choke hold or should I say a sleeper
But I ain't going out like Rip Van Winkle
So you can't gas me up anymore, and I think you know
That I can see clearly now the rain is gone
It's bright outside, I see the light, and I'ma speak upon it

You know what I'm saying?
'Cause all that s*** they taught me in school amounted up to ZERO
(Word is bond!)
Abraham Lincoln ain't my motherf***ing hero, why know what I'm saying?
(That Devil ain't my hero neither)
Word up, yo this is Def Jef the poet with soul
Cooling with my man Eddie O.G.
On a funky funky funky funky funky funky track
(Yeah, Bulldogs is out there, why'knahmsayin?
ShaQuan, peace to you and Ace, why'knahmsayin?
Peace to Teddy Ted, Special K, DJ Doc, Ramos
Yeah boys, the soul brothers, why'knahmsayin?)
Oh yeah yeah, Craig B. ? Love and the Legend
And DJ Eric Vaughn, hah
(Word up)
Yeah

Notice this!
They put ""In God We Trust"" on a dollar bill
They don't even have it on a church
And don't even open the verses of their bible
But on the dollar bill is a big sign ""In God We Trust,"" correct?
Then they have, on the back of the dollar bill
The key, the scales, the pyramids
All of the symbols of bondage, slavery
How they took the country, who they took it from
Who you are, the builders of the pyramids
Without your eyes
You are the builders of the pyramids without your eyes
Because you don't know you did it
Why don't he know?
Because a traitor, taught him to eat wrong foods, since he was a baby
Put pork in him, has you eating pigs feet and ribs
Has you living in his image
And took away your divinity
And replacing it, with his low animalization",Speak Upon It
Ed O.G,"Uh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah
ED O.G. uh uh, D Quest uh uh
Boston's Finest, y'all check this out

You challenge me I'll challenge you, off balance fool
I'm a show you rap niggas what real talent do
Never shook up, doing with skills not book up
Four-course-meal is what I cook up
Put your notebook up
Niggas swear they're down cuz' they look up
Rip them rhymes up, hook them hooks up
You need a mic check I'm a push them rooks' up
Your crooks suck, I make a deal off of blood money
Make an album off the drug money
Take the label money and launder it under the table money
And open businesses
It don't matter who's the first or who's the first one that finishes
I'm out of nowhere just like Kurt Warner
Did it to the head without a nigga in my corner
The solo performer, who tell the ""Truth"" like Sojourner
""EDO"" keep it hot like a bullet from a burner

[Chorus]
Whatever you got we got two of it
(You bring yours I'll bring mine)
Straight up sucka' without a crew with him
(You'll get yours in due time)
If you got skills learn what to do with them
(You bring yours I'll bring mine)
What goes around comes back in town
(You'll get yours in due time)

Do I really have desire to flow
Or desire for dough
By any means play the spotlight or behind the scenes
Fuck rap sell ? and get chased by crack fiends
But remain positive and appeal to black queens
Left and right not too many scenes for inbetweens
We kept it divided I remain undecided
And put it on auto-pilot, lay back and cruise
Till I get enough blues and bad news to blow my fuse
Walk a week in my shoes
Concentrate like the camp on the Jews
We drop jewels, while others blow budgets on bars and booze
We already lost nigga so it's hard for my to lose
And choose without being confused
A lot of funny shit happens but I'm hard to amuse
I was knocking hard in the beginning
Learning to lose is the key to winning
A lot of you all take drastic measures with plastic treasures
How we going to put it down without the cash together
Make it last forever and realize you all been blessed
To hear ED O.G. and Deric Quest on the quest

[Chorus]

Yo, I've been in altered states all throughout the states
Blew out the gates, you want wine we got to squash them grapes
Over seas it ain't about the states
I make a hot album, you get a verse on other nigga's tapes
Your first mistake's your worst mistake
Trying to eat and survive off of other nigga's plates
If I'm involved then there must be dialogue
I spits fire dog, to the wire on a level that's higher
Money will turn a saint into a liar
If you ain't got game, you'z a baller in the wind
Niggas rather have a dime up front than a dollar in the end
Silence when you lose but you holla when you win
Big star, close but no cigar
You get smashed on stage like a heavy metal guitar
Whoever you are, or what you sold niggas
You old niggas I don't care what you told niggas
Or who you gased up, you ain't no damn winner
ED O.G.'s the lead singer and you just a band member
Yo, you just a band member, yeah

[Chorus]",Extreme
Ed O.G,"[Chorus: ]
You used to be my man, we used to be in love
Since we parted ways things is gettin' rough
Just because I got a kid by you
Don't give you no reasons to act like a fool

Yo, you used to be my girl, but that was in the past
It's a shame that that shit didn't last
And just because we got a kid together
Don't give you no reasons to change like the weather

Sometimes I reminisce on how it was before we dropped a seed
I was your everything and you was all I need
Stopped payin' attention cause I gained a little weight
Pokin' all these hookers, layin' up from state to state
My stress level's risin' to the highest, you begged me
To have your baby, now you're tryin' to play me
And so I choose to move away from this drama
No longer in love, now you just my baby's father

What's up, you needs to shush up and hush up
Everything you hear you believe
You're loud plus you Rifkin more than Steve
When I come through you make me leave
If I roll up on you like a sleeve
Don't get it twisted like braids or weaves
No welly, I'm off to the bank telly
Plus actin' foul when my seed was in yo belly
You ain't the eight one on the section
The problem is we ain't together but we still keep sexin'

You tryin' to keep the upper hand just because we got a kid
Don't give you the right to try to monitor the way I live
Where I go and who I date ain't no business of yours
No need for you to player-hate, you still get the drawers

The love used to be there, I don't know where the shit went
We was young and wasn't ready for commitment
Young ways at a young age
Two teenagers with a young seed to raise

[Chorus: ]

See you been on fire since the baby, flamin' up
Started changin' up with the rah-rah callin' my peeps and hangin' up
Speakin' in a different tone now
On that young shit, even though we grown now
You on your own, but ain't raisin her alone
We can't even hold a decent conversation on the phone
Yeah, we lay down like SMPTE
You want me to hit you so you tempt me
Turnin' red like Simply

Don't take it out on my seed cause you resent me
It's unfulfilling, so in other words we empty
You talk about things you prepared to do
I was there when your fam wasn't there for you
And yo, I'm pointin' fingers, like triggers
Your sisters is a bunch of goldiggers
With they kids around a million different niggas
Fake tears you cried and wept
Baby, walk the same path and follow in they footsteps

You try to say them hurtful things and threaten me with fear
But I cried my last cry and shed my last tear
I did my best to keep you out of court for child support
But you don't do your job, it's like I'm married to the mob
Your friends be on some spy shit, I'm on some do-or-die shit
Survive it, I got to, I can't depend on you
Watchin' her on weekends, thinkin' you the shit
Callin' it a favor when you babysit
You'se a part-time daddy with some part-time love
And I ain't stoopin' to your level, I gots to rise above
Appreciate I demonstrate, my ways could be much meaner
You be a clown and fuck around, I'm servin' you subpeonas

[Verse One]
Yo..
If the opportunity was to present itself
I might just have to go and reinvent myself
Hook up a chick and advance, don't stick whenever the chance
Sometimes I hit, most the time my dick in my pants
It's on dogs, put your life on pause/paws
Get heads wrapped up in bras and drawers, fightin a lost cause
We break laws, give gauze when we break jaws
Findin flaws in stars and keep the even with the odds
In head-nods, from Spanish red-head broads
And stay Trump tight, with the cards
Went from a meter to a yard, livin my life scarred
Cause every minority grow up hard
Blow up hard, illin get you banned and barred
Soon as you start sleepin catchin you off guard
The very thing, is a 'Bury thing
Either everything is workin, or you workin for everything

""The crew is sayin somethin..""	"".. you know the deal""

[Verse Two]
Will them dogs that smoke blunts witchu, throw a punch witchu
or hold it down when you down and the mutts hitchu?
We all got tools -- I hate tellin good people bad news
Everybody livin by they own rules
Niggaz make me so sick I get nauseous
When I'm in the streets I always remain cautious
You can get rolled up, like a ounce in some Garcias
Compare my accomplishments, to my losses
Everybody want to wonder what the winner does
On my worst day now, it was better than it was
Cause money kept, is twice as good as money burned
And money won, is twice as sweet as money earned
Will there ever come a time, when the cryin ends?
Cause death is just a moment when the dyin ends
The very thing, is a 'Bury thing
Either everything is workin, or you workin for everything

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Alcohol and weed is my vices
to see my daughter smile is priceless
I leave the nicest lifeless
Return like Christ in a crisis
Take this +American Pie+, and distribute out slices
Like enterprisers, who take it to the wire
And shine so bright, niggas need a sun visor
MC's search the seven seas and wind up fishin
There's little to no competition
when I appear like an abberition
Your repitition, kept you in the same tradition, same position
Same ol' rapper, same ol' mission, the game won't listen
We got two thousand new ways, to shine and glisten
Ed O.G. is to rap, what Pedro is to pitchin
Nowadays if you dissin, you could wind up missin
But if you ain't under God, you goin under hard

I'm the bread, and you are just a crumb off
Jerkin your jimmy but you still can't come off
I'm from Roxbury, the 'Bury, but not the fruit y'all
Don't make me act like where I come from cause it's bru-tal
Hold my bone, in a zone that's neutral
Soon to be large, the whole nine yards, but I ain't souped y'all

At first you didn't know us, but know it's like, ""Yo put me down""
We didn't get in there so you can get in with us
You wasn't down when we was ridin the bus
So put on your Adidas, and STEP OFF.. I got to have it

No need for me to run away, brother put the gun away
You want to take my life away as if we were in combat
You can buy some new Adidas but you can't buy my life back
Aiyyo whassup with that?  Why is it like that?
Let's stand together y'all... and fight that in our race
To replace waste with a taste, just in case
you can't face the place that you've been put in
If you was my kid, for what you did you'd have a foot in
right in your ass, another term's rectum
Kids are having kids, they're not parents so they let them
do things that shouldn't be done
You're not a father cause you got a son unless you're taking care of him

It's my turn to go, and I got the right-of-way
You gotta fight your way to see another brighter day
But that's another subject you like it or you love it
Ja-ilers, get jealous, no push but I'ma shove it
But regardless, when times are hardest
I cleaned off the dirt, cause they needed a polish
When you're in like food in your stomach, they want to stick witchu
But when you're out like Elvis, they want to dick you
But hey, that's OK, cause we kept on strivin
and even when T lost his car, we kept on drivin
You had your chance to advance, but you blew it

Now this is the meanin of a Bug-A-Boo
It's a person who's constantly BUGGIN YOU
Never givin you no room TO BREATHE
On you like skin, or a shirt WITH SLEEVES
A person that constantly wants to be around you
It could even be your moms or pops when they hound you
Just someone who's always botherin you
If you was a plant, they'd be continuously waterin you
Sweatin you like - heat
Let's say you are the (?), and they are the sheets
Always on you, and wrapped around you
As if you were lost, and they just found you
They never get the picture
No matter how many times you diss 'em, they still want to get witcha
continuously callin never givin you a rest
A Bug-A-Boo's just like a fly..
Nothing but a pest, and I suggest
That you step, why?

[Chorus]
Cause you're a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo..

Now girls, there's that certain guy that just be tippin
On you like clothes and I suppose that you be dippin
in his kicks, cause he's a stupid dick
Sappy givin you this and that, so you can feel happy
Yeah you might be happy but you're sick of him
Because he's on it, and you want to get rid of him
But he's sweatin you, don't knock it cause he's gettin you
everything you want, so you can get fly
You say, ""Bug-A-Boo jump,"" and he says, ""How high?""
Hey, just get paid, cause he's payin you
And don't call him by his name, call him a Bug-A-Boo

[Ed O.G.]
Now everybody knows a Bug-A-Boo or was a Bug-A-Boo
You mighta had to bug a few or even fell in love and knew
that you was buggin a person, never cuttin no slack
Cause everytime you called them they was like ""I'll call you back""
Now a girl can whip a guy, and he can become one
He'll be callin you'll be stallin cause he's stupid a dumb one
But it goes both ways, and as a matter of fact
A girl can catch her man cheatin, and still take him back
So to all you Bug-A-Boos who got the blues and really want it
without you Bug-A-Boos we couldn't say that you were on it

instead of sweatin rappers for the way they say a rhyme?
I thought your state was straight, lots of girls and very sunny
You're bein Bug-A-Boo's cause they black and makin money
Protestin and arrestin a rap group real quick
If there was a white rock band you wouldn't say shit
Oh shit, I said a swear, I'm appalled I shouldn't say this
You musta started swears cause this ain't even our language
The other man and sellouts, are constantly riffin
Porno flicks are legal talkin about it won't make a difference
2 Live is sellin gold, so somebody's lovin the

They arrested white people, for wearin bikinis
They said they're showin too much, I don't see, how y'all can take it
But when I go to Florida, I'm goin naked
And swearin, and rappin, and talkin bout sex
Full of Olde E, from my feet to my neck
I'll be the main attraction on the news at eight
Since drugs and murder, don't affect that state

Don't try to be like me, cause God made only one
individual, who's original, just myself
It wouldn't be right, for me to be like, anyone else

I ain't hearin it, cause in the 'Bury we don't fear that shit

Aight man, let's kick it

Sometimes I feel like a nut, and sometimes I don't
Yo
Bu-do-do-do
Sometimes I feel like a nut, and sometimes I don't

Now there were times when girls ignored me
I was feelin' very horny
I wanted to flex
I was in the mood for sex
I couldn't get it
If she was a ball, she still wouldn't let me hit it
I couldn't understand why this girl wasn't with it
Yo, but now I'm makin' records and it's easy to get squeezed
Cause girls be handin' it out like government cheese
Now I'm gettin' it and I don't mean to pick with it
But tell you the truth, fellas, I'm gettin' kinda sick of it
Everyday out and in, in and out
Every girl makes the same noise - ""Ah,"" ""Ooh"" and ""Ouch""
T-Nyne said (I got two, you're ready to strike it?)
I'm really not in the mood, T, I just don't feel like it
Cause

I had a dream I lost all my girls and couldn't re-up
Jimmy couldn't sleep, so he woke me up
He was standin' straight up, lookin' down on me
And said you know what time it is, and then it dawned on me
I was horny and it was drivin' me crazy
Jimmy said it's about that time for love, baby
And I was with it
So I called up a freak, so I can get freaky
She said, ""My parents are home,"" I said, ""Just sneak me
Through the window cause this is somethin' I gotta have""
Said said, ""Okay, come over,"" - ""Cool, I'm catchin' a cab""
So then I got there and then I snuck in
Creepin' and duckin' and pressin' my luck in
All sorts of ways cause she was a new recruiter
Wasn't a traditional mission for me to knock some boots
Finally at last time to step on the gas, see
Of course I filled her up, cause she was on E
Sayin' all sorts of things, I couldn't understand what
Just one of those days I felt like a nut
Cause

Now a girl might say I'm sweatin' her cause she's a cutie
I give a freak a thousand chances to get the booty
And then when I get there to ignite it up
Hey yo, jimmy's prepared and ready to light it up
And then things won't be the way they used to be
I won't be callin' her, she'll be callin' me
Sayin', ""Hi, hello, what's up and how you doin', E?""
Call me back, freak, cause you're annoyin' me
Down my name to your friends you wouldn't bone me
You gave me a piece and now you think that you owe me?
Come on, step off get lost
Tell your friends you rode me like a race horse
I bet you won't tell 'em that, in fact
Freak, don't even call me back
She said, ""If that's the way you want it, punk, I won't""
I said, ""Ehm, sometimes I feel like a nut, and sometimes I don't""
Let's swing it

I want to send a super shout-out to Da Bulldogs who's in the house
I got my man T-Nyne in the place to be feelin' like a nut

I got my man Smooth Ice Gee

""I'm different, so don't compare me to another"" (3X)
""If they can't hang, word to the mother""

Verse One: Ed O.G.

I'm not like anyone else, so don't you think up or make suggestions
""He rap like so-and-so"" aiyyo yo know that's out of the question
Plus it don't sound right, cause I don't sound like -- him??
Or try to G like, see like, or even be like them
or anyone else I'm goin for self you opened your mouth and then I stuff you
You're like a floor; walked on, waxed, and then I buff you
Plus you think you're tough too?
Witcha garbage style, rubbish nothing but trash
You want to try me?  Come on I got some shit for that ass
I never be weak, doze off, fall asleep or get tired
Put wings on your head, so it's easier to fly it
Off you go, blaow, off the block
Get funky on you suckers like a gym sweat sock
cause I turn, to inflict, pick your hair up like a pick
Ed O.G., here is me, I make medicine sick
I'm never takin a loss, but beatin em down with force
Go when Dave writes the source, I got more holes than a golf course
Here's a lyrical lesson, so you losers you learn
Wack raps are like weak jim hats, you break and get burned
So I dare thee to compare me to a soft-hearted sucker
I'm different, so don't compare me to another

Chorus

Verse Two: Ed O.G.

Some of the people want to be equal wishin that they could be me
They never benign, got many who rhyme in the East so don't attempt to be
thinkin that you could do that, boy if you only knew that
I can't hold back, stompin a sucker I enjoy that
My impact, on contact, will overlap, your wack rap
Cause def tracks, exact to react, and attack the wack
I won't slack, but smoke smack slap you sap
Straight your soft so I put you in stacks
and stomp a sucker dead in his tracks, takin apart you righ to the max
Wake to the wonderful words, buggin you up and then waxin
Never ever takin a half-step, you diss oh that's your last step
You slept Joe, with strep throat, so now I'ma bust your rep
Droppin this, strictly on the metropolis
No comp for this, so why do you persist in this
Go ahead and attempt to; you better be filing exempt too --
-- cause you're a student, who's intruding
out of your district, oh well - another statistic
While I'm statin the swift style strictly, then switchin this
Swarm in a storm somehow, and leavin your shitlist
Smoke smack slap you sap, you are a sickness
Step and stand still boy, so I can stick this
sword of rap, straight up your spine sap
So you will be too scared, you swallow my style in your stomach
Let me shoot my sperm, until she screams and squirms, see
But don't sweat that I got a jim hat for safety
So I dare thee to compare me to a soft-hearted sucker
I'm different, so don't compare me to another

Chorus

Verse Three: Ed O.G.

Ed O.G.'s imposing threat, to be dreaded
To those I beheaded, the rest just sweated
But some of them are skeptical, so I step
with full packed force, and you know what, I wrecked the hoe
So don't put yourself, in that predicament
Because I'm sick of it, and you'll go out quicker than Bounty
The Quicker The Picker-Upper while I soak em
I might choke em, or even smoke em, NAH
But I'll max, and I'll just tax
and keep scopin by oneses, just like Jacks
See I compete with the weak I come across
I'm too elite to defeat, step off cause you're soft
When I elaborate, the ruler is smooth, I collaborate
in a state to straight that you hate
After this I'll be famous, but not the same as
those who proclaim this I'll leave them nameless
Thinkin you're hard with your backup, punk don't make me crackup
By yourself you just choke up, and plus get smoked up
So I dare thee to compare me to a soft-hearted sucker
I'm different, so don't compare me to another

Ed O.G & da Bulldogs,"""Come here, are you ticklish?""	

When I first got introduced with her
I wanted a future with her
And it was very easy for me to get used to her
We went to the movies, everything was groovy
We started spendin time and it was like she already knew me
We spent more time, then everything was fine
I kicked it to her how since she kicked it to mine
I called her up at work and even met her downtown
Keen to knowin one another, yo, I thought that I'd found
The perfect match for me, this just has to be
Asked her what's up with you and me?
She said she wanted to be friends with me
So I took it like a man
I couldn't understand why she wouldn't take my hand
And let me take her on a trip
She's a cute honey dip
It make her feel real good when I start to kiss her lips
Gimme a chance, oh yes, I be true to you
Hey yo, cause I want to make love to you

Let me tickle your fancy, girl
Let me tickle your fancy
Let me, let me
Let me tickle your fancy, girl
Let me tickle your fancy
Let me

""Come here, are you ticklish?""

Lampin on the block, coolin out and maxin
This girl walked by, she caught my eye, I said, ""What's happenin?""
WE started talkin, she was showin her interest
Got her number and address that very instance
Later on that night I decided to call her up
She was on the other line, she say hold on and hung up
With the person she was talkin to so she could talk to me
That was a sign that she was with it, it was time to drop some g
So I laid down with my eyes closed and kicked the Willie Bobo
And talked to her all night because I took a couple of No Doze
The next day came, I heard a knock-knock-kknock
I had on shorts and no shirts, so I unlocked the lock
She came in and sat down and we got right to it
I didn't waste no time cause I was ready to do it
She said she wasn't ready and this I couldn't understand
See, I really, really wanted to tickle her fancy

Let me tickle your fancy, girl
Let me tickle your fancy
Let me, let me
Let me tickle your fancy, girl
Let me tickle your fancy
Let me

The attraction from me to you was very physical
And if you had it and you lost it you would miss it, girl
I make you scream, scratch, squirm and sweat
When we get up to take a shower my bed'll be soaken wet
And after the shower we'll go and get some breakfast
Eatin to makin love is really the next best
Thing than actually makin love
Cause after love I'm hungry for some grub
I know your father always told you watch out for guys like me
Don't even say hi to me, just walk right by me
You see, I disagree, cause he was just like me
You want to obey him with all of your might
But look at your father now, he turned out alright
Come on, take your chance, yeah, I'm a dog who's sneaky
But gimme one night so I can show you I get freaky

Let me tickle your fancy
Let me, let me

Ed O.G & da Bulldogs,"Coolin at a club I seen a girl I wanted to stick it to
Well, I seen a few, but this one I had to kick it to
So I stepped to her, threw a couple and a few of
My lines to sedate her
Hm... she grabbed her coat and her bag, we left five minutes later
Yo, if she was a door I wouldn't knock like a neighbor in peace
I'd treat her like a drug house and bang like the police
Now at the crib the lights are dim, the music is soft
I said, ""You know what we're here for, so take those off""
By now she's butt-naked, I'm ready to break it
Threw on the jim hat, I'm ready for trim, and all that
So I did it up, oo-wee, homes, I lit it up
After I was done, she almost didn't get up
Then she got up on her feet, sweat me like a dog in heat
I knew it was comin, I didn't even have to run it

Ridin in a car with T-Nyne, Slim Dog and Darren
We stopped at a red light, this girl started starin
At me, I was in the fuss, so I said
""Excuse me, could you pull over, please?""
Right down ( ? ) in the heart of the 'Bury
I said to myself I'ma show this girl the meaning of my dic-tionary
She was dressed in black with a pair of riding boots
A Chinese top with a nice ( ? ), she was cute
She wasn't like a radio, so I couldn't turn her down
I got her address and said I be over after sundown
Night had fallen, Edo G wasn't stallin
I was over the crib, ready to place my bib
She was def/ man, you shoulda saw her
I rode them riding boots like a brother ride a ( ? )
She was the perfect match, and I was ready to strike it
Huggin on my jimmy tellin me how much she liked it

Late one night I was with Kenny and Mike
We was ridin through Morton Street projects
Just cruisin around, foolin around
And then we saw a couple of female subjects
All of our eyes looked their way, standin in the doorway
With nothin on but two tight little negliges
So we stopped the car, got out cause we was trickin
Kenny and Mike wasted no time, they walked right up and started kickin
As if they had been there, pretendin to live there
Helping hands, but it was really just to get in there
Then they got in and left a brother all alone
K said, ""Hey yo Edo, then you can use my car phone""
So I'm talkin on the phone thinkin this is ill
After a 30 minute ( ? ) K said, ""You're runnin up my phone bill
Come inside maxin,"" he didn't even have to run it

Rollin in two Jeeps, and both of them were Cherokees
Feelin like nuts we all wanted to get skeezed
So Teddy Ted and Special K
Led the way to a place where we could all get paid
Where the goods were like rugs, just waitin to get laid
So we stayed, tryin to decide on
Who would have who, and which girl wanted to ride on
His jim, one got up and kissed Glen
And took him in a room, goddamn he's in
Teddy Ted and Special K was already bonin
In a room with two girls who was yellin and moanin
And that left me, Fish, T, Cruz and Joe
Me and Cruz got hooked up so we looked up and g-o
G and Joe was waitin, sittin and debatin like troops
While Fish got up so he could step into some boots
So now it's two left tryin to get into the hoes' clothes
Ted opened up the door and said (Kick the Willie Bobo)
So now we're all in, finished and done bonin
We jumped in the streets cause it's time to start rollin
Everybody's feelin happy cause it was kickin
So we stopped at the store to get some forties and chicken
If those girls was prizes, we woulda won it

Ed O.G & da Bulldogs,"But when it comes to
Protecting the lives of twenty-two million Afro-Americans
Then all of a sudden, Uncle Sam becomes very conscious, of legality

Here's the reason that, I've been upset for a while
'Cause if you're black you get life, but if you're white you're on trial
Ain't nothing to it, just like that chump Charles Stewart
They're always claiming, that the devil made me do it
For insurance, he killed his wife and his child
And blamed it on a brother, and racists got buck wild
He had the media, believing the, aesop fable
And all the whites were like, ""I can't wait 'til
They catch the bastard - I hope they fry him""
They were sure that he did it, there was no need to try him
And Willy Bennett, who was in it to win it
Got bassed and harassed cause they was sure that he did it
And the thing that really pissed me off and truly offended me
Is the suckers wanted to reinstate the death penalty
For a brother man, but not the other man
And when they found out, he killer her himself, hmm on the other hand
Now it's inhumane, bring it back they wouldn't dare
But his brother confessed he was with it, so give HIM the chair
But that won't happen with that punk Dukakis
Flynn and Mickey Roach, you better just watch for us
I don't want to hear that you're sorry to me
After you tore up, and started a war up in the black community
It's out of the news, but it's still in my head
Charles Stewart still lives even though the sucker's dead
I'ma speak upon it

He is trying to wipe, you, out
Trying to eliminate your total existence
With falsehood and lies
And he's succeeding in doing it!

Now here's a verse about a relative, that coulda lived
But killed by a cop that thought negative
Shot in the back like a victim of Jesse James
Tell them his motherf***ing name!
Phillip Pernell, murdered by a devil
That never saw a cell, so I'm here to raise hell and tell
About a child that was left to decay
And the next couple of days the pig was suspended with pay
Receiving support from cops and superior courts
And all we receive is a bullet inside a corpse
Now tell me, what type of justice has been done
What woulda happened if I shot his son?
I woulda been killed, taken to a chamber and filled up with gas
But yet nothing has happened to ?
So I had to take two extra steps
And put it on wax, cause I couldn't let it rest (why?)
'Cause I can't stand to see Satan smile
And get away with taking the life of a child
You meant to do it, so now your motto is (tell 'em)
The more bullets, the less blacks live (you better)
Watch your back you murderer because you're wanted
But for now, yo, I guess I gotta speak upon it

We've got to come together
Pool our efforts, our strength, our finance
And build our own nation
The Chinese did it, it's called Chinatown!

Let me speak upon this with a radical take as I take
Time to talk about the systematical break-down
And deliberate destruction through mis-education
Of the Nubian Nation
Starting in kindergarten, continuing through college
They continue to kick you trick knowledge
And call it education but I call it training
Washing your brain into gaining and maintaining
The American dream, but to me it's a nightmare
Because they keeps ya right where
They want you to be, mentally, physically, and monetarily
As you go merrily merrily merrily
Down the stream but it's more like up s***'s creek
Without a paddle and the boat's got a leak
We start drowning in all that s***, getting deeper
Mind's in a choke hold or should I say a sleeper
But I ain't going out like Rip Van Winkle
So you can't gas me up anymore, and I think you know
That I can see clearly now the rain is gone
It's bright outside, I see the light, and I'ma speak upon it

You know what I'm saying?
'Cause all that s*** they taught me in school amounted up to ZERO
(Word is bond!)
Abraham Lincoln ain't my motherf***ing hero, why know what I'm saying?
(That Devil ain't my hero neither)
Word up, yo this is Def Jef the poet with soul
Cooling with my man Eddie O.G.
On a funky funky funky funky funky funky track
(Yeah, Bulldogs is out there, why'knahmsayin?
ShaQuan, peace to you and Ace, why'knahmsayin?
Peace to Teddy Ted, Special K, DJ Doc, Ramos
Yeah boys, the soul brothers, why'knahmsayin?)
Oh yeah yeah, Craig B. ? Love and the Legend
And DJ Eric Vaughn, hah
(Word up)
Yeah

Notice this!
They put ""In God We Trust"" on a dollar bill
They don't even have it on a church
And don't even open the verses of their bible
But on the dollar bill is a big sign ""In God We Trust,"" correct?
Then they have, on the back of the dollar bill
The key, the scales, the pyramids
All of the symbols of bondage, slavery
How they took the country, who they took it from
Who you are, the builders of the pyramids
Without your eyes
You are the builders of the pyramids without your eyes
Because you don't know you did it
Why don't he know?
Because a traitor, taught him to eat wrong foods, since he was a baby
Put pork in him, has you eating pigs feet and ribs
Has you living in his image
And took away your divinity
And replacing it, with his low animalization",Speak Upon It

How many of my real niggaz are still left?
A lot got killed, and filled a wooden box
and went out like ?docks?
I can picture when you went down, just like a ?becks?
Here one day, and gone the next
We all make mistakes, and these are the breaks
but I'm, sick and tired, of goin to wakes
and seein an end, to my friend
So we kicked it to the L to get some brew and gin
Nobody said nothin everyone was pissed
as we got drunk and reminisced
At your funeral, your head we kissed
Didn't go to the burial, but you'll be missed
That's if you didn't know, from your true friends and not your foes
Cause love comes and goes

Now my man, he never had no problems
but he got killed, when niggaz tried to rob him
Because they knew when they did it, they couldn't get away with it
So they killed him, took the dough and split it
Thinkin about the money, and not his four kids
A couple got caught, and now they're doin bids
Loot is worth more than a life, cause niggaz livin trife
My man had four kids, and a wife
Now the kids don't have a father and the wife don't have a husband
because when, you did what you did
the future of his kids may fall down...

I went to his funeral, thinkin maybe soon it will be me

When he makes it, that's when they want to take it

to see me at a show, and move the crowd
Your best friend, shot you over five dollars, that ain't right
The money mattered, and not the life

by another nigga, whose crew is much bigger
But he don't dig it cause his jim hat broke

I was creeping to Jenny, here's a note, don't sweat it
Forget it, cause it ain't worth it
I need to be alone when I'm goin under the surface
Now I'm out to hit my workers

I got money to burn -- dropped out of school
cause they couldn't teach me what I needed to learn
on how to earn big money, big money
I got the fortune, and a crib where it's sunny
But like a dummy, I started gettin careless
Talkin on the phone, so DEA could hear this
Date transaction the time and the spot
My world crashed on me, when I got caught
Now I'm locked, with the niggaz that are trife
No more money no more women for the rest of my life

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Can't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
And it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two",The City
Ed Sheeran,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to

There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change

All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again

I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind, I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take

And if it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

Ed Sheeran,"You were just a small bump unborn, in four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair, but you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands be as gentle as I can
And now your scan on my unmade plans
Small bump, in four months you're brought to life

I'll hold you tightly, I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you

You are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

You're just a small bump unknown and you’ll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
(Oh) Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide a small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes

I'll hold you tightly, I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you

You are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

You can lie with me, with your tiny feet when your half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me for a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one, and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

You were just a small bump unborn, for four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why",Small Bump
Ed Sheeran,"White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste

Lights gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the class A team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside, tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly, for angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes

Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the class A team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside, tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the class A team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

They scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside, tonight
And in the pipe fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly, angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly
Angels to die",A  Team
Ed Sheeran,"This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh

And I'll throw it all away
And watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall, now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing

And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I thrown it all away
Watched you fall, now

And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall
Down to earth
Take me back for

This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new",This
Ed Sheeran,"I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
End up forgetting things about myself
I'm stubborn I'm forward head's just blocked
My head's still with you but my hearts just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
That's why you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
Everything's great but everything's short
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied

Because if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down oh
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not he only one to feel low
Because if you want I'll take you in my arms
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know that god made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied

Ed Sheeran,"I should ink my skin
With your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it

See I could do without a tan
On my left hand, where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles

'Cause maybe you're lovable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter I'll
Hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty
If you did the same to me
Would you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it twelve times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too
And if your DVD breaks, today
You shoulda got a VCR
'Cause I never owned a Blu-Ray
True say

And now I've always been s*** at computer games and your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go all cross
And chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you'd laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always tryna get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot

So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand And I'll
Make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand

And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now

'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up",Wake Me Up
Ed Sheeran,"Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you at all
You need me man, I don't need you

You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper

Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow)

From day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back

Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a French church tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt

On a late night coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am

I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong

Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1

Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence

Oh well, she's a local girl
No make-up
Cos she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

Is it fast food
I'll regret it after
And I needed money
But I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her I love her
And she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty

She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek

So if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
I say I hate wasps too
I don't really dance
So I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that's alright
I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don't mind sharing

What you're wearing

When we’re resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5.01
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And I’m way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it’s cold outside, again

And we’re both so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I’ll take ya
But I’d rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa, with you

When the morning comes
We’re not watching Formula I
It’s not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain’t too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

Ed Sheeran,"I’m in so deep Omar Epps can relate to my situation on a real,
Pain ain’t the emotion I wanna feel but I’m thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I’ll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can’t afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It’s dark when I’m about just me myself and my shadow
I'm parro, running out of ammo, and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so it’s narrow
The less then the better, a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess I'm clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind’s infected with terror
No wonder I’m under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It easy when you look back, shoulda, woulda, coulda but I bet you can’t bring should woulda could back
Back to fifteen I said to myself, that I’m more than a hood track!

You can’t ever drown me out, the water supplies too low

I've never seen someone drown without, a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I’m choking? Seriously, do I sound like I’m joking?
I’m floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's sunk many years, I’m maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it’s in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I’m broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain’t close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this ain't tug of war, still don't get roped in the open, I don’t wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I’ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don’t wanna see this guy survive.

Ed Sheeran,"Hmm let me go,
To see my family.
Please Father let me go,
As my mother sleeps.

I don't know about days gone,
But round here nobody lives twice.
When your gone, your gone, without no bye,
Cause only a judge can give you life.
This is my advice,
Trust me, I nearly lost my life.
3 weeks after I got this ride
It seems like I had too much wine.
Which that I I didn't get one,
Anyway, I was going to the [?] booked for a set,
Even though I didn't have a set one.
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one.
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one.
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination,
Then I was off to the next one,
20 minutes later I was on the M1,
Tired.
But I kept on going,
Fell asleep without even knowing.
No emotion in my face,
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going.
Woke up,
Lorry,
Flash,
Panic,
Break,
Skid,
Crash,
Skidded,
More,
Bang,
Smash,
Out,
Cold,
Ribs,
Cracked,
Ouch.
I was in so much pain,
Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini,
When I was still on the first lane.
Baffled, didn't even know my name.
Fainted, too much shock in my brain.
Surrounded by paramedics and feds,
Trying to get up but fainted again.

See I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared,
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family,
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul,
Please Father let me go.
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps.

Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open,
I can hear voices and my phone ringing.
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning,
One of the worst situations I've been in.
I can hear all of the angels singing.

But when it stopped humming,
My brain turned on, stared running.
Still in pain, but it started numbing,
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning.
I still tried to do a few shows cause I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming.
But I was left with a permanent problem,
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside).
Ever so cunning,
6 weeks later, jogging and running.
I used the first aid kit like a drum set,
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming.
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes,
You can't afford to let one in.
Never done dream for a while,
The pipeline was blocked,
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing.
They say tomorrow never dies,
But he forgot to tell you 'you can'.
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang,
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam.
You can try beg for another,
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show,
Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother',
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner.

I just want you to take a second, hear me out.
Don't think I'm happy cause I smile when you see me out.
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared.
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,
To see my family.
And keep it inside,
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps.
Save my soul,
Please Father let me go.
Keep me safe.",Family
Ed Sheeran,"Hey
Can you hear me?
I just wanted to let you know
Hm

I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam'
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
'Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you.

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alone

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you, oh

I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out?'
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us.
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam' I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing.
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never wanna be alone

I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you, oh

It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you, when I see you but,
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you

There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
'Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot.
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me.

I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face,
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you?",Goodbye to You
Ed Sheeran,"I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
""'Cause real will recognize real"" is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.

Five o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z
Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
It's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

[Chorus]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be...
The times I'm living in lately.

I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die.
Never die.

Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true!
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.

Ed Sheeran,"Listen, Little Lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday.
It's 30 degrees Thursday, you work late.
You was with a perv making dirty, fake love in his Mercedes.
Maybe the word, rape, sums up events that take place every night. 
You wanna get up, but you know your legs will ache if you try",Little Lady
Ed Sheeran,"They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week,
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife,
Right now it's better than it's never been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me,
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak,
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it.
They chase dreams together like a slumber party,
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading.

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.

You better wake up cause I am making moves,
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms,
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training,
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze.
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading,
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception,
cause they try to hit misses with my direction,
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike,
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night,
The haters know where the family lives,
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger.
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it.
They say sleep is the cause of death,
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading.
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next.

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.
They watching me! They watch me sleep!

Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality,
And daydream about losing my sanity.
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow.
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed.
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat.
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep.
See, all the dreams I'm fonder,
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I Mr hard worker,
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up,
And I missed my chance worst luck,
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish,
thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress

[Chorus]
When the darkness creeps in,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
And when my dreams are sleeping,
I feel my nightmares watching me.
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me.

Ed Sheeran,"Hi, my name is JME, there was a time when radio played me
'Cause my music came from my heart, it was real to me
But now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real, 
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal,
Sometimes I sit back and think JME just do one tune, make a couple G's and chill,
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is, unfair, straight 
Who could tell me different, look at me, determined,
Man on a mission, my music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'm a do this

Now I need an A list just to chart oho

I get in, forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, 
And I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? 
The song was not a hit on the radio, 
Oho, oho, oho, oh, oh, oh

Thank God for night clubs and the raves
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down, but cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bullet proof booth,
You won't hear me on the radio, 
But go to the rave and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

I never had a playlist in my heart, oho

Oho, oho, oho, oh, oho, oh

I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, rhythm by the pile,
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the base line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?
Are you gonna play me, though, 
This song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing,

Ed Sheeran,"These thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid
the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits
I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum
It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots

Whats better than thinking about the ones you love
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm in the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up
No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone


And when the sun falls down I'll be up again
I never close my eyes,
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)

I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
'Cause you're been trespassing, and you won't leave my mind
Now even think about this, call me say, yes nan
I'm 31 now I'm still saying yes nan
You had to replace my mom, dad 2 parents in one
I know your proud staring at your grandson
I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I
like
Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin'
And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must
now I gotta fly
My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock,
I don't stop at night.


And when the sun falls down I'll be up again
I never close my eyes,
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)

Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated

Another mind
Another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Another tear
Another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated

Another love that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated

Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?

But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love,
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends all they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school, listening to grown ups
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything other than that

So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way
You wanna be loved

I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words, to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time

We can nurse it, she said,
Come inside for a little lie down with me,
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worse thing.

But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder,
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
And let me hold you, oh.

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,
My little bird.

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew,
We can lie down, so I'm next to you,
Come inside for a little home made tea,
And if you fall asleep, at least you're next to me,
And if I wake up, say it's late love, go back to sleep,
I'm covered by nature, and I'm safe now,
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me.

That I'd never leave her
Now I'm ready to go
And strange as it seems
She's endless to me
She's just like paperwork
But harder to read

Patience, my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans
And she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn't sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time
I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me
For dear life
And blocking my way

Patience, my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
Won't you stay?
She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I'll stay, anyway
Cos she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself",She
Ed Sheeran,"Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I'm next to you

Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you?
Do I hate you?
I can't make up my mind
So let's freefall
See where we land

It's been this way since we were young
We'll fight and then make up
I'll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch

Tell me your secrets

Do I hate you?

Ed Sheeran,"White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause she's just under the upper-hand
And goes mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes

Ed Sheeran,"You and I, two of a mind
This love’s one of a kind
You and I, we’re drifting
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

You and I, learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
You and I, we’re lifted over the edge
And I will fall for you

If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

Ed Sheeran,"I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one
To help me get to sleep

And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

It's only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

It's only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

Ed Sheeran,"Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you breathe me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton
I'll take you along the Pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened
I'll make it disappear, dear

Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand
If you'll let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
You squeeze me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
This love's too overrated
See what's going on, on

Ed Sheeran,"Filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you won’t remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother

I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar

When summer’s gone
I’ll still sing a song
Of you in September

Ed Sheeran,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all.
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to.

There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore.

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make.

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love.

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again

Ed Sheeran,"Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you’re lying in the bed again
Either way I’ll cry with the rest of them

And my father told me, son
It’s not his fault he doesn’t know your face
And you’re not the only one
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside, a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we’re wrapped in light, in life, in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they’re designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we’re set alight, we’re afire love, love, love oh

And things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
And now we’re left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie standin' in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when

And my father told me, son
It’s not his fault he doesn’t know your face
And you’re not the only one
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside, a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we’re wrapped in light, in life, in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they’re designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we’re set alight, we’re afire love, love, love oh

Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing halellujah

How'd I get so faded

No no don’t leave me lonely now

Ed Sheeran,"I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
Well be in between the sheets 'till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
She's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about
Maybe well go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why I'm sat here singing

Don't  with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize that you want it
It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love

Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end

I can’t work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us

And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
When you’re on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
No, easy baby, maybe I’m a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can’t shake this feeling now
We’re going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop

And oh, I’ve only caused you pain, you know
With all of my words, always beloved
Of all the lies spoke
When you’re on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
No, easy baby, maybe I’m a liar

Ed Sheeran,"Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm twenty seven, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore",The Man
Ed Sheeran,"I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing the bells
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And read stacks while the speakers play
I’ll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high, two cars, we needed to breathe
We used each other’s edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time’s the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'mma wait too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You’d be wearing my hood
With jewels, strings pulled tight
To keep your face in the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we D on the road
'Cause every day when I was a baby
Don’t you speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
And if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to burrow all of the ‘queltics’ are disappearing
You call me selfish, I don’t understand
But I can’t help it
I put my trouble for everything
Except my family and friends
But you’ll be in between forever
So I guess we’ll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I’m not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain
Or wait to get on the plane
But in the day we’ll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain’t never coming home
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
'Cause that’s you and me
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, oh won’t you leave me now

Oh Nina (Love will come and love will go)
You should go Nina (But you can make it on your own)
'Cause I ain’t never coming home (Sing that song, go)
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina (People grow, and fall apart)
And then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)
'Cause that’s you and me (Take it back)
Both in a road, won’t you leave me now
Now

Oh Nina (Love will come and love will go)
You should go Nina (But you can make it on your own)
'Cause I ain’t never coming home (Sing that song, go)
In a road, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina (People grow, and fall apart)
And then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)

Ed Sheeran,"Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
Just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong?

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one",One
Ed Sheeran,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Hm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""",Photograph

I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I don’t wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna runaway
Runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, socks, in the morning, go

""How long you leaving?""
""Well Dad just don’t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this""
It’s been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way but
I love him from the skin to my bones, ah
But I don’t wanna miss home, ah
There’s nothing to save and he knows, ah
I’ll just runaway in the overnight

I’ve never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone, and the kitchen lie
I tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what I’m gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it’s morning, go

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
'Cause I packed my clothes
My dad wasn’t in with that plan too bit tired and turns to show up
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us the same
To get the good nose up
I don’t wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces, and hold that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

I love him from the skin to my bones, ah
But I don’t wanna miss home, ah

Ed Sheeran,"It’s late in the evening
Glass on the side now
I’ve been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don’t wanna know
If you’re getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man’s land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling
Won’t you let me know, oh
Oh ooh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe, oh
Oh ooh

Sing, oh oh
Oh oh
Louder, oh oh
Sing, oh oh

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local raid, no
I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said it’s nice to meet ya
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she’s a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I’m in deep
If anybody finds out I’m meant to drive home
But I’m drunk and gonna live it now no?
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now she’s kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling
Won’t you let me know, oh

If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe, oh

Sing, oh oh

Louder, oh oh
Sing, oh oh

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don’t really wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so hoped you'd take my hand, darling
Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it, oh
Can you feel it, oh no no no?

(Sing) I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling
Won’t you let me know (louder), oh

Ed Sheeran,"You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Hoping that you'll understand

Ed Sheeran,"Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's son

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out for the rope, sent by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out for the rope
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
And I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father hold fast and we will

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
And I see fire, blood in the breeze

Ed Sheeran,"I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You'll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya and you'll think of him
And pretty soon you'll be floating away

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss, bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make up
I'll never trust you again
You can just be a friend

And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won't dry

Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild

I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm, I'm drowning in the oceans you made

Ed Sheeran,"I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over
Like your stepfather
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old, yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at the subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens is from now on
I'll be ready to start again at the end of the song
Still their claiming that I handled it wrong
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
I'm healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses
Rubber dinghy rapids
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic
I'm battling for respect
I don't know if I'll have it
This songs from the heart
Cover the planet
I'll take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Take it back now
Now I don't ever want to be perfect
Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart break
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again
Living life on the edge
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No

Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love

So I'll make my way 
Through long winding country roads

On the phone it's amazing
From the street to the craziest places I've seen

In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me

I spend my days
Just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats 
For my home and my English rose

I met a man 
In the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me ""son
You know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea""

And I found truth 
In people I barely know

Ed Sheeran,"You give me life
Like lots of oxygen
You treat me like
I was in love again
And I hold you tight
Tight enough to know
That you are mine
I'd never let you go

And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss
So let it out
And let it out, now
And let it out
And let it out now, now

And you speak to me
Behind your dark green stare
And you let me be
As if I wasn't there

It seemed perfect,
The concept,
Free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart
You see we were just like glue

It's you I miss
And it's you I miss
So let it out

Ed Sheeran,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes

When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes and
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill",Castle on the Hill [Acoustic]

Ed Sheeran,"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way, ""I won't be doing this again""
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, ""always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
So no man call ya, bibia be ye ye

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seems and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Ed Sheeran,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I find another use of key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""baby, I just want to dance""

She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun

And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room

After dancing to Kaleigh,singing to trad tunes

A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl

Ed Sheeran,"Walking down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'd feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
I know I was happier with you

Just know that I'll be waiting here for you",Happier
Ed Sheeran,"She is the sweetest thing that I know
You should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pot hole, every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell, fill my lungs
Spent my summer time beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame
Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread
Oh my, hold this, oh this, I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Well I found love in the inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear

Ed Sheeran,"You are the one girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms round you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?

Ed Sheeran,"I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya

On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border

She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, met her at Guy's in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her

Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border

She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya

From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

Ed Sheeran,"No, no, no, no, no

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears both shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet at watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Louis Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to

We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says, chune, boy never light up the room
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisp, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man

But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to

Darling just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet 
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love

Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Ed Sheeran,"I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or dream
What line do we stand upon 'cause from here looks the same?
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills

So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

And I pass on these things my family's given to me

Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go

Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth

And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle",Mam'selle
Ed Townsend,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love. 
Love.",Prisoner of Love
Ed Vezinho,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love
Ed Vezinho,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight

We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

"Ed Wiley, Jr.","To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there

Edan,"Prince Paul already used this loop
But I'ma keep it movin' and put you up on the scoop
I first saw the world in 78
Around the same time rap music source first played
Nowadays my name should be the kingpin with words
Kids should drop my personality like King Tim the third
Word to the fat back queen with the sugar hills
I should be splicing verse without the payment of a dollar bill
I gots to chill though or think about sex
'Cause if whiskey fills my third leg
Or should I say the second neck?
Connect the dots with all the faggots making records
Who couldn't suck a dick or put the gloss on the upper lip
They can't fuck with this I'm just too vivid
Like rainbows falling out the sky and turn liquid
My word systems turn your scene to tangerine
The kid sees colors flashing wild on his movie screen

Red and yellow and pink and green
Purple and orange and blue
I can sing a rainbow
I can sing a rainbow

I love most brothers but someone told me that I burn bridges
I simply use a rapper's bones to build to build my third niche
I work with the aesthetic of a brain medic
Cutting up the reels with crystal shards to make the tape edit
I take lettuce, onions, tomatoe
Add a dab of mayo plus the fish fillet-o
Appetizing gray matter with a strange platter
The symmetry of energy with chemistry and plasma
After you latch on to lost masters
Come back to re-evaluate the now chapter
Style masters born to make classics
And paint canvas geometric break dances
The almighty made Saturn caves and caverns
The flames of magma rivers in Niagara
All of this beauty can be yours to discover
Can't you see it brother?
Without the LSD I see colors

Red and yellow and pink and green
Purple and orange and blue
I can sing a rainbow
I can sing a rainbow

Red and Yellow and gray and black
All the colors that represent my past
But now they're just a part of
The shadows of my mind",I See Colours
Edan,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.

Eddi Reader,"She won't recover from her losses 
She's not chosen this path
But she watches who it crosses
Maybe move to the right
Maybe move to the left
So we can all see her pain she wears 
Like a banner on her chest
And we all say it's sad
And we think it's a shame
And she's called to our attention
But we do not call her name

Of the world in her hands

'Cause we're busy with our happiness
And busy with our plans
I wonder if alone she wants it 
Taken from her hands
But if things didn't keep getting harder
She might miss her sacred chance 
To go a consecrated martyr
The girl with the weight 
Of the world in her hands

I wonder which saint 
That lives inside a bead
Will grant her consolation 
When she counts upon her need
It makes us all angry 
Though we feign to care
But who will be the scale 
To weigh the cross she has to bear
The girl with the weight 
Of the world in her hands

Is the glass half-full or empty
I ask her as I fill it
She said it doesn't really matter
Pretty soon you're bound to spill it
With the half logic language 
Of the sermon she delivers
And the way she smiles so knowingly 
At me gives me the shivers
I pull the blanket higher 
When I'm finally safe at home
And she'll take a hundred with her
But she always sleeps alone
The girl with the weight 
Of the world in her hands

I wonder which saint 
That lives inside a bead
Will grant her consolation 
When she counts upon her need

Eddi Reader,"We had an apartment in the city.
Me and my husband liked living there.
It's been years since the kids have grown,
a life of their own, left us alone.

John and Linda live in Omaha.
Joe is somewhere on the road.
We lost Davy in the Korean war.
I still don't know what for, don't matter any more.

You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,
""Hello in there. Hello""

Me and my husband, we don't talk much anymore.
He sits and stares through the backdoor screen.
And all the news just repeats itself
like some forgotten dream
that we've both seen.

Someday I'll go and call up Judy.
We worked together at the factory.
Ah, but what would I say when she asks what's new?
Say, ""Nothing, what's with you?
Nothing much to do.""

You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
ah, but, but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,

and you should spot some hollow ancient eyes,
don't you pass them by and stare
as if you didn't care.
