Little Walter,"You know it ain't right to treat me like you do
You know it ain't right to treat me like you do
When you don't want me to, do these things to you
You know it ain't right to treat me this-a way
You know it ain't right to treat me this-a way
Takes my money, and go off to play
You know it ain't right to say what you did
You know it ain't right to say what you did
You've got another man, and you can't keep it hid
You know it ain't right to stay out all night long
You know it ain't right to stay out all night long
I ain't got nobody, to carry my business on

Little Willie John,"Hear my voice, where you are, take a train, steal a car,
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me.
Catch a flame, catch a breeze, on your hand, on your knees,
Swim up high, only please come on back to me.
On a mule, in a jet, with your hair in a net,
In a shower wet, I don't care.
This is where you should be, from the hills to the shore,
By the wind to my door, raise the highway dust,
Break the law if you must, throw the world, only just
Come back to me.

Blast your hide, you recall, must I fight City hall
Here and now, damn it all, come on back to me,
Where on earth must I be, still I yell till I'm blue,
In control then when you come on back to me.
Have you gone to the moon, or the corner saloon
And to crack and to croon, oh my girl, where in hell can you be?
In a crate, in a trunk, on a horse, on a junk,
In a road or a van, wrapped in mink or saran,

Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

My voice says make room
May the hand combat the gloom
When the ant comes creeping up
I spread my arms so I'd assume
My vest starts to bloom
With the breath that I consume
And I grow like grass on the hillside
It's the way I leave my tomb
Was it dark in there at all?
It was dark I must admit
Was it you that I heard call?
It was me from yonder pit
Was it what you thought was you?
It was me and someone else
I was crying out for you
In high and girly swell
Is the gleam you thought was gone
Beginning to return?
When you lay down on the lawn
Can't you feel its fiery burn
See the rooftops in the sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone
Hear the dooby doo
Boom

May the hand combat the gloom
When the dark slips in 
I spread my arms so why did I consume
The depth of its doom
With the brightness I resume
And I grow green leaves on my branches 
Its the way my blossoms bloom
Wasn't I the wind that blew?
Here is that what you allowed
To come wildly rushing through
You became a gambit howl
Was it finally coming true
It had never ceased to be
Wasn't I the light that grew
Wasn't that light born in me
Here is that what you have touched
When you weren't trying to
It was how you made so much
By forgetting what was you
See the rooftops in the sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone

This time, they tried to fill my pocket full of loot

Next time, they'll start to weep while I'm bailing
Next time, I'll have to wait through their wailing
Last time, they had to hang me like a poster
This time, they rode me like a rollercoaster,

Next time, they'll have to find if they wanna try
Next time, they'll have a long time to wonder why
I always turn my head when they walk by
I make believe my shoelace came untied

Oh I gotta do what I don't want to
High as the heaps that hunt and haunt you
Pouring to paint your peeling won't you

Pull a pal away when he's reeling don't you
Look at last time for one minute
I'll promise I'll try
Look at this time will and win it

With a gleaming in my eye
Look at next time search and squint it
Pull power from the sky
Look at what the light does when we're in it

So I wonder why, I stop to wonder why
Last time, they spread me shallow like the gravel
This time, they struck me twice like a gavel
Order in the court!

What court? is the question
Give no retort, leave everybody guessing
Last time, they bent me over like a rainbow
This time, they step through me like a tango

Next time, I'll abbreviate it so they won't lose their breath every time they say it
Oh I'll keep a song inside their head and bloom
Feed it sweet light, fertilize it with some tune
If words are the wrist then music's the perfume

Oh song from the mouth of friend or stranger
Dangerous bird or bird of danger
If you can keep up, well why won't you?
Songs everywhere, so I sing it, don't you?

Look at last time for one minute
I'll promise I'll try
Look at this time will and win it
With a gleaming in my eye

Look at next time search and squint it
Pull power from the sky
Look at what the light does when we're in it
Now I wonder why, I stop to wonder why

Last time, last time
This time, this time
Next time, next time
I'll try, I'll try, I'll try",Next Time

I know you understand
I have a love for what you do

Inside a simple glance that's tied to you
Wait there don't dare dismiss a feeling true

And I would not know this
I would not know this
No, I would not know this
Without knowing you

I know you understand

Little Wings,"Then, (Ida?) break the spell of change,
And so to duly rearrange,
The faces that you've seen before.
And, let the will of absence pour.

The gravity will keep you near,
Inside its arms that are so clear that
You may never even see them, but
Realize everything could be them.

Up and down your chest will rise.
There's no invisible disguise.
Your face is open sky sometimes.
Your chest a forest grown inside.

Feed it, let it grow, and replicate.
The universe, you know it has no weight.
It waits for magnets, waits for gravity.
So I know everything I have was sent for me.

Unwrap it all and skin me.
Climb on all the branches in me.
Look through light and see me in it.
Name the game so we can win it.

And, everything, oh everything,
In your cloaks you go,
Disguising what you work through,
Talking to me as I go.

And, become my life, become my time.
Become that year that's never mine.
Let that come through, let glory shine.
Grow up and feel the change inside.

Expand, expand like land horizon.
Sponge and water soak the skies.
Intake through what brought you by breathing
Life into the life you're leading.

First came dust and light,
So it's late at night,
And I can see the first thing in your
Headlights while we drive.

And we pull over.
I am sober.
My face looks older.
You touch my shoulder.

Now you've seen me.
Now I've seen you.
Now we try somehow to share the time
That we've been through.

And, I could feel the brains were born anew,
Anew by light of morning, walking
In the skin that grew.
It grew me and I grew it too.

It knew me and I knew it too.
And no one feels the day go through
Exactly in the way I do.
That's what makes me, me, and you, you.

And I can be what makes me.
And you won't be what breaks me.
And I can wait for all that wakes me,
In the way I've always done.

I'm finding out what chose me,
How to use the hand that rose me,
How to sing the word that woes me.
In a way I've just begun.

In a way I've just begun unravelling
This costume at the seams that I design.
I know it inside out.
I know that you attend may bring.

But whenever I am here,
I am aware of everything.

I'm something I can understand.
I am the sky, I am the land.
I am the foot, I am the hand.
I am the wave headed for sand.
I am the cattle and the brand.
I am the souvenir stand.
I am the hometown, local band.
I am the mic, I am the stand,
I'm everybody.",Everybody

Feel it's dark embrace
Your all alone except a million stars in space
As you walk lost and astray

With cold eyes that cannot see
Is it the echo of your footsteps that you hear
Or is it someone there?

Dance the walls when your out of sight
Creep up from behind
When you walk in the moonlight

This is rock medicine

The singing water

Listen
I am dancing underneath you
This was the way of it
It is a river
It is a chant
It is a medicine story
It is what happened long ago
It is a bead in a story belt
It is what has been forgotten
It is the smell of sweet grass and cedar

And prayers lifted to sky father
It is a way, a tradition
The way it was always done by the people
It is a feeling of warmth

Moved into my apartment at the university
The only one that lives here is me so why the phone ring all day long
I got no friends except Mike and he's gone for the summer
And I just want some peace and quiet
Come to my room and it's a telephone riot
Ringalingaling every time I take a step, can't sleep can't eat
Can't breathe can't bitch I can't get my work done
'cause people keep callin' with the same damn question
""Hello is Shaniqua there?"" ""Nah Shaniqua moved out last year
 I think you have the wrong number This is Little T""
""You mean Shaniqua's brother?""
""Man can't you just leave me alone

I wonder who Shaniqua is what she does and where she lives
Is she a hothead with too many zits, a movie star with inflatable tits
Does she take the train or drive in a car
Work in an office or down at the bar
How the hell should I know she could be a bino for all I care
""Hello is Shaniqua there?"" Yes she is but she can't talk now
She's busy milking our purple cow and talkin' to the Easter Bunny
""Man you think you're funny""
Shut up Beavis, I told you six times before

After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was hardly nothing left
But a bare and sore ground
Lite a stripped and dried out soul
Without body and skin
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
Reminding them of how old they are
Suddenly a force from above
Silenced the elegy
It was at the end of the day
It was at the end of the day
Although the beginning of a new and bright tomorrow
Deus ex machina...
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was a last sudden gust of wind
Before the life and freshness again
Touched every heart, mind and soul
And the comfortable summer breeze
Played with the green leaves of the hazel trees
Reminding them of how young
And beautiful they are
Echoing a sorrowless future to come
They thought about their lives
How satisfying they were
And they spoke with happy childlike voices
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters

Of her days and forever
Her heart is yours

One love she won't forget
She longs to give
Forever live
Her soul has such desire
She needs to love, admire
A tide to the shore

No vale of tears
No hauting fears
Another birth
She's joy on earth
Dancing like a child
So pure and wild
A virgin rose
She longs to be close

Into these silent waves of all times - eternally

We can go on
Stormy times will we behold ?
Do we still care
What future holds
So many words been said undone
The waves of green
They will flow on
Heal me, free me - dawning is near
Where is the saviour - for us to believe
As I sit here - on Norge's shores
Cries of the unheard - will they be heard
The waves of green - whispering my name

And the clock is finally dead

No matter where it leads, I know it will take me to the brink
And leave me there by myself and all alone with my dreams

You played the role of having sense
I always played the fool
Now something's different
I don't know the reason why
Whenever we separate
I almost want to cry

Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head

And when I come home late you don't complain or call
So as a consequence I don't go out at all
My friends are frightened
They don't know what's going on
They think you put a spell on me
And now my mind is gone

Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head

Love's not so bad they say
But you never know where love is gonna go
Does anybody really know?

I'm standing at the altar
As they play the wedding march
I'm in a black tuxedo with my collar full of starch
She looks as lovely as she's ever gonna get
I wake up from this nightmare in a pool of sweat

Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head

What you gonna do
What you gonna do when it comes and gets you?

Living Sacrifice,"Altered state of mind induced by terror
Repression, placed out of consciousness
Most profound betrayal
Most painful revelation
Dissociated memories
Provoke trapped anguish
Related sensation produce
Fear decades later
Most profound betrayal
Most painful revelation
Cease the entanglement from future abuse
Embark on a search walk in forgiveness



",Departure
Living Sacrifice,"In the mind of mortal man
The vision is tainted red
Consumed by anger, provoked bye words
That should never been said
Now all this mind seems to harbor are misplaces aggressions
Once released, they will seek
Reaping the sadistic intentions
In this time and age that maintains no aspect of order
Hard to see are these lines in which many souls border
Visual assistance show life as a harsh reality
The bitter effect produced not approved by society

Read the words, hear Christ speak
Refrain from anger, revert the cheek
Withheld in compassion, not signs of the weak
Seek humility for blessed are the meek

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow

Can't you see the music is just starting?

Fantasy could never be so giving
I feel free, I hope that you are willing
Pick the beat up, and kick your feet up
Dance with me

Livingston Taylor,"Rosie crossed the Rio Grande
In the middle of the night she swam
With all she could carry
In a plain cloth sack
Heading for the promised land
Never coming back

Friends and family stayed behind
To haul the crops at harvest time
They think about Rosie
And all those nights
She spent thinking of
Her city lights

City lights shining in her eyes
Spreading out like Christmas lights
Under California skies
When the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's got those city lights
To help her find her way

Times were hard and the jobs were few
City lights were so brand new
Down in the barrio
Good times were hard to find
So Rosie packs her cares
And up the hill she climbs
To see those

City lights shining in her eyes
Spreading out like Christmas lights
Under California skies
When the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's got those city lights
To help her find her way

Rosie never wants
Those dreams to fade away
Never wants to let the rain
Spoil a sunny day
So when the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's go those city lights
To help her find her way

City lights shining in her eyes
Spreading out like Christmas lights
Under California skies
When the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's got those city lights
To help her find her way",City Lights
Livingston Taylor,"Yes I'm Falling
Oh oh falling
Falling in love with you
Was easy as the day
A down man looked up to see
Nice things in his way
Falling in love with you
Was like that first sunrise
Was it in my window
Or was it in your eyes

And I call myself an island
And luckily I find
That you're the sea around me
And are with me for all time

Falling in love with you
Was learning how to cry
And telling you I'm all alone
Oh please don't pass me by

Was learning how to see

Why did I stop to hesitate
On my way home

'Bout loving and hating and all of the rest
And ideas I've roamed

Then I saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and
Find I'm blind

My thoughts they make a tender smile
My hands they move and in a while
I've got what I want.
That tenderness that you insist you feel
Ain't worth a damn 'cause it ain't real
Lord it sure does haunt.

Then you saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and find you're blind.

If you've got the time
And don't surprise me or you'll find
That I'm completely blind.

Now I'm so sick of what's being said
My thoughts they burn inside my head
There's not much untouched.
All of my children begin to cry
They clutch at me demanding why
Tell 'em 'bout loving and such.

Livingston Taylor,"Matthew was a country boy
Until one day he found
That cheatin' folks was easier
Than plowin' his daddy's ground

He left his farm in Ohio
Bound for Chicago town
He crossed Big Jim and turned his back
A bullet laid him down

And as he lay there dying
He begged, ""Will I see my Ohio?""
In my reply, I lied a bit
And said I did not know

Jim McCall was meek and small
And to become a man
He'd have to build himself up tall
With fancy folks and land

He threw some stones at honest friends
And got himself these things
His children left him and he sneered
""That's what my kindness brings""

And in the South End he got lost
And asked me where to go
In my reply, I lied a bit
And said I did not know

And lazy Susan called me up
She'd heard I stole the show
In my reply I lied a bit
And said I did not know
In my reply I lied a bit
And said I did not know

I believe our hearts can find
A way to push back all that time

Waiting for your call.

You were walking that walk, smiling that smile

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now

The world becomes your lucky star 
You wander around like a peacock 
With your lover on your arm 

Next time you fall 
You think you've heard it all 
No one could turn your insides out 
And your friends hear you say 
If your heart slips away 
I'll wonder what its all about 

And it's first time love, giving you fever 
Second time love, cooling your brow 
Finally love takes your hand in the dark 
And leads you home somehow 

So never say never another 
Just because somebody broke your heart 
Get your chin off the floor 
You'll never know what's in store 
If you don't give love a chance to start 
And if you don't believe in following feelings 

It's never too late to start 
Cause when you open your eyes 
Then you'll realize 
I'm the one who's chasing your heart 

Well it's first time love, giving you fever 
Second time love, cooling your brow 
Finally love takes your hand in the dark 
And leads you home somehow 

And it's first time love making your heart beat 
Second time love making it stop 
Finally love picks you up from the bottom

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills

Watching the lake turn the sky into blue-green smoke
The sun was setting to the left of the plane
And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow
In 27-D, I was behind the wing
Watching landscape roll out like credits on a screen

The earth looked like it was lit from within
Like a poorly assembled electrical ball
As we moved out of the farmlands into the grid
The plan of a city was all that you saw
And all of these people sitting totally still
As the ground raced beneath them, thirty-thousand feet down

It took an hour, maybe a day
But once I really listened the noise just fell away

And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video
The stewardess came back and checked on my drink
In the last strings of sunlight, a Brigitte Bardot
As I had on my headphones
Along with those eyes that you get
When your circumstance is movie-size

When I can dazzle them

As I got light as a feather they got stiff as a board
I can't feel any more, but I can fake it forever",My Bionic Eyes
Liz Phair,"Lying wide awake in the dark
Trying to figure out where you are
Always going nowhere
'Fraid of going somewhere
And somewhere's a place in your heart

Sometimes when I think about you
Why you're always running away
Sitting in your car
Changing who you are
And drowning the thoughts of your life in the music

[Chorus]
Scared the lights will turn green
You'll have to be seen
You'll be like anybody else
Scared the lights will turn red
You're stuck in your head
You can't commit to even her

How you gonna get through the year?
You can't 

Playing on the sides of the net
Too many people want too many things
And you only want to forget

[Chorus]

How you gonna make it through?

You're always listenin'
You're always listenin'
You're always listenin' to yourself

You're always thinkin'
You're always thinkin'
You knew what everybody else
Should do with their lives

Lying wide awake in the dark
Trying to figure out where you are
Always going nowhere

And somewhere's a place in your heart
Somewhere's a place in your heart

What's give or take nine years anyway
I'll bet you that cigarette
You won't regret my time

So uncomplicated, so in tune
Just take off my dress

Wanna know all the details of my disaster
Like an accident on the side of the road
When you're driving past slow but there's nothing to see here

Wanna take a look, take a look [Repeat: x4]

I'm some kind of freak now and
You'll never see me the same

Are you sure you wanna find out?
Cause once you know the truth
You might wish you'd walked away

To put my cards on the table?
And would it liberate you
If you knew what I knew?

Do you think I wander through, half-blind?
I see the things you hide

Everything about you
Cause I would never want to find out
What I thought wasn't true

Your mind is a place I don't need to embrace
What you've got in your heart is enough
For me to start breaking through
Closer to you
Closer to you

I love you as you are
Here and not too far
Out of view
I love the way you walk
To hear it when you talk
Like you do

But I would never want to choose
What I like best
About you
Cause I would never want to spoil
That mystery
With a clue

Your mind is a place I don't need to embrace
What you've got in your heart is enough
For me to start
With enough holes in my soul
I don't need your rock-n-roll to stay in tune
And open to you
Open to you

Oh the abyss
Mess of all those frustrating fools
They wander all around
Black and white, no sound, no improvements

But I see something on a TV
With a smell and a choice
When I feel yours and my heart beating
With the wealth of the universe

Your mind is a place I don't need to embrace
What you've got in your heart is enough
For me to start making your happiness my own
Open up and let me show what I can do
When I am closer to you

I want to bring down all those demons who drank with me
Feasting bleed through me

And I promise that I'll make some changes

But reaching back it occurs to me

The minutes tick by 'til the watch face turns black

Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go

I wanna go

I wanna go

On the phone
But you're not at home
And the trees are blown
By the wind
Please let me say,
I had a hard one today
I never could feel ok
Alone

I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go

I wanna go

Liz Phair,"The trick to happiness is to ignore anything negative you might
Feel about yourself
That people don't really like you that much
That you got fat because you are lonely
Or that your parents are going to die

I like to get my coffee with all the little frothy things on the side
And I like to put in those little sticks

The trick to freedom is to deny your past regrets
Questionable lovers, lies, drunken weekends

I just like to have a lot of energy
My life demands it
Everything's up, all the time
Up, up, up!

[Chorus]
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
How high? to the sky!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
How high? to the sky!

People like positive people
Positivity makes good things happen

My husband doesn't let me buy those tabloid magazines
'Cause he says that it makes me fight with him more

Pills that you mix with wine
That your husband and you aren't having sex anymore
That you got married for the money
It's been positively proved that most top 40 hits have a BPM
Of one twenty or more

I definitely like the gin-song
And the ginko bal-boa?

[Chorus]

Sometime you picture yourself getting impaled
On an imaginary spike sticking out from over your bed
When you keep forgetting to call somebody back
But the more time goes by, the less you feel like calling
Because you're embarrassed

'Cause it kind makes you freaky
And you don't want people to think you're freaky
Even though you are kind of freaky
But only in the bedroom
L-O-L

My mom says I'm really hard on my kids
I don't want them growing up thinking
That everything's just going to be handed to them
They're going to have to work their asses off, just like I did!
You know, we get them up at six in the morning
We're like 'come on! get up! get outta bed!'
'It's gonna be a great day C'mon! up, up, up!'

Liz Phair,"I was tripping looking at my portfolio
Wondering how I was gonna make enough dough y'know
Called up a friend who wrote for One Tree Hill and Jericho
He had a job for me, and check it, with a four-letter company

Get it on
Get it on

Hey, I got a proposition for ya
How 'bout you let me keep my profits as a scorer
Record sales are shrinking, I'm gettin' poorer
I got a kid to feed, how about you cut a deal with me

Ha! Hey look, Liz we see you as a commodity
We've been with you since Day One and that's an oddity

And after a series of phone calls
To the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor,
I reached my representative, who pulled out the contract
From the File Cabinet
On microfiche
In the form of Tablets
Made of stone
Then he said

Let me see, it's here in my folder
Oh shit, you're twenty years older
Still hot, but getting a lot colder
And you wanna cut a what with me

Let me tell you how it's done here in the Hollywood
Maybe you was thinking you was in the Bollywood

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Liza Lee,"Baltimore Oriole
Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho-down Louisiana
Where a two-tiin' Jaybird
Met the divine Miss O

I'd like to ruffle his plumage
That Baltimore Oriole
Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgivin' is easy-it's a woman like, now and then
Could happen to thing
Send her back home
Home ain't home without her warbling
How she can sing
Make a lonely man happy, Baltimore Oriole
Come down from that bough
Fly to your daddy now",Baltimore Oriole
Liza Manili,"Si tu me prêtes tes Lego,

Tu me rendras un peu moins bête,
Un peu plus belle, plus sage peu être,

Celles que je n’ai jamais confiées

J’ai renoncé, tout recommencé,

A jeter tes yeux dans le vide,

Le temps de dire, que je vous ai aimé

Mourir de toi, partir pour toi
M’abandonner encore une fois

Allongé sur le sable, je ne peux que savourer
Le bruit des vagues, qui viennent me bercer
Tu ma quitté la nuit passé, ton abandon va me tuer

Mourir de toi, partir pour toi
M’abandonner encore une fois

Ma tête explose, plus le temps de penser
Seule la douleur est mon allié, ton odeur s’est évaporée
Je ferme les yeux, arrête de respirer

Sous nos airs, désabusés
Alors pourquoi, refuser
De se laisser consummer
Par cette amour dont on rêvait

Not a loser anymore

So nobody loves me

Liza Minnelli,"About a year ago - I heard this truly terrific, absolutely true story
And it just so happens that I told a couple of friends of mine this truly terrific, absolutely true story 
And it just so happens that these friends of mine are song writers
And guess what happened, right, truly terrific, absolutely true song

Gather around, I've got a story to tell, About a Manhattan lady that I know very well
She lives at five Riverside, her name is Shirley Devore, And she travelled 'round the world to meet the guy next door

Well there was trouble inside apartment 29 E, 'Cause Shirley's mother and dad were as upset as can be
They said we hate to complain dear and we don't like to grouse, But your nearly 32, you should get out of the house

You gotta ring them bells, you gotta ring them bells, You gotta make 'em sing and really ring them bells
It's such a happy thing to hear 'em ting-a-ling, You gotta ring - them - bells

Well Shirley was 31, which she was loathe to admit, And she had never been loved, which didn't thrill her a bit
And so she sat and she thought, she thought for hours on end, And said I'll go to Chase, Manhattan, where I got me a friend

And so she borrowed a thou' and called TWA, And told her mother and dad that she was up and away
I'm gonna travel the continent, a month, maybe two, And haul me home a hus' if it's the last thing I do

You gotta ring them bells, you gotta ring them bells, You gotta make 'em sing and really ring them bells
It's such a happy thing to hear 'em ting-a-ling, You gotta ring - them - bells

She met a Londoner first, but they did not hit it off, 'Cause every time she approached he got a bronchial cough
And so she went to Madrid and met a handsome Senior, But he liked to throw the bul",Ring Them Bells
Liza Minnelli,"Some people can get a thrill, knitting sweaters and sitting still
That's OK for some people don't know they're alive
Some people can thrive and bloom, living life in a living room
That's perfect for some people of one hundred and five
But I, at least gotta try

When I think of all the sights that I gotta see
And all the places I gotta play, All the things that I gotta be at
Come on papa, what'd ya say?

Some people can be content, playin' bingo and payin' rent
That's livin' for some people, for some hum-drum people, too be
But some people, ain't me

I had a dream, a wonderful dream, papa
All about June in the Orpheum circuit
Give me a chance, I know I can work it, Uhh, what a dream
And it was just as real as could be, papa
Well just listen to me, there I was in Mr Orpheum's office
And he was sayin' to me, Rose!
Get yourself some new orchestrations, new routines and red velvet curtains
Get a feathered hat for the baby, photographed in front of the theater
Get an agent and in jig time, you'll be being booked in the big time

Oh what a dream, a wonderful dream, papa
And all that I need is eighty-eight bucks, Papa, that's it
That's what he said papa, only eighty-eight bucks, papa

It's uh, yeah, but it's only eighty-eight bucks
It's not like I'm askin' for a second mortgage on this place
What do ya gettin' so crick, why you gettin' crazy, it's eighty-eight lousy bucks
What do you mean I ain't gettin' eighty-eight cents out of you
Well, I'll get it, and I'll get my kids, out, now

Goodbye, to blueberry pies, good ridance to all the socials I had to go to
All the lodges that I had to play, all the shriners I said hell",Some People

Liza Minnelli,"When the sun goes down
I open up my window for hours and I watch

Every passing stranger
Every early shadow, I wonder if it's you

Always I'm dreaming, and recklessly scheming
How to get you back in my life

I want you now
And I'm prepared to take chances
I've told you how
I won't take no for an answer

Every empty evening
The sailors sit downstairs, drinking 'til they fight

Shout and raucous laughter
Sounds of breaking glass shatter through the night

The men from the circus are juggling with knives
The acrobats fall just like you

I want you now
And I'm prepared to take chances
I've told you how
I won't take no for an answer
I won't take no for an answer

Now you're miles away
'Cross the sea, out of reach, unheard
I've cried to you for help
But the wind blows away all my words

You sat there once beside me
Where the actors play, you kissed me every night

When you left you promised
You'd soon be back to stay, and it would be alright

Now I'm abandoned, my letters unanswered
Got to get you back in my life

I want you now (I want you now)
And I'm prepared to take chances
I've told you how (I've told you how)
I won't take no for an answer

Liza Minnelli,"Men of affairs, women with power
Satellites talking, to clatter our lives
Banks of predictions, policies made
Prophecies broken, violence deranged (deranged, deranged)

And if there was love, would that be enough?
And if there was love, would that be enough?
Pollsters and planners, incredibly sad

Indelibly inking, their names across our lives
Individual freedom, intrinsically curbed
Inspiration nil, slavery ten

And if there was love, would that be enough?
And if there was love, would that be enough?
And if there was love, would that be enough?
And if there was love, would that be enough?

I've been working for a long time
Scattering smiles
Must I swallow my pride?
There's a hole in the sky, as distant and vast

As our moral vacuum, and growing as fast
And if there was love, would that be enough?
And if there was love, would that be enough?
And if there was love, would that be enough?
And if there was love, would that be enough?

""They that have power to hurt and will do none,
That do not do the thing they most do show,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmoved, cold and to temptation slow;

They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
And husband nature's riches from expense;
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others but stewards of their excellence.

The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
Though to itself it only live and die,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:

For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.""",If There Was Love
Liza Minnelli,"The sun comes up, I think about you
The coffee cup, I think about you
I want you so, it's like I'm losing my mind

The morning ends, I think about you
I talk to friends and think about you
And do they know it's like I'm losing my mind?

All afternoon doing every little chore
The thought of you stays bright
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor
Not going left, not going right

I dim the lights and think about you
Spend sleepless nights to think about you
You said you loved me, or were you just being kind?
Or am I losing

Liza Minnelli,"You dress me up, I'm your puppet 
You buy me things, I love it 
You bring me food, I need it 
You give me love, I feed it 

And look at the two of us in sympathy 
With everything we see 
I never want anything, it's easy 
You buy whatever I need 

But look at my hopes, look at my dreams 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 

You phone me in the evening on hearsay 
And bought me caviar 
You took me to a restaurant off Broadway 
To tell me who you are 

We never-ever argue, we never calculate 
The currency we've spent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 
I love you, you pay my rent 

I'm your puppet

Liza Minnelli,"If this is a ghetto, I'm in it with you
If it's just a prison, I'm locked in it too
I tried to leave you but after all that we had said
I went to pieces when I should have shouted and screamed instead
So sorry, I said

Your powers of persuasion, those quizzical eyes
Have tired and tied me with innocent guile
I would have walked out and after all the tears we shed
I should have stalked out gone and painted the town bright red but instead
So sorry, I said

How tough it gets, don't talk to me about it
To pay off your debts, I worked on overtime
And you say you never believed in luck

If you need a reason, consider me mad
An old retainer, loyal and sad
I bought my freedom but after all that we had shared
I couldn't leave you, think of the skins I'd have to shed instead

Wipe the miles away
I like to think that I can be so willed
And never do what you say
And never do what you say

Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
In my hands you know you'll never be

We just poked a little empty pie
For the fun that people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
The timid smile, and pause to free
I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll
Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
In my hands you know you'll never be

Read them good and well

Liza Minnelli,"Thank you very much, you're really terrific
And seeing how you are, can I tell ya something, I have a problem
No wait, it's not a big problem, but it is a problem
It's my name, you know I find that still - a lot of people call me Lisa - Wrong
My name is Liza - Liza - has a 'Z' in it
Well, for instance, somebody'll come up to me on the street and say
Hello Lisa how are you, I'll say, I'm fine thank you but it's Liza
Or somebody'll say - Lisa what a nice hat you have on
I'll say thank you very much but my name is Liza and that's my hair
So you can see what I mean
Anyway, I've been trying to figure out a final solution to this whole thing
And I think I've come up with the answer - Jack

It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza
I'll do it again
It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza

Now - if my name were Ada, I'd be Ada, even backwards I'd be Ada
Or if my name were Ruth, then I'd be Ruth because with Ruth what can you do
Or Sally, or Margaret or Ginger or Faye
But when you're a Liza you always have to say

Nn - It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza

In the magic of moonlight when I sigh, ""Hold me close, dear""

Well, chances are your chances are awfully good

Could make me be true, could make me be blue;
And even be glad, just to be sad, thinking of you.

Some others I've seen, might never be mean;
Might never be cross, or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else, gave me a thrill - with all your faults, I love you still.

It had to be you.",It Had to Be You

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

And no egos, Amigos, together!

With you for me and me for you,
We'll muddle through whatever we do.
Together, wherever we go.

We're gonna go through it together.
Wherever we sleep, if prices are steep,
We'll always sleep cheaper together.

Who, me-oh? No, you-oh.

Now all we need is someone with nerve.

Dans un très vieil appartement rue Sarasate
J'ai pour me tenir compagnie
Une tortue deux canaris et une chatte.
Pour laisser maman reposer
Très souvent je fais le marché et la cuisine
Je range, je lave et j'essuie,
A l'occasion je pique aussi à la machine.
Le travail ne me fait pas peur
Je suis un peu décorateur un peu styliste
Mais mon vrai métier c'est la nuit.
Que je l'exerce travesti, je suis artiste.
Jai un numéro très spécial
Qui finit en nu intégral après strip-tease,
Et dans la salle je vois que
Les mâles n'en croient pas leurs yeux.
Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

Vers les trois heures du matin
On va manger entre copains de tous les sexes
Dans un quelconque bar-tabac
Et là on s'en donne à cœur joie et sans complexe
On déballe des vérités
Sur des gens qu'on a dans le nez, on les lapide.
Mais on le fait avec humour
Enrobés dans des calembours mouillés d'acide
On rencontre des attardés
Qui pour épater leurs tablées marchent et ondulent
Singeant ce qu'ils croient être nous
Et se couvrent, les pauvres fous, de ridicule
Ça gesticule et parle fort.
Ça joue les divas, les ténors de la bêtise.
Moi les lazzi, les quolibets
Me laissent froid puisque c'est vrai.
Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

A l'heure où naît un jour nouveau
Je rentre retrouver mon lot de solitude.
J'ôte mes cils et mes cheveux
Comme un pauvre clown malheureux de lassitude.
Je me couche mais je ne dors pas
Je pense à mes amours sans joie si dérisoires.
A ce garçon beau comme un Dieu
Qui sans rien faire a mis le feu à ma mémoire.
Ma bouche n'osera jamais
Lui avouer mon doux secret mon tendre drame
Car l'objet de tous mes tourments
Passe le plus clair de son temps au lit des femmes

Que c'est bien la nature qui
Est seule responsable si

For the moon refused to shine
Couple sittin' underneath the willow tree
For love they'd pine

Little maid was kinda 'fraid of darkness
So she said, I guess I'll go
Boy began to sigh, looked up at the sky
Told the moon his little tale of woe

Shine on, shine on harvest moon, up in the sky-why
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July
Snowtime ain't no ti-ime to stay outdoors and spoon
So shine on, shine on harve-e-est moon

Don't make-a me wait too lo-ong
My love for you is much too strong
I ain't had no, I ain't had no lovin' since 
January, February, June or July
When all the skies are grey
I want to go inside and stay

So light up, oh light up
Fast or slow come past that door, and
Shi-i-i-ine on harvest moon
Gi-I've some love again
I ain't had none since a-Lord knows when
No time, ain't no time to stay outside a-and try to spoon
So shine on, shine on harvest moon
For me, for me and my gal
Pass that light, fair and kind
How much lo-ove will be mine

Harvest moon, come on, come on, come o-o-on
Shi-ine.",Shine on Harvest Moon [Live]
Liza Minnelli,"In a small cafe on a crowded night
In a spot of light stands the singer
Then the band begins and the beat is strong
And the room belongs to the singer

All the people turn to hear her sad refrain
And catch the cry of pain that's in her song
But in her haunted face and in her searching eyes
There is a sign that something's wrong

Now the eager crowd hangs on every word
But the sounds are slurred by the singer
Til' the people feel every aching part 
Of the broken heart of the singer

Still the song goes on about a love she knew
That seemed so sure, so true, but turned out wrong
And from the tears she shows nobody really knows
Is she the singer or the song
Is she the singer or the song

As the sad song ends she hits the final note
It catches in her throat but comes out strong
And as she bows and goes, nobody really knows
Was she the singer or the song
Was she the singer, or, the, song...

La-la-lah-la-lah, la-la-lah-la-lah, la-la-lah-la-lah...

Liza Minnelli,"Some people can get a thrill, knitting sweaters and sitting still
That's okay for some people don't know they're alive
Some people can thrive and bloom, living life in a living room
That's perfect for some people of one hundred and five
But I, at least gotta try

When I think of all the sights that I gotta see
And all the places I gotta play, All the things that I gotta be at
Come on papa, what'd'ya say?

Some people can be content, playin' bingo and payin' rent
That's livin' for some people, for some hum-drum people, to-oo be
But some people, ain't me

I had a dream, a wonderful dream, papa
All about June in the Orpheum circuit
Give me a chance, I know I can work it, uhh, what a dream
And it was just as real as could be, papa
Well just listen to me, there I was in Mr Orpheum's office
And he was sayin' to me, Rose!
Get yourself some new orchestrations, new routines and red velvet curtains
Get a feathered hat for the baby, photographed in front of the theater
Get an agent and in jig time, you'll be bein' booked in the big time

Oh what a dream, a wonderful dream, papa
And all that I need is eighty-eight bucks, Papa, that's it
That's what he said papa, only eighty-eight bucks, papa

It's uh, yeah, but it's only eighty-eight bucks
It's not like I'm askin' for a second mortgage on this place
What d'ya gettin so crick, why you gettin' crazy, it's eighty-eight lousy bucks
What do you mean I ain't gettin' eighty-eight cents outta you
Well, I'll get it, and I'll get my kids, out, now

Goodbye, to blueberry pies, good riddance to all the socials I had to go to
All the lodges that I had to play, all the Shriners I said hell",Some People [Live]
Liza Minnelli,"[Chorus]
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)

Where is the love you said you'd give to me
Soon as you were free, will it ever be, where is the love

You told me that you didn't lo-ove her
And you were gonna say goodbye-ye-ye
But if you really didn't mea-ean it
Why did you have to lie, where is the love

[Chorus]

Where is the love you said was mine all mine
Till the end of time, was it just a lie, Where is the love

If you had had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so-o-o
Don't leave me hangin' on to promises
You've got to let me know
Where is the love

Oh how I wish I'd never meet you
I guess it must have been my fa-a-ate
To fall in love with someone else's love
All I can do is wait

Oh where is the love, where is the love
Where is the love, where is the love
Where is the love",Where Is the Love?
Liza Minnelli,"The moment I saw him smile
I knew he was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
Though I dream of him all the while

But he doesn't know I exist
No matter how I may persist
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me
Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three

How can I ignore the boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me glance his way

And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore him
So I can't ignore him
The boy next door

I just adore him
So I can't ignore him
The boy next door",The Boy Next Door
Liza Minnelli,"Dancing in the dark 'til the tune ends
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends

To brighten up the night, I have you love

I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
Cause my heart belongs to Daddy

If I invite a some boy some night
To dine on my finnan haddie
It's just a pose, 'cause my baby knows
That my heart belongs to daddy

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love

Liza Minnelli,"A clown with his pants falling down
Or the dance that's a dream of romance
Or the scene where the villain is mean.
That's entertainment!
The lights on the lady in tights
Or he bride with the guy by her side
Or the ball where she gives it her all.
That's entertainment!
The plot can be hot, simply teeming with sex
A gay divorcee who is after her ex
It could be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his father and causes lots of bother.
The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for a loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt
The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!
It might be a fight like you see on the screen
A swain getting slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene
Where a ghost and a prince meet, and everyone ends in mincemeat.
The guy who was waving the flag
That began with the mystical hand
Hip hooray! The American way
The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!",That's Entertainment
Liza Minnelli,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",Trolly Song
Liza Minnelli,"What did I have that I don't have?
What did he like that I lost track of?
What did I do that I don't do the way I did before?

What isn't there that once was there?
What have I got a great big lack of?
Something in me that he could see
That beckons to him no more

Oh, I'm just a victim of time
Obsolete in my prime
Out of date and outclassed, by my past

What did he love that there's none of?
What did I lose the sweet warm knack of?
Wouldn't I be the late great me, if I knew how?
What did I have I don't have now?

What did he see that's gone in me?
What did I use that now I'm shy of?
Why is the sequel never the equal?
Why is there no encore?

Where can I go to repair?
All the wear and the tear
'Till I'm once again the previous me

What did he like that I am not like?
What was the charm that I've run dry of?
What would I give if my old know how
Still knew how?

What did he love that there's none of?

Liza Minnelli,"Come Saturday morning
I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-spend till the end of the day
Just I and my friend

We'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

You know what the trouble is?
Trouble is that probably all the good things in life
Take place in no more than a minute

I mean all I did, I, I bet you
At the end of seventy years should you lose someone
You can sit down, you can figure the whole thing out

You spent nineteen years sleepin'
You spent five years goin' to the bathroom
You spent thirty-five years doin'
Some kinda work you absolutely hated

Spent seven thousand eight hundred and
Fifty-three minutes blinkin' your eyes
And added to that, you got that one minute of good things
Then one day you wonder whether you're minute's up

And then we'll move on

Liza Minnelli,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

And got so far

Why keep it mum when there's nothing to hide?

Let me assure you it grows every day

Look at my baby, my baby and me

Nothing can stop us so nobody try
'Cause baby's rough and full of stuff
And incidentally, so am I

Watch how we bubble and blossom and bloom

And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Blue
Lizabeth Flood,"Why can't you behave?
Oh, why can't you behave?
After all the things you told me,
And the promises that you gave,
Oh, why can't you behave?

Why, why, why can't you be good?

I was faithful and true but what good will it do

And do, do just as you should?

Yes you had the right touch but I was askin' too much
Won't you turn that new leaf over,
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

There's a farm I know near my old home town,
Where we two can go and try settling down.
There I'll care for you forever,
'Cause you're all in this world I crave.
Oh, why can't you behave?

Lizabeth Scott,"Why am I
Just as happy as a child
Why am I
Like a racehorse running wild
Why am I
In a state of ecstasy
The reason is 'cause something's happened to me

I'm in love again, and the spring is comin'
I'm in love again, hear my heart strings strummin'
I'm in love again, and the hymn I'm hummin'
is the ""Huddle Up, Cuddle Up Blues""

I'm in love again, and I can't rise above it
I'm in love again, and I love, love, love it
I'm in love again, and I'm darn glad of it
Good news!

Someone sad had the awful luck to meet
Someone bad, but the kind of bad that's sweet
No one knows what a glimpse of paradise
Someone who's naughty showed to someone who's nice

I'm in love again, and with glee I bubble
I'm in love again, and the fun's just double
I'm in love again, if I got in trouble
I'll be cursin' one person I know

I'm in love again, I'm a lovebird sigin'
I'm in love again, I'm the spring lamb springin'
I'm in love again, weddin' bells are ringin'

Lizz Wright,"Dream of a land my soul is from 
I hear a hand stroke on a drum 

Elegant boy 
Beautiful girl 
Dancing for joy
Delicate whirl
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Two young lovers dance face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway
Then slip away
To some secluded place

Whispering trees
Echo their sighs
Passionate pleas
Tender replies
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Lovers on flight
Upward they glide
Burst at the height
Slowly subside

And my slumbering fantasy assumes reality
Until it seems it?s not a dream
The two are you and me
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue

Oh shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue

Try to carry on

Love will lead the way!

In the shadows of the valley

And tell my loved-ones not to worry
But love will conquer hate

The earth is always singing
Praises of the morning sun
Even before morning
And the whole world is singing of
It’s beauty all day long
And even the quiet dark
That silence is a song

Weep not for the day of gray
For the heavens are not weeping

Is it big and will it scare me
If I ask to leave will the wiss even hears me
And how will I Knew then - if I ever get home again

Here I am alone
Witch feels the same
I don't know just where I'm going

Out here on my own and it's not a game

Shining hours were brief
Winter is over
Summer is near
Are we stronger than we believe?

I walked through halls of reputation
Among the infamous too
As the camera clings to the common thread
Beyond all vanity
Into a gaze to shoot you through

Is the kindness we count upon
Hidden in everyone?

I stepped out in a sunlit grove
Although deep down I wished it would rain
Washing away all the sadness and tears
That will never fall so heavily again

Is the kindness we count upon
Is hidden in everyone

I stood there in the salt spray air
Felt wind sweeping over my face
I ran up through the rocks to the old
Wooden cross

Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.

Like a chump playing stud,

Banning all the reasons why

Lie on your back and watch the virgin die

In a suicidal rage of attentions missed

Still no one heard your cry for help

Tear down the satins, unveil the lace

Said if you're lonely just give me a call
'cause I'm only a hotline away

The cherry filled here your talk is cheap
We'll bring your lonely nights to life

So here we are, we've come so far
Got lost along the way
Don't you know we're living in a state of pain
You like my wicked ways, forbidden kiss of pain
It's dark and strange, tied up all night
We're on the beaten path, tangled up in life
Love hates the game no rules apply
So here we are, we've gone too far
We've passed the place to stay
Don't you know we've living in a state of pain
Can't hear the whispering to clear
Can't stop screaming in my ear
Bit by bit you we're turning the screws
You never knew me, I never knew you
Inch by inch we unraveled the clues
We gotta lose, you know we're livin' in a state of pain
So here we are, stoned and starved
We just wanted to play
So here we are so desperately
So here we are, we've gone this far
The dog will his day
Don't you know we're livin' in a state of pain",State of Pain
Lizzy Borden,"Eye of newt for gods of love and hate and war before us
We pray and dance and scheme
And conjure pagan ritual lust
We cast our spell into the sky
We sacrifice a life to live, some one must die

There will be blood tonight
A sacrificial lamb in white
There will be blood tonight
The ceremony flames ignite
There will be blood tonight
A virgin drowns in the sea of light
Come all you faithful while the moon's full
Just believe and thy work will be done here
The council for the cauldron
Secret coven, reach for clear
The holy spirit gemini
The seven sisters two of nine
Now wait for the sign
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming
There will be blood tonight
Messiah come reveal your light
There will be blood tonight
Our sacred shadow rise to life
There will be blood tonight
A hanged man soul is our dark knight
From him which is witch's to come
Salvation for archangel's son
Washed our sins with his own blood
Drowning rats die in the flood

The world is mine, the world is mine
The world is my world, the world is my world
The world is mine, this is my world
Dark places in a dark heart
And now it's pouring acid rain
I'll take a sentimental journey across my wrist to leaky veins
Well I can take you I can make you
You know it's down to us or them
Call me god this time you mean it
Cause I'm rising up again

Feel your flesh it makes me whole
It makes me cold your love I stole

She sold her soul beware
There all out there now, I'll take you there
There out on the move, ga, ga, god knows where

Extort the greedy sex offenders
Creature comforts never end her
Lust for life for love
The sinful ways of wickedness
Alluring power of decadence

I wanna go where no one?s ever been....

I wanna crawl down under your skin....

I wanna Strip away the pain....

Look at you, you?re sick and self infected....

Ain?t got a clue of who you see reflected....

Empty eyes of vacant suffocating....

Drowning in your vanity you?re disintegrating....

Who you are is what I wanna be....

So bizarre so insane....

Where you are is where I wanna be....

How we are is all in vain....

I wanna lick away the pain....

LL Cool J,"His realm is a new horizon of cuts
They expand from his hand as he conducts
Aim a lot of cool projects not photography
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography

The lyrical virtual also makes his return
All adversaries should be concerned
Ll Cool J is back again
Allow me to introduce you to my friend Cut-Creator

He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves
Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave
English revision he endure any collision
Like a searcher with a scalpel, he'll make the head decision
As for me I'll annihilate, eggs, I'll let's 'em communicate
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter
All you sucker DJ's will scatter
Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy
The real helper of cuts, Cut-Creator is his name
The boys' so nice, my boat is your strain
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains
To arrange scratch-padders for the audio change
Not trippin' ah, my tree, for the mental geometry
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous

""I need a beat""

Yeah I made it, don't look astonished
I had to remind you of what I've accomplished
My scenario, four-door stereo
Up-bein' beat, zero is the ratio
Cut-Creator, LL Cool J
Say Ole, to what we just played
Rappers who don't evade instead we invade
And all competitors will be slayed
Any comment is a compliment
No groups' talent can be the equivalent
Of mine and his combined
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme
So why listen the greats by the deaf of the bass
Takin' out every sucker, DJin' the place
A performance underrated, it's not narrated
So Cut-Creators social statics can't be alleviated
He's dangerous

Demolishin' DJ's in under a second
I called an old phrase from my last record
The beat alleviates, the scratch excels
Except I came hear to raise some hell
Searchin' up Sykes and cuts like the blade
He can squeeze a dry sponge and make Kool Aid
I drink at steady, the record turns many
Instead of a needle, he uses a machete
He scuffs the bars a-get you involved
As the record revolves, DJ's dissolve
Musically, physically, mentally he's an innovator
Greater, Cut-Creator is on the cross-fader
So try to digest what I invent
On Farmer's Boulevard is where I rest
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego
Je pan de la francais, and Italiano
From my projects and I'll inject
Into your ears, a new concept
Conceived in silence, to be unveiled
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail
I'm dangerous",Dangerous
LL Cool J,"Yo Yvette, there's a lot of rumors goin' around
They're so bad, baby you might have to skip town
See something's smellin' fishy and they say it's you
All I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew
They say you're a man-eater during the full moon
Mascot of the senior boys' locker room
They said Yvette walked in, there wasn't too much rap
Her reputation got bigger, and so did her gap
'Cause girl your momma should of taught you better
I'ma sit down and write you a long letter

Dear Yvette

I'm glad you ain't my sister, then again if you was
I'd have to treat you like you was my distant 'cause
I'm not a news reporter, I don't mean to assume
What should I think? I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom
You wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone
The door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was moan

Dear Yvette

Dear Yvette

I don't really know if the story is so
I can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe
Or Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe
Like Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho
In every disco you say hello
Like you're a little angel, but we all know
Since you was eleven you been actin' this way
You always got in bed when you wanted to play
You're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva
Some freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver

Dear Yvette

Dear Yvette

You're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro
A high-powered body makes your Levis grow
See the stories I've heard, they could amaze
I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days
So calm down freak, get a G.E.D.
That's a General Education on Decency
One day you'll see, and agree with me
Unless you're gonna be a freak until you're ninety three
For you there's no fee, everything is free
This is from me to you, not you to me
Every night is your night, your leather pants are tight
You try to shake your butt with all your might
I don't really wanna dis nobody
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi
But that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette
How bad can a girl's reputation get?
See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met
If you're desperate ask Yvette, 'cause she'll say bet

Dear Yvette
Dear Yvette

Dear Yvette

B-Boys are hard on the boulevard
The Reverend at the church said you was barred
Homeboys on the block loved you a lot
You're a real famous freak whether you like it or not
So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'
Let me explain to you who is talkin'
I'm L.L. Cool J from around the way
You boogie down to my records almost every day
Go a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still
You're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill
Won't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A.
The guy at the desk said it was OK
For you to come inside 'cause he knew you'd stay
Greg G. And Garfield yelled ""Hooray""

I said, ""wait!""
""Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?""
""Have some donuts and milk?""
""Listen to a pop tune maybe?""

Please be his ex and be my bride
Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried
Love you claimed to share just wasn't there
You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair
Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole
You was fooled by the face of a phoney role
But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby
Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me
I cry out your name as you hold his hand
If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned
I'm looking out the window at the stormy rain
And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain
All alone in the room, and it's making me sad
Fantasize of the love we could have had
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

I pour wine for two, even though it's just me
I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see
Your man is the devil, but he gave you a ring
So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing
You're the type that ignores the destiny of two
It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you
You're being handicapped by a Don Juan rap
You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more, yes girl
I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

The time has come, the decision's yours
This super love story ain't working no more
Can't you understand that my love spans
Higher and further than any man
You're looking a gift horse right in the mouth
This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout
You're my only desire, I fight to the death
And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath
Ain't getting on my knees, but I'm oh so close
To our love I toast, all he does is boast
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

A knock on the door and a tap on the glass
Tells me you see it my way at last
You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me
He called you up and said, ""Yo baby, why you diss me?""
Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore
You want more of what you used to ignore
During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy
Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me
Make love at night, coffee in the morn'
I be the only blanket that's keepin you warm
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more, uh

I'm good in the morning to the crack of sunlight
But my agony continues till it reaches night
Sweet image of your face appears on the wall
And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall
I look at the sky, then I search for the moon
Realize it's three o'clock in the afternoon
So I dress to impress, exit the house
Go up to the school and watch the kids come out
In the middle of the court yard there you stand
With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more, uh

You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction
You won't get used if you follow my instructions
Your scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm
Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan
And that'll be eroticism, highs die down
You will find your best friend finally is found
I caress ya at night like a virgin in white
'Cause the new world I found is oh so tight
And tender and young, soft and wet
It's hotter than any fantasy could get
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

I can give you more
Hey girl, I can give you more
I can give you more
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more",I Can Give You More
LL Cool J,"Look girl, I'm not gonna sing
'Cause I just don't do that

I see you in between class when my mind does a task
One glimpse of your eyes and my heart beats fast
A mysterious fantasy, lovely young queen
You're poll so subtle just like the magazine
Come and visit my sister she's in the livin' room
Eat doughnuts and milk, listen to a pop tune
Used to be my baby-sitter, I want you for my woman
Without you girl, my life is bitter like a lemon

I want you
I want you

I day-dream of seeds girl when you pass by
I wonder what the future holds for you and I
I tell my friends favorite tales about me and you
My total devotion for you is true
See you on the bus I trip as I get on
My body gets warm but my mind is torn
I admit you're the queen of elegant
Maybe I'm just another ""puppy love lucids""
I will tell you straight up, not to load on a letter
Opportunity knocks, I feel I just better
Disappear out of sight, rejection is my fright
To me you're like a drug-boy, easy red light

I want you
I want you

To weak or wreak I can't speak I'm messin' up in school
Just to hear your name girl, it's makes me drool
As you sing ""Full Settle"" on the college choir
My temperature level grows much higher
Spent a night over my house with my sister and friends
I wish you wouldn't treat me like I'm your cousin
Your high-school year book under my pillow
You walk by my window, I see your silhou-ette
Candle light is what I desire
But all I get to do is fix your flat tyre
When you ring my bell, perfume I smell
The aroma pierces through my heart-cell
I tell you that my sister isn't here today
You go away but I wish you'd stay
Yes girl, I'm twistin' around your finger
When you leave your perfume lingers

I want you
I want you

The clock tick-tocks as I lay in my bed
It's visions of you circlin' through my head
I sip lemon, Ice-T, read a magazine
Wish we were involved in a sneaky love scene
Saturday night it's time to party y'all
But an unseen force has my back for the wall
All eyes hit the door, red dress shines loud
The moment has come, my fantasy's' here now
You sip Gin & Tonic with the double-hole straw
Finally I get the nerve to by you one more
The bar tender smirks, I whisper, ""he's a jerk""
I'm wearin' leather pants and a thirty dollar shit
Often usin' double mints, sit back, crack a smile
Tryin' to act like y'all relaxed and not a child
See I'm sixteen and you're in college
Love is sweet, then please give me the knowledge

I want you
I want you

See it's easy to detect a line that's been said
What you don't know is your the woman I've wanted to get
Four years and now I'm here sweet dear
Cool in the snow under a polar bear
I light your cigarette with a Raphael lighter
Your dress seems like it's gettin' tighter and tighter
The ice cubes' melt, the heat is felt
The cards' on the table and my deal is dealt

I want you
I want you

I had to subsequent my soul, cowardness kept a hold on me
And the key was analyzed on my role as a man
To instigate romance not break down and cry
When you ask for a dance
Some fellas talk to her but she walks by
She can only say no, it's not do or die
Like Bedstock, it's natures' way
A sweet love story from LL Cool J

You can't dance!

Why don't you just nail your feet to the floor?
Homeboy, what's the use?
Anytime you wanna step inside a party
First think of an excuse
You dance like a fat old lady
Not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice
But every time you try to get one move right
The old lady done did it twice

Feet dragging all around

Take my advice, don't move!

If I danced like you I'd sneak out the party

You look like Ralph Kramden or a Donald Duck cartoon

You wanna come to my party?

Ended up in an ambulance
Wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold?
You dance like you got arthritis already
What'll happen when you get old?
You can't dance!

Yeah! Why are you so stiff?
Is it something that your mother did?
Maybe you grew up around ""can't dance"" people
When you were a ""can't dance"" kid
You live in a ""can't dance"" house
Went out in a ""can't dance"" car
Your doofy ""can't dance"" father
Got drunk in a ""can't dance"" bar
You take a ""can't dance"" bath
Put on your ""can't dance"" cologne
Go out to a ""can't dance"" party

I'm the mic dominater, best of all times
And you ain't heard nothin' till you heard J rhyme
You'll rock!

Now I'ma tell you the mean behind the scratchin' sounds
He's Cut-Creator, Philly-Philly as the DJ crown
Me and him are imitatin' but never underatin'
My rhymes and his cuts have been consolidated
The mission ain't complete without the use of his hands
He makes my rhymes so fresher, my beat expands
So I'll like you to meet him, but don't attempt to beat him
A Five Man Crew, me and him will defeat them
He'll scratch and wipe out all foes
Turntable terrorizin' and I think you should know
That were, high calibered and my names' J
And for all you sucker crews it's Judgment Day
To ring this encounter, I'm your rhyme sayer
I have to say it girls, but yes, I'm a player
Materials royal, I'm a'nating all
Like brown with dimples and I'm six-feet tall
And promoter of recordings that I call my own
And I'll love to take one of you ladies home
I'll complete and clear, infiltratin' your ears
My litera-ture is above Shakespeare
Emcee, a sucker natter and I just won't stop
I'm the author and the designer of the jam you'll rock
I'm a lyrical game on the heels of fame
And the world is glad that Cool J came
You'll rock!

Now I'm a dedicate this rhyme to my favorite street
You think about it everytime that you hear this beat
Any other jam you hear just dis-regard
This is the National Anthem of the Boulevard
See I'm loyal to the bully cause it tought me the deal
Certainly the place to be and that's how I feel
Farmers Boulevard, E-Love and me Cool J
In the center of it all is a cute 3-A
Forty-seven will surrender till emcee's in fear
Queens Boulevard is soft, they don't come around here
Quick as L's on my face I will hold my space
And to taste, stimulate, and conduct the bait
You'll rock!

Now I'ma kick it for the beat, check complete my mission
Subtractin' emcee's like a mathematician
Jammin' up the board at the rappin' commission
Soul inventor of this composition
I disintegrate rappers I can and I could
Degrade egg your Al and Ol couldn't write this good
But I'm the Warlord of rap with my own army
Japans' whole military couldn't disarm me
Super bad, cold-crushed, number one be	-boy
Like a paintin' from Picasso, I'm the real McCoy
Crown-Prince of rappin', Godfather of bees
Emcee's that need a new lady to feed
You'll rock!

You know I'm sayin'? Break!
You know I'm sayin'? Break! Break! Break two!",You'll Rock
LL Cool J,"That's right y'all this is the LL Cool J party
Move it, move it, move it, get on the floor baby
That's right, don't try to front like your fly
Get out there!

To rappers I'm a nightmare on Elm Street
Hellafied hotter than heat, guess why the others can't eat?
Cause I'm a carnivore and I can eat much more
Than a fat man after a pack-a-jam
L.L.'s thicker than butter, well-known throw cutter
When I'm involved all the amateurs stutter
There's scared and can't believe that their whole crews
Ain't a rapper alive that can fill my shoes
I'm dope on a rope virgins water elope
I do the hustle and the shuffle and the roper dope
Cause I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

Three hundred and fifty seven reasons
Why you gotta get your butt on the floor right now
We ain't playing, we came here to get ill
Iller than ill, LL you know I'm sayin'?

Just like Ali Baba and the 40 thieves
So nasty you don't know whether to stay or leave
More fear then Evan Bluebeard I serve primrose
A picture of me is like a part of Michaelango's
I don't play the banjo will you ever understand yo
Serving I mean the matter how old I go Rambo
Cocks strong half a block wrong
Illy I'll fire starter hitting harder than King Kong
Not a battle axe not one of the mill
Not easily knocked out or easily killed
Cause I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

A hundred and ninety five pounds punk
More bounce to the ounce and I say what counts
Know I'm saying?
Now get yourself on the floor
Stop acting like a sissy

Boy, I'm better than better is, badder than badder is
I won't scare em or dare em I'll just splatter his
Guts kick his butt while Bob is rocking the cuts
Wanna step in the ring with me you must be mushed
Now ices in a crisis afraid when he's ready or chasing when he's chasing
But filling when the scene I mean I'm icing and acing
Amateurs who like it can't hack it I attack it that's why I'm gonna crack it
The shell and the soul of little kids who can't roll
I told em, scold em, teach em and mold em
Get paid ten knots at a time and then I fold em
I remember the blood and I remember what told em
I can, can't cause I'm down with E yet you have the audacity
To try and mess with him and me
Hypersonic is weak and Supersonic is wack
Sneak around at the minute like a Siamese cat
""Pellum"" (1, 2, 3) catch twenty-two I'm H-A-R-D
I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

Rock the beat now that can be arranged
Yo baby you look fine spread em
Yo homeboy get up against the wall put this in your pocket
Who is this?
Move it, move it, move it

I'm a nappy, sappy crappy imitator of who
If I ever imitated it wouldn't be you, oh
You don't know so many have died when the LL growl was amplified
Get back better yet step back get that
Like shaft in the Mack cause I'm mad and I'm black
I'm a perfect plan a good boyfriend
I'm the reason rap rules and the country out Cool J-A-M-E-S
Fresh as a cliche but so is my forte
This goes out whether the blues is old news
P's and Q's keep me in your shoes
And you're dissing me because I'm young and I'm strong
And cause I'm capable of making a platinum LP
Wrong you was, you assumed I was all in
But boy is for balling they'll never say I'm falling
Calling all cars for the brother in black
L-E-L the Mack back bone of this track
I'm force full of force to put you on your back
Making hit after hit while you sent for a contract
Hotter than hot now watch how hot I can get
Leaving rappers fee's dried and skimmer's dimmer's wet
I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

Now the LL posse is now handing out speed knots
To all those who don't want to get busy
That's right baby get your body on the floor
Move it, move it
.357 at point blank range ain't nothing strange
You're having a heart attack is at your back
Now listen to me bring it, bring it on, 
On down, down, down, down, down, down",.357 - Break It on Down
LL Cool J,"I'm the Ladies Love, legend in leather
Long and lean, and I don't wear pleather
Last of the red hot loving MC's
Looking for a little, that's my theory
It goes quick like lightning, too exciting
Lover of ladies, don't allow biting
Level-headed leader, toy boy feeder
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater
Looking, learning, the one you're liking
Listen and you will love what I'm writing
Ladies love, long, hard and lean
And now you know what L.L. means

[Chorus]
Let's get ill!
Come on now
Let's get ill!
Everybody
Let's get ill!
Everybody
Let's get ill!

Lightning in the sky, L.L. don't lie
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys
My literature is the land's highest law
The man of the brand, one you look out for
I'm loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker
Listen to my rhyme
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates
First not last, leader of the class, see
From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearing Lee's
The Kangol is mine, the godfather is E
I bust your lip, my level won't slip
Clocking crazy dollars on the L.L. tip
Come on!

[Chorus]

Loose with the ladies, loud like a ref
When I die, there will be no lovers left
I'm the little girl liker, legendary writer
Let's see, I never lost cause I burn like a lighter
My love is long and my lyrics rock loud
Lurking shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud
I'm the Ladies Love, lyrical lord in the club
Ladies Love, the man you dream of

[Chorus]

Never ever lost, not lonely or alone
You can call me the last Capone
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids
Don't need a legal lawyer, I ain't doing no bid
Cause the ladies know my bass is low
Rocking L after L ever since the intro
Liberace couldn't rock it like the long-legged pro
Two legs, not four like Lassie, I don't eat Alpo
Come on

[Chorus]

All over the land they listen to my jams
Like a cherry lollipop when you're licking your hand
I'm popping and locking, so I can give you a list
All of my lyrics are swift, so the losers never riff
I love giving em bliss, having my name on the list
I'm the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless
Each jam is like a lesson other rappers must learn
Cold laugh cause they don't like it every time I return
Come on

[Chorus: x2]","Ahh, Let's Get Ill"
LL Cool J,"Knuckleheads spreadin' gossip all over town 
Every time I drive by you're just standin' around 
Hundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand 
Don't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man? 
L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place 
I want to take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face 
You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games 
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame 
Movies, records, goin' on tour 
Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor 
Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill 
Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill 
See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God 
I have experience in goin' all the way to the top 
It's harder harder than hard 
All the suckers are barred 
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred 
See the problem is you want what another man has 
His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz 
But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own 
Cause when you're rich you got friends 
But when you're poor you're alone 
So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul 
Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old 
Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me 
Why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree? 
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree 
Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three 
A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life 
You'll say ""I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife"" 
Every day is a chase, every day is a race 
And every day you're being overpowered by my bass 
Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace 
It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face 
I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed 
I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead 
I'ma lead you away from drugs and petty crime 
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme 
Lead you to that ticket line 
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine 
Get busy, not dizzy, want to teach the young 
The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung 
Not that I killed him, it's just 
He didn't want to trust 
The words of a master that's why you must 
Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear 
Don't try to say you can't hear 'cause the words are clear 
Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest 
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best 
Cause tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight 
Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right 
E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck 
If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck 
L.L. Cool J is on the microphone 
Tellin' all you punk ducks ""Leave me the hell alone"" 
Cause I'm rated X, born to snap necks 
Straight up and down, no special effects 
I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean 
If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens 
Cause that's where I live, and this is what I give 
Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives 
They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan 
Like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin' 
Here I am, tellin' the truth 
And I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth 
It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam 
I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans 
All you petty MC's in the state of New York 
Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still want to squawk 
Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin' 
Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin' 
Your mic sounds weak, remember that sieezer 
I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar 
I'm a hit man, but I'm not for hire 
Fly girl's desire, the man you admire 
Not only on the stage, I rock in the park 
And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark 
So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound

LL Cool J,"I know a fat girl, she wears a orange skirt 
You give her twenty dollars and you can do work 
She'll take food stamps and a traveller's check
Because her hair and her face and her life's a wreck 
She wears a bright blond wig, some high heeled pumps 
She's down in the dumps so she's sellin' her rump 
She's a hot little momma and she works every day 
If you want to pay to play, here's where she stays 
She's at the

(The Bristol Hotel) Where that at? (Jamaica, Queens!) 

I seen her standin' there, slutty as could be 
Offering the putty for a itty-bitty fee 
Every red light she'll come over to your ride 
Or she's standin' in the doorway tellin' you to come inside 
The Bristol Hotel, 'cause it ain't no thing 
And her meat tastes better than Burger King 
Japanese executives in three-piece suits 
Glasses all foggy when they come in the place 
The girlies in the Bristol, they're all in cahoots

Party people check the story 'cause the story is ill 
It's the story of two men, one Harold, one Bill 
They went inside the Bristol on a Saturday night 
Harold was cool but Bill felt uptight 
The girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool 
""Never ever rush, that's the golden rule 
I been comin' to the Bristol's ten years of my life 
A-yo, what the hell? Yo, man that's my wife!""

[Chorus]

You see, a Bristol girl is a one of a kind 
And if you know her good enough she won't make you stand on line 
She'll let you inside, make you pay for the ride 
Take off her pants and then it smells like somebody died 
You say ""What the heck"", because you already paid 
Not knowin' that the guy that went before you had AIDS 
Bang bang boogie, she was so amusin' 
Next week you're at the clinic gettin' blood transfusions

Serving em well
And as you all know
I am hard as hell

Woke up at 9:30 on a Saturday morn'
Hemmed my remote control, turned my stereo on
Then I reached for a brush since I don't use the picks
And the floor was kinda cold, so I put on my kicks
Walked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes
As I bop to a tape of Cut Creator's breaks
With hardcore, heavyweight, B-boy blast
Connoisseur of hardcore, and Cut Creator's fast
Jumped in the shower, it was boiling hot
So I stayed there a hour, cause I like it a lot
Jumped out, dried off, put on the Denim cologne
Then I called up Earl on the telephone
He told me 'bout a jam that I could do later on
10 G's plus a limo for one strong song
So I said, yeah, I was with it, hung up and got geared
Got a magnifying glass, then I brushed my beard
Rewound some tapes of some Def Jam tunes
As I waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon
12 o'clock came, left the door crack
The freak walked in, a mink on her back
Put her curt on the rack, threw my sex robe on
Then I threw in a tape of the quiet storm
We drank Round-hill Cavern, ate soft mignons
She said, ""L.L., when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?""
My skin got pale, I wam-bammed the tail
Did it so hard I should of went to jail
She left, Earl came over and we went outside
Jumped in the BM to bust a joyride
Went up to A.J., in my fresh black wheel
I'm not a sucker on the corner trying to scrape up a meal
The girlies want sex, the fellas try to plex
But those who flex end up with broke necks
Signed some autographs for a posse of freaks
Said, ""It's L, baby, I ain't down with Chic""
Conversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more
Then I jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door
Due cause I'm a gangster people think I do crimes
They don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes
Some smile, try to call L.L. a hoodlum at times
But he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind
L.L. has iced all the washed up slobs
Vigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob
Don't run from the cops, making suckers jock
And I'm only 18 making more than your pops
Tormentor of toys and boyscout boys
And I dare any critic to call it noise
Peeped at the clock, it said 6:03
Said 'later' to Creator and broke out with E
Went up to White Castle for a chocolate shake
Thinking 'bout a 100'000 that I'd soon make
Finished up the snack, jumped up, out my seat
E-Love hit the table and he made up a beat
Kicked a few lines, stepped out the door
Since tonight is a bore I'm in the mood for more
We jumped in my ride, I took a peek at the time
It was almost 7:30 and the show was at nine
L.L. Cool J will soon stand at a jam
With thousands of people screaming, ""Touch my hand!""
But since I had a hour plus a half for tat
I was searching for the cutie who's my perfect match
Her name was Renee, her face was okay
But she had the kinda body that made Jay want to play
I said, ""No need to rehearse,"" then I made my approach
Said, ""You got a good team, girl, but you need a new coach""
Said, ""My name's L.L. Cool, if I may introduce
But I'm not here for conversation, I'm here to seduce
Want to mix it up, baby, want to feel you grind
Cause it ain't 5th grade, and these ain't nursery rhymes
And I know that you adore my sure side hardcore
Check out the real L.L. behind closed doors
So tell your buddies you're busy, tell your boyfriend beat it
Forget the silk dress,cause you ain't gonna need it
Unplug your clock, do away with the light
After five minutes or more you hear me say, 'That's right!'
Your body is bad and I heard you got a Caddy
When we make love you can call me daddy
I'm L.L. Cool J, say hey, Renee
I'm not a toyboy, but I still want to play
Promise you I'm not wack when I'm in the sack
After that I leave you starving for me to come back
But in the meantime, put your digits down
And the next time I see ya I'm going to town""
Stepped away from the freak, it was a quarter to nine
When I rolled to the jam I saw the crew on line
Took a trip around the side, so I could get backstage
If you call me a tiger, then the stage is my cage
I rip, stomp and crush, heavy metal bands rust
Them flaky knuckleheads I crumble up like crust
Walked in my dressing room, and then I heard four knocks
They said, ""L.L., you're running late and it is time to rock""
Told Cut Creator what the order would be
Then I said ""Lord have mercy"" and slapped hands with E
Went onstage, I heard the girlies scream
And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream

Disappeared for a year now I'm back y'all
So get down with the entrepreneur of funk
Not a sloppy fat punk or a Shaolin Monk
Ain't down with Johnny Cousin know as use at a jam
So to hell with Anne McMahon & Tom McCan

Signing hungry-over-beasts that's why I always eat

Hard like haystacks cow-hold
Calling me a sucker boy you're pushin' a broom
If you try to pull a ace you'll get a punch in the face
All eyes are on my posse when we walk in the place
Got a Cunningham family from my happy days
Not the boys that play the bench for the Oakland A
He drop you to a hop to the record he play
Couldn't keep it a secret I'm L.L. Cool J
Rhymes are all wack and real all real
Yo Earl, tell the party people the deal

Yo listen here
Ya ain't no thing, can't complain
They catch like a muh'fuck pass to J

That's right I'm back he's talks how to rap
He used to Smurf now you're jacking cause my name's on the map
Sit and lie my homeboy Earl says is that he loves hats
With a hands like a hatcher, Cut Creators in bat
Cut Creator on the fader the teachers pet
Baddest man with ten fingers you've ever met
And sooner or later we'll have to sit
Cut Creator cut the record so they don't forget
Get down

I make hard rock jams for hard rock fans
What I'm sayin' is for real this ain't lala land
Got a can full of jams pullin' off the lid
Competition in New York is doin' what I did
Cold sender of a story I paid my dues
I rocked at house parties I was down with crews
Now I'll never be caught I'm on my P's and Q's
And for the rest of your life you wanna be in my shoes
I scar like stones hard like cement 
And I rocked every jam that I ever went
Cause I got a better reppin' than any emcee has
And I'm down like a brother from Alcatraz
Get down

Ni-ni-nigga-nigga-ni-ni-ni-ninja
I rap the boss is back the only man
you should call when the party's packed
From Paris to L.A they say I'm as sharp as a pin
When it's a Cool J party you gotta get in
So I'm making big steps like Gladys Knight in the pier
One rhyme you're on my tinsels as I leave my lip
Up the block kids are talking and spreading the news
About the new grandmaster the one you'll choose
Cause I'm chuckling I wanna stomp the rest
When I kick it couldn't bore it could only impress
I'm not a Hula-Hoop this isn't a passing phase
Hard work pays I'm getting straight up A's
Cool J is running things I want it understood
Executioner I should wear a black hood
And carry an axe cause I'm ruff on wax
Speakers speaking ""phone-wear from durable"" eight-tracks

5, 6, 7 'o' clock 8 'o' clock rock!
9, 10, 11 'o' clock 12 'o' clock rock!
Gonna rock (What?) rock, rock, around the clock
Three years ago in St. Albans, Queens 
I was rocking at a park called one eighteen
Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot 
Didn't know that years later I'll be standing on top 
Living near Farmers Boulevard I was born and base-shaw
Stopped the rich and shaked hands with the poor 
And this is a story about a brother I know
Cut Creator on the fader no watch him go

Go, go cut creator go
Go cut creator go 
Go cut creator go
Go cut creator go
Go, go cut creator go
Go cut creator go
Go cut creator go
Go cut creator go

When back in the days before I clocked some dough
I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
Hoping and praying one day I'll get on the road
So I had a feeler and a summer and I meet when I'm stoned
Not fearing a thought, got stung like a horse 
Don't make fun of my posse, cause each man is a boss
When his only damn way to pull a jam out the crate
One time for your mind
Check out the guitar break 

[Chorus]

This jam just wasn't enough for Jimmy Hendrix to see
He could do lessons of mixing take you under his wing
Straight from the heart cause it ain't the money that we came here for
Ain't no thoughts in the room ain't breaking no roles
And in the Rock 'n' Roll land, a big striving plan 
Just my posse learn the vocals what little they had
It's all about us three: Eve, Phil & Jay
He heard Cut Creator cut now check it out to play

[Chorus]

Rock, rock y'all check out the funky cut
It's like traveling through time to the straight cats strut 
Cuts are slicker than Grease needle as sharp as a knife
We'll be do doing the doo for the rest of the lines 
Want to piece of the action, it's time to party, get up
Not a subway bummy singer putting change in a cup 
Want to see you boogie, oogie jumping up and down
Biting your living hold your breath until we come to your town

LL Cool J,"I met this new girl with big juicy lips
And nice round hips, I mean her body's a trip
And when I go over her house, you know what I like?
The way she tells me ""take it off"" and never says ""syke""
Yo, I'm never in need, she's feedin' my greed
She never waits for me to ask, she takes the lead
Her tongue is sticky, and hickeys are her specialty
E wants her, but she saves the good stuff for me
Her name is Kanday, she's dandier than Dandy Don
You're mad and I'm happy that she put me on
I'll never leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I, feel, good)

[Chorus]
About Kanday
(I, feel, good)
About Kanday
(I, feel, good)

Now & Laters gum drops, jellybeans
Brothers beg for the leg, she's on the cheerleading team
It feels wicked, every time I stick it, that's right
When we're alone she never ever acts polite
Hey yo, she blows me kisses, she does my dishes
I wished I bust two and she grants my wishes
She's clever in bed, she uses her head
She's the kinda girl that keeps a fat man well fed
Left to right all night, the chick's outta sight
I broke my lamp shade in half because I don't use a light
Man, she's juicy like a berry, chocolate with the cherry
Ask me if it's good and I'll have to say very
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I, feel, good)

[Chorus]

I'm feelin' gooder than good, if you wouldn't I would
If you could, I know you could, she's kickin' back in the hood
When she starts to get off she can knock off a cough
I know 'cough' don't rhyme with 'boss', but she made me her boss
She's the talk of my room whenever I'm in my room
My little brother loves her more than his favorite cartoon
Her body's bad, the girl's built, skin like silk
Wet, steamy and warm just like a hot cup of milk
She's all the way live, keeps me satisfied
I don't go outside, I like to stay inside
Her ways are like a angel, with bright white wings
And I'm crazy 'bout the way Kanday shakes her thing
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I, feel, good)

[Chorus]

Ooh, you couldn't imagine, I'm lickin' my lips
If she was tea I'd take a sip, when I'm in gym I do flips
I'm in love with the pizznoot, it's proper as hell
I'm hittin' harder than hard, always makin' her yell
She's cooler than an iceberg, word to the mother
In the house, down the steps and under the covers
Right away, no sation, or frontin', or playin'
Or delayin', I'm never steppin' off, I'm always stayin'
Her mother knows me well, father hates my guts
He don't know when we're alone she's always feelin' on my niggy-niggy-nuts
For a snack, cornflakes, crackerjacks
Day after day I try to break that back
And man, oh man, damn, you can't and I can
Last time I saw her with man I had to shake almost hands
I said ""what up"", he said ""what up"", ""I took your girl, so what up?""
Gotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up
All the boys laugh about her, Darryl and Dewayne
Bobcat and Earl, but they must be insane
Michael Spelling's on my side, and big Chuck the Grease
She's my private freaky deak, my own personal skeez
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I, feel, good)

(Who I feel good about?)

LL Cool J,"Do you remember the first time you fell in love
The way it felt, the way it feels
Bein' able to say from the bottom of your heart
I love you for real

Your eyes, meet, you feel your heartbeat
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em
Ooh what a thrill

You was always searchin and finally your dream came true
They came strollin' along
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart
I swear, I'll never do you wrong

Hand in hand, heart to heart
Nothin' in the world could separate the two
And even though you've only known that person for a short time
You tell 'em I love you, you're my heart

You argue witcha parents and they argue back
You're too young to be so serious
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you
And walk away aggravated and furious

You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter
The relationship's yours
You feel you're maturin' and hey
You can fight your own battles and wars

You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm
Life is sweet, kissin' caressin' and huggin'
And keepin' each other warm

But now comes the serious part, 'cause love
Believe me, it ain't a easy task
We'd have one argument too many
And you'd have to ask, am I still your heart?

Am I still your heart or somethin', pullin' us apart
'Cause baby if it is, please let me know what
You run out the door, I tell you come back
I love you, you shout out, so what?

How could you hurt me? How could you treat me
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?
And if so, I only have one request, sit down and explain

To me the person who treated you right, did you right
And held you tight, every night
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?

'Cause if it is, aww, baby, please, don't do this to me
I'm tryin' to reach you, tryin' to talk to you
It's killin' me 'cause you're my heart
That's right I admit it

You're my heart I refuse, to let you go
I struggle and fight for you against all odds
Get down on my knees and pray to God
That our love is in the cards

'Cause I know you're right for me and I know I'm right for you
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands
People say forget about it, move on, but see they don't understand

You're nothin to them, but you're so much to me
So much in fact that I'd give my life
To stare into your eyes and caress your face
As the priest, announces us man and wife

We'd live happily, ever after
White picket fence and the whole nine yards
And anything that anybody said
I'd disregard, if I was still your heart

So make up your mind, 'cause I've made up my mind
I'm beggin' you baby please come back home
I'll be tossin' and turnin', as I lay in my bed
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones

This can't be true, I'm losin' you
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright
All I wanna do in this whole wide world is hold you tight

I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried
Now it's up to you baby, please understand
I forgive you for everything and give you anything
Just let me take ya by the hand

And lead ya, baby I got ya
Protect you like a mother, protects a child
Now it's up to you, I'ma call you in a little while
You're my heart",You're My Heart
LL Cool J,"Yo ""Hello 1-900-LL Cool J?""
Yeah whats up? ""Can you please bust a funky rhyme for me?""
Yeah I can do that, check this one out honey

I motivate, accelerate
Devastate, and dominate
I don't smoke crack so I won't lose weight
Give me the {pussy} and the money and the mic and I'm straight
Go to a restaurant, give me steak
Then cook my chicken with Shake'n'Bake
I leave all the preaching to Reverend Flake
How much money can one black man make? 
I'm what's known as a true dynamiter
I write rhymes fast without a typewriter
Go with the flow, but no, I'm not a biter
Can't compare a cock-a-roach and a spider
Hell, you might as well get a glass of punch
Cause you're biting my lyrics like a Nestle Crunch, huh
And biting my rhymes ain't slick
I got your gold teeth marks all over my
Complications and aggravation
An unnecessary-sation
I'm like Sunkist, good vibrations
Your al-blum, sounds like a compilation
Cool out, grab a seat and listen,
Cause I'ma start dismissing
Sucker MC's who's out there fronting
Talking all that yang, yo you smoking something
Should of treated me royal, yo he wasn't loyal
Now it's all about chaos and turmoil
Gimme that microphone
I'ma show you the real meaning of the danger zone

Yo ""Hello is this 1-900-LL Cool J?""
Yeah whats up? ""Can you tell me what you do when you're cooling out?""
Yo check this out

Now when I'm cooling out, no time for a granny
Just a fly girl in t-shirt and panties
""Can LL ?""  Man, can he?
I tell you what, give up the fanny
Cause on a bedroom tomb, J swift
Not too big, but nothing to play with
In addition, you on a mission
You need to audition for another position
Doing damage is a crew tradition
Name your next al-blum intermission
You're full of preservatives, plus,
You're too conservative
I'm full of flair, savor faire, debonair
There's no competition, for this here
So don't waste your time and breath
I'm giving you all a big F
MC's I envelop,
As the song goes on, the rhyme develops
I'm Asiatic, acrobatic, charismatic
You don't want no static
Anyway, I ain't having it!
When I see the microphone, I'm grabbing it
Plug it in and take charge
LL XL, Xtra-Large
Know what I'm saying?  Peace

Hello?
Hello whats up girl?
How you doing girl? I been trying to call you all day
Word up I was talking to LL he was kicking 
Some mo' hyped up rhymes to me
Word, I spoke to him today too, them rhymes was pumping
Well not to cut you short but I gotta go cause my man is here
Alright
See-ya",1-900 L.L. Cool J
LL Cool J,"I was at the mall, sippin' on a milkshake
Playin' the wall, takin' a break
Admirin' the girls with the bamboo earrings
Baby hair and bodies built to swing
That's when I seen her
Her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina
I said, ""How you doin', my name's Big L
Don't ask me how I'm livin', 'cause, yo, I'm living swell
But then again I'm livin' kind of foul
Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl""
To make a long story short, I got the digits
Calls her on my car phone and paid her a visit
I was spankin' her and thankin' her, chewin' her and doin' her
Layin' like a king on sheets of satin
That's what time it is, you know what's happenin'
She had a big ole booty, I was doin' my duty
I mean, yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie
But Tina was erotic, Earl's my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
I sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in
And said to her with a devilish grin

Tina got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But Tina got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
Tina got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But Tina got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you

I went to the high school about three o'clock
To try to catch a cutie ridin' my jock
My homeboy's jeep, the system blastin'
Cold forty dogs, smilin' and laughin'
Girls all over, the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
That's when I seen her
Her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that I'd always remember
I said to my man, ""Stop the jeep""
She's only seventeen but, yo, don't sleep
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like a big game hunter
I said to the girl, ""Yo, you look tired
Let's go get some rest, relax by the fire""
I put the big booty on a bearskin rug
She gave me a kiss, I have her a hug
I said to the girl, ""them young boys ain't nothin'
You want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button""
I circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while I was eatin'
You know what I said
Too bad you caught me cheatin', but

Brenda got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
Brenda got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you

I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time whe the waitress are on their lunch break
I pulled in the parkin' lot and parded my car
Somebody shouted out, ""I don't care who you are""
I paid it no attention, I walked inside
Because Brian had a nine and he was chillin' in the ride
I walked in the place, everybody was lookin'
And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin'
I sat down to eat, ordered my food
I said to the waitress, ""I don't men to be rude
But I'll take you on a platter""
She said, ""You got a girl,"" I said, ""It don't matter
You look like you're tastier than a pipin' hot pizza
What's your name?"" She said, ""My tag says Lisa""
I said, ""O.K., you're smart and all that
But when you get off work, yo, I'll be back""
She looked at me and said, ""Make yourself clear
L, where we going?"" I said, ""Right here""
She looked kind of puzzled, I said, ""You'll see""
I pulled up at ten on the D.O.T.
When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and place my order
And have her a tip much bigger than a quarter
On and on to the break 'a dawn
All over the restaurant, word is born
I heard somebody coughin', I checked my watch
I couldn't believe it said nine o'clock
I grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol
Who did I see, Oh, yo, it was Brenda
Yo, she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember

Lisa got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
See ya
Lisa got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
See ya",Big Ole Butt

How you gon' sleep on me holmes, do I look like a mattress?
Am I that old, do I walk like Grady?
I'ma hundred-fifty proof, Smirnoff is only 80
Don't you ever try to rock my house
I'm a real cool cat, know what I'm saying Mickey Mouse?
The poetry specialist, so take a dose of this

Ugly as work shoes, messing with the Ruler:

One of my battles'll get your girlies in the mood
Sucker MC's really make me sick
I'm so bad, I can suck my own {dick}
If you go to your girl's house and I'm there already
Don't go Crazy cause my name ain't Eddie
Rhymes so rough, it's like a course in trigonometry
When Einstein was talking, he was talking bout me
The Prince of the Earth, and I'ma give birth
To a rhyme so hard you look soft as a Smurf
Giggling and wiggling, so how we going out?
Lovely, and that's without a doubt!

Rappers are my servants, they serve me like an emperor
When I'm through, you'll need a nurse to take your temperature
And cool you down, cause you're cold as leftovers
Not the ones on the table, I'm talking about RUFF rovers
You can't get over, what's my name, Goofy?
You smoke I'm no joke, so my brother break out the looseys
And take a pull, cause the buck stops here
I get swift as a magician, wreck {shit} and disappear
Don't cross me, or lose your loyalty
To the Prince of the rap court, I'm royalty
And it ain't no puzzle, it's a shame how rappers guzzle
Paragraphs I put together so I carry a muzzle
To shut em up and cut em up and make em be quiet
I'm a one man riot, so don't even try it
The Prince of special tactics, plus I'm athletic
Before you play your hand you better do some calisthenics
Jumpin jacks, squats, push-ups, the whole nine
Speak your piece, then I'ma go for mine
And I guarantee you, I'm gonna strike again
I recommend my friend you drop the pen and give in
Cop out to one rhyme cause you're facin' ten
I ain't Sidney Poitier but we can 'Do This Again'
I'm nice wit mines, and I gotta admit it
You don't really want to battle, why don'tcha just forget it!

But if you're hard headed and you still don't understand

""takes everything you've got""
""pushing a broom"" 
""sure would help a lot""

Check my stats, how we living, I thought so
I'm fresh, oh yes, but can they flow, hell no
My rhymes are up to date, excellent, on point
I'm telling you, they're the serious joint
I eat my steak fast, I drink my brew slow
My voice is milky with a nice clear flow
I eat like a fat man, and walk like a gigolo
I'm not a ballplayer, so now ya know!

Clap your hands everybody (hey yo)
And everybody just clap your hands (hey yo)
Cause I rock the house, everybody (hey yo)
And everybody just clap your hands (hey yo)

Know what I'm saying? 
And I'ma be straight til the year three thousand
That's word to mother, know what I'm saying?
And I say mother with a V 
Cause the V is for Victory ya know what I'm saying?
Cause I'm the victor in this game, word up
Know what I'm saying?

To decapatate, amputate and take titles

Damn I take souls, condemn we men
And make microphones men again and again
Cause, I'm blood thirsty watch and try to curse me
You'll lose the battle even if you out re-hearsed me
I'ma rip holes watch heads roll, like a mole
When I'm strollin' with my neck on a goal
My battles' like a blackout, you can't back out
Only difference, no time to feel a track out

So come forward, admit you're guilty
Admit that your thoughts of New Jack killed me
Admit you were sleepin' on the skills of L
Now know that I handle mine, very well
I burn buildings, eat emcee's
Smack DJ's and tell the seated girls please
They try to jam hard, but I'ma fan God
And they could never get a piece of the man Todd
King Posse ruler and high roller
You losin' it son, your games' gettin' colder

I'm a Monar, the Warlord of life
The eliminator, and I'ma score tonight
Somethin' like Murley, but it goes much deeper
Now just another rapper with a chain and a beeper
One sample is ample, four emcees'll get trampled
Bein' absent from God, I'ma give you sample
My vocabulary's legendary, my rumpy your temporary
So what your name in the bituary
Step back the conqueror spreads his wings
Kindergarten rappers, I'm back to change things
I rock the clearest, one hell of a learer
Since I can't miss and I'm kinda like a chemist
When I put a potion together it's splendid and fatal
You can never make a move on me cause you're still premado
Grip the mic tight sometimes I get calasis
And when I'm through you face baralysis
I'm gettin' thinner, watch me eat dinner
I'm down to skinner beginner to be a winner
It's a

Who gets the roughest, you know the answer
You're a dandelion, I'm a panther
When I pick up the mic, as my fist see mo'
King of Rackadochio, I'm magnifigo
When I rock, hearts roll on and walk bad
Cause I know it's makes the face-sucker-ducks mad
I came back to smack wifes and pull cards
Introducin' the original Todd
Just like a bloodhound but I got this spellbound
Your rhymes are snowbound and I can throw down
I'm like a thundercloud, I drop heavy
Hold steady, get ready, your petti confetti
Techniques and styles, they ain't ready
Ah, ah, yeah, full of horsepower and I'ma devour
Stay clean when I scream you're soft las cauliflower
I set the track and record you like a brown mouse
Then flick and do a Bruce Lee 'roundhouse
No threat exist, no man can stand
Say mic check and expect to take the man

[Chorus]",Def Jam in the Motherland
LL Cool J,"Just like Pauline you all-in

Oh,
Brace yourself, I'm the ace with grace
I'ma win the race and make you feel disgrace
In any case, yo, I'm moving like a steeplechase
MC soldiers, about face
Now step off, I need room for my takeoff
My custom made lyrics slays, yours are soft
I think you better tape this, yo, you can't escape this
Yo, I planned it out just like a landscapist
Whipper-snapper back up for coming crap up
I plan to trap a MC and kidnap em
Phony, so skip the baloney
You and your cronies need to jump on a pony
And roll, cause you're just a rookie
When it was time for rap school, you must of played hooky
I'm the show-stopper, your rhymes are improper
I'ma teach you like the master taught the grasshopper
Just getting warmer, I'm a transform a
Regular rhyme into a barnstormer
Try to jump I'll bump you chump, my job is thorough
Any MC, state city or borough'll get ragged
I drop like a sandbag
Serious as the mob, I don't play tag
Best of the batch, no man can catch up
Hoes can't be passed, a battle's a mis match
I flip lyrics, like a acrobat
And avoid combat like a diplomat
But when it's time for back lash, jacked or killed
It's a thrill to drill a run of the mill Bill
With my skill, I'm the lord of the rhymes
And I be writing at a rate that pace way past my bedtime
I rock the mic unlike
Some brothers I know, I guess they flow, pysch!
I'm dropping 'em

Dropping 'em

Yo, you're all in, stiff as a mannequin
I'm sharp as a pen and I'ma teach discipline
I get busy like it's two of me
Evidently, I'm hated by a few MC's
But so what? I just max like I'm playing the sax
And take the crowd to the climax
Yo, Cool J, I'll never go astray
I'm funky you can hear me at the Milky Way
You're weak, wick raps, I'm cool as jazz
Got razzmatazz ask my man Shabazz
I know you're afraid because I'm self-made
I invade, and blow up like a hand grenade
MC's are terror-struck, I'ma run amuck
Cause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck
Just a toy boy, can't stop my convoy
Rhymes I said last year were just decoys
I'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox
I'm back with a style that's unorthodox
You must of had a teaspoon full of bull
I'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful
They try to get with this, to me that's an insult
Boys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult
I enter like a giant saying fee fi foe fum
Then rock the auditorium until it's pandemonium
I'm dropping 'em

Yo E, dropping 'em

Don't sleep, cause I'ma go deeper
All you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper
My rhymes are rising, the angle's getting steeper
I hated Mussolini Martini so I'ma sweep a
Emcee, like he's one of the two
Break him into fragments right in front of you
Mic check one two, is too fundamental
My rhymes are monumental over an instrumental
In the center, I had to enter
Tormentor mentor experimenter and inventor
Of lyrics, so all you non-believers
It'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a
Rude awakening, you can't do anything
You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring
Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence
Alarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced
That the crew invader, soloist exterminator
Greater evader of ducks, concert crusader
Is bad, my nickname's the circuit breaker
Eating up the world, acre by acre
I'm dropping 'em

Word to mother, dropping 'em!
Know what I'm saying? Straight til 1999, dropping 'em!
Yo, year two thousand, ya know what I'm saying?
Audi man

Yo I'm dropping 'em",Droppin' Em
LL Cool J,"Yeah
Funky! Uh
Yeah
Yo, let me tell you bout a girl named Peg
A D.C. haircut and stewardess legs
Dressed to kill, her physique is ill
Her face belongs on a dollar bill
Her boyfriend's down with the M-O-be	
Driving around in a 300e
Trunk jewelry and all that
Talking bout, ""My man can't fall black!""
Sipping on cham', diamonds on her hand
Taking cash, carrying drugs for her man
Driving around in a kitted up Jetta
Under the seat a automatic Beretta
You know, the whole blase blah of rap
Telling brothers they need to get off the bra-strap
That's the type of girl she is
Word to Miz, she got the
Full length blue fox, knock you out the box
Big rocks, this girl is hype Hobbes
The type of girl that cold did son wrong
She got the face that you want to spend money on
Her man be smacking her up
Yeah, backing her up
To the wall, get undressed, where you going?
You ain't playing me out with that hoeing
Look in the mirror, check the jewels
Silly rabbit, you know the rules
But he had to leave on another deal
So she's out there with sex appeal
It's the weekend, time for freaking, she's sneaking
Outside, telling her home girls, we can
Do the do, with who-ever we want to
Cause we're the fly girl crew
Not knowing her man messed up the money
Riding around, thinking everything's funny
Went in a disco, came outside
Somebody pushed her in a beat up ride
She had to pay for her man's mistakes
They shot her in the head
That's the breaks",Fast Peg

I'm going back to Calim hmm, I don't think so

I'm going back to Calim, I don't think so

Going back to Cali, styling, profiling
Growling, and smiling, while in the sun
The top is down, on the black Corvette
And it's fly, cause it's sitting on Dayton's
Laurents steering wheel, plushed out, gold-leaf phantom top
And three girls waiting
Vroom engine's blowing, the chrome, is shining
Passing all the cars on the way
Movement of the wind, back wheels spin
Pop in a cassette and push play

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali

Takin 'em to spots they never before hung
The place, on Sunset it's a trip
Where the A.C.'s cold, and the girls still strip
The record skip, but this girl kept dancing
Prancing, grinding, grinning, romancing
I asked her to the barn, so we could hit the hay
I want to do this, Brutus, but I don't want to pay

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, no man I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali

I'm going back to Cali, rising, surprising
Advising, realizing, she's sizing me up
Her bikini, small; heels, tall
She said, she liked, the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster
She's looking for a real good time
I said, ""Close your eyes, I got a surprise,""
And I ran away with the bottle of wine

While you're steady fronting in your homeboy's ride

You're the type of guy to try to call me a punk
Now knowing that your main girl's biting my chunk

W, x, y, z, it's bullshit to me

Rhyme to the rhythm of a or should I give a brother time
And move on, you better get another vick to work with, or quit
Cause I'm on some ol' L shit
Capable of murder but I never committed
Taking no shorts so you better forget it
Tracklin' the world on my tone deafen station, taught her
Supercalifalistic emcee excutioner
Wicked witch, diggin' your ditch
Givin' ya stitch by stitch, ain't this a bitch
Sweeter than lemonade, stronger than a hand-grenade
Rhymes are laid, go deeper than a mermaid
Louder than a siren, I'm not retirin'
Despirin', admirin' the way I'm gettin' fly and
I sees ecleptoes and I resent those
Brothers who slept on, when they shoulda kept on
Rollin' with rush it don't get no rougher
I stopper, huffer and puffer, a buffer, suffer
I was holdin' back the man superior, right?
You want to take my title, yo, you'll be alright
You stand below the plateau I stand on
You want my faction to put the man on
I Shake'n'Bake and break the laws of gravity
And if you chew on, you'll get a cavity
Cause I'ma giant, and you're a pee-wee
And all that LL shit, you can't see me
You're cheap and weak, incomplete and off-peak
Cause it gets no rougher
It gets no rougher

Release the juice on 'em

I release the juice smack dab in your face
Do damage, I'm pickin' up the pace
My mics' like a torch when I'm walkin' at nighttime
Straight to the dome, it's like a pipe-line
High speed, stronger than Thai-Weed
And before you pick up the mic to get fly
You need all the dope khaki's that you can feature
So I can serve you, you know the procedure
Listen to the man intellectualize, visualize
Your whole posse gettin' paralyzed
I don't want to hear no alibi's, don't apologize
ER-ERM-ERM, I 'll put the highs' in your eyes!
The bass in your face, like you ditch the attorney, 
I'm on the case
With rhymes that'll hit ya, get ya and sit ya down
The competition is booty get the picture now?
Skip the record, my road, to get me-a-go
I'm figurin' yo, nigga you know
I won't allow, not now, no way, no how
Any form of disrespect, you better bow
Time gets rough to swamp I do it pump
In between my jaws adversaries got chomped
The cordless mic is my only utensil
Lyrics you be runnin', I break 'em like a pencil
Cause I'm massive, and you're a small fry
You're all in, a stunt, a fall-guy
Outta order I smolder blacks to make you SUFFER!!

Shut up, the alley cats' got attention to get
And drop these L dope lyrics on ya, 
The beat is pumpin', you know I'm sayin'?
Tell 'em

Let me ask you ask a question,
You could take the game of rap and rule it alone
Demonstrate many styles on the microphone
Build an empire like an African King
I had to show Apu Jack the Ripper could swing
I'ma rappers nightmare, I crush my opponents
There's only one title, I own it
Emcee's flip-flop, I bust out the workshop
They try to eve'sdrop, goin' to make rock
Aerodynamically, it's all automatically
The way I jiggly full of originality
Shay-shop 'em and stop 'em like a cheetah and an antelope
Then I cut 'em like a cantaloupe, on the table
They ain't able, I'm a legend, not a fable, gotta keep it stable
Crack your back bone, harder than grimstone
Doin' your justice overseein' like a chaperon
Huh, on the hip-hop scene, I got shit sewn up like a sewin' machine
Eat a rapper like a sandwich, leave 'em in a bandit
Crack the stage and leave the audience damaged

Yeah, get funky on that cut, get funky on it
(Yo, L, them lyrics is dope man you know I'm sayin'?
You better raw sick for years..) this how we do it dog
(Pump that good man, let's cut us some real, real somethin')
Yo, bust this

I'm kinda like a soldier, see I told ya
When I pick up the mic I'ma hold ya
Captive, a mack-tive, I'll make sure I'll track it
I'll speak a cell a sneak as your backs' gettin' weaker
I freak the beat and get shieker
Rule over King, you're too over-eager
You're tryin' to make a move for

I think he was jealous and in the mood for an ass-kickin'
When you mess with, the man with the plan
Mic in his hand and a fresh skit
R-O-U-G-H-E-R, rougher! So here we are
Face to face, mic to mic, man to man
While your battle ship is sinkin' in quicksand
Strappin' to the bottom like a two-ton anchor
And break, pull the rope, point blank, I'm a sniper
Rapper like a pack, step on 'em like a mack
My DJ Cut-Creator scratch a record like a cat
E at my side with pride who got a bigger rep
Shh, smoke the mic like a cigarette
Every puff is rough I pull, kill a bull
One toke, your crews' a joke
I run through rappers like runnin' through rubber holes is
Nigga, I'm comin' up roses
Step back, I got the title, bear-witness to a dope recital
I've killed many men my friend and I'ma do it again and again and again

Word up to this slow gangster beat type thing
Check it out yo

Jealousy, I wanna kill him and shoot him
He's a sucker, I'd like to execute him
Recruit him, put him in my school and school him
I said something simple, and I knew that I'd fool him
He's only mediocre, jealousy can't get with me
Hang up your clothes, cause jealousy ain't spent to me
He's just a monkey, riding my back
In fact I kidnap, ram-sack, hijack and back slap the fool,
see my name is Cool J
I play for keeps, the microphone's my tool
I've been holding back long enough I had to bring it

I'm not lackadaisical or lazy on the microphone
I bring the bacon home so jealousy go home
Or play the wall and pout about the way the prince is rolling
So when they give it up, stand back and start folding
All your jealous show clothes, I think you need to grab a
half-pint of Cisco and hang out with Backstabber
Cause I'ma break down all walls Jealousy built
and then walk tall, like I'm standing on stilts yeah
Jealousy the jam is mean you'll have to rewind it
If you didn't know about him, you must have been blinded
Ask him if I'm right, he'll tell you he sure is
Excuse me for a moment, fellas sing a smooth chorus

His name is Jealousy fellas see what I mean now turn it out
without a doubt and if it hits you in the heart don't pout
Cause I'ma hit Jealousy and his posse where it hurts a lot
Him and his boys have a habit, they always smirk a lot
and make mean faces, I see em in many places
Scared to face us, they wish they could erase us
or outdo us, can't do damage and never will
The Legend in Leather is clever, man I'ma never chill
Allah take a break from this, yo I love swingin'
Yo E, pop the bubbly, fellas, start singin'

Oh yeah, now I'ma wind it up
It's time to move on and end the Jealousy cut

I flowed like water now I'm finished explainin
In the spotlight tonight his name was Jealousy
And for some strange reason, it seems fellas be
falling for him, I hope you understood
Stay away from him he ain't no good

L can yell or make 'em melt like gel
I signed the contracts that buils up stacks
Play the wall or fall I stand tall you're small in fact
Step aside, you might get fried
By the super technique that the rapper applied
As a matter of fact, the impact will distract
Your attention away, from the rest who say
They can mess with Cool J the best of to-day
And best 'cause the rhymes are so funky fresh
I'ma attack smack and make 'em stand back
Black strong as cognac I got the knack
To rhyme to the rhythm of this, and give 'em a gift
That's swift, other rappers are stiff and don't riff with
Mr. Smith, 'cause that ain't safe
I get you wide open like an uncut eighth
I write to fight, don't bite, to reach heights
The mic makes right, give me the spotlight
So I can prove the pen is mightier than the sword

My rhymes are so dangerous, I need a permit to rap
Solo, on the microphone
MC's, don't let me catch you alone
I'm nitro!
Yo, I got the kick of a kettle drum, guaranteed to overcome
You're just a minimum, messing with the maximum
And when I swung my tongue among the high strung
Young MC's, they all got done by the legend
Every second I'm wrecking
Not a mistake you'll find, but you can keep checking
Out the sound you'll find that it's genuine
Bet that you'll rewind this a thousand times
You can taste the bass like it's filet-of-sole
I leave the microphone full of bullet holes
I drop the bomb like I'm in 'Nam and go beyond
The normal boundaries of too much harm
To MC's, but as they say please I freeze
Rhymes like these kill like a disease
Tried to fill my shoes, and caught the blues
Because they get bruised by the rhymes I choose
I kill rappers at random, I don't understand 'em
The ones I didn't get, are on a memorandum
Lines I recite are spontaneous
The nursery rhymes you write, are miscellaneous
So pass the crown, bow down and give in
I'm the Prince of Rap, that's how we livin'
Setting milestones on the microphone
Empires are overthrown, and I ain't even baritone
No joke I spoke then God stroke
As Job tried to sweat the style and got soaked
Conquered and killed on the microphone
MC's, don't let me catch you alone
LL's nitro!
Nitro!
Yo, flammable, like gasoline
Threatening, like a guillotine
It's like a bad dream when you battle my team
I go to every extreme to make MC's scream
I'm clever, I last forever, we can do whatever
With whoever, whenever, I never
Ever got rocked, stopped or dropped
They got popped, by the hip-hop rock that I concoct
I'm so nice yo, flowing with the maestro
Murdering and hurting MC's because I'm nitro
The earthquakes'll kill snakes and fakes
You can't flake, you made a mistake, give me a break, thanks
Now that we're straight and that's clear
Watch all the big mouths, disappear
Disintegrate, deteriorate, fall
I demonstrate, and devastate you all
There's no doubt about the fact I turn it out, the wack
Be on the lookout, LL made a comeback
Full of power, I'ma devour
I stand tall as a tower, I won't allow a
MC to see-O-M-E, see-L-O-S-E
Play me long D-I-S-T-A-N-see-E, M-see's
On the microphone, I'm nitro!
Nitro!
Yo (funky)
I daze amaze faze blaze and beat 'em down
Nowadays they crave and praise, the funky sound I pound
Rhymes I write 'em in, recite 'em and then slide 'em in
Order to slaughter comp that start soon as I begin
Total domination, across the nation
Devastation, cut sensation, it's the invasion
Of L the Terrible, devastating rhyming wiz
I cut through through do and chew, you know what time it is
Slick, I get off of kicks, vick your flick
Hard as bricks, rock ya sick over the mix
The L, L, see, O, O, L J Period now you know bro!
N-I-T-R-O yo go for what you know
Unless you're dumb 'cause yo I'm nitro-glycerin

LL Cool J,"One shot
Oh lord
You know, it's gonna be a lot of negative things surrounding you
Trying to pull you down
But what you have to remember is
It's up to you, it's your choice
You only get one shot in life
And you only get one shot at love

Did you ever notice, every time you fall in love
And it seems like you finally met the perfect match
Everything is perfect, it seems divine
But for some strange reason, there's always a catch
It's a one-way relationship, it hurts inside
One person smirks while the other one cries
Butterflies in the stomach of the one whose in love
It cuts like a knife, the truth mixed with lies

One shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
That's all you get

Physical and mental, those are two different loves
Physical's a moment, mental is forever
If the physical fades and gets weak, all of a sudden
Remember, it's the mental love that keeps you together
You gotta be strong and endure the hard times
Cause af-ter hard times, good times, always follow
And when you're kissin' and huggin' and makin' love
Treat that person like there's no tomorrow

One shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
That's all you get baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one, shot (one shot at love)
That's all you get 

Jealousy, don't let it interfere
Don't let it come in between
The love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God
So merciless and mean
And it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships
And pit two people against, one another
And because of this God, the one you love so much
Will no longer be your lover

One shot (one shot at love)
Aw baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
That's all we get, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
I mean this baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
That's all

I hope you understand what I just said
All I'm saying is that you only get one shot at love in life
And you have to hold on to that shot, take advantage of it
Cause when you lose it, it's gonna hurt real bad
Take it from me
You only get one shot, and I mean that
One shot

Smoking, doping, keep your ears open
Put me on the flier and I'm guaranteed to rope in
Twenty-thousand people to the place that I play at
And have em even saying how could someone say that
They're as good as the man who just saw
Please give me some more
Of those hooping, scooping, rhymes you be trooping
If you don't know the new dance, Patti Duke'n
Clap your hands, stomp your feet, snap your fingers
I'm snatching airplay, from all you AIDS catching singers
It's a, special delivery on your front step
My picture's on the cover and the rhymes are in effect
Cause, I love to lay down, joints for the playground
And have you OD'n saying, y'know, J sound
Righteous, the brother did what he had to
I didn't talk about this, so I had you
Sleeping, breathing saying yo he ain't keeping
His promise to astonish, from weekend to weekend

Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh
Uhh, aww yeah!

I'm the wise wizard of the microphone swinging it
Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singing it
Doing a dance in tight bike pants
So get up on it (hoe!) you'll only get one chance
To work out, the soreness in your muscles
Do your own thing, even the hustle
MC's I'ma torture, that's already known
But while I'm torturing them, I'ma leave you alone
So you can bump, grind, and rub up against your partner
And look wild like you're tryin to get a part in a
Dirty movie on the hip-hop tip
Now tell me (tell you what?) that brother L ain't tryin to flip
With the

[Chorus]

Moving, grooving, admit that you've been
Shocked and rocked and I'm on top and it's been proven
I'm self-reliant, on stage I'm defiant
All those rumors are small things to a giant
I'm not a cool calm, collected type of brother
I'm kind of hype that's why I'm a good lover
In bed I'm energetic, kind of like a freight train
Going so crazy I have the girlies saying, ""Wait James!""
I do damage, use the beef to build a sandwich
And when I'm done, she'll be saying, ""How did you manage
To make me feel pleasure from my toes to my head?
On top of that, you ran laps around the bed""
So bust out the pumped up funk that I'm revealing
And listen to it, while you're in your car wheeling
On on your Walkman as you're staring at the ceiling
Or when you and your love is sex-appealing
To the

Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh
Know what I'm sayin?

LL Cool J,"You know I don't understand why you treat me like this
It's almost like you feel like you're from two different worlds
(Well, we are Todd) I don't think so
You should have a listen to me right now

I can feel it now baby I can feel it now, I can feel that
Even though you're a queen and I'm only a prince
I felt the magical between us ever since
The first time that I laid eyes on you
I want you to be my girl, so I can hold you
Caress you and let you know that I love you
And day by day my love grows
Here's' where I stand, I gotta be your man
I don't care if we're from two different worlds
But we're from

Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds
Two different, two different worlds,
I don't understand the way you feel
But it's just a dream and it could never be real
So face to face I can't love you
We're from two, different worlds
Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds
Two different, two different worlds

Man things are different, birds and bees
Flowers and trees, you and me
But it really doesn't matter, it makes us stronger
There's more to talk about, we'll be together longer
Trustin' me, have faith in my love
It goes so deep, girl you're so sweet
As a matter of fact, I want you for my wife
Please be a part of my life

I can't believe you won't give up

We're from two different worlds (I don't care)

Never could keep us apart (Whoo, yeah)
Hold on (hold on) who cares what the world is sayin'?

So what's it gonna be, you want to be with me?
I want to be wit'chu, my love is true
All you gotta do is get into love
It's like a blessin' in disguise, sent from up above
This is your last chance, real not fate
Give me a break, don't make a mistake

Two different (have a heart honey), two different worlds (I want you, I need you)
We're from two different worlds (take my hand honey)

LL Cool J,"Warning, MC's stand back
You better take a chill and observe the skill
of the man who can, so understand god damn
I got a masterpiece a master plan and a brand new
way to attack the wack cut 'em down to size
to realize LL's back
Don't sleep I'm too sweet to repeat a beat
a lyric or rhyme I wouldn't waste your time
with weak words, that's for nerds, you never heard a rhyme
So you deserve a line rougher than rough enough is enough
I'm, gonna slaughter choke ya smoke ya like a sauna
You don't really wanna
But if you wanna battle on here's a lesson, stop 'fessin
I'm a lethal weapon, you better get to steppin
off the stage, and outta my face
You're too light ? save the bass

[Chorus]
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?

It seems like people-'ll never understand
On the microphone I'm not your average man
I cool out sometimes, I save my best rhymes
and then the toy boy thinks that he can come and get mine
Let your friends gas him up, talk trash and make bets
then gets played like those kids who tried to rob Goetz
You don't know what I'm sayin?  Yo check it
Give me any microphone and god dammit I'll wreck it!
I'm coldblooded I'm about to mutilate
Last year before I left I told you to wait
But you couldn't stay loyal started goin astray
Thinking Tom, Dick, and Harry can mess with Cool J
Is you crazy? I'm booming, got the talent of two men
The stamina and skill in battle to kill a few men
The heart of a lion, the loyalty of a soldier
I wreck your whole mob then tell ya I told ya!

[Chorus]

Cause I don't jab around you, I come inside
Bob and weave, deceive until you get tongue tied
Brawl for all give a lyrical display
and next time you know better than to get in my way
""Yo whassup wit LL?
Will he ever make another 'Rock the Bells'?""
Yo brothers is coming up, ""I think he's falling off
I don't think he's still 'hard as hell'""
See, this is the attitude, of ignorant ones
cause they don't know, all them MC'sll get done
One or two might say, ""Yo L'll be back""
but the rest they be sucking on sugar smacks
Talking that crap about who's better than me
You think so? Just let a MC
make me mad enough, to really wanna battle
I put a L on his ass like he was cattle!

[Chorus]

Just cause I make a love song, or say a simple rhyme
""Boom, move over L, it's Miller Time""
I don't know whether to laugh, get ill or get wild
Cause brothers don't realize, I got so many styles
like tripling up the words, confusing all the nerds
Heard put my sights on mics and ? flipping above the word
to the mother, no other
MC brother, can mess with Ladies Lover
I'm original, I'm bright under color
And when I get on the mic, yo I burn rubber
Can't stand criticism, give 'em an exorcism
Been rocking for years, now I have wisdom
The way I'm kicking the lines you can hear my tongue twist
and it'll have your neck spinning like you're spineless
I'm picking 'em up, throwing 'em down
Hyping 'em up and slowing 'em down
All of these words with only one tongue
Shaking 'em up and then baking 'em up
Smash boom bash scraping 'em up
Now you thought that was hard, I just begun
Cause I'm a roll on the microphone
And take control just like Al Capone
I'm notorious, you're foolish if you sleep on me
Cause I'm too slick to let a rapper get sweet on me
Try to make a move for my heavyweight belt
You get played like the Wizard of Oz witch, you melt
Yo I'm crazy dope, with super hype lines
and a lot of hype lines make one dope rhyme

[Chorus: x2]

Cause that's what it is

Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you think they call it dope?",Why Do You Think They Call It Dope?
LL Cool J,"Do you remember, the first time you fell in love
The way it felt, the way it feels
Being able to say, from the bottom of your heart
I love you for real
Your eyes, meet, you feel your heartbeat
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em
Oh what a thrill!
You was always searching, and finally your dream came true
They came strolling along
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart
I swear, I'll never do you wrong
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Nothing in the world could separate the two
And even though you've only known that person for a short time
You tell 'em I love you, you're my heart

You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK
You're too young to be so serious
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you
And walk away aggravated and furious
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter
The relationship's yours
You feel you're maturing, and hey,
You can fight your own battles and wars
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm
Life is sweet, kissing caressing and hugging
And keeping each other warm
But now comes the serious part, 'cause love
Believe me, it ain't a easy task
We'd have one argument too many
And you'd have to ask, am I still your heart?

Am I still your heart or is something, pulling us apart
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what
You run out the door, I tell you come back
I love you, you shout out, so what?
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain
To me, the person who treated you right, did you right
And held you tight, every night
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?
Cause if it is, aw, baby, please, don't do this to me
I'm trying to reach you, trying to talk to you
It's killing me, 'cause you're my heart
That's right I admit it

You're my heart I refuse, to let you go
I struggle and fight for you against all odds
Get down on my knees, and pray to God
That our love is in the cards
Cause I know you're right for me
And I know I'm right for you
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands
People say forget about it, move on
But see they don't understand
You're nothing to them, but you're so much to me
So much in fact that I'd give my life
To stare into your eyes and caress your face
As the priest, announces us man and wife
We'd live happily, ever after
White picket fence and the whole nine yards
And anything that anybody said
I'd disregard, if I was still your heart

So make up your mind, 'cause I've made up my mind
I'm begging you baby please come back home
I'll be tossing and turning, as I lay in my bed
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones
This can't be true, I'm losing you
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright
All I wanna do in this whole wide world, is hold you tight
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried
Now it's up to you baby, please understand
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything
Just let me take ya by the hand
And lead ya, baby I got ya
Protect you like a mother, protects a child
Now it's up to you, I'ma call you in a little while

Nothin' can save ya
Nothin' can save ya
Nothin'

Just throw your hands in the air 
And wave 'em like you just don't care 
Keep 'em there 
Yo, run the jewels, run the jewels, run the jewels 

Can you feel it?

I used to be rollin' like a millionaire 
Cash in a flash, bankroll to spare 
Homeboys hangin', champagne and girls 
Got my main woman diamonds, my mistress pearls 
Everybody laughin' at my corny jokes 
I was stupid, I thought that they were sincere folks 
It turned out they liked the money and the fame 
If I ain't get paid, I'd be that nobody James 
The nobody who dreamed about bein' somebody 
Chief rocker at the party 
And they was hangin' like, ""Yo, I'm your man 
I don't even care about the ring on your hand"" 
We'd go out to eat and chill 
But they would go to the bathroom 
When it was time to pay the bill 
I didn't notice all the chuckles and laughter 
Too busy with a female, tellin' me I'm the master 
I was slick like, ""Huh, do I know you? 
I got play, here, let me show ya"" 
Used to have a girl that was on the ball 
When the cash flow got low, so did her calls 
Used to have a homeboy, always chillin'
My cash went low; he told me I was illin'
And don't call 'cause he don't hang with derelicts 
Broke with no cash, yo; I was in the mix 
Everybody stepped 'cause my pocket wasn't fat 
My girl got a new man; I fixed his flat 
I'm the one that they're laughin' at 
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that""

Can you feel it? 
Can you feel it? 
Can you feel it? 
Nothin' can save ya

A anchor to my ankle and jumpin' right in the ocean 
Cause I'm ashy, and I can't afford lotion 
So-called friends in the jewelry store 
Told me, ""Todd, come back when you get off tour"" 
Souped as hell; I really regret it 
Now the only thing I got in my pocket is bad credit 
How can a man like me 
Be walkin' around in a world of misery? 
And if women like a man with a body, it's not mine 
Cause they be walkin' past me like I'm a stop sign 
My homeboys laugh when they pass the forty 
Sayin, ""Todd, as if he used to have a sporty"" 
The Benz was slammin', the Jeep was pumpin'
Ain't that somethin'? 
I just laugh; this isn't what I was raised for 
When I walk away, it's like ain't this a
Kick in the rear that I'm standin' here 
And can't afford a tissue for my tear 
Should I drink wine and brandy 
Or get a job puttin' stripes on candy 
Or put a hole in donuts? 
Cause when you're broke, your middle name is ""so-what?"" 
I had to learn in an incredibly fast way 
When you ain't got no money, they treat you like an ashtray 
I pawned all my jewelry and clothes 
Right after that, I got dissed by all the hos 
That I thought was mine but really never was 
Soon the whole neighborhood got the buzz 
That my tank was on ""E"", and that means empty 
That Twinkie looks good, so mister don't tempt me 
Everybody thought I was trippin'
I rode the back of the bus, but my grip kept on slippin'
I'm the man that they're laughin' at 
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that"" 

[Chorus]

I want to hang with my man like, ""Let's do this"" 
But this man like, ""Who this?"" 
That's right, the brother got two faces 
They got me puttin' the tips on shoelaces 
P on the Puma, a mop and a bucket 
My motto is: I don't care 
I don't give a damn; so what, why try? 
I might as well rob some Blake Carrington sucker for his money 
It's so funny 
Cars ride by, with the boomin' system 
Sayin, ""Leave him alone, my man already dissed him"" 
Now I'm on the cheese-line, poverty-stricken 
As the red tape thickens 
I go to the park; they want to baseball-bat me 
I go to the mall; they throw my old tapes at me 
I'm so horny 
And every girl I know be like, ""He's so corny"" 
I want money in a hurry 
I'm gettin' tired of leftover curry 
I want to fall off, but I don't know where the edge is 
I'm so hungry, I eat my neighbor's hedges 
Now I realize I gotta go for mine 
It's windshield time 
I take quarters, pennies, dimes, and nickles 
And a kiddy's tricycle 
I'm a desperado 
""I'm a steal your rims"" is my motto 
I watch wrestlin' until I'm dizzy sore 
So if you're cashin' your rent check, know how to get busy 
Go to the drive-through, run with a milkshake 
Go to the supermarket, pocket a raw steak 
I need beer 
I'm a catch the Miller truck out there 
You know how they throw the newspapers in the morning?
The owner don't want 'em 
I'm the man that they're laughin' at 
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that."" 

[Chorus]

So yo, one more time, one more time 
Party people in the house tonight 

Just throw your hands in the air 
And wave 'em like you just don't care 
Keep 'em there 
Run the jewels, run the jewels, run the jewels",Cheesy Rat Blues

I leave scratch marks under the tears of a clown 
I write rhymes that shine like lipstick 
So much material, but not materialistic 
Imperial styles I use

It's so visual the way I'm throwin' down 
Visualize MC's goin down 
In a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes 
The moral of the story is: I'ma get mines 

I saw the cord-less, boy, I'm gonna house that 
Your rhymes are cheesy, you found em in a mouse trap 
Don't try to front while the freestyle's droppin 
He wants to battle, he must be needle-poppin

Writin' your rhymes, starin' at my signature

I'm unique when I speak to a beat 
Another rapper'll fall when the mission's complete 

I daze and amaze, my display's a faze 
Every phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays 
The competition that's lost in a freestyle

With the magical wand that they're callin a mike

In order for us to make this thing work, man
We've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and the prostitutes?)

Ah, ah
That's funky

Yeah
Hey yo, Marley, man

Yo, what's up, man?

Hey yo, man
You know
We was getting busy on the album everyday
We been getting funky, but
I wanna take this jam back to Farmers
Know I'm saying?

Yo, let's go back on Farmers
And get some of them early MC's
You used to be kicking it with back in the day?

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo, let's do a jam with them

Alright, bet
But first I gotta like introduce it
You know'm sayin?

Aight, kick it

(Farmers Boulevard)

Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin' Games People Play
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin' to my man
Talkin' bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin', I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard

Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
I'm makin' moves, not fakin' moves
So don't you never come around here, talkin' that talk
Or walkin' that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savor
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! I'll have you breakin locks
I'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin' forties of beers
On the Boulevard

Funky, funky, funky rhymes bein said here

Hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo Uncle L, let's go

Yeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip
Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little something

Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleeing like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, cause the brother who cross me's getting buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mother is comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handing me a mic is like giving a chainsaw to Leather face
Smoking MC's in an instant
At my side busting caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip making you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up

Yo, yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo

Yeah, we living Chinese people in a Turkish bath, baby

Hi C over there, man

Yo, what's up Hi C

Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leaving bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreading terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a body bag)
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother

Yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo
I was,
Yo, what's up?

9 years ago, man
Youknowmsayin?

Yo, I was kinda,
I was kinda stagnant to sleep on it
But yo, L
Won't you, won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?

Aight, let me sum this up

Now you heard the brothers speaking bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hitting, beats kicking, you can't get none
F-a-r-m-e-r-s passing the test
Marley Marl in the background doing the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, kato
Get up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh
I did a jam against all odds
And it was dedicated to Farmers Boulevard

Hey yo, man
Ain't nothin' like a nice bowl of cornflakes in the morning 
To smooth you out

Milky cereal
(Baby)
Milky cereal
Milky cereal

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest female of them all?
It was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul
Rich female, very debonair
Drivin' a Rolls with rollers in her hair
We was hangin out, pumpin' the stereo
She took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's
She walked like she was jumpin' a hurdle
I was happy as a kid that just saw Mutant Ninja Turtles
A guy walked over, said, ""Your earring's cute.""
I said, ""I'm wearin' a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop.""
Me and Frosted went to get a drink
But she ordered somethin' bugged, and I ain't know what to think
She ordered potassium, calcium
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium
She took me to her crib, threw me on the couch
I woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth
She's

Milky cereal
(Baby)
Milky cereal
Milky cereal
Milky cereal
Milky cereal

I went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm
For some reason, we walked in the rain
She had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain
She had a salary that was full of calories, for real
And I was in the mood for a home cooked meal
So we went to be alone
But we had to be quiet, 'cause her corn pops was home
Kissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms
I said ""Forget it, let me see your lucky charms.""
When we began, her hairstyle was neat
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat
Talked about marriage, I said ""That's risky
Besides, it's such a waste of Rice Crispies""
She had a robe with the velour material
Her pops woke up, I said ""Hello Mr. Cereal
I came this morning to deliver the paper.""
He said ""Stop frontin', I know you caught the vapors
That's my daughter, so save your croonin'
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in.""

[Chorus]

Yeah, check this out here

Then there was Pebbles, times was rough
She was turnin' tricks to get her ""coo-coo puff!""
Her mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact
She was wearin' an Apple Jack hat
With a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks
Her father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pocks
We called him Hungry Jack
He talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack
He invited me out to lunch
With a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch
The waiter said, ""Jack, what would you like today?""
He said ""I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?""
He said ""Cool,"" came back with the order
That's when I said, ""Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter.""
He said ""Pebbles? Boy, are your crazy?""
I said ""Nah, I want to ride in a Mercedes
She could sing while I'm swingin' my thing
'Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King.""
He said ""Go party, do some minglin'
You and my daughter, your brain must be jinglin'""
I said ""It's smooth, no disrespect
She'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week cheque.""
Then we walked down the aisle
Our honeymoon was milky cereal style

You know what I'm sayin'?

Milky

Peace!",Milky Cereal
LL Cool J,"Nah, y'all, nah, y'all, uh-uh
I ain't disrespectin' though

I'm just sayin' it happen to me
It can happen to him
How you doing?
What's your name?
Oh, you're his girl

Hello, my name is Mr. Goodbar
I'm came to offer champagne 
Later on, maybe, I'll tell you my real name
But for now sip your drink and be merry
And be a nice girl and sing me a cherry
Me, I'll have a Cowa-loo and milk
'Cause champagne always stains my silk
You got a man?  That's somethin' we will talk about
He's smart enough to have ya, but dumb enough to let ya out 
I like ya friendly bag, your alligator shoes 
Ya hairstyle, and ya whole point of view 
The way you lick your lips and stare 
You tell me that's a habit, hmm, yeah
Funny coated legs with not one scar
The stylish wardrobe is up to par 
Here's my number; call me in my car
You deserve a visit from Mr. Goodbar 

So how long you been talkin' to him?
Word, nah, he's cool with me, he's cool with me
Oh, he loves you

Honey, open up a bottle of brandy
Better yet, have a piece of Cool J candy
And sweat the man with the master disaster
Break ya like plaster-plan and
The cards on the table, and the deal is dealt
Uh, I'm in the mood for a tuna melt
And I can't make you; I sure wouldn't rape you
Feelin' kinda mellow, and I sure would hate to leave the job half-done (Nah!)
Cause at a time like this you're the one that I'm lookin' for
Callin' on the floor (Woof!)
I'm comin' back for more
If the Mona Lisa's name was Teresa 
I'll get a piece-a of the Mona Lisa, then smoke a cigar
You deserve a visit from Mr. Goodbar

Yeah, so you be callin' on the request line
oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, he's my man; word him too
Yeah, I like Bobby Brown
Tell him he's cool but

Don't be cruel, 'cause you'll be on your own
Cause my, rockin' my microphone
Come and get this ice-cream cone
Or I'll deliver it when your daddy ain't home
Grown and healthy, that's how I like 'em
Big juicy legs and a nice pair of kegs 
Hmm, Mr. Goodbar style
You haven't met a guy like me in a while
I jump out a cake, dance, play, shake I ain't got no Body By Jake
Smooth as Whitester extra dry Moetzer 
Don and I'll slip it in your mouth like a Bon-Bon

Ya know what I'm sayin'?
I'm Mr. Goodbar, (Goodbar) yeah
So, you know next time, uh, your man is out
Check my,
Nah, nah, he's cool
But my girl, oh, I don't know, your man might be with her, uh
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
But I'm with you, yeah, Mr. Goodbar, baby, uh
May I say, may I say that outfit you got on,
Slim, juicy lips; so honey coated,
Yo, he never says that to you
He never gives you compliments 
Yo, he be givin' you flowers, baby
And tellin' you how much he cares for you
Does he hold you, and caress you, and give you affection
I didn't think so",Mr. Goodbar
LL Cool J,"Hey yo, don't go near the speakers 
The big showdown, the display is skill 
I'm the type of Picasso with ya girl on the pill 
Take a family snap shot, kiss ya wife 
'Cause I'm like a knife, the concrete is right 
And I'll take ya life, and take ya like python 
I'm a do you wrong 
Any emcee who you want to name? 
I want pain that I can be tamed 
Talkin' about guns, punk, it don't alarm me 
Got enough cash to make a whole damn army 
I can't hold back the way that I feel 
'Cause when I bust a rhyme it's like ya slippin' off banana peels 
Ya like fruit cake, ya fruit cocktails 
First your title, now I'm takin' your female 
All of a sudden you're so proud of a black 
A baseball hat but you ain't sayin' jack 
The ripper is back, and you can't escape 
'Cause one of my records will sell more than your whole tape 
I want beef, so bring on the rookies 
I got more than just Cool J cookies 
Rip, rock, crush, stop, cop; I'm poison; come and take a drop 
I bet ya teeth will end up around the corner, kid 
Don't ask me why I did it 
I'm civilized damage to a nobody 
And I'm carrying a gun if I'm rhyming at the party 
New York, Chicago, Detroit, LA 
I'll slay wherever ya play 
D.C. or Philly, or Baltimore 
I'm worrying the rich, invading the poor 
Perpetrating in your video; here's the real smoothing 
Country accents, who do you think you're foolin'? 
I play crushable, late night craps
You only knew 'cause ya onto your raps 
And rap city and B.E.T. 
The channel thirty-one, and, but now here I come 
To save the day and the now you're getting done 
Like a hooker, don't try to soul, crumb 
The first sign of the battle you little fake 
It's, comin' out ya kitchen sink 
Your Mic's a baby bottle, son 
Some say they ain't, but I am the one 
The slice is that the fire, boy, it'll break ya 
Servin' or heard 'em; a word occurred to him 
Then he could move; a would get moved on 
Like a shotgun blast, big mouth emcees, I'll bet ya none last 
'Cause they ain't stable or able 
And I bruise the party like jumper cables 
So plug me in, and put me on 
I'm serial hard, so I can battle amore 
From coast to coast fly, cripple, and crazy 
Use a dictionary, but you still don't phase me 
Listen and we can sound cheap 
Reach out for my blackness, but your records ain't wack this 
Your bitin' on the castle door but when you fall in the moat 
I won't see ya no more 
Let's get together and diss LL 
Use his name and ya records might sell 
I can't believe you found a dead maggots 
Crawlin' all over my name, I won't have that 
You better look in the mirror and re-think your plan 
Why walk in quicksand 
When you can stand on your own two feet?
I'm rippin' emcees a funky drum with a big beat 
Name the date and a or Rainer 
Ya three year old ballerina 
I can't believe the suckers try to throw-down 
Whether you're new or older than old town 
Just kick back; I don't like a, psycho rap 
You can't handle the format 
Whether you're swab or swoon 
Ruff or rugged, all I need is a broom 
If I slay the way they slay, punk play the pay 
Mr. Morris has entered the buffet 
Some of y'all are sittin' in rows 
Plates of hot butter rolls, beat ya with balamey 
Slap ya with salami, 'cause when I get hot I get hot like pastrami 
Then I make ya wonder why you don't hear bass 
But you feel the thunder 
You get cooked; I'll knock out your tooth 
We'll be fighting from lobby to the roof 
You are on me like I wrote your dinnertime 
Yo, Marley 
(Whats up?) Spill the time 
(Nah, man, just kick a little warmth) 
Pass the brass knuckles then we break his jaw 
When I'm on the microphone I want silence 
Let KRS-One stop the violence 
Ain't no rivals, ain't no competition 
Punk, I'm beatin' ya into submission 
I'm gettin' busier than ever before 
Never more will I'll slack, I'm a keep it real raw 
Eat ya up like a pack-jam 
Video is poppin' over a Batman 
Rippin' you to shreds, tappin' you on the head 
Then leave the battle lookin' as happy as a newly wed 
Give me a tech-nine to spray 
Save the peep, and put it on law-away 
I'll make a mailman spin and send a jam the fans will understand 
Feel ya weep about the murdergram",Murdergram
LL Cool J,"Something real smooth
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
We'll get into the groove
Power of God move
Something real smooth
Something you need to take heed to

A base-head cleaned up his act
He stopped smoking crack and took his soul back
Decided, he could find a much better way to live
You know the way, positive
Without all the negative chemicals and drugs
Without all the hanging with the envious thugs
Never before was a man so far behind
And came back to rule for a long time
Positive will explode when you light me
My enemies lurked, and they held the dagger tightly
Wanted to taste my blood, but they got scarred
When they felt the power of God

Wickedness got crushed when the Lord came
Down with the King, cause he's evil and vain
He doesn't understand the power of a ?
Doesn't realize I'm rolling with a team
Avenging angels will come and burn
All those who saw, but refused to learn
He has no color, no shape, and no form
And like I told you before, I'm just getting warm
Get up, get down, get on it, it ain't that hard
You can feel the power of God

Money is small and the soul stands tall
All those who don't realize this, fall
The mind of a drunken fool is a useless tool
And it's cool to be in school
And overcome and overpower, but still uplift
Your mind is a gift
You're somebody, whether you know it or not
Outside the weather is hot
People walk around with their minds in a daze
Never take the time to stop and give praise
You're lucky to live in this world
Even the starving boys and girls
Cause life is a gift in itself
And only certain people are blessed with good health
I'm Uncle L, but you can call me Todd
I can feel the power of God

You know I'm sayin
And G is the seventh letter made
Yeah
G is the seventh letter made

The power of God
Yeah
The babies, we gotta teach em, and hold em
Send em to school, so we can teach em, and mold em
Shape em, and make em take form
Cause their mind is like a ball of clay when it's wet and warm
Harmless and innocent
Until they're taught to be violent, and militant
This mentality gotta be erased by faith
The 12th hour is coming, we're close to the 8th
Get a chapter, and gain some knowledge
If not from the Bible or Koran, get a book from college
It's not about being black or white
It's about everybody being a right
I pulled out my mic, and the devil got hit hard
He felt the power of God

And G is the seventh letter made
Power of god
G is the seventh letter made

That was just a word to the wise
Up rise
Cause we definitely gotta unify
And we need unity in times like these
We got to stick together
Cause we as a people
All people
Gotta make it to the promised land

Honey, I know what you're up to I know how you're livin 
I know where you go when you leave my house
I know what your dreams are but I dream too
Your with a man your not with a mouse 

I see how you stare I see how you smile 
I see right through now act like you knew 
I know all about where you been runnin 
Wipe your feet before you come in

Yeah, that's smooth, let's just sit here and relax 
While my man plays the piano for us 
Sip somethin mellow
And it's us while you're here 
But of course I ain't sayin nothin

OK, now that you know I know you know that I know you know 
And that's the move so sit right here
Whisper in my ear caress my chest
And say somethin smooth but don't forget

I'll know what you'll say
Just what I thought I know the routine 
I know the routine just what I thought
I know you tell the truth I know you don't lie

Trashy
Brother from way back.
We're blowing mics
Since the days of
8-track.
Certified
Bonified
Pull out the weapon.
Rusted.
Your ho's gets busted.
Run your jules!
Shooting up ya damn fools.
Leavin' your loser
Lazy lyricist
In bloody pools.
Went away
Came back
Your still wack.
Now your slobbing Marly's mob
For a dope track.
Coming off like a bra
And its the witness.
No click-click
A fru ? business
Don't care about no money
Got props in it.
Flipping scripts
With every letter in
The alphabet.
Wanna jump. 
Jump!
And jingle your rump. 
Rump!
Here to pump punks
With real hot lead chunks.
Full-grown
I ain't no baby with
These rhymes kid.
Put the mic down
My peoples know where ya live.
I chop you little
Brittle riddle
Right up the middle
And have the police
Playing the fiddle
In the hospital.
Somebody said, ""He
Couldn't rip with the
Roughness.""
Rhymes kick your teeth
But end up front less.
Soul survivor of a
Thousand beats
Sending funeral wreathes
To all ya use-to-be chiefs.
Is a raw
To a bearlin' in the woods?
Brothers tapes ain't jack
Their best tracks is wack.
I heard you think you
Got a chance to win
But my glock is stopped off
To murder the top ten.
Rough and rugged and raw
I'm like a callous.
The underground can say
""ain't no Fra-zontin
In my palace.""

Well can I be the
Flavor of the month?
I got the flavor
Plus I can bump a chump.
I got the funk
Straight from my
Underground hide-out.
I freak it in the house
And let the hits just
Ooz out.
Bust on the scene
To let ya know I
Wasn't fronting
Got ya screaming for my album
So I had to do something.
Write tonight
To take a bit
Not a bite.
And watch the ?
Freak you with
All my might.
Like ""Here I am to
Save the day!""
I stop the tracks
With the mic
So I say ""To chay""
And ""On Gaurd""
When I'm swinging for your brow.
Cause in the house of hits
Ain't no fronting allowed.

Just when you thought
That it was safe
To try and chop me.
Run for ya life
Now here somes Mr. Funky
And I'm pissed.
So watch how many heads
I'll be the takeout
Boy ya better look out
I work ya like a cook-out.
So get the flavor
The original Mr. Funky
?
And you watch me do my thing.
Because I hit ya with the funk
Of the fly-talker
And make your girl
""Bump-bump! 
Get it, get it!""
Like Luke Skywalker.
I can't front
I love rapping with a passion.
Crash your head front
Into the funk
You think I'm slam dancing
See when you front
You make mad
The alter weight ?
Freak this:
""funky twin powers activate!""
Sheik on the mic
With the cape and muscles.
Crushing MC's
While their girls
Do the hustle.
See other rappers
Try to dis the lords
But yo, your dead wrong.
Dammit, can't we all
Just get along?
We'll see
There simply ain't no
Fronting allowed.
Yo, I'm out
Like the Cosby show
Peace to the Funky Child.

Punching your
God-damn eyebrows
Off
Roughing it up north
Lookin' like your
Laugh off ?
It's a blash smash
And crash from my stash.
Be watching your back kid.
Your girl and the phat path.
Talking bout your macks and tax.
What's with that?
Your getting wet like
Slow sex.
Ripping on that old school kid.
Leaving sliced as a slit
Says I wet your crib.
No question.
Testing the west
And the east and
Once the ammo was released and
I'll make your girl
Come and getcha.
Hope you get the picture.
Boy your better off
If a pit bit ya!
What's its like
In the illest fight.
Believe the hype.
I'm giving crowds more
Nose jobs than Mike.
Fight sight alright
They bite
Spot light tonight
Is hype
Trigger happy tripe
Don't hit bite
My owner's right.
And ya know it's coming off
So don't ask it.
Snatching the vocal
And hotties on the rap tip.
Macking ya boys up.
Bringing the noise up.
And now ya need stitches
Because my voice cuts.
Chainsaw
Gain more
And reign raw.
And never let a brother play it

Man, you need to get up out of this spot man

I know you don't want to hear it man
But, hey, man, wait, hold up loc you got company man
(where's my guns?)

When I'm ridin' on the street I hear gunshots (rare shots)
Crack niggas cause they moms missed flips
So black man really care about politics
In the ninety's, our governments so slick
I watch CNN sometimes and I realize
They're playin' tricks on my mind
They want a man to work with his hands
Too young to die, and they don't give a damn
Rare-momma got down on her knees
But not no more, god damn it, I make cheese
I'm on the move and I'ma show and prove
You might cry to my political groove
Rest in peace,

I love you to death while my beats' like a reef
In the middle of the night on the city streets
The only thing we got left is the beat

All we got left is the beat, huh, give it to me

Who brings guns into the USA?
And then makes sure that they come around the way
Gain the points until the whole race traps
And teach up my woman that she should call up the cops
The projects are hell, wait a, minute
There's nothin' we do but ride on top of an elevator
Say the clubs, I can't get a job
Mouth to feed, somebody's gettin' robbed
I ain't worked, but I ain't workin' for crumbs
You ever seen a man-shelter?
Check out the bombs!!!
Brother of pain, their whole lives are over
They spent every dime tryin' not to be sober
And all the ladies got bags of clothes
They'll be your long lost momma, one never knows
The streets are like a nightmare
While the presidents secretary is chillin' in his leather chair

[Chorus]

Lemon to a lime, lime to a lemon
When you need a toga-black, hire black linen
Your rippers' man applause when he can't get a job
He gets up all of his family and feels like a slob
The black women don't understand
Cause they don't realize what it is to be a black man
In the mornin', a brother feels like a jerk
Seein' black women and white men go to work
So all women fear, the brothers ain't real
Cause they won't give us no jobs, that's the real deal
Hold my hand while I get it all together
They don't deserve me at times of bad weather
Cause I'ma make it out the concrete walls
And there's another way besides basketball
Let me go, let me do what I do
I'm red, black and green, then red, white and blue

[Chorus]

Ridin' in the street you can feel the city heat
A little bit of grass and a whole lot of concrete
Creepin', I'm standin' on the corner
And you can get robbed if you want to
Paybacks a mother on the street
You're seein' gold teeth, ya hearin' funky beats
Brothers ride by real slow
You get leary when they got tinted windows
Sittin' on the steps with a blunt
I'm drinkin' Valentine, I wasn't raised up front
My Aunt Ellie always talked about God
Tell me you never cried cause its so hard
Government got a hell of a plan
But word is born they ain't destroyin' this black man

Still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while
So I pull up to your door to give you what you're looking for
Hardcore
I know you want to come, in my jeep
We can park on a back street
You're checkin' out my car phone, scopin' out my jewelry
Let's do this in a hurry
Air freshener is kickin', drive through for chicken
I know you need a good stickin'

You got class but deep down you're real freakish
You got it all, but you never had a wild episode
That's when me and my jeep showed
Up with the funk in the trunk and
Hittin' it, we're spunkin'
I'll even get you drunk and tipsy
Cause I know you're feelin' frisky
You love it 'cause it's wild and risky
You got your eyes on the hood
You're up to no good
I took you in the back, you hoped I would
You got your black on black so stacked in the back
While I'm pumpin' in the CD I'll skip a track
Windows are foggy
And, uh, back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby
And you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets
I give it to you real raw in the backseat
That's how you want it, don't ya? (yeah)
You'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)
Don't lie 
Take it in your eye (why?)
So buckle up, buckle up
What's my name? what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? huh
I never knew a four wheel drive could be so live
I'll put your numbers in the archives
So take 'em off, and put them things on the mirror girl
It's my jeep and your world
You got it going on lovely, time to do the right thing
'cause I can tell you want to swing

We're bonin' on the dark blocks
Wearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock
Seats full of sweat, I told ya I would hit it
Your kitty, kitty, cat, cat, was hungry so I fed it
Workin' as a team
Somebody, anybody (scream)
Jump with me to the cash bar
I'll be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin' ""wah""
Damn, it's so good, the mad grip on my tip
You're still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip
You go wild and stick your toes on the roof (yeah yeah)
You're so cute, wit' your gold tooth
Extensions on the carpet
That nice round brown is my target
It's so firm, so cushy, it makes me feel mushy
I love it when it's pushy
But don't laugh, I'm serious with this (word up)
The back seat of my jeep, is priceless
You're climaxin', you're climaxin', it's full action
You love a good waxin', it's so relaxin'

People are gettin' done, people are gettin' done up (we gotta rise)

Diggedy down, down just look around, my world is goin' down
Disease is spreadin' everywhere, I can-cannot be found
This, the season for murder, isn't no reason
To hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin'
And every alley-way, they're gettin' high
On playgrounds they're sellin' crack and every day another baby dies
Pistol whippin', kidnappin', anything can happen
Diggedy down, diggedy down with Old Trafford

Many poisonous chemicals and (uh) boom!
Many devilish goals are up (uh) soon!
No love where loves' ya dwell in
Mother-earth transformed into hell an'
Ice, murders, conspiracy and (uh) schemes!
Young boys will reveal their, dreams!
Handguns in the hands of the young
And diss all this paranoia, yo, there's much slugs for everyone

We need to rise (rise), as if we live with our eyes (eyes)
Stay away from the hate (hate), before it's too late (before it's too late)
We go ah

James Todd Smith and nine years old
When Sugarhill was in control
I'm listenin' to cold-crushed tapes to get sold
I set my demo in a silvia-treated me cold
Time flew cause I was gettin' my shit off
Sixteen-now it's about the time to set my first hit off
(""I Need A Beat"") I Need A Beat, it was a smash on the DL
But everytime I did a show my name was misspelled
Can't Live Without My Radio drops
I'm kickin' down the door-crushed cool box
Rockin' the bells like a madman
Dissin', event-flippin' the script-but then I made my first $50,000
All I wanted was a pencil, a little gold
A little money in my pocket and a Phillie to roll
I'm makin' records, now alla the girls are on my tip
I'm sleepin' late, no money damn, I'm late for school, SHIT!!

I Need Love, that means I need a girl to love me down
I dropped the pretty style cause rap was gettin' ugly
I waited a year for the results, I'm triple platinum
We know the presidents are flowin' by who's sackin' them
I'm that type of guy when poppa wasn't happy with it
Trippin' them up, that was my style, but everybody bit it
Yo Marley, hit the remix, make it fresh with flavor
Another power move, I'll switch my hat, the shit is major
Puttin' out Till Da Break Of Dawn, tell me what sucker?
Cops harass me Illegal Search motherfucker
I'm just a brother makin' jams now I got a name
I still remember chillin' with my pistol on the train

Look around, and turn your wet dream to fright night.
You can call me R and B, homies, which stands for rough brother,
Word to my grandmother.
I buck you in the head just to let ya know.
Stick you for ya dough, spit on the flo',
Drag it out of ya, bring it on.
I smack him back down, yo dope, word is bond.
I know you want a piece of the champ,
But you roll too weak, you couldn't make it in my camp.
You thought I went for the flip,
But I'm bustin' off hip-hop, clip after clip.
I kept you out there, ripped you for your wear.
Jump inside your video, bust you with a chair.
Smack, slap, smack, slap, smack, slap, smack.
Just to make it worse and hurt your pride I'll run it back,
Smack, slap, smack, slap, smack, slap, smack. 
Click, click, boom, stop dead in your tracks.
Stick the steel in your mouth,
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, lights out.

[Chorus] 
(I'm comin'.) 
How ya comin', baby? 
(I'm comin'.) 
This is how I'm comin'. 

The album that I'm comin' with is rough, the flavor's mean.
(Ooh.) Kickin' you for real, in the guillotine.
Fourteen shots to your dome, kid.
I'm doin' time in the game like a bid.
Movin' rhymes like a package.
So stigetty step up and get your nostrils damaged.
Shootin', lickin', bustin', sprayin', all of that,
And then some, dead, dead, dead, one by one. 
Never step to a real man,
Cause your rhymes only work on a playground program.
They impress your little friends, bring you a little ends,
But you still you gotta ride in your man's benz.
Word to hip-hop, I'm a blast ya.
Gotta set you on fire, cause I gassed ya. 
Boom, blow, Batman, bang, pow.
(what,) uh, (what,) that's the way it's goin' down.
My new album ain't no joke.
You want to take me out, how many bunch ya smoke? 
I'll never slack again, I'm off the job like the mob.
Hey, no prob', many solved, on the knob, make 'em soft, drob.
What you gotta deal with is real, made of steel.
You can feel it comin', burnin', buildin', flowin' like an eel.
Movin', killin', breakin', servin' you, just like a meal.
Take off your clothes, and taste the steel.

[Chorus] 

Check, baby, 
Rockabye baby, on the roof top.
Open up your mouth, and taste my gallot.
When your jaw breaks your gold teeth will fall.
Down will come the monkey, banana clip, and all.
Splat, (buck, buck, buck) it's all over wit'.
Another plan O.D.'ed over my war hit.
The way I'm workin', and jerkin', and hurtin', brothers converted.
Non-believers get murdered, 'cause I waffle birded.
Get your face out the bill, catch the thrill.
Carry a nine, put your hootchies on the bill.
The thought of you gettin' scared turns me on,
Like my first television with my backup tip hard.

So where's your mouth kid?  Where's your heart, shorty? 
It's all over, cash your chips in, crack a forty.
You look thirsty, you ain't gettin' no mercy, mercy,
And ain't no way that you can rehearse for me.
Murder I wrote, murder I wrote, is what I figure.
It's in my tote, it's in my tote, so I pull the trigger.
Put up your women, your crib, your speakers,
Your dog, your cat, your crate, your speakers,
Your sister, your aunt, your crew, your Knicks.
Got 'em booin', all you mother rappers who think that's too tough.
Bam, bam, here's a hit you wish you had.
A hit that makes you mad, a hit that makes you slap your dad.
Dead, dead, dead, kill, dead, kill, dead.
Try to battle me, I gots to buck you in your head.
I pull your file, click.
I know you're good to style, blow.
Livin' wild, when it's come to this I never smile.

What did you learn from the lesson I just gave ya? 
Obey your momma, be on your best behavior.
It's never endin', and I am recommendin'
You put your name as Brendan.
I see y'all is blendin'
The message that I'm sendin'.

Peace to my brothers on ""Rikers' Isle""
Introducin' the crew, that's goin' a mile
To get behind the ropes, stop actin' wild
This here part is like section one
So you can bug-a-loo and set fire to your buns
Early mornin' light is yet to come
And when it come, we'll get buggy in the sun
Females, let your hair down
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown
With the funky sound, the razzamatazz
You give me to the ""sploshers"", you can get your-a blast
Enter at your own risk, some brothers got weapons
Yet you're still steppin', the beats' so funkafied
And answer to the bone, people'll be dancin' alone
Leanin' on the wall next to grandma's mop
With the funky, funky groove that's far from pop
Dosey-do your partner all night long
And all you mothers, bring your kids along

Don't stop till you get it on
With ya head B-boppin' like a bouncy ball
They do it in the park, they do it in the mall
But when I do it (yeah), I'm doin' it for y'all
Asiatic, automatic, your funky fanatic without no static
Flippin' on the freak like I'm acrobatic
You were searchin' for the funk and I had it
Here we go, hand over the cash yo
What chime? Hey yo, blast the Tabasco
Work your body like a dime, oh no
Do the freaky-deaky, the whole girls' cargo
Females on the side, we gotta win 'em, yeah
The back pockets are stuck with nothin' in 'em, yeah
Except my beeper number, rubbin' all my lumber so I cannot slumber
Makes me sick like an earthquake
So do the baddy-too-true, we got cash to make
Able body, ready to party, all the ladies in the house
Must be eatin' hardy
And provin' and movin', groovin', so soothin' good for ya
And clinically proven, damn!
Every little bit of the tip makes ya taste flip, like sugar on Ritz
Get on down, to the sure-shot sound
Cause all five burrows are rockin' uptown

Pump up the nasty, nasty, nasty sound
Kick back and let it please ya like a rub down
Put ya body in the lost and found
(Kick that L) I love the way its goin' down
What you see is what you get
And all the words who's next to be the teachers pet?
Down-home monkey, corn fed, original
And what you do is up to you, the individual
This is the place to be for why'all underage brothers
With the rebel mentality
Sweet young freaks sayin' ""Rock me ?Arma-day-us?
Skin so smooth lookin' all ?
Video to video, tape to tape
Walkin' through the jam in search of a playmate
Party is packed like a rich mans' fridge
Too many people in the crib
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady
Ain't nothin' here petty
Trip down to your laund-a-ray, I'm ready!
Hold your horse, and baby feel the force
And get jaws off, no matter what the cost
Come out to cloth, get hot like a stove
Early in the mornin', we're dancin' in robes
To a funkafied sweaty, greazy groove
I know the Marley remix to make you move

But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it and 
You held back when your loved jobs called in 
You had faith when they said they're not callin' 
You understood that what we had was good 
You stood by your man like a real queen should 
That's why now I got you livin' your dream as 
A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and

The his,
The hers,
Of those,
Of theirs,
Of them,
I see your title
Around your neck, 
Just swingin' loose.
I take your gem. 
I'm takin' it off your neck
With every line that I select,
And wrappin' it up and cuttin'.
While I'm starin'
With disrespect. 
Bustin off.
Yeah,
Squeezin' like a vice grip,
Blowin' ya off the stage,
Into the crowd,
So have a nice trip. 

I'm takin' control.
I hold
The microphone as good as gold.
Fly, so many heads.
I built my twenty-fifth
Totem pole.
Turnin' it out,
And gettin' wrecked
Is just a understatement. 
How special to rap a flat,
Puttin' his head 
Inside the pavement. 
Burnin' 'em up,
Just like a flame thrower.
Rippin' 'em
With the cool flower.
Takin' 'em out in pairs,
Like the man, Noah.
Holdin' 'em up
Just like a trophy,
For the world to see. 
You really ain't superb,
You see.
You're goin' out,
Like a girl to me. 
Takin' your little
Boo-hoo, baby.
Tear drop.
Cryin' style.
Breakin' it down
Until there's dust,
And I'ma vacuum up the pile.
Showin',
And provin',
And groovin',
And makin a movie
On the mic. 
Slappin' a Marlboro
In his mouth,
Just like
A dirty little tyke.
Master of the murderous
Maniac,
Mad style,
Amazin' man.
Mackin' the mic
Since I was just 
A mere child. 
Props and props; 
More props than Terminator 2.
With pen and pad
I play to you,
And on the cross-fader too.
Endlessly with energy,
Undefeatable lyrically, 
Expandin' my empire.
You don't want to test me.

Wizard of funkadelic.
Every album's like a relic.
Bite the line,
Chewin' on mine, 
But ya never live to tell it. 
Bustin' it off quick,
Flippin the script.
That's in the bushes,
Then walkin' around the jam.
I'm handin' out pounds
And mushes.
You're makin' a face.
You want to test my slick maneuver?
Your best to rock a break beat,
Or somethin' you can groove to.
Even if every rapper
In the world was makin' jams,
As soon as I set this off
Their mics are slidin'
Out their hands. 
Rockin' the junky's world
With the release 
Of every single.
Back in the days
I told ya,
I need a beat 
To make ya jingle. 
Overlord
Droppin' the sword,
And choppin off the mic cord. 
Rappers are dead
All over the street
In every state I toured. 
I'm dealin' the truth,
With living god
That's right before ya eyes.
And I'll be rollin'
In hoods and sneakers,
You can keep the suit and ties. 
No sell out.
Bet ya uncle never dies.

I'll rip it up 
Until sunrise.",Straight from Queens
LL Cool J,"Check it out 
I break a nigga down ugly like Coke, up on the scale 
Next step throw a stack up on the third rail 
The undisputed, I'm never ever diluted or polluted 
You could fuse it, if ya choose it 'cause it's deep rooted 
I make ya maggot ass crawl out the gutter 
For underestimating as I'm creating the butter 
Cliques get clipped like heavy bricks when I'm dropping
I'm wrecking nigga whole shit plus I make a profit 
Wicked with this shout, bodies are fished out 
I'm wrecking niggas one-by-one but then I miscount 
Mispronounced, how do LL bounce 
And get ya shit bust? I turn ya fagots into mush 
Ya slipping, I'm gripping microphones real tight 
Then I crack up the speakers in ya Ac all night

Select my dialect, inspect all my checks 
He claim he getting money but L cast the cheque 
You sell blunt weed, Glock block, horizons 
Niggas in the projects find ya hypnotizing 
You clowns know when I bring forth the heat 
Hardcore niggas be wearing panties, looking sweet 
I'm on a journey through the land of fronting niggas 
Nervous motherfuckers with the hands on dirty triggers 
I lay back, niggas beef or let my nuts live 
I take my blade, insert it until ya guts give 
Execution, the destroyer of ya suspect bunch 
What? Drama! You can't believe how I deliver bomb shit 
Ya brains split, the pain hits ya little dick

You falling backwards, leaning like a dope addict 
Rope niggas claim me, packing automatics 
Found his ol' Earth's burner underneath the mattress 
Go outside, the bitch up just like a actress 
I take ya motherfuckers one-by-one and show ya how it's done 
And dick ya down in front of everyone 
Bitch niggas ain't got no type of reason 
To say a bullshit rhyme in LL season 
I'm freezing, ya bleeding heavily up out'cha rectum 
Black and blue, trying ta hide up in the spectrum 
I got ya raw ass busting straight flat 
Head up on the place mat, ready to waste that 
Operating incorporates stimulating designs 
Lay that motherfucker's shit down, nigga resign 
Don't lose ya mind, concentrating on how I shine 
You never hear a nigga like me, never in time 
I blaze it quick, amaze cliques when I flip 
I can't believe you niggas forgot who rip shit 
It's '96 and niggas like to hold they dicks 
I'm breaking shit aside ya doctor's can't fix

Fuck the tricks and all them smooth singing grooves 
I'm bringing crews, in my ring you swing and lose 
With the blues light my fuse, allow me 
To show ya crab ass fake niggas how it be 
My technique's superb when I'm pissing on these herbs 
Crystal clear so you can hear every word 
Fuck the goodie-goodie or your moms might hear it

Feels good to bust shots at the critics
You crave more taste of my funk

Knock it off
I like your style but it's a slight bit soft

I wanna dedicate this one to the game 
that put me on the map
Y'nahI'msayin?

I know you love it, the game is so irresistible to touch
You should see me when fienin' for microphones that I can clutch
Droppin' bombs, combinin' the club attracts
like the Ol' Sugarhill Gang, King Tim and Fatback
There's no question the suggestion was made
The foundation was laid when the Furious played
Grandmaster Flash slayed the competition that was wishin'
they could serve the technician with the number one position
Uh, the real deal, Fearless Four scored
Bambataa was hotter, Spoony was givin' 'em nutta
An' I was all up in my headzone, melody and all
Cosign and The Movement sayin' ""Yes, yes y'all""
It's just the love affair that never ended
I recommended that I take microphones and blow em up, ain't that splendid
This one goes out to all the hip-hop do-or-diers
A song is dedicated to the music I admire

We want you, do you feel the same way too? (I need hip-hop)

Kane's era was terror, he warmed it up
Parrish and Erick cat lyrics that'll make ya turn it up
And I was in the cut, chillin' in my drop-top Benz
with friends, loungin' with my mens, laughin 'bout all the ends
that I spends, making snaps, pumping Kool G Rap and Biz
Dapper Don, Dookie wrotes I'm about to show what time it is
At the rooftop, I was with Doug E.Fresh and Slick Rick
'La Di Da Di, Who likes to party?' was the fat shit
I mean I saw this hip-hop thing on every level
Chuck D, PE, yes the rhythm and the rebel
I can reminisce the black fist, Uzi, Terminators
Terror doom techniques that terrorize the lighter shade
It's all about the game that we play everyday
Eric B & Rakim flow to such a diff'rent way
I'm lovin hip-hop cos it help brothers escape
Let's celebrate our music people before it's too late

Survival Of The Fittest-Mobb Deep, and Lost Boyz
Lickin shots got the game hot
They even flipped on 2PAC
Snoop Doggy Dogg put the West Coast in gear
Dr Dre, NWA, Eazy E's in here
I wanna tell the world they just don't understand
My man Nas Escobar, Wu-Tang Clan
Keith Murray to the Redman, down south Da Brat
My people are you with me where you at? Ya peep that?
I'm on a mission to rejuvenate the funk
Bring the game back and give the do-or-diers what they want
When you hear Craig Mack, Notorious B.I.G.
Latifah, Heavy D, you should reminisce of me
Some say it's Naughty By Nature-'hip-hop in all its glory'
A fleet of battleships floatin in diff'rent categories
My love affair with hip-hop'll never fade away

LL Cool J,"""All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost."" 

Yeah, you know 
It be buggin' me out, you know what I'm sayin'?
That rap, how everybody, like, is using metaphors and all that 
It seems like everybody's some kind of metaphor freak 
Some kind of metaphorical freak or somethin', man
You know what I'm sayin'?  Word up 
So, you know what I'm saying
You know brother's want to make a movie and all that 
You know how I mean, so I figured you know what I'm sayin' 
I'd just make a little movie with a chicken ball 
Check it 

If you saw the movie, Wall Street, I guess you know 
The way ya stack chips and regulate wild dough 
But ain't no G-funk, and far from my era 
Tales from the hood, your boyz will feel terror 
MC's contaminatin' tracks with feces 
You think of pussy until a flick like Species 
Hi-tech, ya, my pen got velocity 
Jumpin' out the SSL like Virtuosity 
And never question what I'm doin' to ya, girl 
She let me dive deep like her panties is Waterworld 
But all metaphors, the only thing in rap 
You brothers need to stop with that 

[Chorus]
I'm goin' from 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good? 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?

Check it, 
I'm makin' Speed like I'm Keanu Reeves 
But too many True Lies can make a honey please 
She said, I know you want this 
Get a Pocahontas 
I got Higher Learnin' 
And bangin' gets monotonous 
Her ass is classic 
Cheeks was Jurassic 
Servin' a Justice 
Poetic the way I last it 
I touch ground, real windy, with my lyrics 
Make her talk in tongues, and feel the Holy Spirit 
Hear it, pulling light strings 
Got mad cast a swing 
When I do my thing, my ballz is hairy like the Lion King 
I'm in the jungle, layin' down my mack 
You brothers need to chill with that 

[Chorus]

Take me away 
You think I won't, fool?
Take me away 
You think I can't, fool?
Take me away 
You think I won't, fool?
Take me away 
You think I can't, fool?
It's kinda like miniature satellites floatin' in closets 
Spyin' in pockets 
Jumpin' out of a helicopter into a football stadium filled with cotton candy 

We
Word up, 
So your man got a good job lovin' ya so much 
Boss on his back, comin' home like, 'What the fuck?' 
But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin 
That's when LL come in 
Blast a ass like Apollo 13 
Sugar get the cream 
Hoppin' dom in every direction 
What a scene 
He can't understand your best friend's plan 
Running game while you chill with the Demolition Man 
Good love, have fun, tight hugs and flowers 
I have your girl runnin' off to fake baby showers 
Better get down before ya cryin' at home 
I got her standing on the bed gettin' closer to the Drop Zone 
Some brother's won't appreciate that 
Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack?
Let's run it back 
See the flavors in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me 
Balls a lethal weapon, dick a menace to society
You ain't a player-hater, kid, you took her off restriction 
I make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction 
Kid, you know I'm game tight when you hit it tonight 
I hope she screams my name right 
This word is born kid, you know why?

Cock the hammer let the uncle give 'em one 
Done take a flick of a wicked lunatic 
Puttin' hits on your clique, got'cha wife in turnin' tricks 
What you don't want to, I thought that you was bawlin' 
Now watch 'cause I cock ya love, ya girlies fallin' 
Uh, what's my function? Lyrical injection 
Blazin' niggas, hittin' 'em raw with no protection

What goes around comes around, not around farmers 
Silence, sh, very deadly 
Come and battle, let me add you to my medley 
Possessin' power, takin' everything I can grasp 
Go get it now, why you always dwellin' on the past? 
Baby boys reminiscin' old school shit 
Young fools get dicked, LL rules the shit 
With a platinum fist, the relentless abyss 
I take you to a land where piranhas like to kiss

Chuckin' the color outta cartoon character

Oh really, now tell me how long have you been whinin'
Sixteen years, twenty million albums, yeah you're climbin'
I love your joint 'rock the bells', it was mad hot 
Ya record 'bout the radio was blowin' up my spot 
My girl was on your chip when you flipped 'I need love' 
Your backseat count set was mad butter, son 
I loved your boomin' system it was wicked as could be 
You bad, now I'm writin' on your pink cookies 
And you had me screamin' 'mama said knock ya out' 
Ya jinglin', baby, no doubt

Ten times platinum your career's looking critical
Reach for this, mother fuck being a criminal
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal
You wanna freestyle fuck that
I need at least seven figures to even touch that
But since everybody was underestimatin' my format
I dropped Ill Bomb and now niggas want more of that
Ain't a rapper dead or alive fucking with me
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads
I can talk about movies, I can talk about awards
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four
And 2001'll be mine, by law
Why name the Greatest Of All Times?
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standing in line
Loving the way I shine and my lyrics combine
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch

Laying up at night, peepin' at stars,

I told ya my status was that of a don,

I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take 'em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, 'cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
Yous'a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?

Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin' a tiger cub to his knees 
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga, you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name

LL Cool J,"When you was seventeen and I was nineteen
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens
We didn't know a thing about love
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug
Held you tightly and promised you the world
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl
When I think about it now makes me smile
Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while

Funny how you grow up and innocence fades
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (Of what?)
Of the darkness and bitter memories
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity
I promised you I'd love you to the end
Always and forever since way back when
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend
You taste better now than you did back then

[Chorus]
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl, understand me
You will always be my candy girl

While you sucked caramel apple lollipops
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock
We used to walk down the block hold hands
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man
And any guys that want to socialize
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that tries
My peeps used to say I was whipped
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt
I would look up at ya I remember
The afternoon you surrendered
We made love the temperature was high as could be
You said ""Todd promise you ain't lyin' to me""
And as we went our separate ways you turned back
Smiled, I remember all that

[Chorus]

(Take it to the bridge)
Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and every day

When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call
Of days when love was true I slept and held you
Taste the brown sugar, let your climax melt you
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me
Sweet love strictly
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul, your heart, and your mind
In your hour of need girl, I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love

You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat

What do you think

You are my life
I have to go on
Havin' me any way you want me baby
Just love me til the tension's gone
And don't you come too soon

I'm patient I never come too soon
When I kissed you you said it was the same old tune
But I missed you my life was filled with gloom
I was hopeless sittin' in an empty room
When you re-appeared I was back in the mix
I put the key up in the lock cause true love fixed
All the drama got to stop baby no more tricks
My broken heart was addicted but now it's fixed
And I cherish you forever believe me you
You's a priceless treasure from my point of view
It took time to change I'll admit that
My back in the days love I had to get back

[Chorus]
You are my star ship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late 
You are my star ship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon
(never that)

I never thought that I would ever lay beside you again
Tastin' every inch plus being your friend
Romantic nights with shootin' stars and full moons
Kiss the rose better til it come full bloom
Can you feel it passions overflows in waves
Keep it steady providin' everything you crave
Now you ready I like that my love you save
I love it when a bad girl agrees to behave
It's the motion that makes your love affair complete
But devotion makes it all twice as sweet
Back together reunited bonded once more
Before I was hesitant but now I'm sure

[Chorus: x2]

Well now you know how I feel
And I definitely know how you feel
Word up
I'm feelin' this
Word up
Cause wit' you by my side
I'm a take it to the top yeah","Don't Be Late, Don't Come Too Soon"
LL Cool J,"I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,
So help me GOD
I just felt like telling the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that

If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin' on the phone
Come on

All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed

Moms got tired of the beatings said, ""Yo, we got to go""
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't taking these whippin's no mo'
I want to live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Looking down at me standing on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feeling me?
(I'm feeling you)

[Chorus]

My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens
Possessed by a demon, a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screaming I can't forget that
My grandfather tried to close the do'
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real

[Chorus]

My head was spinning, I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops disappeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started getting beatings everyday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishing the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'
That's just the tip of the iceberg look
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book
Word is bond, that's real baby

[Chorus]",Father
LL Cool J,"I was swerving through Queens
Fully growin' Benz
Searching for the butta through my Cartier lens system
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly
My fav' is
The smo' mo, crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice
Crease my scar piece
Laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne
She lived on the South side, so bring things on
Honey got flavor, and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks

[Chorus]
Your car make me hot, hot, hot
You just make me just hot, hot, hot
I like your rocks, rocks, rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check this out, uh

She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde
Scooby dooby hizza
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh
I've got her right where I want her
Reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly, gently with my G
While the light reflects off my ice p
Waiter, ice the Crystal, let it simmer
Lights too bright, here's a grand, make them dimmer
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop
I don't mind spending paper when it's looking that hot

[Chorus]

You burst out of semi-top
She pulled down the straps to her dress
Reached in the back sparked up sess
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the bass
She said ""Now would you want to sell your soul for chips,
And give up girl to push whips?""
Never miss some, spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone
She said ""I would do anything for money
Give deep pockets to my man's coats
Take off my sleeves
Drop to my knees""
Talking in my face
Breath smelling like cheese
I asked her
Shorty you degrade yourself
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf
You turning me off, I can't lie
Keisha said ""Why?""
I said, ""Yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid, 
Then he correct that""
Ice is the price for an overnight wife
A true shark caller don't want that in his life
So all you ladies that are selling your souls
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll, 
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow

Dance on the bed while you under my leg
Would you suck your fingers, 
Start to beg, or would you crawl like a tiger

By age 19 Tyheim is turned out
He ain't talking much, keep a dutch in his mouth
Cop the aberrettes
Orange and Blue
Laced the Gore-tex, stepped with his crew
Black superstar, Jesus piece
Who he prayin' to? God or the Beast
Some bust blocks, feared on the block
Traded in the trucks for a silver drop top
Drug money flowin'
Jealousy is growin'
Paranoia got him second guessin'
D-T's on his back got him stressin'
He was at the light blazin' up traum
Around the corner came a tinted out Yukon
Ten slugs in the door made him fall
Guess he should of never hustled at all

[Chorus]

My man Tay-Kwan like the chicks a lot
Even when he hustled he kept them in his spot
He liked to fuck a lot and make the rubber pop
5 baby mothers
1 live on my block
Shinin' in the club
Chickens showin' love
Cash bubblin' from pimpin' and drugs
He a real pretty cat
He get from his moms
Back in the seventies, she was the bomb
His games top notch, and he don't stop
He hit a reverends daughter in a church parkin' lot
Tay-Kwan is sick, heartless with chicks
He liked to beat 'em up, make 'em suck dick
Met a little shorty, brought her back to Queens
Honey got the virus, you know the routine
Not only did he walk away with the HIV
Her man's jealous, jooked him rediculously

[Chorus]

Yolanda's always got a scream
Credit cards in ATM machines
Used to make coats, holdin' work got arrest
Honey made sons pockets bleed to death
She a vet, yet she look innocent and sweet
When she wet, ain't no controllin' the heat
For baguettes she give love to ill thugs
Age of 15 she learned to pump drugs
Then she got pregnant, abandoned the kid
Met this drug kid, set him up and slid
Now she 23 full blown in the mix
Sizin' up wits than more cliques is gettin' chips
She down for whatever, as long as it pays
She tipped off the kids and got Tyheim blazed
She was in the same Yukon, laughin' with the thug
He said thanks for settin' Tyheim up
Take a slug

Snappin' your amateur MC's 
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas 
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease 
Ringmaster bringin' a tiger cub to his knees 
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence 
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance 
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm 
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb 
You don't want to bar that you want to idolize 
And you don't want to make me mad nigga you want to socialize 
And I'm daring every MC in the game 
To play yourself out position and mention my name

A mouth full of rotten teeth with a dildo in her hand 
Who the fuck let you in, all my assistants are fired 
Now I'm looking for some washed up rapper that I can hire 
You know some old school nigga wit a bit of attitude 
Pay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude 
You say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food 
So what I scratch my nuts, how the fuck is that wrong 
For so glowing, Afro picking 
S-curl hating, Jamaican rum sipping 

Kid I'll burp on your girl butt cheeks

I'm bananas, out of my fucking mind they won't let me back in

Transporting out, the poison in 'em 
Box 'em up in the aisle with the frozen dinners 

And them niggas that ran

My goal's to get 'em 
With the heat seeking flow with, four antennas 
Doc's the Name, that's why why y'all fuck wit me 
I'm pocket change, the bums don't fuck with D 
Objective in 'em, Carlo inspection sticka 
Check the pen, I write like a X was in 'em 
Teeth gritting, I brawl wit a major league mitten

Yo, this be the Cool J function, music get my blood pumping 
Down for whatever, which usually means I'm up to something 
Who owe me something, them niggas in the back fronting
They rocking cuffs and, put the eight up, repercussion
You know my name, so there's no need for introduction 
I'm Mr. Done it all, so none of why y'all can do me nothing 
Bitch I'm grown, puffin on that one and bone 
Bet me and Queen Bee be swinging til the honey comb
Backs get blown, trash get thrown 
In headlocks, from this view, I'm fuckin' Star Jones 
I'm red hot just like candy, in '95 won the Grammy 

Yo, he use it as an ashtray now 

Niggas can't stand or understand me, yeah

Still pulling out pennies, Fuhgidabowdit 

The shit I see every day brings tears to my eyes 
How I holla at my niggas brings ears to my cries 
Stick niggas for not knowing, then teach 'em something 
Bitch niggas talking bout you from the streets you fronting 
I never liked you, and you, I don't know 
So what the fuck you think is 'sposed to happen, we goin' go 
Mano a mano, whatever nigga, I'm goin' dust you 
If you can't pick that afro, I'm goin' bust you 
Walking like you was a lil nigga 'cause you is 
And don't forget that daddy's gonna always love his kids 
Cracking niggas got the nerve to wonder why I rob, why 
You guys will live while everybody else'll starve 
That pretty shit is played, fuck what your name hold 
Break a nigga off something, watch a nigga gain fo' 
Now you laying somewhere cold, stiff as shit 
And all that riffing shit, men's will get you hit, bitch

Right here baby

Look in the mirror while I tell you a tale
About a mogul named Uncle L
Sit on eight figures, man with a vision, move with precision
(He excels, they all fail)
Undisputed, the game got so polluted
That he turned his 'Radio' off
He 'Needed A Beat' so he could 'Jingle' them bells again
Watchin' the plasma TV in the loft (with somethin' soft)
With a leopard print outfit on
Cause he known to flood any mic he spit on
He's a (uh uh, 'Phenomenon')
Ice glistenin', listenin' to 'break of dawn'
He went from, 'Hollis to Hollywood' in fact
Owned the Dow Jones and stacked the NASDAQ
Conference call with his broker, 'What's the yield on that?'
""Exotic Motorcars,"" we want a deal on that

[Chorus]
Mirror mirror (you go baby) speak to me (you flow baby)
What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)
It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)
I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)

'Around the way girls be doin' it well'
They love the way that man look on the (XXL)
On the Money magazine covers
When he stop at the light, it's like his Benz hovers
Smoke blowin' from the chrome exhaust, of his Boxer Porsche
(Look at him, lickin' his lips when his joint pull off)
Ever since 'Boomin' System', damn she missed him
She, couldn't resist him, dreamt she kissed him
In a, warm jacuzzi full of 'Milky Cereal'
She said (I need love from the grand imperial)
I been his biggest fan since five years old
And now I'm twenty two, I love money (ooh)
'Backseat of the Jeep', you need that
(Who do you love?) Baby repeat that
(Who do you love?) You need to keep back
Milk and 'Pink Cookies' he known to eat that

[Chorus]

Tryin' to get as much money as possible, no negative consequences
Knahmsayin baby? I'm goin' long, feel me

'Hey Lover', I'm 'Loungin'
'goin' Back to Cali', cop a crib on the mountain
Strobe lights jumpin' off, birdies is bouncin'
'(Four)-to-the-Three-Two-One', he stopped countin'
Eliminated competition quickly
Phantom of the Opera on the low where your clique be
He feel his flow deep down in your artery
Peep her man's checkbook (uh) that's where his heart'll be
'6 Minutes of Pleasure' for 'Jack the Ripper'
Young players fall quicker from chicks and hard liquor (ahahah)
But uh, he's 'Bad', he got 'The Power of God'
In the Four Seasons, laughin' at the L'urmitage?
He been there, mini-bars, RandB stars
Young groupies in the lobby on the search for (Bobby)
Young tycoon in the Steve Wynn suite
Readin' e-mails with ten on repeat, I seen it

LL Cool J,"Yo, yea, alright after this particular practice run 
I'ma practice both verses, after this, I want you to find a spot
That's close to when the beat drops to the rewind point, locate point
You ain't gotta be on that all night, this the soundtrack
Yo, Yea, Check it
OK, alright, huh OK

The other night I was up at Farmers, politician wit some bloods
They told me ""yo L, in the streets you ain't getting no Love
And Ever since the X's and the Jiggas came out
My niggas ain't trying to the hear that smooth shit you talk about
What's Up wit that cat Canibus, some played you out
Why you didn't answer back correctly, fuck was that about?""
As I sip on some henny, and try to explain some things
About the life of a legend, and all the Drama it brings
Been gone a long time, had a lot of shit on my mind
I decided I don't want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine
Streets is Hip-hop and I'm Hip-Hop, so the streets is Mine
Ballin' as long as you been livin', that's a long time
Hard to Stay hungry when your pockets are so fat
You hit a hot one in every city on the map
And niggas keep sleepin' and you keep coming back
You know better than the gat, but niggas still want to clap

[Chorus: x2]
It feels so good to be back Where I Belong
The Streets is Where I Belong
They Had me locked down much too long
Hey Hey

Some Say ""L that's cool, but see times have changed""
Niggas got red bandannas, and the grill in the range
That gold shit is dead, niggas rock platinum chains
Trade O.E. for Henny, Colt 45 for champagne
Hustling niggas found they way into the game
Extorting all these so called ballers wit big names
And you gotta have a squad, 'cause running from Def ain't safe
I know you living good, but ain't no smile up on our face
I'm like a villain, I'm representing on my lyrics
And force feed the world, even if they don't want to hear it
As far as Canibus go, my man is hittin' his ex-broad
I'm getting head from his new piece
While 20 gang-bangers applaud, you came up with that bullshit
Some heads sucked it up, then you dropped that garbage album
And Totally fucked it up, I coulda told ya I knew your moms
From the after-hours spot, when I used to be up in Canada
With the dreads on a black block, before you dick rode Lost Boyz
For a ticket our to Jersey, but being the man I am
I tried to show ya mercy, I could of told the World
The way ya label hates your guts
And how me and Wyclef, got together to set you up
And how he gave me half your budget, don't believe me look it up
Ya A&R promotion niggas, they helped me hook it up
I hate to be responsible, for destroying your career
A one-hit wonder, huh
No Wonder you disappeared, I could of told the world
You get your lyrics from the internet
Then spit 'em word for word
Like you really a rap vet, How you take metaphors from books
And put 'em in your rhyme, and how you really from Canada
And you been frontin' all this time
I heard your second album, that shit is garbage too
LL Cool J and I did this to you
On that note he said
""Yo L, you the man"", I said peace, one love
And Drove off in the Lex Land

[Chorus: x2]

Yea nigga, the jig is up nigga, huh ha
You know what I'm saying?, all that bullshit you was talking
Don't mean shit, you finish now
I'm still the man nigga 
The vanguard award is in my motherfucking living room
You know what I mean? come get that shit, fuck, what
MIC still on my arm nigga, word up
Both arms, I'ma get another one nigga
You Know what I'm saying, this LL you know how I get down
You should of known, when you did it
He probably did it to get some fame
But is this really what you want?",Back Where I Belong
LL Cool J,"You ever get to the point where you so frustrated
You ready to give up?
You ready to end it all?
Don't do it dog, word up
I don't care if you black, white, Latin, Asian, whatever
We all go through pain
When you can't think, use your soul baby

Preliminary discussions is over with, the verdict is in
I took the rap throne back
I reigned like krills in eighty-seven, my name is on the map
It feels like a razor down the middle of my back
They slept on my lyrical ability to blow
Gave another nigga credit for inventing my flow
I'm a child of God, witness the rising son
From the cradle to the grave, I remain number one
This thing of ours, got competition taking red showers
Grieving mothers calling 1-800-Flowers
My repertoire burn your ashes in the urn
Is it God or money that really make the world turn?
Grab your gun, separate the ones from the real funds
Inhale deep and hold it in your lungs
The streets was requesting some original LL
A soundtrack for niggas that was raised in {hell}
They looking for a leader that can guide 'em through the maze
Smoke filled rooms, breathing in purple haze
Po' nigga's on the bricks his whole life
He ain't got nothing to live for, so fucking living right
But if you stay in the rain like hurricane
Gold melts down but it don't fear flames
Toxic, lethal, psychologically evil
Genocide was committed on the black people
And the ghetto is a trap with glass walls
Should I sell drugs, be a rap thug, or play ball?
We end up in the grave anyway
The average cat and LL Cool J
It's a never ending cycle, life and death
Until then may my mic stay blessed, to the death

[Chorus]
I can't think! Why do I feel I'm losin my mind?
I can't think! Could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I can't think! Even though I'm a one of a kind
I can't think! I want the paper, that's just the bottom line
I can't think! Mo' murder every day around the way
I can't think! I'd rather get paid and parlay
I can't think! It's all about survival God
(You know the epilogue by James Todd)

Put your life on the line, you running out of time
The coroner's calling, she know she on a nigga mind
Amongst the dogs, real cats is hard to find
Even a nigga moms hate it when he start to shine
Get the money and run, dodge the devil and his sons
Spit powerful parables like a sermon has begun
Fuck the turntables up, leave the DJ awestruck
Attitude is what, keep the razor blade tucked
Too much flossin'll get your reputation touched
Too much rappin'll get your big mouth shut
Protect your neck nigga, you'll get it in the gut
You wearing a vest? What if you get your throat cut
Sold your soul for a dollar, now you having bad luck
Used to keep a bad bitch in the crib bagging up
Player here, player there, nigga turned you out
But never told you beware
Never told you that black love supposed to be shared
And you never judge a woman by the texture of her hair
Fancy cars and gold teeth, G-strings and things
The almighty dollar replace the wedding ring
The Ark of the Covenant was held by a king
I ain't trading my soul in for skins and chrome rims

[Chorus]

Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
The dawn, of a new millennium, came to pass
The world revolves around sex or cash
The black man's motto, ""Kiss my ass!""
Shorties in kindergarten are strapped, ready to blast
All I ever seen was killers and dope fiends
From FEDS Magazine to the heart of killer Queens
Bronx and Brooklyn and everything up in between
No matter what, you always got a Judas on your team
Giving it to the world and I'm telling it like it is
Tossing lyrical daggers and sending em in your wig
Know where the body's buried, I ain't saying where it is
Raised inside the ghetto, but dammit I wanna live!
The legendary master of lyrical combat
But ain't no competition, ain't nobody to go at
So I'ma take the time and spit a universal verse
Hit the streets with a blessing and erase the curse

I don't mean this in a disrespectful way
But Columbine happens in the ghetto every day
When the shit goes down why'all ain't got nothing to say

He kicked the old lady's door in, threw her on the floor
Choked her to death so she don't scream no more
He need some white chocolate, he feel it in his bones
He heard she refinanced and got a bank loan
He used to mow the lawn, take the garbage out
Now she in the closet wit a sock in her mouth
Copped a chain, copped some crills
Crack pipe in his windpipe, twisting like a drill
Run around fronting, buying his men's kicks
Gassed a broad up so she can help her rent a whip
The other killer peeped him out flashing a knot
A well known murderer, check the ill plot
Call up Corey Buns, get him on the block
Niggas gotta eat, plus he front a lot
He came through, straight strip search
He said I'm coming back, and I'ma put in work
Niggas told him, hey yo, leave that shit alone
But pride mixed with crack, had him in a zone
Prepared for more shit than Depends
Eyes bloodshot through a Cardier lens
Niggas said Buns came through looking strange
Yeah, Buns won't stay in his lane
Aight, Buns want ghetto fame
And caught two in the Ukraine at point blank range

Jamaican cat, real treacherous
Used to smuggle burners up from Texas
Had the ill crib out in Rosedale
Took the money from the trunk and copped a fish scale
Chinese Jamaican, real pretty nigga
Love puffin blunts, throwing bodies in the river
One of the illest niggas that the world ever saw
Used to take loaded nines and throw 'em on the floor
He was from Brooklyn, and I don't know the block
I met him at the flicks he commented on my rocks
We rolled back to back, while I was slinging raps
He was slinging crack, I was seventeen fascinated by the stacks
Running with dangerous niggas and packing gats
Uh, the shit thrill me, looking so clean, and living so filthy
I heard his right hand man disappeared
They found his bike in the street somewhere
Conspiracy theories, niggas talking shit
Small world, I was close to his right hand man's chick
She kept beeping him he never called back
When they found him in the trunk his body was jet black
Pretty Jamaican kept doing his thing
Him and his older brother got caught up in a sting
Out on bail, pressure by the feds, he caught seven in the head
What goes around, comes back around

In the ghetto black men are dying at alarming rates
Walking the street is like entering a sweepstakes
You never know if you goin' win or lose
We walk around feeling confused and totally abused
Can't front, I'ma millionaire living like a king
Still feigning for that shrimp, fried rice and chicken wings
Still feigning for the vibe, only the ghetto bring
Pumping songs of pain only real niggas sing
Queens finest, but there's one minus
The bodies on the battlefield that got left behind us
I'm sick and tired of going to wakes
'cause niggas never look the same in the casket
It's bugged out, they skin look like plastic
I shed tears, but use shades to mask it
""Mr. Media"", where was you at when my man died
When it was classified a drug related homicide
It's like until the killer hit the suburbs
I ain't hear nothing, not a word
""Mr. Media"", help us shed light on these homicides
Not just Columbine, but all the time

It's a, homicide, just a homicide 
It's a, homicide, just a homicide 
It's a, homicide, just a homicide 
It's a, homicide, just a homicide

LL Cool J,"I just want you to fantasize with imagination
Know what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah I like that
Give me some more, some more of my vocals
You know sex 'em up a little bit
You know what I mean?

You're the honey that I see when I'm riding by
The one giving me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh
Acting like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye
Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turning me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny
Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss
Let that nigga hear you scream
Sounding like that screech on the fax machine
Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a raccoon
Touch yourself baby tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go

[Chorus]
I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)
Have you calling me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill
(I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide)
Imagine that
(Me and my fold got my broads collide)
Imagine that
(Knocking girls off two at a time)
Imagine that
(Disrespect you and still make you mine)

Uh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school
You've been a bad girl you broke all the rules
Forgot your homework, chewed gum in class
And the only way to fix it is to give me some ass
I got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk
I kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh
You're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks
The vibe is thick baby, we both red hot
I kiss your neck unbutton your blouse
Let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth
Your apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life
Got your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight
You could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey
But no Trojan soldier scold you like me
Match the calculus then measure my frequency
But when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree
Put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails
Give me goose pimples when ya put yo tongue on my dimples
Baby feel me now you got yo ass suspended
Got a letter for your parents but I didn't want to send it
I stopped by the crib you invited me in
You convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin
Then you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back
You twisting, kissing ya fist like that
Rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat
I filled it up with air again baby hold that
You a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet
Squeeze tight so I never forget the teacher's pet

[Chorus]

You was laughing with your girlfriends, sippin' a drink
When I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink
Guided you to the dance floor and held you tight
We in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights
I'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice
You rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes
The club is so black we can't see our own hands
I know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants
You bold huh, want to feel it in your hands
Rub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it
God gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it
Life is a song, you were born to perform it
Drink the Cristal at the same time
Get intoxicated till we lose are minds
The crowd separated as we start to shine
I lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb
We tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd
The lights start to flash the music is too loud
We hit the back door and jump in the limousine
You pull up your skirt I put some ice in between
You're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet
Even though we outside I hear the bass from the beat
Funkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks
DJ Enuff make the mommies want to creep
No problem uh mi spouse no aqui
Tu muy caliente tu vamos con mi
Si mami I'm the chauffeur make it whip
Take a ride bet you never forget
Here we go

Talking midnight black, nappy hair with peas in the back
Scratch my pipe up every time I hit that (oow)

No disrespect mami, but tonight L creeping

Can't hit a light-skinned dime all the time

First you got to love yourself, then you can love me

When your bra straps showin' baby girl it's love

In Paris you were on an Eifel Tower givin' me head
Go to Switzerland, private jets over the house
Come home, ghetto style, bend you over the couch

Check this out why y'all

I got the key that fits the lock of a real dog's mind be	
The answer to the question chicks ask most the time see
Why my man cheat and give some bitch my heat?
Slap me one day then Sunday he's so sweet?
To me and mine, this nigga's hard to define
Cause he beefing when he broke but he arrogant when he shine
It fucks you up, you wonder if you wasting time
Mention marriage, he lit a Dutch and peeped out the blinds
What different niggas feels in they hearts is scary
I used to say shit like,
""see man baby, you should be honored to share me""
She used to throw the cakes up, plus the burger was hairy
I used to have to think of shit to keep 'em coming, you niggas feel me?
Baby or no baby I wasn't loyal or nothing
Just me and my niggas on tour, fronting and hitting something
Red lipstick prints all over my drawers
Oh you want to be an actress huh? Well my movie's hardcore
Like Dungeons and Dragons, getting brains in a Benz wagon
Step out, jeans sagging, crew laughing
Getting blazed by the fiend for ten bones a piece
Nothing but the dog in me needing to be released
This is us

You know that I do, the best that I can
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more
I try to please you, and be your man
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more

The flip side of the coin, what team you want to join?
You in The Tunnel every Sunday exposing your tenderloins
In every rap cat's face, with some ol' flirty shit to say
Need to go home, wash your kids up, and put your tits away
Me and my clique in motion, champagne and Alize
Got your mind bubbling crazy, want to flip Cool J
Spend your last on your hairdo, but you ain't save a dime
To put your child through college baby, now have you?
Go get a job interview, your bad-ass kids a curfew
And skip that ""Bills Bills"" shit broads is goin' through
I know this prostitute who said that life ain't cute
Child born with a destiny only God can dispute
Players giggle and laugh, flashing gats and cash
My dogs don't care about you Boo, they like your ass
Told me if I call and your man answer, ask for L
So he can say, ""No L live here,"" our code is ill
Tell him you about to catch a flick with Sherell
Plotting and scheming in the shower, masturbating on the cell
The neighborhood hustler, that cat we all know
That nigga we grew up with, son from next do'
My dream was to flow and escape the hell below
But the demons in my life set fire to my dough
I thought about murder, I vowed my revenge
Like the devil's pumping hate through my heart with a syringe
This is us

[Chorus]

They say a man goin' be a man, but that's only half the scenario
You nag a cat, you giving him a license to fuck a hoe
When a man come home late, he want his girl to say hello
Not hear all that bullshit, bout, ""Nigga where you go?""
Fried chicken ready, t-shirt and panties at the stove
Messages written down, blunt rolled ready to go
Give me a hug, not too long, give me space
When a cat got issues don't need you all up in his face
Rub your breasts, kick back, smile a little
If it's raining outside, chill, listen to the drizzle
Now kiss my chest, call me Superman
Pull down my boxers by the Calvin Klein band
Wash it, enjoy the flavor, I return the favor
This behavior, should save ya
From me all night freaking, with a nineteen year-old
Half naked Puerto Rican, creamy ass leaking
Every man will agree, when she nag it's killing me
I don't always want to talk about how the world is shitting on me
I sip some Alize and meditate the pain away
And get in my own zone where I want to be alone for solo
Reminisce with photos
And missed opportunities to make some dough flow, you know?
Chill, relax baby, support me from the background
Believe in my dreams, instead, you and your girls sat 'round
Complain about, who's trading ass for cash
If there ain't no trust then just us can't last
This is us, I know you feeling that
Think about that shit, word up

I love my bitch wit no drawers and no bras
No laws, we break 'em from the get-go
Slidin' by, riding high when we get-go
Love it or leave it, we love livin illegal
Servin' or swerving in a '85 Regal

LL Cool J,"Yeah,
Word up
And you say New York City
A-ha-ha, word up (Take me away, baby)

Damn, you and your man had beef
So he left you Uptown, teary eyed, on the back streets
For me to scoop up in the Bentley drop
Long as God hold me down you know I had to stop
What the deal ma? You want to use my cell?
You running solo? This block foul as hell
You said my ex be beating on me
He mad jealous even though he be cheating on me
I said miss, let me tell you something
Bout who's making major moves and who's fronting
Huh, who's talking loud but ain't saying nothing
And those who get the one they want but keep fronting
He don't appreciate the well til it run dry
Love is blind, it's hard to say goodbye {goodbye}
But smart birds choose to fly
Cause we living in the hood girlfriend, it's do or die
Here's my definition, of love everlasting
I would trade all my cash in, for passion
Tiffany jewels and designer fashions
To hear happiness is mine for the asking
Every day on my knees I pray
That I would run into someone that make me feel this way
What you think, you want to ride with L?
Some things are meant to be baby, you never can tell
{I want to ride, with you baby}

[Chorus]
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me,
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Making love til ever after
Baby you and me, yeah, you and me

Now we dipping on the FDR
It's one of them lucky nights when you can peep out the stars
We speak without talking and the world is ours
When I glance over at ya I can feel your power
You scheming, L want a one-night stand
I'm scheming, she probably in love with her man
But we keep on rolling, hoping there's something more
Dreaming about tomorrow and what life got in store
Living, no drama, we can chill, relax
Sex all night in the morn' count stacks
Sip Grand Marnier and maybe puff a dime sack
But only in moderation, we ain't living like that, ya know?
We jetted up the tavern on the green
To talk about love cause the game's extreme
Domestic abuse and everything in between
Cause I want you to think of me when you need a shoulder to lean on
I'm from Queens, I'ma rep to the fullest
But I'd rather chill with you, 'stead of dodging bullets
Glock in the stash I don't really want to pull it
On some so-called thug cat, that's faker than acrylics
He said your fam' be riding your nerves
And you hate him for never giving you the life you deserve
Remember, the one who hold a grudge is foul
And everything you ever wanted is in front of you now
Whats up?

[Chorus]

I promise you, dreams do come true
There's trials and tribulations that we all go through
When your heart's bleeding, how could the sky seem blue?
But listen up shorty, this is what I want to do
Be there for you, baby care for you
When my dogs stare at you never sharing you
And to my ex-girlfriend, never comparing you
And do the things that your ex never dared to do
Time to bounce baby, I'm taking you home
Look at the moonlight sparkle on the 20 inch chrome
The rocks on my hand got a life of they own
Plus the blend tape's bumping and it's setting the tone
Should I jet to the hotel, is now the right time
Or should I be patient and explore your mind?
You said you grew up in the ghetto and it hurt your heart
Tried to live smart but your dreams fell apart
You dated hustlers and brought 'em customers
They totally destroyed whatever trust their was
Now you hate men and everything they stand for
Cause you want to be treated like a queen, not a whore
Close your eyes, don't be afraid to dream
Open your heart to this cat from Queens
Whatever you want to do, however you want to do it
Back to back baby, we can get each other through it

[Chorus: x3]

Know mean? Word up
Yeah, yeah
See'mon, see'mon
See'mon, see'mon
Yeah,
I just want you to think about that, ya know what I'm saying?
Late at night when you laying there
And you feel like the whole world is falling around you
Remember these words that I said
There's somebody out there for you baby
Might be me, you never know,
Word up, stay strong shorty
Keep your eyes up to the sky, know what I'm saying?
Don't let nobody tell you you can't make it
And don't let nobody around you tell you
That it ain't possible to make your dreams come true
Word up,
Know mean? That's real
Queens represent, rock on

LL Cool J,"You can call it a comeback

Doin' the buck 10 chrome skating on the battery
My, clutch burnin' on top of the world turnin'
Rippers is just learning by stacks I been earnin'
I'm the uncle, hell, future of the funk
Turn my joint up, find out why I'm different from all these chumps
And tell your favorite rapper that I'm ready to dump
For real cat, that represented rap from the jump

Six figure interest on the cheddar
From music, fashion, film and television
Poppin' amaretto, so what  got a vendetta?
I never felt better
Now forever competition get severed by skills you can't measure
I'm a champ, you a peon
Kiss the ring, begone
Known and respected on any block you be on
And be on, stand there, get your mad on
I chuckle cause there's nothing to waste energy on
There you have it
The uncut raw for rap addicts
Waited three years to see if L still had it
Ten million stars
Got beef to the deck
End of my contract, I'm the last one left!

My limousine roll up, the whole world shocked cause
You steppin out with an entrepeneur
I copped you more than what you bargained for
Roll the red carpet, enjoy the profits
First, let's make love in the walk-in closet
Daddy just made a nine digit deposit
Believe me sweetie, it's not luck it's logic
I'm the captain of my destiny
Used to dream of the things I was blessed to see
The jewels and the papers, sports cars and such
There's nothing in the world LL can't touch
You stood by my side and pushed me so much
That's why you got them 10 karats, you know what?

It's so amazing, amazing, amazing
Life's given my baby, my baby, my baby
Maybe some day you'll feel, how I feel, it's crazy
To see my baby is so amazing

Sing it baby

I've got riches wall to wall
Up the stairs and, down the hall of
All the things that we have done

Uh, uh, slide out to Venice, my game's in order
Would chip in to vent, but the city's on water
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky
A vowel on the end of everything we buy
Yellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie
I'm lovin' this life style, baby I can't lie
It feels so good it make a grown man cry
Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died
I guess I had determination
And baby girl kept me in the congregation
Now it's private jets and deep conversation
Hundred G's a month to show appreciation
All eyes on us, the cameras flash
In God We Trust, I don't love this cash
But you was definitely, by my side when my world collapsed
Now I'm, rich for life and I'm payin you back

This is like this for life baby
This gon' always be like this

Hold you tight for the rest of my life

LL Cool J,"Yeah, this one's dedicated, to my grandmother, and your grandmother
It's all love, let's not forget who raised us, word up

Big Mama, my grandmother, my main girl
I love you much more than the scandalous world
As a young boy you gave me whoopings to save my life
Cursed me out, to keep me out the streets at night

'Cause my momma had me when she was young
So you took on the responsibility to raise your grandson
You taught me if a task is once begun, Todd
Never leave it 'til it's done, Todd

Be thy labor great or small Todd
Do it well or not at all, God
Big Mama, my blood is your blood
When the whole world's against me, I know I got your love

If I was in a cell for the rest of my life
I know I'd hear your prayers in the middle of the night
Used to sit me on your lap and teach me mother with
Early Sunday morning for them salmon and grits

I love you baby, you the one and only, that's a fact
'Til death do us part, I'ma always have your back
You beefed 'cause you heard that I was cursin' in my raps
Eighty-six, still you want to run and get the straps

I love you, I promise you I care for you deep
'Cause when I had bronchitis you would rock me to sleep
Rub me down with green alcohol
Little brown-skinned lady bout five feet tall, Big Mama

[Chorus]
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table (you gave me unconditional love)
There was no time to eat, she said to me
Boy hurry to Sunday school (you gave me unconditional love)

I remember when you told me certain friends wasn't real
I didn't want to listen, I swore I knew the deal
Come to find out, everything you said was true
Who I end up goin' to for advice? You

I love you, that's why you got nurses and maids
Ever since I got paid, you ain't never been afraid
That's granddaddy wife, she taught me how to think
How to navigate through life, you made the sacrifice

You kept on livin', 'cause when my granddaddy died
It took all your might, but you ain't quit on life
We took trips down South, biscuits and chicken
Me you granddad and Alison, trippin'

Remember, you used to pick me up from junior high
And classmates laughed when the Buick rolled by
Remember, I pulled my privates out in class
And from Farmers to Dunkirk you straight whooped my (woo!)

The best cookin' a man could ever taste
It's written in my heart, it can never be erased
Thank you so much, you taught me well

How to not get souped up, because I'm LL
How to walk the street, and hold my head real high
How to live with Christ and not be afraid to die

We sipped daiquiris, but you never told moms
We even shared beers, Big Mama my dear
A toast to a woman that raised a man
In popular demand all across the land

You're my lawyer, my teacher, my doctor, my friend
My mother, my father, you with me 'til the end
I love you, I mean that from the bottom of my heart
That's the reason why my record's number one on the charts

I'm a tell it like it is, I love you forever
Dead or alive, we'll always be together
Big Mama I love you

[Chorus]

I dedicate this to the Big Mama's everywhere
The ones who raised us, when nobody else was there
The ones who held us and told us it'll be alright
When gunshots was goin' off every night

Taught us how to lock the door and check the peephole
And how to swallow Vicks when we had a chest cold
How to stay proud, and represent hard
Eat plenty baby, but first say grace for God

Big Mama, I'm a miss you
When one of us leave this earth
But baby for what it's worth, I love you since the date of my birth
And if it wasn't for my children, I would want to go first

You're the reason I'm the man I am today
The inspiration, for me to be LL Cool J
When you told me ""Knock 'em Out,"" I brought you home a Grammy
I learned to be tough from Big Mama and Aunt Cammy

A black man that was raised by black women
On tour, sippin your special honey and lemon
You told me, gargle with vinegar water and salt
The concert was hot, thanks to your support

Girl, you're the one I love
Whether right here with me or smilin' from up above
Trouble or no trouble, you always had my back
So I had to let you know your son appreciates that, Big Mama

The Benzes, Beamers and Corvettes?
Or the, wood-grain in the convertible Lex

Is it the, Diablo, parked on Rodeo?
Half a mill' in the trunk and I ain't moved no llello
Could it be I'm, anti-pimp, hundred-thousand a clip

They say Ladies, Love, Legend in Leather
Simple ain't it, uh, but quite clever
Is it the, fact I melt in liquid ice?
Tapped it once, you felt it twice
Is it the, multiple O's I'm known for those

Is it the, bowlegged, hard-headed
Little honey in my grill with her pinkies wetted?

Papi chill, get sloppy, get killed by 
Blood streams the guillotine f'real, yeah 
Pop bottles with hot models and rock throttles

I guess your motto is I'm a desperado
Leave {HA!) alone, end up like Castellano
Believe me, she flap her gums like Sammy Gravano
It's easy, child barely an Italiano
But don't do it, she'll have your eight by ten on every channel

No honey can set your body on fire like
Make you want to get higher and higher with
Put your murder game down so you can buy it for

Walk in the crib, filled with desire for

Third strike, and all of your priors for
Gave up your whole empire for

You want to time travel and re-do it, but wait
You a inmate, or worse at the pearly gates
Damn, all because you and {HA!) had an early date

Close your eyes, recognize, visualize
What's the real reason you really freezing them pies, huh? 
Tan lines, strawberry oil on the thighs
Got you subconsciously contemplating suicide

Should of learned, remember how your man died?
Grabbed his iron, it was time to ride for 
Multiple homicides, taking lives for 
He's dead and gone, the next man's deep inside 

Check one-two, I select a few
Jewels for those of you, who are still confused
She's an obstacle, hot and tropical
Fatty so rockable, that anything's possible with 

[Chorus]

Cheese fantasies, dodgin' the D's to please 
Livin' life on a flyin' trapeze to keep 
Who's the one you want? Who you want to flaunt?
She haunted, but who's the only bird you ever want? 

Why you sell drugs? Why you a thug?
Why do fools always seem to fall in love with 
More advances than technology
Every day I stack chips, whether music or flicks

All these transparent cliques full of devilish politics
Wish they could take my longevity and bottle it for 
But they can't so they kill for Grants
Smuggle iron in the party, pop (ex) for hot sex with 

Love's an illusion, mental and emotional confusion
Instant gratification oozing
Exotic temptress, eyes just like a empress
Split game relentless, I had to represent Miss

I've been lovin' you since junior high, ma you got
Everything I need, everything I want
You're the type of dime a real player want to flaunt
Lovin' them lips and the shape of them hips
When I see you in that whack brother's whip, I FLIP
I hate your boyfriend, that cat is corny
I kick it to you and I dare that clown to run up on me
When nights are stormy I be thinkin' about your pretty smile, gritty style
But duke got you locked down like Riker's Isle
I want to break your man off, I can't control it, I'm a hater
Especially, when your perfume lingers inside the elevator
You're the one, the only one
That I would beg, to give me some
Playerism's for life, eternal flossin', proceed with caution
Baby toss him, divorce him, let the boss in

[Chorus] 

So ballistic, mystic, twisted
In my dreams I kissed it, never missed it, I frisked it
Searched it, worked it, lollipopped it and jerked it
You followed, swallowed, scratch my back, baby burped it
Red Passion, high fashion
Nobody got to know I'm smashin', I'm sayin' shorty
Rock, Miss Thang, playin' childish games
Standin' on the corner knowin' damn well I want to blaze
Sweet get to it anywhere you like
On the rooftop, at midnight
The project stairs, I'll be there
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
Anyway, the untouchable, magnetic
Kissable lovable huggable energetic, call a medic
Your man'll regret it, when I hit it I'm athletic
Energize your thighs you'll recognize the size
It's epidemic 

[Chorus]

When why'all alone in the Brooklyn brownstone
Starin' at the high ceiling, what a feeling
Clothes peeling, finally you're double dealing
I'm walkin', he's wheeling, it's unreal when
You got the dime of your fantasies
My lollipop ecstasy's on top of me
Just like I thought, it's a small world after all
I don't care if your neighbors hear us down the hall
Make 'em jealous, what they gon' tell us?
If you don't tell your girls baby, I won't tell the fellas
If you don't plea, I orchestrated icebergisms
Visions of my lollipop's thick risen, for my wisdom
Plop plop fizzdom, what I give them
Make, yea baby, right there, my new anthem
I love you baby, take it deep deep deep
Deep deep deep, now go to sleep

This is hard to say
I want to make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct

Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know

A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise

Nightgown draggin' on the heated marble floor
Flash Cartier when you open up the door, slide these on baby

So butter, still relate to the gutter
Just your life style's different, spirit uplifted
Fell in love with a cat who's gifted
Turn you back to paradise, damn I missed it

Pop a bottle, light a purple candle
I got somethin' that you can't quite handle, that's why you love me
Pour bubbly, glow from the flame make your skin shine lovely

I'm long range like a miss-ile, many styles to getcha
Tear ya out the frame so the hood can get the picture

The legend is real, I'm not a fable
Captivated the screen, I'm Queens' Clark Gable

LL Cool J,"Yeah, uh-huh
Uh-huh, I can't explain it
 
You know it's that moment
It's just that moment
Y'knahmsayin? I can't explain it

[Chorus]
Can't explain it
My love when we're together
You're the greatest, nobody does it better
When you hold me
I wish that I could be your, one and only
Nobody does it better

I understand you want canaries on your hand
Masterpiece Roley, gold tri-color band
Cute wedding pictures sittin' on the nightstand
You don't want to make it happen unless it's the right man
I know you won't touch me unless you trust me
You kiss me and hug me but still won't crush me
I'm kissin' on your neck real tender
Gentle as can be, but you still won't surrender
Let me kiss your eyes
Let the smell of the incense enhance the vibe
I pull back to stare at your eyes
Sittin' there quiet like I'm hypnotized
We kiss a little more, laugh and smile
Might even share a lollipop, you know my style
Kick your Charles Davids off, relax for a while
Let's pretend that we're walkin down the aisle
I can't explain it

[Chorus]

Straight up, you beautiful b
I don't think you understand what you doin' to me
On the couch witcha legs crossed, watchin' TV
Shoe hangin' off the tip of your foot, you killin' me
uh then we kiss for real
I'm fully prepared, I'm already steel
You go to the bathroom for a second
I understand baby, I know what you checkin' (a-heh-heh)
That's when you come back and walk to me slow
That's when you change up and let it all flow
I'm kissin' on your belly ring nice and slow
I love to take my time, love to give you a show
Get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below
Use my ears like handlebars, take control
Ain't no sense in stayin' calm and playin' the role
Baby relax, let me touch your soul
I can't explain it

[Chorus]

My turn to get rocked, lifted out my socks
with sound effects and whatnot (mmm)
A little perfume above the right spot, just a touch
Never too much, I lick it like a Dutch
Two of my favorite numbers, you know what I mean
Add 'em up and they equal fifteen
You the 6 I needed you like a fix
I can see it my mind, I knew we was gon' click
I pick up the pace
You feel the stubble from my beard on your face
I look at your lips and take a taste
Switch it up I got my hands on your waist
We whylin' out, we all over the place
I'm holdin' on with a strong embrace
You holdin' on and tryin' to keep the faith
Together we blast to outer space, I can't explain it

LL Cool J,"(Sip somethin')
Uh, sip somethin'
(Sip somethin')
I wouldn't drink that, if I was you

[Chorus]
With every sip of my drink (uh)
I get a little bit closer (uh-huh)
And when I'm tryin' to re-think (yeah)
I can't really get focused (uh, uh)
I wasn't tryin' to be mean
I can see that it's hopeless (uh)
Cause your persistence overpowers me
I know you rollin' out with me

I was stayin' at the Shore Club, leanin' in the red room
Seen this tan mami, she was fresh off the sand dunes
Big bottles and models and poom-pooms
Surroundin' my table, watchin' me like cable
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades
Had the Prada shoes on 'cause the world is a stage
Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice
Like she finished her drink and started chewin' on my ice
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white
That's when I realized it'll be a long night
The vibe was right, she was laced in all white
Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic
You ever try to focus, resist with all your might
But every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' tan lines, belly rings and things
DJ rubbin' my thing, makin' my head swing
All the honies was schemin'
Cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin', oh God I must be dreamin'
My vision was blurry, the party was rockin
The tools was knockin, honey want to get it poppin'
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled
What would you do, if you was a Don
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blond?
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm
Cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb
You dancin' in your seat, and singin' along
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm
But you take another sip to prove that you strong

[Chorus]

Take it to the bridge

I can't call it, I can't tell
Honestly, I'm drunk as hell (uh-huh)
And me, I can not believe (lay back baby)
This night out is windin' down (uh)
You keep buyin' all these rounds for me (aw man)
I know what you want from me (yeah)
I know what you want

Rollin out with me (roll out)
Rollin out with me (uh, roll out)

When Def Jam signed me
They hit the lottery
It wasn't free but don't call it a robbery
They underestimated me quite possibly
It's like that when you a godfather b
I'm the greatest of all time
You heard that before
But now when I say it
It means so much more
Cause It's so true
No hype man, No crew
No reason for ghost writers
Every year I get tighter
Mothers and daughters agree I'm on fire
Check ya T-Mobile it's all over the wire
Cross ya legs baby hide ya desire
You think I'm hot
You preaching to the choir
Smiling and giggling
Thirsting like Gilligan
More flavor than cinnamon
They rush with adrenaline
I make 'em nervous
I do it on purpose
I come back hotter
Every time I resurface
Drop to ya knees baby
Praise the king
Now ask Russell Simmons
Who built the west wing
I ain't gotta be cocky
I do the damn thing
Paint ya girl with strawberry frosting
Internationally known and respected
You talk slick I'm too large to be affected
You crank call my cells disconnected
You keep slipping but my games perfected

Hollywood love me in the streets I'm gravy
Born with a gift to inspire the hood
You want to out do me and I wish you would
I'm the master separate from all these cats
I'm laughin' in '86 I balled like that
Honey catching feeling from sittin' in Maybachs
Cause her project hall is smelling like Ajax
That's understandable but everybody relax
Hate when folk get money and don't know how to act
I'm a multi millionaire homey that's a fact
But it's not the ice that makes ya wife react
Been had an entourage and platinum cards
Been getting Swedish massage in Boca Raton
What you think all them years I ain't pop no Don
Spend a night in Trump Towers with a blue eyed blond
I been did it all my Benzes was kitted
When you talk like a baller you tickle me with it
But yeah there's money out there come on lets get it
But I'm a get it in such a way you never forget it
Let's go twenty platinum albums in a row
Sixty thousand fans a three hour show
I could care less who drop and blow

These rap cats get upset with me
When security clear out the V.I.P
If honey want to lounge we gone see ID
Ain't no negotiating you gone pay my fee
I'm the boss I call the shots to keep it hot
I don't have competition I'm bigger than the slot
While you waste advances on gray market rocks
I cop municipal bonds and Wal Mart stocks
A family man but hard as a rock
And I die for my kids so stay off my block
They might be impressed with you but I'm not
After all these years I still walk with a bop
Still keep the ink hot
Still scheme like a fox
Still ready to battle
You don't want your career stopped
Industry shocked 'cause I mapped out a plot
And ran around humble with my joint on cock

Gotta do it my way

Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be OK
If you do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby

You feel so good
Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood?
Mind-mannered or up to no-good
It really doesn't matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most?
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin' outta time
Drama of all kind
But there's faith in our mind
We spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin' too fast, the whole world's in a rush
Everybody just hush

The villa in the Bahamas
The highs, the lows
The hoop-t, the Rolls
The money flowin'
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether its Mortans or Sizzla steak
But everything will be okay
[w/ 7 Aurelius] if we do it my way
'cause I believe in romance
Kissin' while ya slow dance
Me bouncin' baby? no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes girl, ill swim to France
'cause ya beauty's unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love, forever we are attached
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach

Like we Siamese twins connected by our brains
Walkin' through the desert in the ice cold rain
Want you in my life and nothin's gonna change
God willin', we still be doin' our thing
When my six-pack's faded
Raps outdated
But that's many years from now so don't rush
Little mama just hush

Clowns talkin' rubish and pretendin' they thuggish

I was raised outta Queens

But rap kept me off of the cover of Fed's magazine
Put me in a Gulf Stream
Your man done it, push the EX 100
And you don't want it, I got the whole rap game cornered

Watch me flaunt it, damn right I'm iconic
Soon as Nix find an icy track I slide on it

Cats never front on me, they know I drive weight
He's the best that ever did it, they call me Cool J
They platinum selling or, my skins turning gray 

Okay
They don't know how to act

The way I keep reein' up, servin' and flippin' this
Dot the I's cross the T's meticulous
The coldest winter ever and I'm so icicle-ish

The movement is flavorful, bags of licorice
The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace
There's no forgettin' this, the way that I'm reppin' this
My bodyguard's big but do that make me rebelish
I'm in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson
That's why I'm still a teen pop idol like Hanson

Black man, get the flies outcha eyes
You can't 'cause where you born but you affect where you die
Until that day, health and welfare, cheers
And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears
Like the Enterprise rollin' over stars for years
Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!

[Chorus]

To be or not to be the man, that's the question
Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined
To lean up in the backseat, givin' directions
Sweep the block clean as November elections
On the Blackberry readin' cash flow quadrant
Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded
CLS Vision, four Humers behind it
You forgot I'm from Queens? You can get reminded
I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm
All my albums is platinum, it's been confirmed
I'm more than a symbol of sex, I get respect
For livin' in the hills but still keepin' it mad real
Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles
You burnin' me, two words: I'm-possible

[Chorus]

Like I said
Yellow canary tennis on the neck
Three quarter black mink
Gucci hat to the side, shades
Gucci shoes, baggy jeans
Black Phantom, oak wood
That's how I play
Yeah
(Shake it baby shake it)
You do it for the gangsters
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby",Shake It Baby
LL Cool J,"Uh, yeah (si papi, uh, uh-huh)
Uh-huh (I see you papi, si)

I was in Madrid yo
Had this hot club shooting my video
They was burning up the floor to that reggaeton
Start to bailando soon as they put the record on
I was sweating like a bullfighting matador
It was the sexiest scene that I ever saw
(La fiesta, tu mi a fuego)
But I was still cool in my light blue Kangol
I met this girl, she was off the chain yo
Cooley head model from San Diego
Father was from Trinidad, Tobago
Mother was from Rio, de Janeiro
She said please don't think I'm crazy
But I've been in love with you since the 80's
? cansando baby
Have you ever been with a latin lady

[Chorus]
Uh, she said there's one thing you should know
(Just here to find to numero uno)
Uh-huh (and I'll do anything to prove it)
(If I can get with ya)
Uh, she said there's one thing you should know
(Just here to find to numero uno)
Uh-huh (and it's on, one shot will do it)
(If I can get with ya)

She said I wanna get with ya
I'm talking more than an autograph and picture
(Tu quiere, benita mi casa)
I mumbled to myself, she's a monster
She said (yo no se lo que no habla)
Don't worry 'bout it lil' mama nada
The chemistry and energy was getting hotter
This ain't like me but I feel like I gotta
She started moving near me
Whispered in my ear so I could hear more clearly
Said grab my waist and look in the mirror
Then started winding it like Shakira
All that shaking and belly dancing
I was going under, I ain't stand a chance man
If I do this, will I love it or regret it
Tempted and I don't know where this is headed

[Chorus]

(Wit'cha, wit'cha) Uh (uh)
Yeah (si papi, uhh)
(If I can get wit'cha)
(Si papi, si) Uh-huh
(Papi) If I can't get with ya

Then she kept begging saying let's go
Pulling on my arm, wouldn't let go
Rubbing my face, kissing my neck slow
When we do it say hablando como {?}
She said (ooh papi te quiero mucho)
(I love you better than any woman you know)
Just then my lady hit my cell phone
I'll let y'all figure out the rest yo

54-11's poppin' wheelies front of Willyburgers
Candy apple M3's, slidin' out gently
Rollin up in Bentleys, Tyson was the champ then
Right after the Rooftop, years before the Hamptons

You was a ghetto queen and a diamond in the rough
You was so beautiful and the world was so rough
Your man was locked up 'cause the cops popped up
You dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up

He was yo' crush, you was his crutch
He'll be gone a dime and it's hard to stay in touch
Your moms say you stupid but you love him so much
Now it's, broken dreams and broken Beemers in the dust

Standin' up on a crowded bus, for college courses
Stay on course when it gets rough, you never lost it
Stay strong baby trust, you'll be back flossin'

You can see the effects of gettin' treated incorrect
'Cause she let the cycle continue, make excuses for his steps
Her girlfriends tried to warn her, all he wanted was the sex
Once he get it, then he gone, then it's on to somethin' fresh

somethin' new, nothin' borrowed, nothin' blue, no weddin' dress
But that's aight, you still young, you got your lifetime left
You gotta leave all that alone, find yourself

Y aqui estoi
1, 2, 3 muevete!

The club was far from empty 
It was crowded at the entry 
I slide right through like how I do 
This girl began to tempt me. 
She said her name Shaiyeeda 
I could tell her mama feed her 
When they tight and when them jeans don't fit 
I'm L, nice to meet ya. 
I could feel my body yearnin' 
The room just started turnin' 
Didn't wanna go out on the floor 
But this girl was so determined (Let's dance) 
My brain began to sizzle 
I'm sweatin' just a little 
On the dance floor in the middle, 
She turned around and giggled, 
She said

You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make me leave my man 

It's hard to control myself 
It's hard to control myself 
You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make this boy be bad 
It's hard to control myself 
It's hard to control myself 

It's hard for me to control myself 
Get to hold myself 
Back from 
Jumpin' on ya 
Like I wanna, 
Like I wanna, wanna. 

Temptation is a mother, 
How we lust for one another 
We barely know eachother 
Yet we're whilin' like we're lovers (uh huh) 
The air is filled with passion 
The strobe lights are flashin' 
The hustlers throw cash n 
The bar tender keeps splashin' 
Her moves were so erotic 
Her games were so hypnotic 
I bet this girl could stop it 
But she continued to pop it 

You know I know you like it, 
Let me hit you on your sidekick 
Cause the after party is at my body, 
Meet me, you're invited 

You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make me leave my man 

It's hard to control myself 
It's hard to control myself

She licked off 
Her lip gloss 
Her hips toss 
Back and forth 
Side to side and 
Up and down 
She touched the ground 
It turned me out. 
I'm battlin' desire, 
Lord help me douse this fire 
This internal inferno, 
Hotter than a shot of cuervo 
Her top was short and purple 
Belly dancin' in a circle 
When I feel like this I can't resist 
I ? don't make me hurt you 
She said 

You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make me leave my man

LL Cool J,"Yeah, uh-huh
I can't believe it

[Chorus]
Finally I'm walking down that aisle
No need for the coping now
I found the perfect partner waiting for me at the altar
Made a vow before God to love me
And finally I'm walking down that aisle
I will never second guess us how
When we're laughing together, and we're crying together
Having kids together, my life begins right now

Finally the day has arrived
I'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle
My heart skips a beat, emotions run wild
Half of me is crying, the other half smiles
I can feel my stomach turnin' and tossin' and goin' through it
I just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it
Take the vow to be together forever
Plus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever
Through the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds
Side by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out
I was blind to love, God showed me you
Now I'm standin' here shakin 'bout to say ""I do""
And I do

[Chorus]

Butterflies, my palms are sweaty
It's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready
But your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere
Can't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here
Our friends laugh as I take you by the hand
But they single and this a feeling that they don't understand
You're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right
Our honeymoon's forever, not just tonight
Knew the time was right, to be husband and wife
Us both dressed alike in the purest white
Such a beautiful gown, friends and family around
Ignore the cold feet now, time to take these vows

[Chorus]

It's a beautiful and heavenly day
As the pastor asks, ""Who gives this woman away?""
Your father says ""I do"" and gives me a hand
Plus the tough guy, and I completely understand
He losin' a diamond and now you're mine and
He don't have to worry, I'm a keep you shinin'
I'm a build us a future, I'm a keep on climbin'
With our family on my back, cause that's my assignment
I'm a work overtime, make sure y'all live
But still find time for you and homework with the kids
Took a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded
But you stuck with me and you won't regret it, ""I do""

[Chorus]

And I do (I do)
Baby I do (I do)
Baby I do
We made a vow baby
I do (I do)
Baby I do (I do)
Baby I do
Find that perfect partner, yeah yeah (I do)
Waiting for me at the altar
And I make a vow before God to love you
Finally I'm walking down that aisle
I'll, never second guess you",Down the Aisle
LL Cool J,"Uh-huh, eh-heh
Lay back on this one (yeah, you know how I do baby)

You only a customer
When you walkin' in the presence of hustlers
Uh, I'm laid back in the cinnamon Range
Two decades and ain't a damn thing changed
Keep my girl, in strawberry swirls
You can taste it, my instict's basic
Lord have mercy, sweet like Hershey
Kisses, diamonds for the misses, ices on the wrist-es
All different colors of the spectrum
The smallest flaw and I reject 'em
Believe me I'm a connoisseur when I inspect 'em
I baguettes them, invisibly sets them
They call me big L-ly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers
Them Chi-Town steppers and them A-Town stompers
These young rookies, fail to understand
Every sumer I return like the ice cream man
Drop what you doin', get-it get-it while you can
By the eighth, by the ounce, when it's gone I'ma bounce
It's the F-L-A-V, no if's or maybe's
You know what I do, drive your taste buds crazy

[Chorus]
Like lemon drops with chocolate kisses
Every bite is more delicious
My favorite flavor
(Mix me and you and we can't go wrong)
Like caramel on vanilla sundae
Have a scoop you'll want some day
Cause you're my favorite flavor
(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon

My flavor's unreal
Smooth but hard like wood grain on the wheel
Recline your seat baby, enjoy how it feel
Why you crossin' your legs, them high heels of eel?
Kick off your shoes, run your toes on the dash
Now peel off your stockings, c'mon let's get it poppin'
I'm in the mood for cotton, candy and I'm plottin'
To see you in somethin' silky and see-through
Me too! Man you know how we do
Camcorder main feature, damn a preview
I love how the bottom on your body's EQ
Low but thick though like the base in a six-fo'
So here we go (here we go) we bunny hoppin'
I hit the switches baby, you keep it droppin'
It feels marvelous, you in charge of this
I hope you ain't heartless but my guard's now regardless

[Chorus]

(Uh) All I wanna do
Is eat you up 'cause you look so good
(Think I look alright huh?)
(I look better on you, what'chu really wanna do?)
All I wanna do
Is show you boy that I taste good too
(I know you taste good ma)
(What'chu sayin', want a sprinkle of the hood ha? Ha?)

We had it out
Now tell your girls the truth when they ask what I'm about
The cookies and the cream and the peaches 'n praline
Butter pecan themes in your daydreams
All real sugar, no sacca-rhine
Low calorie leave no cavities
Guaranteed no place you'd rather be
Than here with me, mix chocolate in the factory

Sneakin' out to my dirt, dead wrong
Comin' back past dawn with the guilty mask on
And I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn
And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights
Shakin' in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck
That was the old me, the one I still regret
The one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again

Swat teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in
My mind's in an altered state
Like I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake
I make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes
I already played the fool when I let you escape
You're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex
Everything about you and yours connects
From your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin
The sheets smell different, this is not livin'
It feels like dyin', god knows I'm tryin'
Ain't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin'
Please find it in your heart to forgive me
Realize only god can convict me
We all make mistakes, so have you
If god show mercy on me, then you should too

When you feel it go and throw it right back 
Just let me hold ya by ya shoulders 
Then you can take it like that 
I knew you was a champ girl got your leg 
On the dresser kickin' the lamp girl 
Run the shower lets go in the bathroom girl 
Cause the temperature is hotter than high noon girl 
Crack that door let the steam flow 
Ain't nobody here but me and you let it go 
You never it this good you already know 
Give me all you got girl really though 

[Chorus]

You're the sexiest woman I've ever known 
My mind is blown 
You're simple beautiful how you do it to me 
You're showin' me things id never do 
Whole 'nother side of you 
Just keep what you do it feels like oh we

You can go ahead and hit a wild climax 
Ain't no way I'm bout to let you relax let me see if
You can hold me on ya back 
Let me see ya body wine to the track 
Chop it a little bit 
Hard to read you it feels like I'm illiterate 
But I'm ready for the graduation 
Yeah go ahead and repeat that rotation",Ooh Wee

You seem like the type that wanna do a couple things
When I look in your eyes I can tell you ready to swing

Slow down baby, I'm way more than a fling
And I'm up on the game that you o.g.'s brings

Damn it's like that, chronological attacks?
You talkin' real greasy, easy, that's a trap
(you need to fall back) what'chu sayin', I'ma rap?
(yeah right I ain't no trick, I ain't with all that)
Now see, you talkin' real bold, your vibes is real cold
You better smarten up, slide on in the rolls

I'm not the next chick, you can hit the exit
Everything you sayin' is just what I expected

Hearts I've rejected many more than you've collected
Life is a movie I'm just tryin' to direct it
You know like I know, you would wanna stay connected
Hip you to the rules of the game, shorty check it

By the time I make my move you be sayin' finally

(too many chickens gettin' laid and watch they reputations fade)
Where you from? (Detroit) what that mean? (I'm on point)
Relax, we talkin', don't get your drawers out of joint
I wanna see you smile, elevate your lifestyle
Cop a yacht, hit the south of France (not a chance)
Keep your little advance, this one's on me
And the chef's on board, you can eat for free

Slow down sweetie, my waist is twenty four
I'm far from greedy (you're gonna love it, believe me)

Cats sippin' venom and spillin' it on my linen
My baby smooth leather is softer than most women
Everything is crisp from my cuff to my trimming
Words can't describe all the garments that I been in

I been had Cartier, switch whips every play
My little Jack Russell know how to hustle
I stay with canaries on, platinum on every song
Hate it or love it, then respect how I does it

Uh, well I'm not dem, that's how I got gems
Cost a quarter million dollars for them like shiny rims
Understand me slim, this how the game begin
If he was me then he'd do the same to him
But L's the real deal, so tell me what you feel
Tell me one of your secrets, I'll keep my lips sealed

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(it's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just
(can't get over us)
And I'm stronger then this
(enough is enough)
No more walkin' round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
Let it go
Turning off the radio

Cause I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here

Boomdizzle, baby

Way back in 1776
Who would have thought we would have had these chicks
Sum kinda slim and some extra thick
They make me feel so patriotic

Man, American girls are something to see
I bet Thomas Jefferson would love be E T
This is a celebration all across the land
Light the fireworks, bring out the marching band

Uncle L, I love the heart land
South Carolina, they lookin' so tan
Out in Kansas, they so outlandish
Up in Nebraska, I know whatcha after

Bubble baths and Budweiser, joy and laughter
A good ol' boy that's not tryin' to gas ya
American girl, no doubt who the best are
I get harder, faster than a car in Nascar

Make more reveal, I wanna ride again
The red coats are comin', fuck it, let 'em in
The king of England woulda left us alone
If he saw Jessica Simpson eat an ice cream cone

Teeny bikinis, red, white and blue
American girl, I salute you
From Massachusetts to Albuquerque
Back to the Mid West, as sweet as the dessert be

I see you out there dancing
Looks like you need romancing
You're my American girl, American girl

You know I wanna hold you
Here's something you can roll to

I'm so glad that French helped us out
Now you're free to walk around and let your cleavage bounce
The Founding Fathers would've been hot and bothered
Watching boomdizzle, you know what I'm talking about

From Philadelphia to Illinois, St. Louis, Alabama
Country Gramma
Queens, New York, Detroit to Montana
Today's your day girl, let's raise the banner

Benjamin Franklin, I so wanna thank him
Take a look at these girls, they the best in the world
Blonds and brunettes, redheads with curls
March with me girl and let your baton twirl

Champagne corks were bursting in the air
Gave prove through the night, my girls were still there
I'm a drum major, leading you to the flavor
Go ahead and shake whatcha mama gave ya

Oh, oh, say can you see
By the dawns early light
Party with me every night
Let down your hands, alright

Whatever you do, don't lose this all fast
I'ma have to fly my flag at half mass
You go girl, you make me wanna holler
Take George off and put your boobs on the dollar

Put your hand in the air, bring the liberty bell
I give you the John Hancock if you don't tell
Let's have the Boston Tea party, what the hell

Celebrate the day Crispus Attucks fell
So we could use our parts and rock to LL
36 double D's never troubled me
Thank god that Columbus made that discovery

The queen of Spain, spends some change
Now Paris Hilton is pushing the range
Stars ride by while the chauffeur's drive
But all you girls with 9 to 5's dance with pride

This is the USA, great to be alive
Great watch the videos with them big ol' thighs
Brown and blue-green and hazel eyes
All directed straight towards the prize

Any shape or size, all different types survive
Around the way girls, ready to ride
Farmers daughter on the John Deer with pride
Conservative blue bloods, intelligent minds

With them girls next door, they put me under a spell
I'm on top of the world, I'ma screaming to tell
I love the USA girls

Met this little girl, she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin' with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo

Cause with whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress n she let me peep that
I'm Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early
Head spinnin' around like roller derby
Everything about her says you don't deserve me
I hope I'm worthy

You need somethin' like me? (Good luck)
Cause he ain't nothin' like me (no)

And treat you like he should
With me shawty you the shit
He might be good but he ain't like this
Cause I'm your baby

In the back of the pickup, clothes the rip up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, can feel the urge
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know I'm a word are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask her
Wanna another drink baby she like sure
Wanna hit the club she like I don't care
She all in the rear-view doin' her here

They say what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
If this ain't Vegas, let's pretend it's Vegas
I know what you up to, your skirt's outrageous
But I'm so fucked up that I forgot what your name is
We can jump in my drop-head and pop the throttle
Live our lives for the moment, baby, fuck tomorrow
Kool-Aid smile on your face, popping a bottle
Like you had an orgasm and you hit the lotto
Throw ya hands in the sky, why, am I
So, damn fly, can't deny
My shit's tight, gear, sit right
Ear, big ice, j-yeah, that's right
Lights are flashing, living life with passion
And if this was a movie, you would be perfect casting
You killing me slowly, baby, you're like an assassin
And you know that I'm married, so why the fuck you keep asking

[Chorus]

Now you can get with this or you can get with that
You wanna pop Crys', then you need to get with Crack
The whip's a 26 and the motor's in the back
I call it Big Meats cause the shit is all black
Now you fucking with Coco, baby, I'm the poster, baby
I'm a hustler's dream, you suppose to pay me
I was dope in the airiness, now I stick crack
I stay fly, you seen a G four on smack, now listen
Don't you wanna party with me?
Where the kush is blowing and the E is free
And the world is yours, it say it right on the blimp
And that yacht's so big, we gotta call it a ship, hey
Punks nigga, gun in the palm, nigga
Pop off, whenever it's on, nigga
Not tonight, I wanna hear my song
And let Flex drops bombs when the shit come on, let's get it

[Chorus]

OK, Flex let Sheek on his Cool J shit
Levi's, black chuckers, hope the deuce deuce fit
Two-seater, little reefer, pass the old fever
Showing her what hip hop is
Todd Smith, G. Rap, nigga, Kane and Biz
And if I talk L.O.X., I'm getting heavy sex
This early, imagine when it get to Flex
Toxic heavy, all black Chevy
Sheek got 'em wet, like somebody hit the levy's
I got a little Porsche, but the truck fit more
More goons, more chicks, when it's time to score
I'm straight out the door, boned from a raw
Swimming pool bottom of it, big as Shakur
V.I.P. cool, but the God at the bar
Partying, no shirts, tats over the scar
Ice in the sharper, come here, ma, I mean

When I was away look how I wrote to ya girl,
Wasn't I polite when I spoke to ya girl,
Tricked on you cop that coke for you girl,
I'd do anything but go broke for ya girl,
Since I'm a rapper I wrote a song for ya girl,
Since I'm a gun clapper I keep it warm for ya girl,
Lift some weights and keep it hard for ya girl,

Grab a broom and sweep the streets for ya girl,
Become the President and get in peace for ya girl,

No since, no reason, no rhyme,
Schizophrenia is hard to define,
Life's a mountain for you,I'm ready to climb,
Become the sun for you I shine,
Much more than all your other guys combined,
So you can tell them all to wait in line,
Cause a crime of passions still a crime,
Life ain't a movie girl you cant rewind,

Even in the mirror you're one of a kind,
And I don't need nobody else to co-sign,

I keep it locked don't ever fear,
When it comes to my man I'm a be right here,
Keep it hustle when times are tough,
Never left me stranded it was all about us,
Kept coming home,
Kept running strong,
This love is meant to be life long,

Life is good when it's me and you together,
And when there's drama then I'm a do what ever,
Keep you warm in the stormy cold weather,
Leave you broken and lonely oh never,
Every work that I say is so clever,
When you feel it in your heart it gets you much wetter,
I am the original go getter,
I don't waste time fronting I go get her,
Stare at the devil and won't blink for ya girl,
Change the way that I think for ya girl,
Put it on paper waste the ink for ya girl,
Walk through the dessert without a drink for ya girl,
Central booking, rock pink for ya girl,
Step in quicksand and sink for ya girl,
Whatever the obstacle I'm a leap for ya girl,
End my life and go to sleep for ya girl,

LL Cool J,"""You better stop foolin' if you want to get along with me""
True
""We grew up on the block, and we know about poverty""
Do you?

Dear hip-hop, I apologize for how you've been treated
I should've fought for my culture, instead I retreated
The game is wounded, I stood and watched while they beat it
My culture starved, I refused to feed it
They sold you for a dollar like slaves in iron collars
A*R's chase you with bloodhounds and rottweilers
You went to the highest bidder, you was pissed on like kitty litter
But far from a quitter, but there's somethin' to consider
Nah, after much deliberation
I decided I'm the hottest cat to ever receive rotation
I'm the foundation, one of the chief architects
Of this dream we're all chasin', I had to speak up
Too much time was wastin' whoa! So here we go
I'm tired of the money talk and the, bitches and hoes
Everybody's always, soundin' the same
I have to walk on water I can't, drown in the game

[Chorus: x2]
""Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark""
""Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark""
""Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark""
""They used to do it out in the park""

I remember your bar mitzvah, that burgundy label
Me and Jam Master had the battle of the big cables
Before the Serratos, real vinyls, real tables
Skills was the motto, no hype, no fables
You seemed so happy, you loved me so much
You popped off and went platinum, at my slightest touch
Over sized hoodies, Yukon trucks
20 years later, it's like lightning struck
They're worshipin' the money, they're prayin' to the bank
They danced on slave ship, slept as it sank
The devil made 'em do it, but only God do I thank
Because we aren't done yet, there's still gas in the tank
You look in a man's eyes, that's how you really tell his rank
Not the size of his account, check him, he might bounce
It's all on the line, this time it really counts
I'll bleed for this one, on down to the last ounce

[Chorus]

They rent a crib they're frontin', they rent a car they're stuntin'
They rent a chain they're bluffin', that's why the culture's sufferin'
And even if you're a millionaire that don't mean nothin'
Unless you build your community and encourage some unity
Too much ego, too much posin'
If he's so hot then, why's the culture frozen?
It's time for a change, the order needs to be rearranged
And this song was pre-ordained
After 2 long decades, LL still remains
And you can blame it on my spirit, not on my brains
Time to put on my armor, go to war for the game
Cause it's on its last leg, and that's more than a shame
This is a lifestyle homey, it's more than champagne
But I will make a toast to Flash reachin' the Hall of Fame
I end it with a line, from the book of King James
Let there be light when I write graffiti on the train

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x2]
Let us proclaim the mystery and fame
I pray the Lord my culture be saved
If hip-hop dies before I awake
May Jam Master Jay cut a LL break",Dear Hip Hop

And try a couple things we never did before
Maybe you could be a freak for me at the door

Won't your girls meet my boys, we can all be friends
Hey, over there, over there
Ho, get over here, get over here

Got to get it popping, the track is knocking, the Bentley's rocking
Overdose I'm suppose to roast 'em, with every bar I'm dropping
Every time I drop they copping, every single line I lay is locking
You a hater, boy, stop your plotting, it'll be your blood we mopping
Talk about that major flavor, keyed up, cut like a razor
Lyrically I stake and bake ya, you can see I get that paper
Wear jet black like Darth Vader, hopping out on playa haters
It's in my n-n-nature, never been a smoother operator
Switch it up, hit it up, get it up, let it up
Your girl from the back, like giddy up
How come I run, you like my son, I blow the whole god damn city up
Inside that long white milky Bentley like I just picked Diddy up
Think about that while you doubt that, you a fake mac, you can't count that
Hop all off then I bounce back, got 'em looking a wolf pack outback
I'm from where them GOAT GOAT, shout that
Ask Master P, I'm bout that
Everybody know I'm holding, in the party, pocket swollen
Rock and rolling, competition catching coals in they colon

[Chorus]

What up y'all, y'all know us
Know the party ain't ill til we show up
Once we hit the scene, the chicks go nuts
Sorry if I intervene, ma, but so what
Pour more cups of the drink, cups of the guz stop
Til I'm all drunk in the place, burn the kush to the face
Making the dudes wanna hate, 'cause we them new dudes in the state

Yeah, we in the club just chilling, be, yeah, baby feeling me
Feel like a barbecue, shorty keep grilling me up
In the club doing stacks where a ceiling be
Do it well, ask LL dog feeling me
Dudes not feeling me, because we walked in the door
Looking flier than airplanes, it's not touching the floor

The body move to the tune, yes sir
DJ let it boom in the room
Shit's just there, like and now your boy here

Shut your mouth, turn it around, 
Shake a little bit, drop down to the ground
Most of the time, don't stop or pound, 
Before we wasn't it but be popping now

Come to your hood, we be rocking your town
Go to the show we rocking the crowd,

Car real fast, bed real big
Just like that, I'ma get them stacks
Got 'em screaming out, my neck, my back
Work it all night, this ain't no tease
You gonna be scarred, I'ma sweat that weave
Now you can't drive, it's too much speed
Just sit back and enjoy that breeze
In the whip today, but not tomorrow
That's the life of a superstar
Wanna be involved, better be aware
Ticky Diamondz got women everywhere
Do it on the floor, stairs to the chair
Do it on the beat, please, hands to stare
Got you on the beach, you out somewhere
Got your girl screaming that it ain't that fair
Baby come true, got enough bread
Switch to the truck, nothing more said
Kid don't play, just do clean
That's what it is, when I come from Queens
Do my lean, big black truck
Coming through like I'm moving that stuff
I just get checks, just get neck
Girls I'm afraid, running round butt naked
Gotta go, back to the grind
Back to the tracks, back to the rhymes
Burn a little haze, I let my rhyme 

[Chorus]",Get Over Here
LL Cool J,"Uh, uh
Girl when I watch you it's like a dream
You look like you stepped out a magazine
I feel like an addict, you make me fiend
As if you were dancin' on a triple beam
I watch your body move back and forth
That's the shit that make Strahan want a divorce
The move is such a seductive way
I feel like Reg in the bush with Kincaid
Never seen a girl in the world
That moves her body, like you do
Have to party, invitin' you
Wish I could spend my whole life with you
If that's too much just a night with you
Kick back and turn off the lights with you
As long as it's, exciting you
Whatever it is, I like it too

[Chorus]
When I look in your eyes, I fall in love
Girl every time I look at your thighs, I fall in love
You're number one - tell all the guys I fell in love
You make me feel like I won a prize, I'm so in love
That good good love (I'm gonna make you love me)
(I'm gonna make you love me)
(I'm gonna make you love me)
(Love me, love) Stop playin' girl

If I'm victim of circumstance
It's because you're killin' me when you dance
I jump right out of that ambulance
Like B.I.G. I want ""One More Chance""
I got questions, you got the answers
Your body is a ? but you have to master
I'm not your slave but I'm willin' to play
I'll search for oil, start drillin' away
Turn off your iPhone, we chillin' and hey
We'll be sippin' Patron, couple gallons a day
Let's take our clothes off, bombs away
Pick a song, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo or Ray J
To get you in the mood, now you ready to play
Come to my house, put your clothes away
There's no commitment, you don't have to stay
Just come with me, I'll set you free

[Chorus]

What can I do!?
I'm in love with you!
What can I do!?
I'm in love with you! (Stop playin' girl)

The more I look at you, the more I get
Hypnotized, my nature rise
Before your eyes, I know you're sick
Of all the lies and alibis
From other guys, when I'm watchin' you
I get energized, I realize
We need surprise, variety
Is the spice of life, so I eat you up
Like apple pie, I like your flow
You're the star, this is your show
Speed it up, take it slow
Push it out, take it low
That helps a love like this to grow
If you're feelin' me girl let me know
I know that you are respectable
But this type of healin' is sexual

LL Cool J,"Welcome to Exit 13
I am your host
LL Cool J

You said I was finished
And Father Time was the blame
You disrespected my legacy
And threw dirt on my name
Told DJs he's over
He ain't spittin' the same
What he says is irrelevant
Hip-Hop culture has changed
When I walk in the room
Young boys look at me strange
As if I am a relic
From some long forgotten game
It makes my blood boil
Turns my eyes to flames
I built an empire
They tried to kick me out in the rain
So I called on an inner power
It's hard to explain
It's like a holy spirit
Utilizing hip hop slang
I'm beyond the gold grills
And logos on chains
You see I changed rap forever
I elevated the game
Launched the greatest label
In the history of rap
And for twenty four years
I carried it on my back
I've always shined brighter
When I'm under attack
I might be down for a moment
But I always come back

[Chorus]
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war (Uh, yeah)
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war (Check it)
It's time for war

This is a resurrection
I'm back from the dead
They told me quit a long time ago
But I conquered instead
I had dreams and visions
Swirling around in my head
I had this hunger deep inside of me
That has to be fed
Hip hop will respect
All the blood that I shed
I have a covenant with God
I have swallowed the bread
Hip hop my co-defendant
With this mic I thee wed
I made an entire generation
Obey what we said
I'm talkin' France to Germany
From Italy to Japan
From London to Belgium
To Afghanistan
From Farmers Boulevard
Smokin' a blunt with my man
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board
To build Def Jam
You see, I'm the undisputed
King of all hip hop
Everything after is my legacy
Like it or not
And I will keep making history
I can't stop
LL Cool J
Eternally hot

[Chorus]

Look at how easily I flipped it
And switched the style around
Competition losin' their footing
I see them falling down
They will plot against me
It kills them because I'm ballin' now
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone
But I got you callin' now
This is a job that must get done
Even if I become public enemy number one
If I had to pick up an Uzi
That weighs over a ton
I will attack hip hop
Until competition is none
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L
You end up tortured
And trapped in psychological hell
And this is the beginning
Of a new era in rap
LL Cool J, feel the impact
It's okay if you call it a comeback
And let them know
I'm ready for combat
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back
The crown looks wrong on your head
I want that

Ever since I spied you
In the rooms of my mind
Now I can't deny you
Bleeding and bruised
Like a vagabond in rags
I've walked the streets to your door
To find just what's in store
I see you
You and many others
In your clean well-lighted place
Where I would find disgrace
But I do
Know I'd find contentment
Just to be your furniture
I need nothing more

In the thick of the night
Take me out of the cold
Let me sing inside
Like a radio

In the thick of the night
Before we grow too old
Let me sing inside
Like a radio

Shivering and cold
This night's conducive
To a flight into my soul
But I stand here
Though my heart grows bold
Once on the inside
I can quietly persist
And hold my tears

In the thick of the night
Take me out of the cold
Let me sing inside
Like a radio

In the thick of the night
Before we grow too old
Let me sing inside

And so still I wait
Though I grow much weaker
No, no, no, I will not faint
I'll stay true
Believe me when I say
I'd climb to heaven,
Crawl beneath the lowest hell
To stay near you

In the thick of the night
Take me out of the cold
Let me sing inside

LL Cool J,"Dear Mr. President with all due respect
I wish we can have a conversation
I'll take a trip done to the residents
We can talk about the state of the nation
Mr. President
I will ask you about the war
Really and truly what is it for?
When an I-E-D mix soldier form dyeing for stuff above us all
Is it all about oil at end of the day?
Is the pledge of allegiance is something say?
I hope not cause I love The USA
In spite of all drama we have today
Mr. President are you aware
Our Flesh and blood is dying over there
When the coffins come back
Do you care?
When only the poor kids die
Is it fair?

If I can talk to the President
Would he pay attention really listen?
If talk something intelligent
Would he be willing to change his position?
Now it's Time time time
To speak my mind mind mind

Don't get me wrong
I respect the flag
But it hurts to see a kid in a body bag
He fought for his country with all he had
Now we have a family without a dad
Lil mama crying and the kids are scared
9/11 why we were unprepared
Mr. President,
Are you aware unless you're rich, you have poor health care
It makes you scream and want to pull out your hair
Discharged from the hospital soon as you get there.
Mr. President Truth or dare
Terrorist is hiding do you know where
Illegal immigrants is everywhere
Isn't really fought they want to come here
I respect you pleased be clear
Talk with me
Show people you care

If I can talk to the President
Would he pay attention really listen?
If talk something intelligent
Would he be willing to change his position?
Now it's Time time time
To speak my mind mind mind

What I'm to do
I can wait here with you
Tell me something that make sense
You sent off for war
Pleased be honesty what it's for
Doesn't matter is life or death
Yeah

I'm not republican or democratic
I'm independent I want the facts
When are the soldiers come back?
Are we prepared for a terrorist attack?
Late at night I watch CNN
It so bad I'm stop leaving
Middle East hates us
What's the reason?
Mr. President
My heart is bleeding
I tuck my kids end every evening
Try to teach them keep believe
Hoping my government want deceive them
Tell 'em Set some goals you can achieve them
Mr. President
I have to know if die for you
What will have to show?
How really truly how our country grow
Waiting for your answer Let me know

If I can talk to the President
Would he pay attention really listen?
If talk something intelligent
Would he be willing to change his position?
Now it's Time time time
To speak my mind mind mind

LL Cool J,"Classic, uh, uh, uh
I'd like to welcome y'all to Exit 13
My name is LL Cool J
AKA the GOAT
R. Leslie on the track, uh, uh, uh

I told y'all that I would make a killing
I told y'all I blow like Mount St. Helen's
I told y'all I'm the truth, they paint me like a villain
Sick on paper, the inch to penicillin
I told y'all the real, they started catching feelings
Muthafuck 'em all, throw ya L's to the ceiling
Cool J, still hotter than a helicopter crashing in lava
Still sweeter to the ladies than a box of Godiva
Music industry is like a game of cops and robbers
Too many Indians, no chiefs to follow
What I'm sowing today, I be reaping tomorrow
So here's some joyful bars, to replace your sorrow
I'm beyond a legend, I'm iconic
Fall off, rebuild, your man's bionic
Put your trust in me, I never let you down
I always come up with a way to checkmate these clowns
I effeminate these clowns, trynna take me down
Ask Puffy and Nas, who 'hates me now'
The Phenomenon, ladies love the don
I give 'em an ear-gasm, they can't keep calm

[Chorus]
Old school, new school, need to learn though
I burn baby burn like disco inferno
Old school, new school, need to learn though
I burn baby burn like disco inferno

I told y'all that I was coming back
I told y'all I ain't going out like that
I told y'all I was the greatest to ever rap
And I built Def Jam and took a piss on the map
I told y'all, I wasn't like the other cats
I'm fresh like a Wii, them niggas playing jacks
They all a bunch of a rats, they copying off 2Pac's stats
Wearing tuxedos to hide they tight speedo
Chains is tucked in, I'm incognito
Fuck with your ego, and touch your girl's labia
There will never be on flyer, LL Cool J
Taking you higher and higher
The wire, the GOAT, the grand sire
Who good at 24's if you want flat tires
Telling your soul and then performing with a choir
People, please, don't listen to these liars
Ladies and gentlemen, these, niggas is selling you up
Bunch of irrelevant shit, it's not intelligent, is it?
My shit's exquisite, don't follow the yellow brick road
Them niggas faking like the Wizard

[Chorus]

Is it really possible I'm this hot?
LL Cool J, still on top?
Twenty four years, I ain't forget the block
You can ask my Jay in the shop
Linden Boulevard, little Coupe, big rocks
Real estate only, I ain't fucking with the stocks
Why not, so our grandkids could feed they grandkids
And they grandkids, can feed they damn kids
And Collin Park throw ya hands in the air
Jump before I turn 'em in a Cool J affair
My word is my bond, every summer I'm there
Ya'll can jump double dutch while I'm laying in the cut
I told y'all I wasn't giving up
I told y'all, I can jump on tracks and switch the rhythm up
Do work, treat rap like a ripped skirt
Sow it up, rep your hood, nigga, throw it up
You'd been standing by my side for years
Sold out concerts, screams and cheers
Front row T-Shirt, L, we here
I bought every album, too many to count 'em
Watch your movies, your the only good thing about 'em
Todd Smith jeans, I can't live without 'em
And the only thing I want from you
Is for you to keep doing that shit you do

That was cool now let's get back to that block shit
Make it impossible for haters who wanna pop shit (I got this)
I'm leanin' back in the cockpit
I drop big bombs these bastards can't stop it (Hot shit)
I'm a profit for profit, once I decide to lock it
Fuckin' with me is toxic
Go prop on niggas love songs and rock shit
Show these motherfuckers how to spit they ain't about shit (This is it)
I'm so ruthless and cunning when the drummer was drumming
Y'all see I got your man running
LL the boss, like Luke wit the force
My techniques ugly, dirty like rugby
Drop jewels like yoda my young students love me
All rappers are under not one of them above me
I rip shit, I blow the whole house down
On your big mouth clown
You don't wanna fuck around

You way to lame, I showed you game
Just in case Y'all forgot my name
I'm the G-O-A-T., much hottest lately
Ripping motherfuckers since Cut-Creater tried to break beat
Farmers Blvd's is up in this bitch
And I help Russell hustle you could go ask Rick

The, the, the, the

They probably put a hit on me for murdering the track
They tried to shit on me they thought I wasn't coming back
They sealed the jar 'n then they threw me in the back
Career means circles I came (back like) crack
I floated to the top, fully loaded on cock
'Cause the way ya motherfuckers his hot oven this hot he don't stop
These niggas wanna sell you the hype but don't cop
I'll give you the pure shot, I'm the L

Clap ya hands and to the beat, y'all
Because the heat'll make you, clap ya hands and say
You go the one for the cash, two for the safe
(This is ring tone murder) Let's dog the place

My bars are like a bullet, blow your head right off
Hate on the trigger, pull it, give your mouth a night off
Give your sound man a c-note to cut your mic off
The promoters need me, nigga, you just a write-off
After that, hit the dress room, turn the lights off
Score on the fourth broad, let her break my pipe off
I used the word 'off' seven times in a rhyme
You dumb enough to think I got a limited mind
But before you start tweaking, critiquing, pressing rewind
Einstein understand, that your third eye's blind
You lack creativity, that's why you don't sign
They calling me a genius, it's about time
I'm like the tattoos on your mama's behind
I bounce up and down, and at the end I'mma sign
And I will humiliate anybody that want it
I'm back on stop, it hurts little homey, don't it?

[Chorus]

It's obvious these clowns don't know who I am
Most who didn't get the message, nigga, check the spam
Get your facts right, take your dick out your hand
No homo, but you probably on the low-low, damn
They call Uncle L, I'm from the north side of Queens
Now you looking at me, like what does that mean
It means I crush you and every coward in between
For sounding like girls with them sweet sixteens
And I don't give a fuck about who's old or young
From what I hear, the graveyard got room for everyone
Test Big Ellie, come and get your head sprung
Which coffin you want, the blue or the red one?
I ain't gang banging, that ain't the motherfuckin' point
The point is, I spark these niggas like dust joints
The point is you gon' pay me what you owe me plus points
Listen to the sound of revenge, it's my voice

[Chorus]

Run around talking bout I'm twice ya age
But I was rich at 17, you got some shit to explain
Rap game's like a movie, niggas playing the role
But your poker game's too weak, you're forced to fold
All this hating and debating shit, made me cold
Ready to blast, separate ya body from your soul
Conniving ass cowards get dropped in a hole
These niggas is shook like Pinky's ass on the pole
I'm the bridge over troubled water, pay my toll
I'm the rules to the game, you obey my code
I'm the center of the bomb, I'm the part that explodes
You are not hip hop, nigga, go write for Vogue
You are not a king nor prince, you just a toad
You ain't a G, you a hoe, you sweeter than Rocky Road
Battle anybody, who want it? Let me know
I just had another birthday, nigga, more dough

When it comes to the paper we chasin'
Homey I stay with some, 
When you walkin' in the presence of hustlers
When the whips come out, you know just what I'm 'bout
I'm havin' fun, uh, you're only a customer
And the ice that I rock is oh so hot
You should get you some, 
When you walkin' in the presence of hustlers

First of all, I switched the protocol
Been teachin' 'em how to ball since Mike went ""Off the Wall""
And furthermore, I'm a hustler to the core
I give you what you need, proceed to keep it raw
Your choice, you can live or die, either or
Have them candles and flowers by that bodega store
Life's about choices so choose homeboy
50 told me L, time to bring out the toys
So it's Lambs and Maseratis, hotties with hard bodies
Ridin' on Ducatis, toast to after party poppin'
Cause my joint's rockin', all the heads boppin'
You know the apple's ridin', that's why the D's watchin'

My face on promo wraps, I'm seein' fo' mo' plaques
The way the paper stack, I'm okay with that
She's so smart in my lap, she's a brainiac
We roll around in the sack, laugh and spillin' the 'gnac
I'm the dog killin' the cat, ignorin' the jack
This is flawless rap, you can't call this whack
Where the ballers at? Go 'head, throw up a stack
This is simply facts, I got the gift to mack
I take this to the max, what'chu know about that?

All these amateur macs with' they're eyeballs watery
Choosin' honeys over money that's how it oughta' be
Meanwhile, he gets his statements quarterly
You're starvin' on the corner actin' drunk and disorderly
Relax in the Maybach gettin' your booze on
Seats is like a couch, get your Tom Cruise on
French pedicure with' the Chimmy Choos on
He wanna' see more he throw somethin' smooth on

Game better than Coby
Style, doper than Codeine

When he walk up in the spot he lookin' so clean

Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic

I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Millenniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat

Aiyyo, one two three four
Five six seven

Shine like heaven
Seven six five four
Three two one
Come on Mr. Smith, come get some!

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin' on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'm a do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy want to pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name

All this fraudulent shinin'
And imitation diamonds is damn near blinding
Every time leave the country
I gotta come back foreign just to remind ya
Know they watchin' my moves but they never figure out exactly how I'm grindin'
I needs rock to my ears
They say the bands look at the finest
No captains, funny
Flashing this money like you taking something from me
Girl gave me the eye, this dude's a dummy
Don't play boy, I'll bag yo lil bunny
Chain around my neck made the night look sunny
Game so cold, your crew knows it's runny
L's in the building, you know that kid
'Cause 100 for yo nose, baby blow that quick

Without you in the game how the coach gon win?
Call Snoop Dogg, it's time to go in
Tell my man Bootsy bring the big mouths in
Step on the parkay, you know I'm gon win

Never go against me, you lack resources
What? I skywalk with the forces
Back in the 80's I was playin' in Porsches
Money ain't a problem, I toll my losses
Maserati coup, take galloping horses
Nah, there's never been one like me
They're looking for a new me as if there might be
Even with a love song, that's unlikely
If L ain't the dope, may lightning strike me

Same day, just a daddy, she love me anyway
So I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray
Cats on my team, got NBA
But it's my black, from the web we stay
I don't whack my suicides, I act my age
Never try to sound like a rapper I raised
Roared as a tiger, can't grow no brains
But the money's coming in in 360 ways

'Cause you already know the answer
Keep it between these sheets
These sheets, these sheets
Ah ah yeah

I won't tell nobody baby, you can trust me
You swearin' that it's good, I'm thinkin' it must be
I'm kissin' on your thighs, relax, don't rush me
Let me take my time, make your pretty face ugly
Hands by your side, stop tryin' to touch me
Let me soak it in, breathe, you smellin' lovely
Kiss yo belly button, and fill it with bubbly
Take a taste, let it drip down your waste
Have it all over my face, outer body experience like you're floating out of space
Come back down gently
Grind your hips on me, you set with the melody
And let the words that I say live on in your memory

I'm a tell you a lil secret
Do you think you could keep it?
Keep it between these sheets
Keep it between these sheets aha
Baby, no need to ask questions
'Cause you already know the answer
Keep it between these sheets

Ah ah yeah

Eye contact, kiss me, I kiss back
Right there, I miss that, I can't resist that
And I'll be climbing up over walls and ignoring all of my calls
Stuff all the things, pause, 'cause you're giving me your all
But I never had a lover make me feel this real
Hold it up in the room, all night, all day
All week I'm strung out like a freak
Got me tapping on my arm for a fix
In-between your sheets
Work you out to this beat, it's just you and me in the suite
My tongue is all on your feet, sheets covering me
I'm kissing all that I see, exactly how it should be

Bring it closer and closer 

You was reminiscing and wishin' 
For L to deliver what the game’s been missin' 
Beast that knock rhymes that lock with precision 
Hot like when Pac first popped out of prison 
Two schools of thought headed for a collision 
Did it big for a minute then you lost yo vision 
Skinny jeans, a wedgy and a dance rendition 
Tycoons wouldn’t choose that mission 
These cats is all hyped, that‘s why I don’t listen 
I’m too tank fittin' right, I see yall slippin' 
Ain’t no hate love, nah I ain’t trippin' 
Still love jewelry and champagne sippin' 
Bank roll healthy, ice is still sickening 
Couldn’t get fresh if you broke up, get slicking 
We Diddy bop, y'all out here skippin'
Baby just ignore these fools, they trippin'

Bishop Lamont, need to give em a sermon 
How soon we forget when the chrome is turnin' 
Models in the backseat burnin' 
But even if I wasn’t LL Cool J 
I had the same girl that I have today 
And that’s not something most of these cats could say 
Your whole hand’s different than you’re payin' a mistake 
Now some of y'all gonna feel some kind of weight 
That’s yo prop in which you, you know how we play 
Grown, we’re the bad, grinding all day 
Fool, you got a edge when you take that away baby 
The moment of truth and the jacuzz on 
Like that news, play some rhythm and blues 
Worry bout the water baby, leave on your shoes 
Toast to the gold, my heart don’t lose

I’mma love it, boy, I won’t you stop

LL grown up man 
Couldn’t give a damn if a young boy’s my fan 
Long as his mama 2 step to my jam 
While she cleanin' up her house, mop in her hand 
It’s how I changed the game, now you understand? 
I got that old money, weak rubber bands 
Cats playin' themselves, getting out of hand 
Show two features to chase teenage fans 
Well I got it right, I cram to understand 
How you trendy shorty, L’s a brand 
Raised on hip-hop, the grownup fans 
Hands in the air, rocking in a stance 
I’ve been made, ain’t no making of the bands 
Save the techno and glow sticks for Disneyland 
I’m sayin 5 features on every other jam 
You like them? Listen to em, we don’t give a damn 

Give it up 
I’mma love it, boy, I won’t you stop

I swear all I need is your heart (your heart)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me where you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

Honestly, I'm afraid to give love
Deep down I'm afraid to be judged
That's why I pull back, don't speak no rap
Put on the beat, man every time we hug
It's deep, I'm afraid of heartbreak so much
The thought alone feels like my soul got cut
The thought alone feels like my soul got cut
My heart's wide open, baby show me mercy
Life is a desert and for love I'm thirsty
You lead me to the water, I'm afraid to drink
You hand me a glass, still don't know what to think
Your love is terrifying, I'm standing on the brink
I'm floating in your eyes then I start to sink
Girl, I never knew that I could feel so weak
Flying on a cloud in-between these sheets
I'm one with myself, why do I retreat?
It's a battle just to try to go to sleep

I swear all I need is your heart (that's alright)

Everybody knows that falling in love's easy, timing out's hard
So I only wasn't really, raise my thoughts as God
It's crazy, I hold you in the highest regard
But us having true love? What's the odds?
That's scary, what if I get hit that hard
So hard I can't get up, heart got lit up
Too weak to move, can't eat, no sit up
Mommy used to say – don't worry, it's just a hiccup
But even she can't help
When your heart's on fire, about to melt
So everything I really feel, I keep it to myself
So I don't end up hurt like everybody else
Took love off the bat, burn I put it on the shelf
With the books I never read about pain I never felt
Love is a problem, baby I need help
My card's on the table and my heart's breaking me up

Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (I swear)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

Just give me your heart

Uh baby
Give it to me baby
Uh girl
Give it to me baby

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
When the last chapter's done, I hope your mine
Yea
(I need you to know)
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
When the last chapter's done, I hope your mine
But until that try

Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (that's all I need)
Uh baby (Uh baby)
Give me love (oh love)
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

And I show my true colors when we paint the town
I hate to hear you cry, I don't like the sound
So my love is turned up, sheets get turned down
I know it hurts now, the drama's the worst now
It's forth in a hundred but love's a first down

When a hail Mary works the world, it's like wow

Grapes get old and they turn into wine
The deeper the roots, the stronger the vines

You could cry on my shoulder if you're inclined
I used to be a Casanova in the lunch room line
That is more important things occupying my mind
Like being there for you, breathing the air for you
Keep trust false and truth to dare for you
The weight of the world I'm prepared to bear for you
The haters get cynical and call you spoiled
Not knowing about the drama in which you embroiled
The numerous pit falls, the tussle and the toil
The farmer still want me to put seeds in the soil
And here comes the harvest, this part's the hardest
I'm still here in darkness

We can lay here all day and baby just love your world

Head in my lap
Massaging your ears, you like that
I bite your bottom lip, you bite back
I know it's good, I don't need you to tell me that
Kiss yo neck
Ignore the main spot getting wet
Pressure's built up high as it can get
So we flows like the pilot, press the jet
Let it stretch
For all the times you seduced me in the tracks
All the chasin' I did so you can catch
Now all I do is shine and move back
Love your world baby, I was running lately
I did a 1-80, crazy

I love the world, there's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
I just wanna lay here with my arms around you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Something) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
We can lay here all day and baby just love your world

Bottom out,
Kissing with your fingers in my mouth
I'm taking all different routes
Discovering the ins and the outs
You slide to the couch
I wanna see what that love seat is about
Work it til it looks like a pout
Too many climaxes to count
Love your world baby, yea it was born lately
Did a 1-80, crazy

There's something about the way you do
The things you do
And when you do, oh tell me
I don't wanna go outside
I don't wanna go outside
I just wanna lay here with my arms around you night and day

I love the world, there's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
(Right there) There's something about you
I just wanna lay here with my arms around you

LL Cool J,"I just wanna make sweet love to you, baby, you know what I’m saying?
I just wanna touch you all over… aw, please!

[Chorus]
We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
Hey look, I've got my hands all on your body

Ain’t no problem, I’m on it oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest, a hundred bottles of bub
It’s just me and the Russians, we get all of the love
They was aware of the image, they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face, Oprah all on my couch
Now I’m hosting the Grammys, what is this all about?
International baller, I must admit I had doubts
If they wasn’t callin’ me back, they was callin’ me out
Game moved to the South, I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
I’m too old for the games, no time for the lames
Next challenge? Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did? Boy, I must be the shit
Waved 106 & Park to play date with the kids
People texting my wife, tryna ruin my night
So I help ‘em mind they business with some bottles on ice

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat x8]
Destruction in the club

Oh, no… Big Snoop Dogg
Ice so cold you can see it through the fog
To walk in my shoes it’ll be a little jog
And if you step by the pockets, you gon’ be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin’, peepin’
The bitches is dippin’, dippin’
So this is the mission, listen, I turn this shit up
It’s the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
Drippin’ in this motherfucker, burn up, now turn up!

We ain’t flirtin’, we talkin’ – we ain’t dancin’, we walkin’
Teenagers is pointin’, couple cougars are hawkin’
I don’t come here that often, but it’s totally awesome
When you livin’ for real, I don’t consider it flossin’
Panty lines are crossin’, I’m proceedin’ with caution
I don’t shit where I eat, gotta manage your portions
LL Cool J, I’m like the old-school orphan
Representing alone, sittin’ on factory chrome
Shades on, in the zone – Kool Aid smile on my face
My security’s strapped, ain’t no beef, just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites, we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly, make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes, always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping, I can’t believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters, they’re so sick of me rapping
I’m enjoying your blog, I’ve got the same type of passion

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat x4]
Fatman Scoop, Maserati Cool J
They ain’t think I can do it, that’s why I had to debut it
And let the critics review it, that way I spit and it’s Buicks
Since the beginning, I knew it rollin’ an L in the Buick
Had the guts to pursue it, that’s how a legend should do it

LL Cool J,"Never jealous 'cause once we're gone
Never leave here til it's done

Oh oh oh, I told you we'd make it
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world

Knock knock – who's there?
The one, remember me?
I'm lookin kinda different these days, don't you agree?
Your boy's going big these days, didn't even see?
The hell with the devil, there's no sympathy
The wishes in my past are still ridin me
All I can do is laugh as they lie to me
You can't take my God from inside of me
Crosses up, light up the sky with me
I got a lot of crazy crazy on my mind
Like what's the real reason that the pope resigned?
I got Van Halen, I don't need a bassline
I knew we can do it, it was just a matter of time
Put the axels back on the street and break on the vine
I came back to take back everything that was mine
If I live to be 1-0-9 I'm still in my prime
If I don't then I don't, I'll live on in your mind

Oh oh oh, mama we made it, aye
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world
Oh oh oh, I told you we'd make it
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world

I'm on a hacksaw tour, Eddie got a Frankenstein aimed at your door
Speakers under the stage, lift you off of the floor
Why? This music is the end to the war
We endure, cameras everywhere, everyone is keeping score
Everybody talkin' bout what's up bout the tour
The world is a steak, I'm a chew it up raw
We're back in heavy metal like we above the law
London, Japan, Germany and France
Lisbon to New York, we're live up in Netherlands
Jump up on some shoulders baby, you never dance
You only live once, come on, here's your chance
You could be reborn, half star, half man
If you rise up and grab my hand
If I live to be 1-0-9 I'm still in my prime
If I don't then I don't, I'll live on in your mind

Oh oh oh, mama we made it, aye
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world
Oh oh oh, I told you we'd make it
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world

We are the greatest
Rise up!

With the subtlety in your song
They're the same old truths
That you've been singing all along

But still your biggest fear
Is finding out that you've been wrong
It's all you ever wanted
Just over the horizon

It's all you ever wanted
I can hear it in your song
It's been there all along
You watch the rising sun

Holding tightly to your dreams
Knowing deep inside
That the world's not what it seems
But when you think you've hit a wall

It's just a mirror after all

And the questions it would bring
Now you come to me
Tell me you've been thinking
And we're back where we began
Was it not enough?
That I loved you
And we're back where we began
In your mind is a perfect world
In your eyes it's crumbling
Now in my arms is this lovely girl
And my heart is trembling

Your not alone, you're just
Chasing the sun
To see the new day first

I know the sky must fall in time

I've been choosing my words carefully
Give me some time and a clear head

I'll tell you everything

So softly spoken from within
So listen, close to the silence
You will find peace again

Suddenly every thing's so far away
In my ear there's a whisper among the cries
So I try to see past the illusion
But the world gets into my eyes

I've got a lifetime of things to say
So softly spoken from within
So listen, close to the silence
There are voices on the wind
So listen close to the silence
You will find peace again

Then through the noise I heard you say
You'll find your way
So see me now a wandering child

So softly spoken from within
So listen, close to the silence
There are voices on the wind
So listen close to the silence
You will find peace again

This scene
And those who've gone before us are seen again
In the sparkle in the eyes of

I know what I have to do
But I promise I'll be home soon
And it's true that when I can
I'll Fly to you

Swim beneath the waterline
Plunge into the soil
I dig myself a place to lie
Build me a box of wood and foil
But you take the ribbons off
And scramble up my bones
Then tie me up in bows again
So no one ever knows
But us

And twenty years are facing me down
Still there's no real explanation
No formal invitation that I've found

I never noticed how much I love the sound
Now I know it's getting late
But I feel better just having you around

I'm waking up
It's breaking me down
It shakes me up
When you come around

I didn't know it would be like this
But I guess my pre-life crisis has arrived
I drag my heart behind me
Until your voice reminds me I'm alive
Now I'm standing in the morning sun
Wondering what I've done to get this far
As I step out from the shadows
I can see just who you are

I'm waking up
It's breaking me down
It shakes me up
When you come around
When you come around

Suddenly you were older, bolder

With informercials sinkin' in
And I can't find my remore
I won't accept the terms of this surrender
'Cause there is something bigger
And I feel it here today

I can't just stand around and wait for somethin'
'Cause I know there is nothing here that I know I can believe
There's a lady on the television telling me
That I can find my destiny if I look up to the stars
But I can see that it's right in front of me
It's here and it's clear

I don't wanna know if the world will end tomorrow
'Cause I feel just fine
I don't wanna know all the answers on this earth
All I need to know is that You're always right there
That's all I need to know

Well I know they say they've figured out the questions
But it's hardly ever mentioned that they always change their minds
The psychics on the phone are always selling me
The future they can see for me, well they can sell to someone else
'Cause I can see that it's right in front of me

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter",ATL Tales/Ride Wit Me

I feel so cool babe
Hmm yeah

Said I'm rolling down the Ave with a bunch of cash in my duffel bag
On they way to my [unknown] path to pop a few tag and hide my stash
Feeling my [unknown] put my foot on the gas moving fast trying not to crash
Damn sure hope this party blast so I can see shawty shake her ass

I see her posing on the corner with a red lollipop in her hand
Didn't notice but every man horns is blowing from every van
So I walked over and I told her I wanted to know if she can 
Shake the chunk that's in the trunk
Shawty let's dance

[Chorus]
'Cause I love the way you walk 
In them high heel shoes
And I love the way you talk
Girl I'm feeling you 
Ain't no more I can take
Is how you move
And baby I can't wait till I'm feeling you 

Shawty the way I feel 
She walks by me is incredible
It's what she must know I can't hold
'Cause her back is unforgettable

She's so
Off the chain
With that thang from a far
Ain't no doubt she's a superstar

Girl I need to know who you are
The Club is jumping 
Music's pumping
And it's extra packed from wall to walls

It's not a lot of room to move it all 
As we make out move to the ball
She's truly raw
To the point where I'm nothing but a jaw

And I truly naw
Can't feel shit like I was hit by a moving car yeh

[Chorus]

So let my mind blown while she throwing in the back
Same way the DJ do with the track
If I breaking, and shaking, and making it clap
Going from my lap down to blown ?

She on the dance floor don't know how to act
Girl lets go home
I got crone on the lac
Your bad to the bone

Can I get with that oh
I'm smoked out zoning
And she looking at me like she want me
Telling me to hurry come to jump ta boning

To the booty up 
She's tryna blown it
And I got enough room to be comfortable come spend the morning

Lloyd,"Starts Off Doo-whop Ballad


[Verse 1:]
Now see it was Monday afternoon
Very first day of school
Back of the class makin' girls laugh
Teacher's mad 'cause I'm cuttin' a fool
I'm just doin' what I usually do
Errything's cool, chillin' with the crew
Sayin' ""finally, the bell's bouta ring""
That's when this new student walked in the room
My jaw dropped, I felt my heart stop
She's flaw to flaw
This girl's so raw
So this girl got me hooked like a bra
Like climax, man I paused
See this girl is sick like the flu
Wish I knew who she was
She's hot like curry, my vision is blurry
But why should I worry

[Chorus 2x:]
'Cause I'm a G
Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

[Hook:]
But I'm a G
(I'm a G)
I'm a G
(I'm a G)
So what could it be
(What could it be)

[Verse 2:]
Now later on got home set down my bags
Got homework, chores: need to take out trash
But see this girl's got me all off task
My hearts beaten fast who could I ask?
Got the phone called Tez
He said ""Lloyd what's crackin'?""
I said ""Dawg you won't e'en believe what happened.""
""I'm chillin' and this girl walked up in the class and
Swear she look just like Janet Jackson
So should I write a letter to her
Or should I send a messenger
I tried to vibe and connect with her
But I didn't have enough guts to step to her
And I really want the best of her
But can I get the rest of her?""
So he told me ""Lloyd don't sweat it.""
And I said ""You're right. Forget it.""

[Chorus 2x:]
Because I'm a G
Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

[Hook:]
But I'm a G
(I'm a G)
I'm a G

So what could it be

As I dig deep inside my soul
Look into my past
And all that I had through these glass windows
I find myself wanderin all alone
About the ways that yesterday
Changed the path I chose
Oh

ain't no tellin where I'd be
Dead or in the penetentiary
From shootouts wit my enemy
Squeeze until my clips empty
But would they give sin to me
By the hands that was lent to me
Know that it was meant to be
To take over this industry

Yea
Its goin down
No more gettin left behind
Its time to shine
Mind on my grind
Look

And only the Lord knows
If I don't succeed 
Then my family's left out in the cold
So I gotta play my cards

'Cause if I fold
No superstar
Expensive cars
Or designer clothes
Oh

When situations get bad
When times get sad
Gotta keep yo mind up

Gotta keep ya grind up
From 99
Never let it behind

Just gotta stay ahead of the race
Keep up my pace
It won't be long
When a feelinz all I can take

I see my heartbreak
Just makes me strong

Been the best of dayz

Lloyd,"I said, ""What time you get off?""
She said, ""When you get me off""
I kinda laughed but it turned into a cough
'Cause I swallowed down the wrong pipe
Whatever that mean, you know old people say it so it sounds right
So I'm standing there embarrassed, if we were both in Paris
I would have grabbed her by the waist and kissed her, but
We in the middle of whole foods, and those foods
Ain't supposed to beef, but you'd think they hated tofu
Check-in line got rowdy, my vision got cloudy
I started seeing circles like some Audi
Emblem, I'm hearing them say, come on man
Do this own your own time, get the hell on, man
I walked out, hm, I got bout
Half-way to my car when I heard shorty shout
""Three thousand, forgot your credit card, smart move
By the way, my little sister loves your cartoon""
Well, here's my name and numb
If I ain't the one, lose it, if I am, use it
If a man chooses, and he can, do's it
And he don't, don't take it personal, he might be might be swamped
With making mozzarella, no, making worlds better
Cheese will come, believe me, I'm, never focused on the cash
Ask Mel Gibson, Jesus Christ, I'm bout the pass, ion

Stop, baby bring that thang back
You know where my heart at
Shorty, show your boy some love
'Cause I'm about to lose it

Whatever that mean, you know old people say it so it sounds right
So I'm standing there embarrassed, if we were both in Paris
I would have grabbed her by the waist and kissed her, but
We in the middle of whole foods, and those fools
Ain't supposed to beef, but you'd think they hated tofu the
Check-out line got rowdy, my vision got cloudy
I started seeing some circles like some audi
Emblem, I'm hearing them say, 'come on man
Do this own your own time, get the hell on, man'
I walked out, mmm, I got bout
Half-way to my car when I heard shorty shout
""3000, forgot your credit card,"" smart move
""By the way, my little sister loves your cartoon""
Well, here's my name and numb
If I ain't the one/ 
Lose it/ 
If I am/
Use it
If a man chooses/
And he can, lose it/
And he don't, don't take it personal, he might be might be swamped
With making mozarella - no, making worlds bettter
Cheese will come, believe me I'm, never focussed on the cash
Ask Mel Gibson, Jesus Christ, I'm bout the pass... ion

[Lloyd]
STOP, baby bring that thang back
You know where my heart at
Shorty show ya boy some love
Cause I'm about to lose it
With the way you move it

Run through ya, undo ya bra, gimme medulla, uh

But keep a sharp eye on him, cause I'm the wrong guy

Really give a damn what it's in for.
Cause what we had, was special, 
And enough to make me never wanna leave home.

I was too young and dumb to notice, 
I know it looks bad, 
But we don't have to deal with our problems alone.

Now that I'm here, so won't you stop cryin'
Have no fear, cause I'ma start tryin'
And its so clear, without you I'm dyin'
No I can't let it end, so girl I'm checkin' in.

Can somebody call the doctor, 
And prescribe me somethin' that'll show me how to act if she's gone.

And my lungs stopped breathin' and baby you're the reason
I've got to do right, the truth is that I, 
I ain't worth a damn without you.
Just wanna take the time, to slow it down, 
And cherish every moment that you're around.
Let me change your mind, about me now, 
And show you what my love is about.

[Chorus]

OK, first time I met her, I remember it like yesterday.
I was in my old school, she was in the Escalade.
She pulled off on the exit, then I pulled up next to her,
No time for flexin' now, I knew I had to get next to her,
All black she love shades,
Classy as she wanna be.
Could tell how I'm jockin' she could have me if she wanted me.
Now that I got her I'ma need a doctor if she leave me,
Girl I need for you to know I need you, believe me

I'm with it [Repeat: x3]
Say I will be your say I will be your 
I will be your.

When you come around I can't find the words to say
I get speechless how you take my breath away
What is it about you I just can't put my finger on

That I'm playing how come this feeling still remains
Am I so blind that I can't see I am wrong
But I don't know.

I'ma catch you in the shower while you dripping wet.
I'ma come and kiss your neck, you gone kiss mine back.
How sexy is that
Rub your teardrop, put your body on the counter.
You gone say ""Do that daddy"". I'm gone say ""OK momma"".
Wrap you in a towel and bring you over to the bed.
I'll watch you spread and get in between your legs.
Now, I know that you won't give my loving to no other.
