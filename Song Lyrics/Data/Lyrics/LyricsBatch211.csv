Anita Ward,"I'm glad you're home
Now did you really miss me?
I guess you did by the look in your eye
(Look in your eye, look in your eye)
Well lay back and relax
While I put away the dishes (put away the dishes)
Then you and me can rock a bell

You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell

The night is young
And full of possibilities
Well, come on and let yourself be free, yeah
My love for you (love for you, love for you)
So long I've been savin'
Tonight was made for me and you

You can ring my bell, ring my bell
(Ring my bell, ding-dong-ding)
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
(Ring my bell, ring-a-ring-a-ring)
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
(Ring my bell, ding-dong-ding)
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
(Ring my bell, ring-a-ring-a-ring)

You can ring my bell
You can ring my bell
(Ding, dong, ding, ah-ah, ring it)
You can ring my bell, anytime, anywhere
(Ring it, ring it, ring it, ring it, ow)

You can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
(Ding, dong, ding, ah-ah, ring it)
You can ring my bell, anytime, anywhere
(Ring it, ring it, ring it, ring it, ow)

Bell, ring my bell
(Ring my bell, ding-dong-ding)
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
(Ring my bell, ring-a-ring-a-ring)
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
(Ring my bell, ding-dong-ding)
You can ring my bell, ring my bell",Ring My Bell [Funk Star Deluxe]
Anita Wardell,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me
Anita Wardell,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon",East of the Sun
Anita Wardell,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Anita Wardell,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Anita Wardell,"I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to feel low-down
I gotta right to hang around
Down around the river
A certain gal in this old town
Keeps draggin' my poor (old) heart around
All I see, for me is - misery

I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan and sigh
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
I know the deep blue sea
Will soon be callin' me
It must be love - say what you choose
I gotta right to sing the blues",I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues
Anita Wardell,"Do you know what it means to walk alone?
And what it means to be, be by yourself?
Do you know what it means when there's no one to bring you good news?
Then you know, you know the meaning of the blues

Do you know what it means to cry alone?
And what it means to cry by yourself?
Do you know what it means to love a woman you can't own?
If you do, then you know the meaning of the blues

I've been weeping and weeping,
Moaning and moaning,
Crying and sighing all the day
I've been hiding my tears
Feel like dying
Wishing love would come to stay
And do you know what it means when the lord is taken away?
I cry, oh I cry
Oh I cry everyday

Yes I know what it means to walk alone
And how it feels to walk by myself
Yes I know what it means to love a woman you can?t own
Yes I do,
I know the meaning of the blues
Yes I know the meaning of the blues
Woo-hoo",The Meaning of the Blues

Anita Wilson,"The very first thought on my mind
When I wake up with You
A love like Yours is so hard to find
Makes me feel brand new
Out of all the people in this world
So glad You chose me
I just can't keep it to myself
Gotta tell somebody

I'm not ashamed to tell the world
That You keep blessing me 
Beyond all my wildest dreams 
And You come to me
Show me that You love me
And believe abundantly
Even things I can't see
I am so complete
All because You love me

I can't help but think about the times
When I needed a friend
I was broke and deep down inside
It was hard to pretend
That when I opened up my heart to You 
And You set me free
Can't nobody do me like You do
Your love captured me

I'm not ashamed to tell the world
That You keep blessing me 
Beyond all my wildest dreams 
And You come to me
Show me that You love me
And believe abundantly
Even things I can't see
I am so complete
All because You love me

Can't imagine how my life would be 
If You didn't feel this way about me
You've given me the strength to believe
Just have the faith of a mustard seed
I can conquer anything

I'm not afraid to say that You love me
You love me
Oh, thank You, Lord
You love me, You love me
I am so grateful that You love me 
When everybody else gave up on me
You loved me, you loved me
You really really really really love me
No greater love have I found 
Than the love He gives to me
I found real love, I said real love in Jesus

I've been in love before
But I never experienced so much joy

Com jeito de menina brincalhona
A fórmula perfeita pra poder te comandar

E te faço de palhaço, pra te dominar

Tá fazendo tudo que eu mando
Achando que logo vai me ter

Nesse jogo vamos ver quem é que vai vencer

Meiga e abusada faço você se perder
E quem foi que disse que eu estava apaixonada por você

Mas se o tempo afastar a gente
É porque o nosso amor é fraco demais
E amores fracos não merecem o meu tempo, não mais
Simplesmente, eu sei que tudo que foi importante pra mim
Da minha vida se foi, então me fez ser assim
Dentro dessa armadura nessa vida dura
Não sou Indiana Jones, então sem aventura
Porque só tinha conhecido gente louca
E tinha medo de um 'eu te amo' sair da minha boca
Até que um dia ele saiu
E eu gelei, e te olhei, você disse 'eu também' e sorriu
Maluco o suficiente pra gostar de mim
Corajoso o suficiente pra ir até o fim
Se eu tivesse te desenhado e te encomendado
Teria feito exatamente assim

Ele me disse ""Vai""
Eu disse já vou
Ele me disse ""Volta""
E eu disse oôô
Ai que saudade de você
Debaixo do meu cobertor
Ai que saudade de você
Debaixo do meu cobertor

Eu sei que sobre nós
Tudo é sempre complicado
Mas, um dia vai se descomplicar, pode acreditar
Te dei meu coração, você cuidou tão bem
Que agora quero entregar meu corpo pra você também
Hein? Me diz se eu to errado, mina
Mas algo me diz que a nossa vibe combina
Eu tava ali, procurando o meu rumo pra seguir
Que bom quando eu te vi, tava tudo tão chato por aqui
Eterno nada é, posso dizer
Mas eu vou fazer o possível pro nosso amor ser
Um dia, a gente vai se ver, bem velhinho pelo espelho
E eu cantando outra música pra você
Pois quando a gente se entrega pra vida
A vida só nos devolve coisas boas
E ela me deu você
E eu vi nessa corrida que você é só você
E pessoas são pessoas

Ele me disse ""Vai"" (vai, vai, vai, vai, vai)
Eu disse já vou (já vou)
Ele me disse ""Volta"" (já voltei)

Quando dança e me beija, sinto que ela me deseja mais e mais
Mesmo louca desse jeito, é muito mais do que mereço

Anja Garbarek,"It happens that someone knocks at my door
And the whole house starts to shake
So that it gets really hard to stand up
And even worse to walk
I usually fall down on the floor

And I stay there until that someone decides to leave
And the house calms down
And I look through the curtains
To see if he would regret
To see if he would try again

It happens that someone calls me on the phone
Then my heart gets so scared
That it jumps right up into my throat!
I swallow like crazy
Hoping my heart will glide back down
So I can talk to that someone
Maybe talk to a friend
But it is too late

It is beyond my control 
If I don't open up the door
It is beyond my control
If I don't answer your calls
I'm not to blame. It isn't my fault
It was you that made my heart shake
It was you that made my heart jump

And it happens that I take a walk outside
Just to get some nice fresh air
And it happens that I see someone I knew
A long, long time ago

Then I just seem to disappear
Becoming one with a wall
Becoming one with a lamp post
Becoming one with a tree
Becoming one with a street
Becoming one with a house
Becoming one with a door
Becoming one with you all

It is beyond my control
If I don't open up the door
It is beyond my control
If I don't answer your calls
It is beyond my control
If I just seem to disappear
It is beyond my control
If I am suddenly not here

It was you that made my heart jump

It was you that came my way",Beyond My Control
Anja Garbarek,"I'm lying as far out
Towards the edge
As possible
So far out
That I'm almost tripping over
You lie behind me
Your breath is heavy
You're sleeping

There are some screws
That are coming loose
From two holes in the wall
The plaster's sifting down
Resting like sleep-sand in my eyes

There's a cabinet
(Hanging over my bed)
Filled with all my secret things
(Filled with all my secret things)
Every night I lie
(Staring at it)
I'm so afraid that it will fall down
Onto my face

I know what is keeping
My cabinet from falling down

It's very a small bird
Made of ceramics
Fastened by a thread
To the bottom of the cabinet
When you're awake
You play around with it
Then I get so scared
That the thread won't be strong enough

I'm hiding my head under the pillow
Hoping that
The bird won't fly away

There's a cabinet

",I.C.U.
Anja Garbarek,"I woke up today
In the apartment of a stranger
I was so certain
That it was my own door
That I unlocked last night
But, there may be someone here
Who has disguised all my rooms
All my rooms

Oooh

Later in the day
A figure came through the door
A shadow that barely nearly touched my body
Then moving its mouth persistently
Open and shut
Open and shut

Ooh,
I'm searching while I'm screaming out to them :
'Now you may come out
Come out
Now you may come out'

As I walk around searching
And wondering whether this may be
A conspiracy by the figure and them
I hear someone laughing
From inside the closet
There's someone in the closet
Someone in the closet

I push the door open
And stare straight into my home
I have found them all

Ooh, I'm searching
No longer now
That I can join laughter
Laugh at everything
Now that I can join in

Just one of those days
Just one of those days

You took away my red lips,
And then cut them up in pieces.

So now I can't kiss the moon,
So now I can't kiss the moon goodnight.
No longer fly,
Through the clouds.
No longer touch the starsâ?¦

To whip the roof

Anja Garbarek,"It was getting to be difficult to walk
She was always so close but never right on
And the roads she chose to walk were narrow
Alleys with names
Hard to understand

Her head was dangling back and forth
She wished to lay it down
But it would roll away
So she put her foot down with care
While she leaned on everybody
So as not to fall

And they told her
The latest tattletales

â??I collect stuff like that, you've got
To have a thing or two to tellâ??.
She said
While her one lip fell down
From her mouth
She picked it up off the ground
But, when she was to put it
Back in place again,
The lip would fit no more,
The lip would fit no moreâ?¦

She very rarely blinked her eyes
'Cause it just might happen she would miss out on things
So when she opened both her eyes up wide.
They popped right out
And rolled along
To see just the things she
Wanted to see

â??I collect stuff like that, you've got
To have a thing or two to tellâ??.
She said
While her one lip fell down
From her mouth.

",Something Written
Anja Garbarek,"There were these two people
Living together in a peculiar house
This house was so peculiar
Because it made such strange noises

The couple decided that they had to move
They could no longer stand living with such strange noises
So they packed their bags and
Put on their propeller hats

And so they flew
High above the ocean and forests and mountains
To find a place
Yeah they flew far into heaven to get some peace
To find a place
That would be quiet
So - quiet

But heaven was no permanent place for this silence seeking copule
Because there there were sounds too
Sky sounds
So they left the place
So they left the place

They flew high above the birds and the clouds and the moon
To find a place
They flew far into the universe to get some peace
To find a place
They flew high above the birds and the clouds and the moon
To find a place
They flew far into the universe to get some peace
To find a place
That would be quiet
Absolutly quiet

They flew high above the birds and the clouds and the moon
To find a place
They flew far into the universe to get some peace
To find a place

But everywhere they went there were these sounds
Strange sounds
Somebody else's sounds
And somebody else's sounds are lot worse to live with than one's own

So the couple found that they might as well go back home
They took off their propeller hats and
Descended between the stars

East or west - east or west
Home is best - home is best
East or west - east or west
Home is best - home is best

And please count the stars for me

One, ooh so lonely star
Na na na na

Have only the moon to shine

Have this last wish tonight
We wish for all the stars to shine
To reappear in the sky
Called upon once more by you
So that our children may have wishes too

With hands that could break me in two but don't
Breaking away gently

But I can see right in your eyes
You lie, you're sly, you try to deny
And you ain't no friend of mine

In that cave you call your soul

The shadow of swords

Have been awoken

What is life without him?
Please, what should I do?
I was just a humble girl
Who got lost in your world
I will cross a thousand seas
To forget that boy

Feel the moon-spill drift to silver grey
Would like to feel the sun, but it's too late
On this rainy day

For my heart still beats
In the crowded streets, its solemn beats
Echo solitude as distant peaks
Washes over me and steals the peace

It's like the sun was never mine
It took away the silver lines
On clouds that broad into the mind
And throw it all away

And the grains of time
Repossess me and all mankind
A fragile entity that breathes inside
On this rainy day

It's like the sun was never mine
It took away the silver lines
On clouds that broad into the mind
And throw it all away

It's like the sun could never see
This life that breathes so endlessly
A mellow daze that captures me
And throws it all away

My feet tangle, I bump my head and hit the ground
I dial your number but my finger's shakin'

Love songs and limousines
Wishing wells and make believe
Disco balls and dancing queens
I fall so easy

Rich guys and candlelight
Telling me the things I like
I'm too young and they're too right for me

I fall so easy for cheesy things in life
Sad, sad movies make me cry
Pretty people I admire, I used to hate

I fall so easy for the stupid little lines
Hollywood and sunny skies
Fancy restaurants with three forks and knives
I fall so easy

Until you came my way
Turn my clouds to white from gray
Showered me with pink champagne
I let go so easier

That girl I used to be
Cynical and heartbreak free
Confidence exude in me now

I fall so easy for cheesy things in life
Sad, sad movies make me cry
Pretty people I admire, I used to hate

I fall so easy for the stupid little lines

Ankerstjerne,"For præcis et år siden,
Sad vi alle sammen samlet om det samme bord,
De samme samtaler startede med de samme ord.
Det er længe siden,
Godt at se dig, har du haft det godt?
Og hvad med karrieren, sig mig er der penge nok?
Vi kan det uden ad, og lytter til de samme toner,
Prøver at undgå at starte alle de samme
Diskussioner. Det' egentlig fjollet vi' skal spille alle
De roller, men sådan er det altid og der
Er noget vi lige skal komme igennem ,
Men det blir' mørkt og lygtepæle tændes over gaden,
Efter et par glas der får vi endelig brudt overfladen.
Ingen vil sige det først, men selvom
Alle kæmper er det svært at ignorere vores flok
Er blevet mindre. Der er tomme stole om bordet,
Stemmer der mangler,
En parfumeret duft der plejer at blande sig
Med de andre, året der er gået satte tydelige spor,
Og det kan ses når vi er samlet om et bord.

Og jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Og intet aner selv om tiden går, tiden den går,
Ja jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Du er væk fra mig, men stadig tæt på mig.

Der er gået et helt år siden du sad her sammen med os,
Svært at tro på, dit navn står jo stadig her
I min telefonbog, som om jeg bare kunne trykke på
Knappen nu og ringe op,dengang jeg havde chancen
Ved jeg godt jeg aldrig ringede nok,
Så jeg tænkte at jeg ku' skrive et brev I nat,
Som kun var dit. Fortælle dig om hvordan det er gået,
Både godt og skidt. Kan starte med at sige,
At dagen du tog afsked var smuk,
Og fuld af blomster og venner omkring dit gravsted,
Og morfar er stærk, vi ser ham knap fælde en
Tåre selvom han på mange måder ha' haft det længste år.
Camilla og min moster de har været ude af den,
Jeg tror det går lidt bedre nu, selvom de er udmattede.
Peter han forlod min mor,
Selvom det er hvad der sker så tacklede han det skidt
Og han bliver nok aldrig velkommen her,
Mette er her stadig, hende og jeg vi passer på min mor
Og igen I nat der er vi alle samlet
Om et bord.

Sidste gang at var samlet sådan her,
Det var I kirken da vi sagde farvel,
Og nu hvor lysene tændes og dagen går på had,
Byen sætter farten ned og roen sænker sig,
Så er det tydeligt at der er nogle ting der aldrig
Ændrer sig. På nogle måder er det som om der
Ingen tid er gået, kvinder I min familie piver stadig
Aldrig over noget, og selvom verden hviler tungt på
Deres skulderblade, sludrer de om vind og hver,
Bladrer lidt I ugeblade, sætter hinanden
Først og deres liv på standby, og noget siger mig det er
Noget de har lært af dig.
Året der er gået satte tydelige spor,
Men du skal vide vi stadig samles om et bord

Og jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Og intet aner selv om tiden går, tiden den går,
Ja jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000.
Du er væk fra mig, men stadig tæt på mig.",1000 Ăr

Jeg finder den mørkegrå hættetrøje du plejer at sove i
Duften af dig, har som det eneste fået lov at bli'
Jeg står tilbage i ruiner fra vores kolde krig
Og høre gennemlyden af de ting du endelig fik lov at sige
Lejligheden ligner sig selv, men intet er det samme
Her burde være sort af aske ligne pindebrænde
Stolen står hvor den plejer, bordet har ikke en skræmme
Der er ingen andre spor, end den tomme billederamme
For bare en time siden, stod jeg i et flammehav
Og nu er her så koldt, at jeg kan se mit eget åndedrag
Finder en kuvert med min adresse og dit efternavn
Min ører ringer stadig fra da døren smækkede med et brag
Og hele verden tav, og varmen den forsvandt
Og nu er det sted vi kaldt hjem, ligesom et fremmed land
Og vores liv er sand, der smuldre mellem fingrene
Der er stille nu så jeg kan høre minderne

Når du går, sig ikk hvorhen
For hvis jeg ku, så ville' jeg hente dig hjem igen
Så slet dine spor, i nat må det ende
Slip mig fri, så jeg en dag kan bli' hel igen

Hver eneste tallerken i mit'skab dem har vi valgt sammen
Hvordan skal vi dog skille det ad, når alting er så blandet sammen
Latterlige ting som vores tandbørster der passer sammen
Jeg burde lukke øjnene, stryge en tændstik og la' det brænde
Jeg finder hadet frem, og prøver at lade vreden vinde
Måske det ville' gøre mindre ondt, hvis nu jeg bar' ku' hade hende
Det virker to minutter før jeg må give op igen
Jeg burde lægge mig ned, men fanme ikk i vores dobbeltseng
Der står en flaske vin på bordet som vi sku ha' delt
Ved siden af ligger den film som vi sku' ha' set
Hvis ikk vi tog snakken ku' det sagtens have været sket
Vi ku' ha' siddet her, og holdt i hånd, sagt ting vi ikk havde ment
Har leget et glansbillede, det ved jeg godt du ikk fortjener
Og jeg forstår godt at du går, du var ikke lykkelig længere
Du hører til et andet sted, håber du finder det
Der er stille nu, så jeg kan høre minderne

Ann Austin,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

And all the words we never meant,

And the bridge came crashing down.

I hear the music and it hurts my head bad now
If you don't like it you can play your own hand now

It's not the records that I'm trying to communicate

You know she's living her life without a better plan, Like you. 

And she just don't know, She steals the show,

Running on and on she goes, 
You know she's living her life,

Then she's standing in the rain, 
She says she only sings the blues, 
And down and down and out she goes, 
And she leaves, Behind her broken heart, 
Her broken bones, For you, And stuck in the middle, 
Not knowing what she's done, And you can't trust yourself, 
And you know it's just the same old one, Was just a lie, To you, To you.

Led astray by your own devices too much at stake put an end to you

For shortened dreams even shorter are the fuses

Life well lived a sentence served it will never be the same and it's on so useless
Sometimes I'm ahead of myself and doesn't that sound good to you?

Last night my heart was so gay

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Ann Burton,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart tho't you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an 'Airmail Special' too

The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismatching, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch-drunk

That lived within the heart of me

Became impatient to be free

Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head

The leaves of brown on the ground
In Spain I did love and adore you
The nights filled with joy were our yesterdays
And tomorrow will bring you near me

Can I get a picture of all my yesterdays?
Yesterday I can say
I get a kick every time they play that Spain again

I can remember the rain in December

Our love was a Spanish fiesta
The bright lights and songs were our joy each day
And the nights were the heat of yearning

Can I get a picture of all my yesterdays?
Yesterday I can say
I get a kick every time I see you gaze at me

I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine and they dance to the melody
And we live again as if dreaming
The sound of our hearts beat like castanets
And forever we'll know their meaning

Ann Malcom,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ann Mitchell,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow
Ann Murray,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Ann Murray,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland, 
Then maybe at the closing of your day; 
You will sit and watch the moonrise over Claddagh, 
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay, 
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream, 
The women in the meadows making hay; 
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin, 
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play, 
For the breezes blowing over the seas from Ireland, 
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow; 
And the women in the uplands digging praties, 
Speak a language that the strangers do not know, 
For the strangers came and tried to teach their way,] 
They scorned us just for being what we are; 
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams, 
Or light a penny candle from a star. 
And if there is going to be a life hereafter, 
And somehow I am sure there's going to be; 
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven, 
In that dear land across the Irish Sea.",Galway Bay
Ann Murray,"There's a spot in my heart,
Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,
Never sounded or known;

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Ann Peebles,"Lying round home alone On a rainy night like this
Starving for your love Hungry for just one kiss
Every rain drop I hear Against my window pane
Beats so loud and clear words that spell your name

[Chorus: x2]
I got nowhere to turn
Tired of being alone
I feel like breaking up somebody's home

I know it's useless 
Hanging on to you when you belong to someone else
Can't change my feelin' child

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Sun was shinin' fine,

Was hangin' clothes on the line
In her back yard,
And weepin' hard.
She married a B&O brakeman
That took and throwed her down,
Bellerin' like a prune-fed calf
With a big gang hanging round
And to that crowd,
She hollered loud:

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey
Won't you come home?

I'll pay the rent,

I threw you out,
With nothing but a fine-tooth comb?
I know I'm to blame,
Well, ain't that a shame

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Maybe I'm not a boy who would stay,

Dancing the night away!

According to a sweet and corny custom.
Isn't it kinda fun makin' vows,
Admitting that we both intend to bust 'em!

Maybe we're out for laughs, a girl and a boy
Kiddin' across a table for two!
But haven't you got a hunch that this is the real McCoy,
And all the things we tell each other are true?

Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all

Ann-Margret,"I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar Carols play
And wide and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth good will to man

I thought as now this day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long the unbroken song
Of peace on earth good will to man

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and marks the song
Of peace on earth good will to man

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor does he sleep
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth good will to man",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day

On Mary's lap is sleeping? 
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, 
While shepherds watch are keeping? 
This, this is Christ the King, 
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing: 
Haste, haste to bring him laud, 
The babe, the son of Mary. 

Why lies he in such mean estate 
Where ox and ass are feeding? 
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here 
The silent Word is pleading. 
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through, 
The Cross be borne for me, for you; 
Hail, hail, the Word made flesh, 
The Babe, the Son of Mary. 

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh, 
Come, peasant, king, to own him.

Let loving hearts enthrone him.

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know was it mine or your mistake

I could use my magic potion
But it might not make you stay
I could talk so much to turn your head

Making a fool out of myself
When you open up and look me in the eye

Oh yeah, this is for real
You want to rule my world
I'm not that kind of girl

What if there's no laughter to conquer the pain?

My apologies
You can't get it right with me so I just gotta go

Disbelief
And constant grief
Sour aftertaste was all I ever came to know

When I smile, you're the tears
I can't make them stop
When I try to connect
You will always block
And you curdle my cream
Like a lemon drop
Don't you know
You're vinegar in my dreams

You're the dirt in my eye
When I try to see
You're the smoke in my lungs
When I try to breathe
And you're the disorder
When I need sleep
Don't you know
You're vinegar in my dreams

You may be right, I may have been a fool, but
Those days are gone and now you're history
You think you're dope, but boy, you're far from cool
Just like a discord in a symphony

Like the rain
Washing down the drain
Don't you realize a thing like this will not sustain
And it's not a shame

And flipped the TV on
The videos were hideous
But they kick started the day

The day the day the day
I'm ready for the the day the day

I'm overcome with a sense of elation
Inside my head there's a radio station
Salvation on heavy rotation

Pop pop and I don't care
As long as I'm on the air
And music is everywhere

I fired up the engine
Heading for the highway
The stereo was way too loud
But that's what it's all about

I could have taken yoga
But I need more stamina
The beats of the body pump
Make me wanna play

Darker than the fear that's gonna pull us apart

God knows it's just the devil in me
The devil that's taking my hand to the fire

I never wanna leave you now
Leave you like the sun is gonna disappear
But it's just believing now
Believing in my heart is what I've come to fear

And it's the fire, the fire, the fire
It's heavenly, heavenly

Desire, desire
I've got desire, desire
I've got desire, desire

And only the lonely
Only the lonely fall
Only the lonely
Only the lonely fall
Fall

Oh, and I go to the fire
But God knows it's the sound of, it's the sound of love
It's the beat of my heart that you
Finally beating, it's coming, coming, coming for you

And it's just the devil in me
It's just a door to the devil gathered in disguise
Taking me by the hand
And leading me, leading me off to the fire

And it's the fire, the fire, the fire
It's heavenly, heavenly

Gotta $5 in my pocket
Want to buy me some gin
A drop of gas in the tank, let me
Think it over again
'Cause I'd rather be drunk on a cloud
Away from here than to be sober,
So sober
Yea
No friends comin' through I think I lost 'em all
No man to take their place
So I decided to make this call
That I'd rather be drunk and
Drive away from

I think I'll smoke just a half
By the time I finish this drink
I'll roll the last of the grass
'cause I'd rather feel pumped
Than to drown in my tears
That'll help me peel over, sleep the night sober
Yea
Did I drink too much?
'cause the road's all lop-sided
I only drove a small way
I thought I swore not to take this right
Now my air's bein' pumped
And I'm drenched in my tears

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty

Anna Maria Jopek,"A thousand years, a thousand more
A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs, to a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths
A million names but only one truth to face
(I still love you)

A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame
The single haunted memory of your face

I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head

I may be numberless, I maybe innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common theif
I've kept this single faith, this one belief

I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves
Eternities still unsaid

Anna Moffo,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture

When I finally realized it was over
And I knew that love wasn't good enough of a reason
for me to stay
Well I saw you yesterday, you were driving
And I'd tried so hard to forget you were alive
And as you passed by I began to cry
Over things that I did not say

And hiding beneath my blackets and sheets I'm finally free
I'm killing the ghost of you and I'm close to awakening me

So I'm taking my heart and I'm getting me out
And love's something that I wouldn't want to live without
So I'm taking my heart and I'm getting me out on my own

Well it takes all of my strength to be stable
And I force your insults under the table
And if you were wise you would compromise
And allow me to live my way
'Cause I am not a force to be reckoned with
And you don't have a clue what you're messing with

Non so stare senza te 
Non so stare amore

Da tenere al petto sempre più vicino
Come un'autostrada lunga senza meta
Scegli tu l'uscita per la tua fermata
Mentre cresci cambi mille direzioni
Per capire dove trovi un'emozione
Ma c'è un'ossessione che non va più via

Come un temporale arriva all'improvviso
Sopra il viso scende piano il tuo sorriso
Nello specchio vedi sempre tutto nero
Scende dalla nave pure il tuo corsaro
Mentre sposti il limite all'esagerato
Stai per condannare a morte la tua vita
E la luce del tuo sole vedi andare via

Smettila di farti del male
È la tua vita non buttarla così
Apri gli occhi e guarda lontano
A cercare il destino ch'era scritto per te
Adesso
Smettila non farti del male
Sei così bella non è giusto così
Nello specchio della paura
Lascia il tuo corpo e porta il cuore con te.

Dentro la tua forza cerca di capire
Che la depressione ha preso il suo potere
Esci dal tuo mondo falso e fuori uso
Guada fuori qui come è meraviglioso
Non c'è medicina per il tuo malore
Solo con l'amore lo potrai curare
Con l'amore vero che c'è dentro te

Cerca un pò di ritrovare la stima
Ricomincia tutto proprio da qui
Chiama pure la tua amica del cuore
Che prova dolore a vederti così

Anna Tatangelo,"Sorridere alla pioggia mentre bagna e cade
Morire in un tuo bacio senza respirare
E perdermi come una goccia
In mezzo alle tue braccia
In mezzo al mare
Guardare le paure
Bruciare dentro il sole
E sentire che con te
Sono Libera
Libera
Come una nuvola nel vento
Che si dondola
Unica, Unica
Come la luce della luna quando illumina

Trovar la pace solamente in un tuo abbraccio
E non accorgersi di come corre il tempo
Sentirsi come un fiore
Incapace di appassire
Solo se mi guardi tu
E guardare le paure
Bruciare dentro il sole
Sentire che con te
Sono libera
Libera
Come una nuvola nel vento
Che si dondola
Unica, Unica
Come la luce della luna quando illumina

Un'altra volta che vuoi rimanere
Ripetilo per tutto

I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw their stars crashing

I’m a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where’s my little China girl?
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw their stars crashing down

I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando

I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone

I never come around
I never come around
I left her fifteen years behind
Girl's laying down
Never come around

So much for girl staying
In afraid of being needed
And seen she watches
The world on a screen

She's distant
And God knows I tried to leave her
'Cause she's got a constant fever
I let it slip my mind

Save us from madness?

Without your company
I have so many holes to fill
At least seven nights a week

I still feel fine, I guess

When I shared it with you
I was lonely

Just a scratch on my ego

From my subconscious singing songs of sadness

With your best time flying by
Not knowing where your future lies

We get no answers from the past
No, how the fire spread so fast

But New Year's Eve
All turned black
Sometimes you're lucky
Sometimes you're not

I better laugh in twenty years from now
With some perspective and dedication
I will find somebody new

It better be someone special
He better be coming very soon
It better be for real this time
Oh I know, it always was with you

You or no one
I hope I'm wrong before I die of boredom
I wantmore than
Days and nights when I amuse
Myself alone

He better be someone special
He better be devoted just like you
It better be for real this time
Oh I know, it always was with you
You, you, with you

Friends forever, oh no
Another girl will change your mind
In less than half the summer
So before you fall in love, I wonder
When you asked for
Something that I couldn't give you
More of
Me and you
I talk as if it's now but nothing is new

She better be someone special
She better be more in love than me
And if I was your brightest hour
She is now, as far as I can see, see
As far as I can see
As far as I can see
She better be

From early march till late in may
Then I pulled out in a day
To catch my breath some place far away

All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I

Tomorrow morning set me free
For many nights you'll never sleep
When I'm far from reaching out of sight
Enough to get me on my high tonight

All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I

Forever lost in 90 days

See'est la folie d'amour
By now my mind is clear
You planted all the fear
Doubts and despair and
You keep my heart on the run
I'm bound to fall in love with the one

Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi

So we planed a secret rendez-vous
Toute la nuit chez moi

Soon confusion grew
I sadly smiled for two
His head went down
He wore my heart like a crown
Ever since I fall for the one

We will disturb you, to make you talk again
Try to find the other side of you
The things you hide, what you don't say

We say no, oh no
We won't let you slip inbetween
We say no, oh no
We won't let you squeeze right through

Give you second chances easily
We wait for answers, for hours and years
But the sadness in your eyes won't go away
It becomes you, in a strange kind of way
I wonder where you come from
Who you've been
What you gain, if you win
But my guess is right you break like glass
And I wonder where, your god was then

I say no, oh no
I won't let you slip inbetween
I say no, oh no
I won't let you squeeze right through

Oh how sweet a girl like you can be
When she tries
You're changing skin like I change clothes
You're faking it well, but it shows

You say: lately I've been bothered by my friends
They need foregiveness
I need therapy, they say
Better lock up well before they come
With their prayers, and loaded guns
Better lock up well before they come
More than ten years to ignore, what they here for

We say no, oh no
We won't let you slip inbetween
We say no, oh no
We won't let you squeeze right through

Stand alone without a fair chance tonight
Here again by your side when
They turn on all the lights
Yes I'll follow you tonight

It's easy to forgive and forget it all tomorrow
I just pass by you, pass by me
My last way out and worst mistake tonight
Lying lips won't say my eyes give me away
Won't you please turn out the light
And I'll follow you tonight

I'll follow you tonight
The worst mistake to make
Or just the kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
And I'll follow you to any doorstep, any hallway
With hope of finding more
Not feel shallow not get bored
And find it useless, feeling meaningless
And just as low as I was high the night before

Or just the kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
And I'll follow you tonight

Some would say that you won't find love that way
The best days are not planned by common sense
By lack of time
You just happen to be where everything feels fine

It's a new secret I have found

From today I'll change my priorities around
I'm no longer in command, and people say
I'm off solid ground and you're to blame
But they don't understand, people never do
It's confusing, I don't expect them to

It's a new secret I have found

Today must have been one of the strangest days
I found a place where I could stay
And people say that it will kill me,
But they don't understand
People never do, but it makes sense to me
To be senseless to change my plans for you

And I'm off solid grounds for you



",My Secret

There is someone outside
Looking through our window
When we sleep at night
You must not leave me alone anymore
Awake all night, worrying for

You to be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else

Didn't I tell you
About the dream I had last night
We were both in it
And everything seemed so right
When I opened up my eyes
He was standing behind our
Don't remember the look on his face
But I remember, I remember what he said

To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
??
It's time for you to be with somebody like me

Somebdy touched me
And whispered in my ear
Come a little bit closer
There's nothing for you to fear here
So I left your sight
Followed my own voice now
The window was open
But he was gone
And I went back to you

To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else

It's time for you to be with somebody outside

So remind me of how I used to feel
Remind me of who I used to be back when
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us when
Nothing could come between us then
That thought would never leave us","No, I Don't Remember"
Anna Ternheim,"Off the road, somewhere I don't know
Soon with you, it's gonna blow
In your car for hours and days
Weeks and months, windows rolled down

Pass small cities and big ones too
I brought one promise, not one for you
We drive fast, sunsets low
Wanna reach the sun before I get old

Deserts and fields and the pine trees
Music my father played me
I was a child just like now
I never once thought that feeling could die

Those days came and went
Then you get taken by life by accident
And you wake up somewhere in the shade
Overloaded by what you made yourself

Have to get the things, the ring, a man, a wing
And smile when you don't win
And I say off the road, somewhere I don't know
Just as long as I feel it blow

Deserts and fields and the pine trees
Music my father played me
When I was a child just like now
I never once thought that feeling could die

That feeling could die",Off the Road
Anna Ternheim,"Last summer was mad, remember the rain
I know people complained I had something else in mind
Not the sound of rain against my window pane
All I could hear was you hammering in my head

Fall like a wave against a rock
Leave with a rush or get crushed
You never know until after the shock
When you wake up, what's broken what's not

One day I don't know how my whole life evolved
Around You, my Lord, believing was not enough
You said I was a hole of desperate need
And no love in the world, not even Yours could satisfy me

That's when the troubles began, disasters came
One by one I nearly drowned in that summer rain

Fall like a wave against a rock
Leave with a rush or get crushed
You never know until after the shock
When you wake up, what's broken what's not

We fall like waves against the rock
Leave with a rush or get crushed
You never know until after the shock
When you wake up, what's broken what's not
When you wake up, what's broken what's not",Summer Rain
Anna Ternheim,"No one I'll rather be with than you
Never say the word but our eyes always do
My head explodes and my mind's a mess
And I'm dying to move like young boys do

No one I'll rather be with than you
Away with the bothers and the saddest of news
Sober or not, high and down below
Days you know but nothing flows

You see me like no one saw me before
You see me like no one saw me before
And this part terrifies me so

No one makes me free like you make me
I speak my mind, I'm honest and I'm cruel
I lay out my cards, I'm a joke, I'm a fool
But the beast in me sleeps oh so peacefully, oh so peacefully

You see me like no one saw me before
You see me like no one saw me before
You see me like no one saw me before
You see me like no one saw me before",Terrified
Anna Ternheim,"You are my everything
My head and my heart, my mind, my wing
I couldn't give all again
I'm never sure of anything with you

The jokes, the laughs, the teardrops too
The games, the fun, the travels too
Yes, I'll go through it all with you
All good things now come from you

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard for you?

I give my everything
My head and my heart, my mind, my wing
The past, the present, tomorrow too
I'll spend my final day with you

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard for you?

It's twelve o'clock and you have not called
You haven't's dialed my number of loneliness
And the distance between us grows larger
It's twelve o clock and you have not called
In my unbearable mind's emptyness
You seem like a dream going away

And the phone doesn't ring
I burst into tears
You have never realised what I'm going through
and my agony grows like a mountain
It's twelve o'clock and all my hopes are standing
just on a dead phone
and my heart is shouting I love you

It's twelve o'clock and you have not called
You haven't's dialed my number of loneliness
It's twelve o'clock and yet no call
I can't stand anymore this agony
and I wan't to tell you that's all over now

But the phone doesn't ring
I burst into tears
You have never realised what I'm going through
and my agony grows like a mountain
It's twelve o'clock and all my hopes are standing

Anna Vissi,"Seems only yesterday now,
Hiding my heart away
I kept my world outside
Tonight love could not be mine
Then suddenly I see you

I knew it had to be you
I feel your spirit in me
Love has saved my life

[Chorus]
Everything I am. everything I own
Everything that's happening before my eyes
I owe it all to you

Pure is the love
Soft is the touch, you thrill
Like no one before, how could I want you more?
Like rain falls to the ocean

Like changes of the seasons
Some things are meant to be
I found myself in you

Anna Vissi,"No I didn't anticipate this
No it wasn't supposed to end like this
But something inside
Holds on so deep so tight
Have to decide
To give up this fight.

[Chorus]
But I can feel you all around me
Sounds of love still resounding
And I'm praying to you
Forgive me this
I look to heaven and
Fall down on my knees
Look at my hands up
Hope you will believe and
I'm praying to you forgive me this.

You, well you never thought
It's gonna happen to you.
Youth is dangerous
When the heat of passions rules

And if I could, well I would
Have done it right
I toss and turn
When I think of what
You might have looked like

In my dreams I see you safe
Safe from harm.
In these fields if heaven you're free
Free to run oh oh oh

Anna Vissi,"Just why I stayed around when all I found was a heartache
I believed your every word
Didn't know the hurt and pain that you'd make
But why did it take so long
At last now I've seen the light
I found the heart to say

[Chorus]
No more the fool who went around waiting
For you to bring me down
Those days are gone now
No more the nights lying awake crying
And waiting for the day to break
No more the sound as my dreams fall and hit the
Ground while I wait around no more the fool

You thought I'd break then you were wrong
That I won't see what's going on but I knew
Here I am I'm alive and you will see I'll survive without you
And I won't be the one who comes running
It ain't like it used to be
Here's your turn to run to me

All the nights I waited for you to call
I waited for a sign that you would stay
But it's so clear you didn't care at all",No More the Fool
Anna Vissi,"Don't say it's like a fantasy

I'm falling
It's your name I'm calling
You touch me
I want you
Feels like I've always known you

Is what really turns you on
And you're loving every minute
Thinking everyone has gone

You just roll your eyes
And you fantasize
Think you're number one

So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?

Always out at every party
So the pain don't show
Talking too much laughing too loud
So that everybody knowns

But the joke's on you
And you're such a fool
That's the way it goes

[Chorus]",So in Love With Yourself
Anna Vissi,"Sorry to call you,am I wrong to be thinking of you
I got so many things on my mind
But then so many things don't come out right
Like how do I tell ""I'm sorry I hurt you?
I don't know if you forgive me but I wish you could be with me

[Chorus]
I'm still in love with you
I still believe in you
I still hold on to the feeling,hoping it's real and knowing it's kiling me
You're still the only one,I love uoy right or wrong
And I can't give up and I won't move on
The ghost of your love keeps me holding on

Gone are days of laughing at love and tears
I got so many things I could tell you,
But then so many dreams never come true
I promised forever and I never stopped believing
We could have had it all
But the tide won't turn
And the world moved on

And if could find the way to make you understand
I'd promise ferever ohh,we should have had it all,
And it's killing me baby

Anna Vissi,"There's a feelin' in the atmosphere
'Bout a million miles away from here
If we energize and free our minds
We can break the laws of space and time

And it's coming down to planet earth
From around the universe

[Chorus]
Supernatural love
It never stops,it never stops
Do you feel it comin'
Supernatural love
It goes beyond the physical
Supernatural love

I can see our future in the stars
Now Venus is in line with Mars
Do you see what I see
This is love to infinity

And it's coming down to planet earth
Right across the universe

Anna Waronker,"Oh, you know I've been feeling down
How can I fly with my feet on the ground?
How can I sing when I can't make a sound?

We were just girls 
When we kissed each other's lips
We didn't know that it meant something

You had to go when I told you no 
And I knew I'd never see you again
We were not friends
It was different than that
We had a love 'til the end 
That was beautiful and dying
Who could have told?
The fortunes of the misfortunes we would hold?
And I never thought that we would grow old together
You wanted to be beautiful
You thought you were a star
And now that everything has disappeared 
You are who you are

That this is the world 
Where things are rarely rarely good

And I knew I'd never see you again 
I'd never see you again, ever again

One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high

Said there was nothing in it to claim

No matter how I try to tame
This fever inside
Can't be satisfied (cause I)

Takes me down and up doesn't let me escape
From the love and the hate and the joy and the pain
It's the drug with a drain
And protection's the name of the game, and I'll play in spite
Of the warning signs
For a time I can feel sublime
And when I start to unwind I just

In a daze, caught up in a fling, this extraordinary thing

Hold your warm and tender body next to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops

I get lone, you've found another
And I'll be here if you should find

And the windscreen wipers keep a beat repeatin'

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

There's no one here who's close enough
To share this sorrow with
Have few answers for myself
Yet alone enough to give
Watch all my faults before me

The cast stoned
The words that linger too long in the air
The rumbling silence over the length of a room
The lie that lay between two lovers
The hopelessness in their struggling
The price to high to pay
A dark and obscured voyeur
Combing through your secret
The stranger to the child
Loneliness in solitude
Sand in the drinkers mouth
Shadows over sunlight
And all the time you are with me

Those with their heads bowed to the darkness
Those who can't see for the glave of the light
Those without strength

Anne Clark,"Here
Upon these ghostly shadows
Of men and women
There are no smiles
Singly
They mingle
With the greyness of the walls
And at strange angels
They travel on
To nowhere
Each a nucleus
Of sadness and despair
Small
Or no conversation
Passes their cigarette-stained lips
They sit
The lonely ones
Sitting eternally
In institutions
That have become their eyes
That have become their arms
Their legs
They are empty now
Just shells moving back and forth
Upon a shore
Of some uncharted beach
Up steep green hills
They linger
Like the darkness thoughts
That push them selves
Into your mind
You cannot question them
For they will not answer you
They
Are our deepest fears",Cane Hill
Anne Clark,"Walking into light
From the blank evening sky
Knuckles rub away the darkness
Circling my eyes
Walking into warmth
From the cold evening air
Numb white fingers push
Greasy rain through my hair
You walk into view
From shadow thrown against the door
Hands reach out and grasp the moment
They've been waiting for
You pull me close
Dampness seeps
through to your skin
You peel the layers away
I feel the fire ignite within
 You create the feeling
 I contain the need
 It's moments that we're stealing
 No pleasure's ever free
 You sustain the rhythm
 I'll maintain the beat
 It's the only ,chance we're given
 Let's turn this cold to heat
 You possess the notion
 I take full heed
 We're bound by this emotion
 Two bodies - one heartbeat
 You create the feeling
 I contain the need
 You sustain the rhythm
 I'll maintain the beat
Desire comes alive
Nothing interrupts the flow
Water nurtures every crevice
Where this love needs to grow
Sliding to the floor
We swell , falling to the ground
The world becomes a place
With no clear shapes, with no clear sounds
We're lost for a short while
In the knot where love's entwined
You pour the freedom from deep inside
I drink it back like wine
The murmur of your voice
Soft words soothe away the doubt
your strength - so essential
Something i can't do without
 You ....
Inside we slow each movement
'Til we're static once again
Outside the city runs
Cars through roads like blood through veins
Here sweet sticky air
Locke a cover keeps us warm
Drops of love fall from us
The last moments of the storm
Opening my eyes
You're even closer now to me
As the crowd goes pushing onwards
Crashing forwards like a sea
We turn and feel the world
Right now a million miles away
It's always there to interfere
But I'm always here to say
 You ....",Homecoming

 I'll melt into the sun

 Remember me for what I was
 A glance in your direction at the right time
 A smile breaking into a crescent moon
 A word of reassurance

 I'll protect myself

""It seems I'm losing my way again"" he sighed.
And once again the tell-tale tears begin their journey down
An ever deepening track.

His wife place a hand upon his shoulder.
How over these past few months, he's aged so many years.
He'd give this life to live again.
He'd be so more daring. Be so much bolder
But a little less aware.
It's something of which he can't
Be certain and so he stays restrained and hurting.

At breakfast he places a kiss upon his only daughter.
How he longs for her to run to them as she did when
She was young, but her secrets have become her fears too.
Yet still she remains his child.
His still-pretty wife manages so well. Makes excuses for his absence.
Tries so hard to find the road he's on.

Leading to my sorry tale
I was in a town I didn't know
I'd arrived there by rail
It all began a week before -
The joys of Saturday Night -
An invite to a party
Or watching The Price Is Right
Opting for a soirée
For the first time in a year
Mixed badly with the revelers
Mixed Bacardi, wine and beer
The room moved back and forwards
The dancers did the same
Found refuge in a corner
That's when he asked my name
Well this is very nice, I thought
Smiling through the haze
As we talked of Auguste Rodin
Through to Harold Pinter's plays
Said he played piano
Said his name was Steve
Why shouldn't I believe
That he really lived so far away
Had to make a move for home
Scribbled down his address
Said he didn't have a phone
Would I like to come to dinner
On Friday of next week
To this i said I'd love to
As he kissed me on the cheek
That night I felt so happy
Excited through and through
See ! The company of strangers
Doesn't always leave you blue
Stumbled home contented
Like a cat that got the cream
Wake up a little weary
But I knew it was no dream
The next few days were auyiouns
What could I find to wear ?
What happens if i arrive
And there is no Hope Road there ?
My friend said don't be silly
No one does things like that
Now will you get a move on
And take off that stupid hat !
Made sure I set out early
Made sure I caught the train
Got out at the right station
Then of course came down the rain
Followed the directions
Exactly as he said
Asked people if they new Hope Road
But they just walked on ahead
I turned left at the junction
Took the fork off to the right
Straight over at the crossroads
Then down to the traffic lights
must have walked those streets for hours
in the dark and in the cold
Before I really could accept
There was no place called Hope Road
So here I am alone again
Indoors by myself
The TV, plants, books and I
All nearly on the shelf
Next time I'll be more cautions
Next time I Won't be fooled

Let this be a warning
As you wander through the world

Filled with love, it was a world so white
And we'd run from one to the other side
Filled with laughter and a love so bright

Something that will tell me, everything's alright.

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life

From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us

Anne Ducros,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Anne Ducros,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And then I peeped through the crack
And I looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you",I Thought About You
Anne Ducros,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Anne Ducros,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Anne Ducros,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Anne Farnsworth,"Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes

And all the leaves on the trees are fallin'
To the sound of the breezes that blow
An' I'm trying to please to the callin'
Of your heart strings that play soft and low

And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight in to my arms you will run

And when you come, my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then, all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then, I will make you my own

And I know how much you want me that you can't hide

Anne Feeney,"Rockefeller's busy giving dough away;
Chevrolet is busy making cars;
Hobo, you keep busy when they throw away
Slightly used cigars.
Hobo, you've no time to shirk.
You're busy keeping far away from work.

The weather' s getting fine.
The coffee tastes like wine.
You happy hobo, sing,
""Hallelujah, I'm a bum again!""
Why work away for wealth
When you can travel for your health?
It' s spring, you hobo, sing,
""Hallelujah, I'm a bum again!""
Your home is always near;
The moon's your chandelier;
Your ceiling is the sky,
Way up high.

The earth your little dinner plate;

you fall asleep 
think of nothing more 
memories will keep 
your dreams will turn to gold 
and you will wake and find 
that you hold a smile all day 
from this lullaby 
maybe somewhere in the silence 
you may wake and you're all alone 
just call and I'll be there 
even when I'm gone 
each day will end

With all your little toys
Your eyes have seen the world
Though you're only four years old
And your tears are streaming
Even when you're smiling
Please never be afraid to cry 

You're a beautiful boy
With all your little ploys
Your mind has changed the world
And you're now forty years old
You got all you can carry
And still feel somehow empty
Don't ever be afraid to fly 

All you beautiful boys
Creating multiple plays
You like to fence in your world
And settle down when you're old
You can run from pole to pole
And never scratch your soul
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back
Don't be afraid to be afraid

With the world on your shoulders 
And your highest hopes 
Laying on the ground

You've gotta try to be my hero 
But don't you know 
The stars you wish upon 
They fall that's true 
But I still believe in you

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth turn in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird

Standing there 
In such an ordinary way

Everything keeps changing 
There's a leaf 
On that tree 
And it floats into a stream 
And like everything 
It gets carried away 
To the sea. ..

But if we give a little of our love away 
Maybe meet in the middle 
Every night and day 
If we could hear just a whisper 
Of what the heart needs to say 
It could sure make a difference 
In some small. .. 
In some small way 
In your heart lies the key 
That unlocks your destiny 
Look within and we'll find 
Everything we're longing for

Oh. .. 
May you cherish each moment you live 
And know all the love that you give 
Will go on and on and on. ..

And it lies deep inside of you 
Breathe it in 
Let it out 
Breathe it in again. ..

Que nous l'attendions passionnément
Que chaque nuit s'efface au nouveau jour

D'aller frôler les glaces et les feux
Qu'il goûte à tout mais sans jamais dépendre
Que trop peut être pire que trop peu

Viendra l'aimer et qu'il l'aimera

Anne Haigis,"I think my heart was designed to fade and lose color
To turn inside out and wash in the rain
It loses all perfection in cold water
So the desired look is obtained

And it rises higher and higher
Like this filthy heat above the city sky
And I feel like I'm going mad dancing in the fire
As if I'm only here to prove there are mountains I could move

So love is spent dancing in the fire
Too high the cost and too quick the pain
And all that's left for the outsider
Is ashes from dancing in the fire

I think my eyes were made for deception
Interpreting lovers will call what we want the truth
With all I have seen burning behind these mirrors
The reflection they see is all that I pursue

And it rises higher and higher
Like this filthy heat above the city sky
And I feel like I'm going mad dancing in the fire
As if I'm only here to prove there are mountains I could move

So love is spent dancing in the fire
Too high the cost and too quick the pain
And all that's left for the outsider
Ashes from dancing in the fire

And voices get louder
And the air's too thick to breathe
Still I lie awake and I wait for the unknown power
Dying for want of sleep

I think my life line was stolen from a movie
The one where they are trying to solve the crime
But this prisoner is always one step before them
And everyone's running trying to stop me in time

And it keeps rising higher and higher
Like this filthy heat above the city sky
And I feel like I'm going mad dancing in the fire
As if I'm only here to prove
There are lovers I could move

Oh love is spent dancing in the fire
Too high the cost and too quick the pain
And all that's left for the outsider
Ashes from dancing in the fire

Lachte auf meinen Knien
Weinte in meinem Arm.

Zog mir an den Haaren

Geradeaus und frei
Und die Welt auf ihren Schultern war kinderleicht.

Und spielt mit ihrem Fahrschein für den letzten Zug.

Die anderen gar nicht mehr.

Warst do sofort in mich verliebt.
Ich beherrschte dich I'm Handumdrehn,
So klein ich war, sah dich nicht mal an
Do warst ein großer Mann.

Und ich die letzte Liebe von dir,
Do lehrtest mich das Laufen
Do lehrstest mich zu gehen,
Gibst mir Kraft und Mut,
Denn ich bin dein Fleisch und Blut.

Do bist meine Zuversicht
Wenn mich das Schicksal schleift
Das Leben reift
Seh ich I'm Nebel dein Gesicht.

Dich bedeckt schon ein Kleid aus Erde
Doch für mich bist do nicht tot,
Do bist für immer nah bei mir,
Bist mehr als Salz und Brot.
Do bist mein Talisman,
Bist da, wenn ich verlier.

do warst mein Papa
Papa ich vergess dich nicht.
Wenn mein Glücksstern sinkt,
Nichts mehr gelingt,
Seh ich I'm Nebel dein Gesicht.

Mein lieber Papa
Papa - ich vergess dich nicht
Wenn die Erde bebt,
Das Meer sich erhebt,
Dann seh ich dein Gesicht.

Do bist meine Zuversicht,

Anne Haigis,"Ooh, now let's get down tonight
 Baby I'm hot just like an oven
 I need some lovin'
 And baby, I can't hold it much longer
 It's getting stronger and stronger

 And when I get that feeling
 I want sexual healing
 Sexual healing, oh baby
 Makes me feel so fine
 Helps to relieve my mind
 Sexual healing baby, is good for me
 Sexual healing is something that's good for me

 Whenever blue tear drops are falling
 And my emotional stability is leaving me
 There is something I can do
 I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
 Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
 The love you give to me will free me
 If you don't know the things you're dealing
 I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
 Get up, get up, get up, get up, let's make love tonight
 Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, 'cause you do it right
 Baby I got sick this morning
 A sea was storming inside of me
 Baby I think I'm capsizing
 The waves are rising and rising

 And when I get that feeling
 I want sexual healing
 Sexual healing is good for me
 Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
 Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
 Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
 Sexual healing is something that's good for me
 And it's good for me and it's good to me

 Come take control, just grab a hold
 Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it

Anne Haigis,"I've seen that look before
Here comes that doubt again
You think that girl we saw
Was more then just a fling
Yes, there was a time
I thought she had it all
She meant the world to me
Back when the world was small

[Chorus:]
That was a river
This is the ocean
That never carried
This much emotion
Nothing compares to
This deep emotion
That was a river
This is the ocean

The love we had before
Can never change this one
We're not imprisoned by
The past we've brought along
It's just you and me
One ship in the night
There are no boundaries
There is no end in sight

Anne Hills,"As my aching head is begging for a sleep that will not come
I rise and walk the morning street again
I keep wondering how you're doing and I wonder where you are
And I know I'll be all right, but I don't know when
Hold onto me, babe, wherever you may be
Hold onto me, babe, I'm with you always
There was something locked in side you like a secret burning pain
In a prison where you would not let me go
I was sure we'd find an answer, til I woke and found you gone
Now just what it was, I guess I'll never know
I keep hanging onto something, but I don't know what it is
But at least I know the sound of my own name
And I work as hard as ever and I see the same old friends
But there's something deep inside that ain't the same

Anne Hills,"When princes meet
The poor little men must tremble
In judgment seat

They speak of their wars
While great armies assemble
Their armor shines
To shame the sun

They move like gods
They do resemble
All bow their necks
To iron feet when princes meet

When castles rise
The poor little men must build them
To charm the skies

They throw up the turrets
Where the great lords will them
They dig the dungeons
From the earth

And their brothers
Wives and children fill them
All those below cast down
Their eyes when castles rise

God save the king
For he grants us leave to serve him
His praises sing
And grant that we may deserve him

Who counts the cost?
The cattle and men to be lost?
'Tis no small thing to serve a king

When kings make war
The poor little men must fight them
They must do more

They hold out their necks
For great lord's swords to bite them
The sons of the lords cleave
Through their ranks

In the hopes some warrior king
Might knight them
It's what the poor little men are for
When kings make war

Hide your cattle in the woods, Francois
The lord is looking your way
Hide your women and your goods, Francois
They're coming around to make you pay

Hide if you can, poor little man
Think of a prayer to say
Hide if you can, poor little man
Think of a prayer to say

God save the king
For he grants us leave to serve him
His praises sing
And grant that we may deserve him

Who counts the cost?
The cattle and men to be lost?
'Tis no small thing to serve a king

Anne Kerry Ford,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,

Sometimes I hear a neighbor snoring
Sometimes I can hear a baby cry

Sometimes I can hear a staircase creaking
Sometimes a distant telephone

Lonely house, lonely me

How lonesome you can be

Lonely town, lonely street
Funny, you can be so lonely

Even stray dogs have a friend

Anne Kerry Ford,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

Anne Kerry Ford,"You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No. you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""what's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you.

There's a ship
The black freighter
With a skull on its masthead
Will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, ""hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! what's wrong with you! earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, honey
Nobody
Nobody!

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say, ""who's that kicking up a row?""
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda
And you say, ""what's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell ya.

There's a ship
The black freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""why do they spare that one?""
Yes.
That's what you say.
""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The black freighter
Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them now, or later?""
Askin' me!
""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock
And so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""right now.
Right now!""

Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

If I did him wrong
And lying to him would hurt me more
Than leaving you this way
So before we forget, we're not cheaters yet
Let's keep it that way

Let's finish this wine
'Cause I'm not thinking too clearly tonight
And the touch of your hand
Makes it so hard for me to tell wrong from right
He waits at home and he's there alone
And though I'd like to stay
Before I give in
Let's call it just friends
And keep it that way",Let's Keep It That Way
Anne Murray,"I was dancin' with my darlin' 
To the Tennessee Waltz

I happened to see
I introduced her 
To my loved one 
And while they were dancin' 
My friend stole my sweetheart from me

And the Tennessee Waltz 
Now I know just how much
I have lost 
Yes, I lost my little darlin' 
The night they were playin'

Anne Murray,"Ever since that first night,
When I gave my love to you.
Everything just seems so right,
You are my sunlight, shining through.
And I've tried so, not to let it show,
Yet it seems sad, because I know:

[Chorus]
No matter how hard I try,
No matter how hard I try,
It's always a goodbye.

You smile softly as you leave my bed,
And I tightly hold your hand.
You lean down to kiss my head,
But there's nothing to be said.
And if you say you want to stay,
I'd know you'd soon be on your way.

[Chorus x 3]

So here we stand, you and I.
You are too kind, I'm too shy,
To say what we really mean.
So we make life a masquerade,
Never showing all, only the parts we play.

[Chorus]",There's Always a Goodbye
Anne Murray,"The love that we have
Is not so bad
Unless you think about
The love that we had
I don't know, who closed the door
But we don't make love anymore

We used to love
You used to care
Now it's hard to find
The feeling we shared
You found a way
To even the score
And we don't make love anymore

So come lie down
Beside me and talk to me
Touch me with your body and your mind
Help me find the feeling
And push all this behind
We'll make sweet, sweet love one more time

But you won't try
And I'll understand
We'll just live our lives
The best we can
We turn out the lights
We still lock the door
But we don't make love anymore

Anne Murray,"No one knows my love for love,

And then the things I do.
He can't help it,
If he's not you.

He wants nothing more than changin'
things,
But I know he can't help it too.

He keeps on forgiving me
For the things couldn't do.
He can't help it,
If he's not you.

Though he's not the one I dream about,
He's not the one to blame.

For the love he dreamed for two.

Or I'll never fall in love

In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I'll fall in love with you

Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too

Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning

Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth

Fever yea I burn for sooth'

Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'

Now you've listened to my story

That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free.

The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you.

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore.

On the other side of doubt is faith
On the other side of pain lies strength
The journey may seem endless
And You know the road is rough
But on the other side of fear, is love

For such a long time I put my dreams aside
The tides of change felt dangerous
The mountains seemed too high
But my dreams were slowly fading
As time went quickly by
So I held me breath with every step
Never knowing I would find

On the other side of doubt is faith
On the other side of pain lies strength
The journey may seem endless
And You know the road is rough
But on the other side of fear, is love

On the other side of doubt is faith
On the other side of pain lies strength
The journey may seem endless
And You know the road is rough
But on the other side of fear, is love",The Other Side
Anne Murray,"I look at this mountain
So many heaertaches wide
I can't help but wonder
Where's the other side
I've got to be honest
I've got my doubts
These tears are asking me
What's this got to do with love?
Darling please tell me something
Won't you make me feel that it's all right

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love survived
Another test of faith
You and I can walk on water
The river rises, we rise above
It may not look that way right now but
Trust me baby this is love

Love isn't easy
I'm torn I confess
When a heart is uncertain
It's bound to second guess
So hold me close until tomorrow
And say the words I long to hear","Trust Me Baby, This Is Love"
Anne Murray,"If words won't do it
And words are just a waste of time
We could get right to it
If I could only read your mind

You're just a mystery to me
Deeper than the deep blue sea
There must be something that will melt your heart
Baby tell me just where to start

[Chorus:]
What would it take to get you closer
What would it take just to stir your soul
What can I do to make you love me
Just the thought of you
Keeps me lying away 
Tell me what would it take 

If the night don't move you
And you've never seen the stars come out
If the touch don't soothe you
Then maybe you've just never been touched
I want to be the one to change your mind
I think about it all the time 
??
I want to wake you from your deepest sleep

You're just a mystery to me
Deeper than the deep blue sea
There must be something that will melt your heart

Little birds will sing along in time
The leaves will bow down when you walk by

I'll be there when you're feeling down
To kiss away the tears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
A reflection of the love in your eyes.

Anne Murray,"Just a kiss at the end of an evening
When the lights are turned down low
One kiss leads to another
Someone whispers, ""Darling, don't go""

Heaven is here
Can't you see?
These are the things love is made of
And will always be

It's late but there's no thought of leavin'
For tomorrow is so far away
The night you found courage to tell him
That you found out to tell him today

Heaven is here
Can't you see?
These are the things love is made of
And will always be

As you leave down the hallway, you're whistling
Some strange melody you never knew
And it won't leave your head as you climb into bed
No matter what you do

Heaven is here
Can't you see?
These are the things love is made of
And will always be

These are the things love is made of
And will always be

",Last Thing on My Mind
Anne Murray,"How do you cool your lips, after a summer's kiss?
How do you rid the sweat, after the body's bliss?
How do you turn your eyes, from the romantic glare?
How do you block the sound
Of a voice you'd know anywhere?

Oh, I really should have known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes, your casual good-byes
By the chill in your embrace
The expression on your face, told me
Maybe, you might have some advice to give
How to be insensitive, insensitive ooh, insensitive

How do you numb your skin, after the warmest touch?
How do you slow your blood, after the body rush?
How do you free your soul, after you've found a friend?
How do you teach your heart
It's a crime to fall in love again?

Oh, you probably won't remember me
It's probably ancient history
I'm one of the chosen few
Who went ahead and fell for you
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch
I fell too fast I feel too much
I thought that you might have some advice to give,
How to be insensitive

Oh, I really should have known
By the time you drove me home

Ever since the train left Montreal
Thought I'd always love this life I'm living
But now I know I love you most of all.

That I'd come home to stay
But it always seems foolish

I believe in you when winter turn to summer
I believe in you when white turn to black
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
Oh, though the earth may shake me, oh, though my friends forsake me
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back

While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear

And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own

Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string

Every life has a plan
Though sometimes the map is out of our hands
Every day is a step
Though we may not know the reason just yet
When your faith fails
When your dreams sleep
Learn to let go, and just let it be

CHORUS:
Let there be love
Let there be light
Let there be hope in the dark of the night
For every heart that's lying in wait
Let there be love
Let there be love

You are strong
You are brave
Though I couldn't even count all the way
There's a time to be still
Let the river carry you where it will
When your faith fails
When your dreams sleep
Learn to let go
Just let it be

Yes, I know what it's like when you lose your way
When the best laid plans unravel
That's when you've got to believe

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.

Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.

Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Just a puppet on a lonely string

Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low

The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back To Me Now

Même si on sait
Que c'est pas comme ça
Qu'on s'oubliera
Tends-moi les bras
Encore une fois
Tends-moi ta main
Tends-moi tes mots
Tends-moi tes gestes maladroits
Tends-moi les bras
Murmure-moi
Toutes les belles choses que l'on fera
Tous les matins que l'on vera
Tends-moi les bras
Raconte-moi
Que tu adores me réveiller
Que tu ne me vois pas assez
Tends-moi les bras
Effleures-moi
De tes caresses qui me brûle
De tes ""je ne désire que toi""
Tends-moi les bras
Enlace-moi
Embrasse-moi
Je veux revivre une fois encore
Quand nos deux corps sont à l'étroit
Enlace-moi
Embrasse-moi
Je veux entendre battre ton coeur
Je veux me perdre dans ta sueur
Et respirer au creux de toi
Tends-moi les bras
Encore une fois
Tends-moi tes cris
Et mes sanglots
Parce que l'on va se faire la peau
Tends-moi mes pleurs
Et ton effroi
Tends-moi ""non, j'ai trop peur de toi""
Tends-moi ""que l'amour n'a pas de loi""
Tends-moi les bras
Tends-moi ma haine
Tends-moi mes doutes
Et tes mensonges qui me dégoûtent
Et nos ""je ne déchire que toi""
Tends-moi les bras
Même si l'on va payer le prix
Même si tu sais que ça me détruit
Même si demain tout s'envolera
Tends-moi les bras
Tends-moi les bras
Parce qu'on a perdu le contrôle
Parce que j'ai mal quand tu me frôles
Mais que j'ai mal quand t'es pas là",Tends-Moi Les Bras
Anne Sila,"Tried a picture in the dark
The sweetest things that we have done
Torn inside I feel a spark
And I realize that they all are gone

Pouring tears are flowing deep in my veins
The memories of how strong I was before you
I'd like to fly to the highest mountains
And hold you 'till the night is through

But in a voiceless scream
That you will never hear
I'm shouting time is taking all my deepest dreams
And we are left apart
With all the words unspoken
Burning on my skin

Tried to feel what it was like
But now my body is standing still
All the lights are fading out
And I realize I'm no longer dreaming

But in a voiceless scream
That you will never hear
I'm shouting time is taking all my deepest dreams
And we are left apart
With all the words unspoken
Burning on my skin

Burning everywhere
It's burning everything
I'm going up in flames
When we're done

Protecting you and me
Was all I ever did
But here I stand alone

But in a voiceless scream
That you will never hear
I'm shouting time is taking all my deepest dreams
And we are left apart
With all the words
With all the words
With all the words

But in a voiceless scream
That you will never hear
I'm shouting time is taking all my deepest dreams
And we are left apart
With all the words unspoken",Voiceless Scream
Anne Sila,"I walk alone this empty night
They say I'm going to be alright
But I can't be
I wash the sacred in your eyes
I want to find a way to fight
But I can't see
Were we living in a lie?
'Cause I know that I'm lost
Were we living in a lie again?
Were we living in a lie?
'Cause I know that I'm lost
Were we living in a lie again?

Anne Sila,"Il faudrait que j'arrête
De dire que je vais arrêter
Il faudrait que je permette
Au vide de venir m'habiter
Il faudrait que j'apprenne
A compter combien de fois j'ai dit
Qu'il n'y avait plus rien
Et combien de fois j'me suis mentie

Le monde tourne sans toi
Et plus je joue
Et plus je perds
J'voudrais tellement tomber par terre
Tomber par terre

Il faudrait que ta bouche
Ne soit pas mon unique raison
Et que botter en touche
Ne soit pas ma seule réaction
Il faudrait que j'inonde
De sombres couleurs tes souvenirs
Et que je dise à tout le monde
Que t'es plus là
Mais j'sais pas le dire
Il faudrait que je revienne
Quand j'pars m'égarer dans tes draps
Et que je me souvienne
Comment ne pas avoir envie de toi
Il faudrait que je trace
Les routes que j'ai jamais osées
Il faudrait que j'efface
Toutes celles qu'on avait dessinées

Le monde tourne sans toi
Et plus je joue
Et plus je perds
J'voudrais tellement tomber par terre
Le monde tourne sans toi
Et plus je joue
Et plus je perds

Et le monde tourne sans toi
Et le monde et le monde tourne sans toi
Et le monde et le monde tourne sans toi
Et le monde et le monde tourne sans toi
Et le monde et le monde tourne sans toi
Et le monde et le monde tourne sans toi
Et le monde et le monde tourne sans toi
Et le monde et le monde tourne sans toi

Il faudrait que ta bouche
Ne soit pas pas mon unique raison
Le monde tourne sans toi
Et plus je joue
Et plus je perds

Anne Sila,"That very second, all I see
Is how changing we are now

We chase the world without knowing
It would soon tear us apart

But it all went, too fast
Oh it all went, too fast

I made a vow I thought easy
For the sky to realize

Wishing that you'd be all I need
Lost my weakness in your eyes

But it's all gone, too fast
Oh it's all gone, too fast

Anne Sofie von Otter,"It's not open to discussion anymore
He's out again tonight and I'm alone once more
He's all I have worth waiting for
But baby plays around
And so it seems I've always been the last to know
To hold on to that girl, I had to let her go
I wish to God I didn't love her so
'Cos baby plays around

I try to be strong hold on to my pride
He doesn't even know it's wrong, how much
I hurt inside
And heaven knows I've tried
But baby plays around. Just a plaything
It's hard to reconcile the facts I'm facing
