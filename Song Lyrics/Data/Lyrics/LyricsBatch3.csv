Aimee Mann,"I'm taking it back I'm making a pact
I will make you indispensable
I spoke to myself, oh I might as well
And let you just be made sensible
Tell me your thoughts so I can
Love you in spite of them
But now I'm happy if I
Never lose sight of them

[Chorus:]
I'll take it back - I never said it did
And that's a fact - as of a month ago
But now that the worst is over
I can just take it back

Oh lovers they come, another call from
A phone booth somewhere in ""Lovertown""
It isn't so bad those others I've had
It isn't as if I'm losing ground
I'm getting better when I
Annex myself from you
It ought be another
Country I'm moving to

[Chorus:]

I'd like to throw myself a
Million miles an hour
I'd like to feel before the
Feeling goes sour

[Chorus:]
So take it back - I never said I did
And that's a fact - as of a month ago
But now that the worst is over
I can just take it
But now that the worst is over
I can just take it
But now that the worst is over
I can just take it back",Take It Back
Aimee Mann,"Guess I got what I deserved
Kept you waiting there too long my love
All that time without a word
Didn't know you'd think that I'd forget
I'd regret

[Chorus:]
The special love I had for you
My baby blue

All those days became so long
Did you really think I'd do you wrong
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize that I would know
I would show

[Chorus]

What can I do?
What can I say?
Except I want you by my side
How can I show you?
Show me a way
Don't you know the times I've tried

Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feeling just grows stronger every day
Just one thing before I go
Take good care baby, and let me know
Let it grow

The special love you had for me
My Dixie dear",Baby Blue
Aimee Mann,"You see me as a judge
Though I deny it
And hold me like a grudge
Then justify it
But when you take such pains
In searching for something that explains
Please take a good look at our remains

[Chorus]
'Cause if you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And maybe there's room for compromise
But signs that I get say otherwise
Say anything 'cause I've heard everything

As hopeless as it seems
I wouldn't worry
You'll get your chance to tell
Your side of the story
While you're raising your right hand,
Whatever defenses you had planned,
Remember that when you take the stand

[Chorus]

If you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And though I'd be happy to believe
I'd have to be much more naive

Say anything, (I've heard everything)
Yeah say anything, (I've heard everything)
Now I've heard everything (now I've heard everything)
Now I've heard everything (now I've heard everything) 
So why do I refuse
The truth, when I clearly cannot use
The comfort of one more lame excuse

[Chorus]

'Cause if you were everything you say 
Things would be different today
And if you were everything you swear
We wouldn't be beyond repair

[Chorus]

If you were everything you say
Things would be different today
And if there has got to be an if
Get it over with
Say anything, 'cause I've heard everything
Now I've heard everything (now I've heard everything)
Now I've heard everything

Aimee Mann,"Shall we agree that just this once
I'm gonna change my life
Until it's just as tiny or
Important as you like
And in time, we won't even recall that we spoke
Words that turned out to be as big as smoke
Like smoke, disappears in the air
There's always something smouldering somewhere

[Chorus:]
I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh, it sure made a difference to me
You'll see me off in the distance, I hope
At the other end
At the other end of the telescope

There was a time not long ago
I dreamt that the world was flat
And all the colors bled away
And that was that
And in time, I could only believe in one thing
The sky was just phosphourus stars hung on strings
And you swore that they'd always be mine
When you can pull them down anytime

[Chorus:]

There, there baby now, don't say a word
Lie down baby, your vision is blurred
Your head is so sore from all of that thinking
I don't want to hurt you now
But I think you're shrinking (I think you're skrinking)

You're half-naked ambition and
You're half out of your wits
And though your wristwatch always works
Your necktie never fits

Now its so hard to pick the receiver up
And when I call, I never noticed you could be so small
The answer was under your nose
But the question never arose

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh, it sure made a difference to me
When you find me here at the end of my rope
When the head and heart of it finally elope

You can see us off in the distance, I hope
At the other end
At the other end of the telescope",The Other End (Of the Telescope) [Live]
Aimee Mann,"Nothing was saving our day
There was nothing to say,
But you said something anyway
Claiming I stepped out of line
Which forced you to leave me
As if that idea was mine.

Oh, you stupid thing
Speaking of course as your dear departed
Oh, you stupid thing
It wasn't me that you
Outsmarted
Oh, you stupid thing
Stopping it all
Before it even started.

I bet you knew it would come
That's just like you, to sit back
And just play it dumb
One word of warning would help
But that sacrifice was made
Trying to save yourself

Oh, you stupid thing
Speaking of course as your dear departed
Oh, you stupid thing
It wasn't me that you
Outsmarted
Oh, you stupid thing
Stopping it all
Before it even started.

Maybe that's just how I am
To fall where I stand, or
I'm weak for that kind of man
One who looks helpless and brave
But you turned into a coward
I don't care for the parts you saved.

You stupid thing
Speaking of course as your dear departed
Oh, you stupid thing
It wasn't me that you outsmarted
Oh, you stupid thing.",Stupid Thing
Aimee Mann,"Today's the fourth of July
Another June has gone by
And when they light up our town I just think
What a waste of gunpowder and sky

I'm certain I am alone
In harboring thoughts of our home
It's one of my faults that I can't quell my past
I ought to have gotten it gone
I ought to have gotten it

Oh, baby, I wonder if when you are older
Someday
You'll wake up
And say, 'My God, I should have told her
What would it take
But, now here I am and the world's gotten colder
And she's got the river down which I sold her'

So that's today's memory lane
With all the pathos and pain
Another chapter in a book where the chapters are endless
And they're always the same
A verse, and a verse, and refrain

Oh, baby, I wonder if when you are older
Someday
You'll wake up
And say, 'My God, I should have told her
What would it take
But, now here I am and the world's gotten colder
And she's got the river down which I sold her
And she's got the river down which I sold her",4th of July
Aimee Mann,"Its so hard not to blame you
Its hard not to put all the blame on you
cause you knew from the start
There was one little part you would not let through
Im sure there were even moments when you thought
You might someday finish what you'd begun,
But that could've been anyone

Could've been anyone
I lost my place in the sun
Well, never mind
It could've been anyone.

So we all make mistakes
It just figures you'd make me the biggest one
I was saving it up
Now its spent and I don't know
What I spent it on
Now I find if you try hard enough
You can wear it down til its just about gone,
til you could've been anyone

You could've been anyone
Lost your place in the sun
Well, never mind
Could've been anyone.

Your pattern is different
Than what it implies
The words may be true but
I realize
It isn't description so much as disguise.
Don't worry, you can learn to live without
You've got a lifetime of that to draw upon
And anyway

It could've been anyone
You lost your place in the sun
Lost your place in the sun
Oh, you lost your place in the sun
Well, never mind
It could've been anyone
Never mind
Never mind

Aimee Mann,"(one, two)
In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye
No guts to sever so forever may we wave good-bye
And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move
When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove
I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book
So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook
By saying there is no use changing
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are

Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
What's the matter with the truth did I offend your ears
By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try
Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy
It's not like you would lose some critical piece
If somehow you moved point A to point be	
Maintaining there is no point Changing
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are

Now I could talk to you 'til I'm blue in the face
But we still would arrive at the very same place
With you running around and me out of the race
So maybe you're right nobody can take
Something older than time and hope you could make
It better that would be a mistake

So take it just so far
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are
That's just what you are

Acting steady always ready
To defend your fears
(that's just what you are)
What's the matter with the truth
Did I offend your ears
(that's just what you are)

You're like a sleepwalking man
It's a danger to wake you
(that's just what you are)
Even when it is apparent
Where your actions will take you

(that's just what you are)
And that's just what you are
(that's just what you are)
And that's just what you are
(that's just what you are)
That's just what you are ?",That's Just What You Are
Aimee Mann,"(And if this is one of your ten thousand dollar hours
Don't forget to write it down
Help is on the way)

Skip the cloak and dagger bit
Don't you know we're sick of it
As much as I would like to stay
The message light just blinks away
And while I'm here you won't push play

[Chorus]
So you leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no

Option to indulge in this
Exercise in cowardice
Ignorance without the bliss

[Chorus]

Cause I know where this boat will go
Pulled down by the undertow
It's lucky I know
How to row

So row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
I hope you drown and never come up

[Chorus]",Choice in the Matter
Aimee Mann,"(I still have the shake in my voice
And I'm going to sing you this song)

I don't know you from Adam, it could make my day
If you leave me a message I'll give it away
'Cause the most perfect strangers that you can talk to
Are the ones who pretend that you're not really you

Are with any attempts here to play Frankenstein
Come with plenty of chances for changing your mind
When you're building your own creation
Nothing's better than real than a real
Imitation

I won't find it fantastic or think it absurd
When the gun in the first act goes off in the third
'Cause it's rare that you ever know what to expect
From a guy made of corpses with bolts in his neck

If the creature is limping the parts are in place
With a mind of its own and a fist for a face
Say hello to your new creation
Now it's better than real
It's a real imitation

You may wonder what the catch is
As we batten down the hatches

And when later we find that the thing we devised
Has the villagers clamoring for it's demise
We will have to admit the futility of
Trying to make something more of this jerry-built love

And you'll notice it bears a resemblance to
Everything I imagined I wanted from you
But at least it's my own creation
And it's better than real
It's a real imitation",Frankenstein
Aimee Mann,"All you want to do is something good
So get ready to be ridiculed and misunderstood
'Cause don't you know that you're a fucking freak in this world
In which everybody's willing to choose swine over pearls

And maybe everything is all for nothing
Still you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause God knows it's not safe with anybody else

You can take your own advice and try again
But a thousand compromises don't add up to a win
And they'd be happy if you'd only cover your tracks
But the trail of crumbs you've left won't help you find your way back

So maybe everything is all for nothing
Still you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause God knows it's not safe with anybody else
God knows it's not safe with anybody else

You can play along, but you'll just end up wrong somehow, won't you

But you're the idiot who keeps believing in luck
And you just can't get it through your head that no one else gives a fuck

So maybe everything is all for nothing
Still you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause God knows it's not safe with anybody else
God knows it's not safe with anybody else

God knows it's not safe with anybody else
It's not safe with anybody else
God knows it's not safe with anybody else

But you're the idiot who keeps believing in luck

Aimee Mann,"(Five six seven fifty)
You fucked it up
You should've quit
Till circumstances
Had changed a bit

You fucked it up
You jumped the gun
I swore you off but
You climbed back on

And when you said
Of course you know
Could I be blamed
If I'd wished it so
I don't think so

You fucked it up

Aimee Mann,"Ray, as of today
I can't say things will ever be the same
And that could be a shame
'Cause though I think I know
Another lonely exile when I see one
And you appear to be one

I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found
If you've got it to spare
I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel
'Cause I ought to be there
And Ray, what can I say
You don't know me and it's just wishful thinking
To keep myself from sinking
And hence, no evidence
To support any theory I have handy
That you could understand me
And so
I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found

If you've got it to spare
I'm playing it cool but it's terribly cruel
'Cause I ought to be there

And Ray, can we repay
Ourselves for days that we've
lost through indecision
With one of recognition
If so, then here I go
'Cause some things you know
And some you just believe in
And hope it comes out even
I'm playing it down 'cause I could really be found

And with college out of reach

Aimee Mann,"You know just how I feel
You know when love is real
It changes the life that you're living
And now I've found it here
It overcomes my fear
Of holding back instead of giving
But, when I hear the phone ring
Your voice pulls me in 'til I'm far away
It's easy cause everything's different now

[Chorus:]
Everything's different now
Seems long ago that our love was unknown
But it's just yesterday
Everything's different now
Everything's different now
And when I look in the mirror and talk to myself
I can't pretend it's the same

Well, soon I'll say your name
And then I'll go insane
I won't understand what I'm thinking
I'll look down at my shoes
I'll wonder what I'll lose
If I feel this consciousness sinking
And we both know what that means
Returning to what we knew before
Forgetting that everything's different now

[Chorus]

What we created
Has separated
A past we hated
From what we are feeling today
'Cause everything's different now

Well hope may live but passion lies
Upon your lips scratched out in blue

But all of the stars in the darkness-

Past your window, tears will come, do you
Whose eyes refuse to see, pass the test of history
But all of the stars in the darkness-

Aimee Mann,"She was married to somebody else
I was lonely and lived by myself
Baby, that's a battle you can't win
So we met and we started the clock
Did that help -- no it did not
But I guess I knew that going in
And watched the sweeping second hand

But at least I was calm
On the road to the big observatory
Where the planets were hung
And the stars swung around the second story
And we stumbled upon
A room where a luminous moon was waning
And I knew I had leapt into the great beyond
But at least I was calm

Fun is fun, but when push comes to shove
When it's done, we'll deny it was love
She will say Jim -- this was a mistake
And the room where we looked at the sky
Will be there with its telescope eye
Just another sentry kept awake
Watching over silverlake

But at least I was calm
On the road to the big observatory
Where the planets were hung
And the stars swung around the second story
And we stumbled upon
A room where a luminous moon was waning
And I knew I had leapt into the great beyond
But at least I was calm

And you'll be glad to leave with dignity intact
She won't be sad so much as matter-of-fact
Like it was doomed and hopeless as a suicide pact

But at least I was calm
On the road to the big observatory
Where the planets were hung
And the stars swung around the second story

In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye
No guts to sever so forever may we wave good-bye
And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move
When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove
I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book
So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook
By saying there is no use changing
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are

Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
What's the matter with the truth did I offend your ears
By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try
Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy
It's not like you would lose some critical piece
If somehow you moved point A to point be	
Maintaining there is no point Changing
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are

Now I could talk to you 'til I'm blue in the face
But we still would arrive at the very same place
With you running around and me out of the race
So maybe you're right nobody can take
Something older than time and hope you could make
It better that would be a mistake

So take it just so far

From Satan's power and might.""

Rejoiced much in mind,

Just like the ones I used to know 
Where the treetops glisten, 
and children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow 

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white 

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white 
",White Christmas
Aimee Mann,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland.",Winter Wonderland
Aimee Mann,"You're a mean one, Mr Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch!
You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch!
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul
Mr. Grinch!
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch!
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile
Mr. Grinch!
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch!
You're a nasty, wasty skunk!
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk
Mr. Grinch!
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote
""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch!
You're the king of sinful sots!
Your heart's a dead tomato
Splotched with moldy, purple spots
Mr. Grinch!
Your soul is an apalling dump-heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful 
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled-up in tangled-up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch!
With a nauseous super naus!
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss
Mr. Grinch!
You're a three-decker sauerkraut 
And toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce!","You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"
Aimee Mann,"The day you left and you called me bitch
I called you selfish better pull that switch
Put my son on amphetamines
He came home crying and there's your proof
Crying 'bout nothing but a missing tooth

I did the right thing

You shade the truth almost everyday
Phone calls at night ""it's going to be ok""
Are you saddened baby under the bridge?
Are you saddened baby on Lake Street

[Chorus]
Black marker on cardboard
Little drawing of a medicine wheel
Everything that's good you steal
Everything that's good you steal

Maybe you'll wake up in jail alone
And hold the handle of the one pay phone
And do the right thing
Like I once tried but I bent the truth

A five dollar dent for a little lost tooth
There's a payback in front of me
Because once you were like a walking high
Breaking in motion through the parking lot

Are you saddened baby under the bride
Are you saddened baby on Lake Street

[Chorus]

Words of encouragement are just as real
Saving my faith does have a smooth group appeal

Are you saddened baby under the bridge
Are you saddened baby on Lake Street

Aimee Mann,"Got out of Phoenix, just in time
A box of Kleenex, for the ride
The tumbleweeds said, their goodbyes
To javelinas and DUIs

I don't want to abandon you but baby I've had my fill
You love me like a dollar bill
You roll me up and trade me in
And if you had the chance you will
And if you get the chance again

It's hard to know when to cut and run
You balance heartache with your fun
And when the scales tip, you know you're done

I don't want to abandon you but baby I've had my fill
You love me like a dollar bill
You roll me up and trade me in
And if you had the chance you will

Aimee Mann,"Nightly, you retrace your steps again to return to the scene of the crime
It's uncanny how you hover in the air of the wreckage that you left behind

[Chorus]
I want you but you're a poltergeist
I want you but baby the price is high
I want you and now I've said it twice so Mary dim the lights

Really when you come into the room it's not helping me, seeing you down
It's not easy in this phosphorescent gloom telling waking dreams apart anyhow

Tossing your hand

Cause I live it with you
I'm living a lie, a lie can't tell
So wait for the crack in the shell

Know that there's a, I've been avoiding yes
Just past his prime
Building his cage, a bar at a time
For every hope I'm as a cold shoulder
Waiting to turn
People to blame
We're just 2 birds
 
I'm living a lie,
You're living it too
Cause I live it with you
I'm living a lie, a lie can't tell
So wait for the crack in the shell

But girl around, do the time on your ground
Is the shakiest leaf on the tree
Creating for you a song or two
Or now and I'll admit all achieves
Now there's too many cooks
But you like how it looks
When they're bowing and calling it bothers
But the powers that were invested in her
And now any means taken, lost

Aimee Mann,"What a waste of a smoke machine
Took the taste of the dopamine
And left me high and dry

Call the cops, call the cavalry
Spin the tops that'll dazzle me
And give me a new supply

There's a layer below, underneath all the layers that I knew
So I pay when you go but it only convinces me that you are
Good for me
Good for

Just a little bit of what I need
To soothe an appetite that I can't feed
Isn't that good for me?

Accessorizing before the fact
Alibis couldn't stay intact
As guilty as a gun

So you dig, so you move some earth
Tunnel down out of Leavenworth
Or set the fuse and run

Blasting deep underground, getting down to the Continental Shelf
I'll pretend I'm surprised by the lies that I'm telling to myself
That you're good for me
Good for me
Good for

Under cover of your rifle fire
I slipped the traces and I tripped the wire
Isn't that good for me?

The rotors kicking up debris
The cloud, the dust, the blades are me

Every look is a truce and it's written in stone

Gotta keep it together when your friends come by
Always checking the weather but they wanna know why
Even birds of a feather find it hard to fly

Thought I saw at my feet an origami crow
It was only the street hidden under the snow
Always snatching defeat, it's the devil I know

Takes a miracle to heal this break and now

I put my hand up on the plexiglass
And scan your face, to see if you're in there

They leave no trace, like you've never been there

Leather books and surplus government chairs
I rose like smoke, or the steam from your cup
A wave of heat where the lighter flares

You might have found some other reason
To burn me like a tissue screen
My heart is a poor judge
And it harbors an old grudge

Falling for you was a walk off a cliff
A dream of a car with the brake lines cut
The only way you can stop it is if
You turn around, keep the windows shut

You might have found some other reason
To leave me in that dark ravine
My heart is a poor judge
And it harbors an old grudge

And I can see your light on
Calling me back to make the same mistake again

And I'll say no, when you ask me, no, when you ask me, no when you ask again
'Cause I won't let it past me, won't let it past me 
Won't let it past til I see that I'm last and then

Falling for you was a last ditch plan
You sized me up with your thumb on the scale
I came up short, but you do what you can
The hammer's nothing without the nail

To lead me to the guillotine

Woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

In Trinidad there was a family
With much confusion as you will see
There was a mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to marry and have a wife of his own

He met a young girl who suited him nice
He went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said, ""Son, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

A week went by and the summer came down
And soon another girl on the island, he found
He went to his papa to name the day
His papa shook his head and this time he did say

""You can't marry this girl, I have to say no
That girl is your aunty but your granny don't know

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

Now, he went to his mama and covered his head
He told his mama what his papa had said
His mama, she laughed, she said, ""Go man, go
Your daddy ain't your daddy but your daddy don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

Hey, worries, it worries me, shame and scandal in the family

The blues was pouring out of me""

The hard work in the cotton fields
I was imagining in my cocoon

You smile at my answer,
You've given me the chance,
To be held and understood.

You leave me laughing without crying,
There's no use denying,
For many times I've tried,
Love has never felt as good.

When your heart's pounding,
You know that I'm aware.

You make it easy to watch the world with love,
You make it easy to let the past be done,

How'd you find me?

How can this be true?

'Cause blessings are deserved

Air,"Everyone dated the demise of our neighborhood
From the suicide of the Lisbon girls.
People saw their clairvoyance
In the wiped-out elms and harsh sunlight.
Some thought the torture tearing the Lisbon girls
Pointed to a simple refusal  to accept the world
As it was handed down to them, so full of flaws.
But the only thing we are certain of
After all these years, is the insufficiency of explanations. 

Obviously doctor,
You've never been a thirteen year-old girl.

The Lisbon girls were thirteen,
Cecile, fourteen, Lux, fifteen, Bonnie, sixteen, Mary, and seventeen, Therese.
No one could understand how Mrs. Lisbon and Mr. Lisbon,
A math  teacher, had produced such beautiful creatures. 

From that time one, the Lisbon house began to change.
Almost every day, and even when she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,
Lux would suntan on her towel wearing a swimsuit
That caused the knife-sharpener to give her a fifteen minute demonstration for free. 

The only reliable boy who got to know Lux was Trip Fontaine
For only 18 months before the suicides had emerged from baby fat
To the delight of girls and mothers alike. 

But few anticipated it would be so drastic.
The girls were pulled out of school,
And Mrs. Lisbon shut the house for maximum security isolation.
The girls' only contact to the outside world
Was through the catalogs they ordered
That started to fill the Lisbon's mailbox
With pictures of high-end fashions and brochures for exotic vacations.
Unable to go anywhere, the girls traveled in their imaginations
To gold-tipped Siamese temples or past an old man,
The leaf broom tidying the Maw's carpeted speck of Japan ?
And Cecelia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta

Collecting everything we could of theirs,
We couldn't get the Lisbon girls out of our minds,
But they were slipping away.
The colors of their eyes were fading,
Along with exact locations of moles and dimples.
From five, they had become four,
And they were all (the living and the dead), become shadows.
We would have lost them completely if the girls hadn't contacted us. 

Lux was the last to go.
Fleeing from the house, we forgot to stop at the garage.
After the suicide free-for-all,
Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.
They had Mr. Henry pack up the house,
Selling what furniture he could at a garage sale.
Everyone went just to look.
Our parents did not buy used furniture,
And they certainly didn't buy furniture tainted by death.
We of course took the family photos that were put out with the trash.
Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market,
And it was sold to a young couple from Boston. 

It didn't matter in the end how old they had been,
Or that they were girls.
But only that we had loved them,
And that they hadn't heard us call, still did not hear us.
Calling out of those rooms where they went to be alone for all time,
Alone in suicide.
Which is deeper than death,
And where we will never find the pieced to put them back together.",Suicide Underground

One of our lives will be over
Brocade waistcoat catches glints of morning light
Silk damask swathed in bottle green memories

We've traveled from station to station
We now approach our final destination
The only way to awake you was to slap your face
So stand up straight and let me take on final taste of you

Before we walk the agreed number of paces
And turn to face our fate
The coup de grace delivered so delicately
You always had such exquisite taste

Morning sky stretched tight as a drum
Tension released in an instant
Brocade waistcoat flecked with blood in the golden light
You were dead before you even hit the ground

Watch all trace of color draining from your face

Leaking those secrets, but put the past away

Make it slap when I've got to go
To the spot when it's hot & cold
And I'm tryna move on but I've got to know

They travelled, these two Indians,
To find some peace of mind
They stood for love and freedom

They swore they would change it
with loving and shareing
They'll never live like their parents have done

And she has trouble sleeping

Now they've got nothing to say to each other
Too far apart to discuss their mistakes
They filed for divorce and it breaks their

Ah - American hearts

Prepared to live those sleepless nights
For precious time in paradise

I tried for it all
She never heard me call at all

There's no regrets, we made the choice
We listened to that silent voice
That haunts you 'til you just give in
And makes you like a child again

We drifted close then said goodbyes
Just reading well each other's eyes
The world had turned while we stood still
And held on to each other

And in between the right and wrong
Is somewhere that sometimes you can belong

the door
And never told me why

I'm black and blue because of you

You walked away from me
Leaving me all black and blue

You, you used to sleep by my side
You swore you had nothing to hide
And now there's nothing left to lose

Night, night after long endless night
You swore you had nothing to hide
And I was so naive to believe your lies

I'm black and blue because of you
I feel like I've been beaten
You walked away from me
Leaving me all black and blue

Down in the depths of your soul
I hear the echo and the sigh that your secrets
can not hide
They never lie to me

Night, night after long endless night
You swore you had nothing to hide
And I was so naive to believe your lies

I'm black and blue because of you
I feel like I've been beaten
You walked away from me
Leaving me all black and blue

Broken in two because of you
I feel like I've been beaten

I'd like another day with you

Don't want to know where it ends

Just tell me what I have to do.

Where is the joy time forgets
You ask me if I know

Up on a breeze soaring high
It comes alive each day

Don't you feel the heat of the night deep inside,

I'll run back to your side
Just where I used to be, Oh Jane

Say we'll be together once more
Please open the door, Oh Jane

Will we ever learn how to love
Learn how to love and let go


When the time is right
I will come back for you
With arms to hold you tight

Because I believe the heat of the night is still burning bright

Tell me if you want me to go
I'll leave you alone, Oh Jane.

I wish I knew how love could be so blind

If that's what it takes to prove myself to you

I understand my life has lost control
What would I do without your love to hold
Nobody knows how much I've come alive
All that I have to give, I give to you from deep inside

I'd give you my heart and soul (I'd give you my heart and soul)
If that's what it takes to prove myself to you
I'd give you my heart and soul (I'd give you my heart and soul)

Air Supply,"Pictures of you race across my mind
Filling all the space there is to find
Melting love's own ice that lay so frozen
I give that sacrifice for feeling chosen


So if I face another day without you next to me
I'll lock you in my mind and wish away the key


CHORUS
Hope springs eternal when you're near
All the passion reappears
All emotion seems so strong


Hope springs eternal through your eyes
Draws me closer to your side
And keeps me there where I belong


Given back the trust that was so fleeting
Captured by one my heart was seeking
Taken to my destiny's horizon
Searching for the moon we see it rising


And in the silence of the night, I hold you next to me
Feeling dreams take flight, they set the spirit free


CHORUS


",Hope Springs Eternal
Air Supply,"(graham russell)

When the shadows spread their wings and chase the day away
The time that is for love I know is near
The mystery we feel will soon surround us
The journey of both laughter and a tear

Sweet memories we make will be forever now
The voices from the past will understand
Waiting for the smile that cuts into me
The fragrance of your hair borne on the wind


(chorus # 1)
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
What is between us is more than your caress
It's more than I would dare confess
I know it to be true
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
Don't you remember the panic of our love
We've risen high above it now
I owe it all to you
I'd die for you, I'd die for you


The flames that born as one in time may fall away
The glow that is within will never die
To live without you now, I cannot understand
To live with out you I could not survive


(chorus # 2)
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
What is between us is more than your caress
It's more than I would dare confess
I know it to be true
I'd die for you, I'd die for you
Don't you remember the vision of our love
We've risen high above it now


Whenever you hold me the cycle is complete
The secret of eternal love is laid right at our feet


(repeat chorus # 1)
",I'd Die for You
Air Supply,"I know you're leaving
I won't ask you to stay
I won't hold you back
I won't stand in your way
If that's what you've gotta do, I understand

It's not that easy setting you free
But that's how it's gotta be
And as you're walking away
As I'm watching you go
There's one thing I want you to know

Just remember my heart's with you
When the night gets so long and cold
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone
Take a moment to think of me
And the love that we used to know
And if you ever find you ever need me someday
I'm just a heartbeat away

Saying goodbye isn't saying were through
Just know through it all I'm still here for you
Light a light in the window
When your lost in the dark, ooh

These arms would be happy to hold you again
If ever you miss me or when you
Start thinking about
All the nights that we shared
Darling, you know Ill be there

Just remember my heart's with you
When the night gets so long and cold
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone
Take a moment to think of me
And the love that we used to know
And if you ever find you ever need me someday

You walk to the door with nothing to say
I look in your eyes and you look away
You're leaving me now, but darling, I hope
Hope that you'll look back someday

And remember my hearts with you
When the night gets so long and cold
And no one's there to hold when you're all alone
Baby, take a moment to think of me
And the love that we used to know
And if you ever find that you're all alone

Just remember my heart's with you
When the night gets so long and cold
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone

And the love that we used to know
And if you ever find that you're all alone
",My Heart's With You
Air Supply,"I don't need money and possessions
I don't need things to weigh me down
I don't need to be under suspicion
For all the things that never come around
All I need is you and your affection
To be a part of everything you do
To break through a lost communication
To let me know that everything is true


CHORUS
Put love in your life, find it today and hold me tonight
You know there will always be me
There will always be you
Put love in your life, open your heart it won't be denied
The one you thought could not be
Is waiting for you


I don't need anxiety to hold me
In the name of something to embrace
I don't need society to scald me
To pin me down and slap me in the face
All I need is you and your affection
To be the judge and jury in my life
Searching for that moment of perfection
To let me know we surely are alive

The puzzled look the years of doubt
It all was meant to be
We can't escape the dreams we make
This feeling now just cannot wait 
So share it with me


",Put Love in Your Life
Air Supply,"We are civilized and free from all confusion
And yet we always worry for the things that we can't see
But now to give your love away, a miracle in motion
You know what seems invisible will never ever be disguised to me


I start to lose control
I start to lose control


CHORUS
I know I will remember for longer than forever
All the love and the stars in your eyes
Until my arms surround you and build the world around you
All I see are the stars in your eyes


First you hear the angels sing and then you see the wedding ring
Shining as the threads of life so secretly are woven
You know what you've found, you want to last forever
You heart has found its wings and left for never never


And then I lose control
I start to lose control

I know I will remember for longer than forever
All the love and the stars in your eyes

Here I am playing with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me

Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside

So thereâ??s no sense pretending
My heart itâ??s not mending

[Chorus]

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby those memories come crashing through
And I just canâ??t go on without

On my own Iâ??ve tried to make the best of it alone
Iâ??ve done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain

I just canâ??t live without you
I miss everything about you

[Chorus]

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby those memories come crashing through

Don't confuse strength with pride and mud

I'm not afraid to face the truth of what I believe
If love was never meant to choose, it could never succeed
And we may always stand alone in everyone's sight
And be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right
Who puts a price on eternity's sin
Who throws the first stone shall search for perfection again

Standing face to face the words just fall away
But in my loneliness I knew just what to say
Did he touch you where I touched you long ago

So don't tell me
Don't tell me
Don't tell me
Don't tell me

I have no room to share
I know the road I follow going nowhere

Don't tell me
Don't tell me
Don't tell me

Should I close my eyes and say I'm giving up
Can we compromise the darker side of love
Did he hold you like I held you once before
Since I lost your love I need you even more
Don't tell me lies

I have no more to give you
I have no room to share

Is it saying goodbye

When we believe our reality
In the words that we say
We're all searching for sanity
Till it drives us away
To that place in the wilderness
In the deep of your mind
You remember the happiness
Wasn't easy to find
Why do we spend time alone
Why don't we end nights together
Isn't it time to come home

I can't stop the rain from falling
Do what you must do
I can only hope to share
The pain I gave to you
Gave to you
We can climb to another world
If we never look down
We can join in the avalanche
And be thrown to the ground
If I'm still a part of your life
Come lay your head on my pillow
And tell me to hold you tonight

A long time ago, from the valley of the sun
Came the holy power,
When the gods were one
Searching for a new home,
Searching for this land
Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen
The pillars of the temple,
In these hills of green
Buried deep inside for only us to find

(chorus)
It is the roar of the wind,
The power of the sun
The strength of a thousand bows
And those who near it again, will fear it again
And it's here in the heart of the rose
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake
All that lay within you,
As this dawn should break
With this force awoken, none can stand before
This is the hour, now is the time
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine
All that we must be, is everything we see


(chorus)
Our love, has brought us both together
And it's our love that will go on forever
There is no love that can become as one
Before it's time

It is the trees in the earth,
It is the rivers that run
And through us this secret flows
And now our destiny calls,
You'll remember it all

You didn't have to be so mad
When you ran across the road
The light alone soon told me
You had a heavy load
But I can't see why you didn't stay
Why you didn't come to see if I felt
The same way
And I do, and I do
I never asked for any comfort
To take up your time
But now I feel so very different
I need to make you mine
And I want to take what you have to
Give me
And bring you the words that fall
From my head
And I will, and I will

And always will
Know you better than you think
And always will, always will

And always will, always will

I'll always need a friend
One I can defend
All I've got to give
Is do you want to live
With me every day till I pass away
I've been sitting here
Frightened stiff with fear
Love has brought it on
And it must go on
Being here with you,
Taking what is mine
Just between the lines
And here we are, here we are
All alone for me to take
And here you are, here you are
All alone for me to take
Fell in love today
Little words to say
Let us close the door
That's what doors are for
Being here with you

I never saw it happen
I never saw the flame
I never new how much there was
To lose and gain
But when the sun was taken
You never shone so bright
And from a place we'd long forgotten
The blind were given sight
If there's one thing I must do
It's to say I love you to
It's the one thing I'm so sure of

If I hold you now from my point of view
Will you show me how to be close to you
If the dawn should break and you're
Far away
Can you ever know what I need to say
I can see how much I was taking it all
For granted
Among the silent victims
Only the wind would moan
And for a time I felt us touch
The great unknown
For that eternal moment
Oh what a price to pay
With nothing left but all we have
We slowly walked away
If there's one thing I must do
It's to say I love you too
It's the one thing I'm so sure of

So give life to your dreams
For there lies your survival
And cast your heart beyond those
Faded scenes
And I'll bring you through that storm
Yes I'll bring you back

This desire in my heart
Born from out of the wind,
Left alone in the dark
Sow the desolate plain,
New horizons to share
All my eden divide,
Generations to share

Don't stop, it feels so familiar
Stay here and show me a new sunrise
You know I want you,
Can the innocent survive
And if I love you, can we touch to stay alive

With a wave of my hand
All direction is cast
From the woman and man

",All That You Want

Where we walk tall, or in disgrace
Who tills the ground on which we tread
Who gives us all our daily bread
The spirit woken from its sleep
The demon stirring from the deep
Whose gates at dawn we all must pass
The last one first, the first one last
Whose words must be both black and white
Whose music shall be day and night
The moon that tells us of the sun
Where voices soar so far above
These pages are the book of love


If we were born just to succeed
If life was meant to be a choice
For either happiness or greed
If you can't walk, you'll always run
Away from anyone, yes you will


But if we learn to take our time
As though each moment is a treasure
That's not so hard to find
When you are free, then suddenly
There's room for everyone, yes there is

Those shadows fall upon us all
And send our weary eyes to sleep
But when you wake, your heart will make
Some room for everyone

I'll always be right here
I tell you now
Your heart is where I live
And what you ask, is what I'll give

 Your heart is calling out
 You want to let me in, to let me in

 Your lips are silent now, we're not alone

 I'd like to take you home
 So I can make love to you

 I believe in you so
 And there's only one moment to live
 When you're here next to me
 There's so much more I have to give

 When the wind blows
 There's nothing else you can run to
 Let's stay together tonight
 I'm waiting for you
 All the words that I told you
 Will always be true
 Let's stay together tonight
 Whatever we do

 Why must I keep pretending
 I'm in control
 When I can feel your senses
 Burning through my soul
 Through my soul

 And there's only one moment to live
 When you're here next to me

Air Supply,"Mother said, don't leave me
There are monsters at the door
I put on all my armour
But I couldn't find my sword
But there'll always be tomorrow
Just you wait and see
If they come to take you prisoner
I'll be there to set you free


Mother said, I'm grown up
In a Sunday shirt and tie
As long as I can see you
Can I hold you when I cry
There'll always be tomorrow
I'll be so big and strong
I'll sleep with all the lights out
Not afraid of anyone


I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you
I need you


Mother said she's sleeping
So I climbed back into bed
But the monsters took her prisoner
That's all that father said
So I thought about tomorrow
And I learned to be alone
Making friends with shadows
As they moved around my home


Mother never leaves me
I can always see her smile


I sit here in the evening
To talk to her awhile
There'll always be tomorrow
Just you wait and see
I know that any moment
She will come to set me free


I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you
I need you


I need you to stay
I need you to stay
I need you
I need you

",Once
Air Supply,"Another day has come and gone
They fade away like winter sun
I should have felt, what I I didn't see
I should have known, that you needed me


But now you're here
My heart is young, my mind is clear
The past was gone, when you came to me
You were always a part of my destiny


I always believed, that this day had to come
There was not enough time
And too much left undone
I could never deny
Just how far we had come


I've got so much love
So much love
So much love
So much love


Another day to spend with you
That's all I ask, just to be with you
And how I feel, you just don't know
And now you're here, I won't let you go


I always believed, that this day had to come
There was not enough time
And too much left undone
I could never deny
Just how far we had come


I've got so much love

",So Much Love
Air Supply,"All the people in the world
Distant voices to be heard
Sacred rhythm shall make you free
Dance together, unity
From creation, the mask of God
Inspiration is all we've got
Hidden knowledge, can't get enough,
Taking chances, making love


Face to face with the moment of truth,
All those little white lies
We the people, we the people decide


We the people, shedding skin
Age of reason lies within
Explanation, the club of Rome
Meditation, and staying home
Moving forward, the chosen few
Teach your children what is new
Band the table, beat the drum
New messiah, overcome


Face to face with the moment of truth,
All those little white lies

Air Supply,"I just saw a picture, from the lost and found
It was taken the day that we met
With so many people around

All my false bravado seemed to disappear
So I just had to follow my heart
I knew it would take me somewhere

And I still feel the same
But it's heart to explain
All my emotions are tossed in the wind
Lost 'til the moment, I hold you again

When I say I love you
When I say I need you
When you say come closer
I know I'll never leave you

You can stare into heaven
When your heart is free
I suppose that we just couldn't wait
For heaven is where we must be

And we still feel the same
No need to explain
I don't see the shadows
I don't feel the rain
I'm walking in sunlight
I'll tell you again

When I say I want you
When I say I need you
When you say come closer
I know I'll never leave you
When I say I love you

I know I'll never leave you",When I Say

To the borders of my country
Will you make those promises come true
Will you always want to hold me

Would you ever walk away from love
Will your lips speak what is true
If you say that this is where you belong
That's all I want, from you


In the garden of my deepest soul
Is the seed to bring the future
It's the story that is young and old
And the student is the teacher

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy 
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to 92

Merry Christmas to you

For the dreams and the plans made in your youth
Does the thrill to achieve match the warm hidden feeling
That lies so still and lives in you


In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child


You've found the place to walk the path you've chosen
You'll never miss the world you left behind
When life gives life, it's happiness unbroken
When you give love, it's love you'll find


In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child


In the eyes of a child, there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future

And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am

Are we still so far away
And how can I share it with you

It's not easy to believe
Are we both about to leave
Without ever saying, I do
I still love you

Just make me part of the scene
Say we're together, always forever
And everything else in between

Just say we're part of the scene

If things weren't as good as they seem

You can say I'm not the one
That a lot of faith has gone
The bridges were never quite crossed

Every grain of truth, we deny or prove
Is somewhere before it gets lost
And is found again

What if these feelings are all in my head
Flying around me in a world of their own
What if there's nothing that needs to be said

Air Supply,"Every since feeling now would take my life into a year ago
You say you love me again
I can't say what I cannot do
It's been too long without someone
How could you let me sink this far away from you
Now you're here wondering why you can't get near

I can't do anything with you
I can't get excited, can't get excited
You can see me look right through

I'm turning back the pages now
I pleaded with you all so many times
Trying just to make you see
Hoping that I might be the one
So come down love me and it'll be alright
The time to bring back love is not tonight
I never thought I'd have to say
that you should leave and go your way

Air Supply,"Stay with me only if your heart is free,
There's no sense if we can't see beyond how we feel.
Honestly, how do we know what we need?
What can we believe?, help me to know this is real.

(CHORUS)
If I give it all, if I give it all away.
We could have it all, we could have it all this way.
I should have said what I was thinking
Followed my heart, but it was sinking.

If you love me say that you love me,
I'll say I love you too.
If you love me say that you need me,
I'll give my love to you.

Broken dreams are never really what they seem,
Somewhere in between you can give all your troubles to me.
I don't know how far we are meant to go,
If you tell me so that is where I want to be.

We could have it all, we could have it all this way.

",If You Love Me
Air Supply,"There has to be a place for you and me
Where we can sleep and waters still run deep
And you're the one that sails into me
And you're the one whose lips are silent
You're the one that always said
There's only one forever
It brought us both together,
There's only one forever

You said to me, just give me honesty
And in return, I'll build your santuary
Long ago, that path was chosen
How could we not fall in love
Remember when we always said
There's only one forever
It brought us both together
There's only one forever

Air Supply,"WHO AM I

Who am I to understand
The ways of love a grain of sand
To fall between these fingers
That I hold

Who am I that you should trust
A wind that turns a stone to dust
A mountain to surrender all its gold

And who am I to say, you should believe in me

And who am I to say I love you
One reason why love cannot die
Tell me who am I

(DOUBLE VOICE)
Who am I, I never knew
My heart was roaming from or to
(I don't know where we are going to)
The different arms between my day and night
(All I want is just to be with you)

Who am I, a distant sun
A thought before the moment's gone
(Just a thought before the moment's gone)
And I will never let you from my side
(You will always be the only one)

And all I have to say you can believe in me

For who am I to say I love you
One reason why love cannot die
You are on my heart remembers
Tell me who am I

And who am I to say I love you
One reason why love can not die
Tell me who am I

For who am I to say I love you
One reason why love cannot die

Air Supply,"(Graham Russell)

Here's on the street
A tear in the seam
Of pleasure and pain
Life carries on
A cloak of deceit
Brings honour to shame
But the voice I used to know
(Where are you now?)
Is the one I can't let go

Chorus:
You are the reason
My faith in tomorrow
A Distant horizon
The one I must follow
You are the first, You are the last

I'help you to see
The light in the dark
The sun through the rain
Until you are free
And facing the truth
That words can't explain
But the truth I think you know(Tell me)
I could never let you go

Chorus

you are the future from the past
You are the spell that has been cast

You are the reason
My faith in tomorrow
A distant horizon
The one I must follow

You are the last to me

Something we need to see
Is it love, yes its love

You, you make me feel, this is all I need
And it's all so real
You help me understand, where I want to be

We can be in the shadow of the sun


Untie the sails, the shore will melt away
Without a trace, I hear the raven say
When it's love, this is love, when it's love
That we must know we must enter
This is love, this is love, only love
When the dove is descended


You are the winding stream going to somewhere
That we' ve never seen
You, are the dare to dream and the silent scream
And the final prayer


I can see to the shadow of the sun
We can be in the shadow of the sun
Reach out for the shadow of the sun
Cry out for the shadow of the sun
You are the colors of the wind
Singing hopes, eternal spring
In a symphony for every lonely year
You are the keeper of the key
And the one that longs to be
The light for each and every frozen tear

The taste of blood like a spear in my side
It?s no wonder I'm a driven soul
Why do you think I just lie here and get fucked
While you tell me that I'm undersold?

You should be scared in amongst desire
I'm a spark to set the truth from fire
Yes, I am, I'm here, I'm the Antichrist
I?ll be leaving alive, I?ll be leaving alive

Come on, come on
Can we break this place apart?
Come on, come on to me

In the lost summer sun
With her tight dress painted on
Fahrenheit 101
She got the long legs to prove it
The back end to move it
She's a XXX movie just walking by
Lip-gloss high heels I'm losing my mind
She's coming at me like a wrecking ball
Upstairs downstairs she got it all

She's blonde bad and beautiful

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

And even the palms seem to be swaying

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Aiza,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

I had sometimes been
I hurt you so badly

I gave you the heartache
But I felt the pain

How much I love you so

Promise that I'm here
I'll never be gone

And we can watch the stars shine

And baby you can be my love

No me quisiera acordar era una tarde de invierno
Cuando por su mala suerte cayo Valentín en manos del gobierno

El capitán le pregunta cuál es la gente
Que mandas son ochocientos soldados
Que tienen sitiada la hacienda de Holanda

El coronel le pregunta cuál es la gente
Que guías son ochocientos soldados
Que trae por la sierra Mariano mejía

Y así mueren los hombres mi amigo
Los que inventaron la revolución verdad de Dios y échele mi AK-7

El general le decía yo te concedo el indulto
Pero me vas a decir cual es en jurado la causa que juzgo
Valentín como era hombre de nada les dio razón
Yo soy de los meros hombres de los que inventaron la revolución

Madre mía de Guadalupe por tu religión me van a matar
Vuela y vuela, palomita párate en ese fortín

A cortar los vergelitos

Si Dios fuera justiciero
Apreciaría al que enamora
Y hasta la vida daría
De las leyes que hay ahora

Agua de las pilas nuevas
Donde se recrían las flores
Ya vinieron tus amantes
Ya vinieron tus amores
Aquí los tienes cerquita
Ya no pedirás amores

Cupido como valiente
Quítame esta vida ingrata
Yo te pido de favor
Que la dagacia de plata
Para morir con honor
En los brazos de mi chata

Mi querida me mando
A una ciudad muy lejana
Me encargo que le trajera
Una lechuga alemana
Un clavelito francés
Y una flor Americana

Unas buenas calabazas
No me las cortes muy tiernas
Porque se secan las matas
No dejes la puerta abierta
Porque se meten las vacas

En la oficina tengo mucho que hacer

Y a un hotel de carretera él se fue

No dijo nombre ni quien es
Seguramente lo esperaba esa persona
Que robaba sus instantes se decía que era su amante

Cuál es la falla que he tenido contigo
Dentro de mi alma sé que no eres feliz

Ake Johansson,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Ake Johansson,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Ake Persson,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Akercocke,"Venerate her under many names
As a pagan mystic rose
Perfect prostitute priestess
Face dripping with the semen of many
Initiatrix to the great work, devoted Isis
Without Osiris
Demeaned and demonized by God
A god so full of self hate
Futile hate
He loathes even his best creation
So full of hate, Full of self hate
Superior sub-rosa Sophia
Sucking the anointed at the temple
Fucking the Baptist by candle
In the trance of Horasis
Goddess soul carved in rock
Heavenly hymns hewn in stone
â??Mary, I am lost without youâ??
Raising arms to the head
To the head of the bed
Breasts rise across her ribcage
Shooting thick white debris
All over her face and hair
â??I have no place in this World without youâ??

Akhenaton,"Chaud comme MARSEILLE, on vous met le feu
Le c?ur de la ville s'enflamme quand le son entre en jeu
Les préoccupations des frères s'infiltrent dans ton walkman
L'argent, la boisson, la fumée et les femmes
Je nagerai avec les femmes et un micro dans une piscine
Si j'avais l'occasion de partir loin des vermines
L'hésitation ne se ferait pas, c'est certain
Mes poches sont vides et j'ai faim de pognon et d'un bon destin
J'extirpe ces quelques mots, un stylo de mon paletot, sorti un jour
Du caniveau, je roule dans les casinos
Ouais, je fais le zgaigue en espadrilles, mais j'assure quand même
Quoi qu'il arrive, car Funky est la Famille
Autant parler des mains que la bouche chez nous n'est pas louche
Méditerranéen de souche, mes styles font mouche
Au milieu d'embrouilles ou de mauvais coups,
Je crame tous les tintanos qui nous cherchent des poux
Dans la nuit, un MC check check le mic
Taquiner la rime et le beat est mon véritable hobbie
Envoyer des styles pour tous les frères qui nique la hâla
Pour la première fois, le refrain commence comme ça:

{Refrain:}
Tranquille au bar
Et popo dans le pétard
Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille
Porche sombre et gadjos dans les couloirs
Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille
T'as garé ta voiture ici trop tard
Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys de Marseille
Tranquille au bar Et popo dans le pétard
Tu reconnais bien là le style des Bad Boys

Pendant que tu fais un flop, que tu tapes un magnétoscope
Don Choa calcine les rimes comme une clope en garde à vue
Le hip-hop au top descend le long de la rue
Et se saisit du show biz à son insu
Accepte le son, qui touche de près mes entrailles
Au bercail, ma fonction est le travail
Je me comporte en canaille, aïe!
Les mauvais garçons se collent comme des moucherons
Aux jupons, frappent sans hésiter pour le pognon
Comme les apaches guintchent ton scalp
Ton fric est la proie, des hordes de chiens des Alpes
En veulent à tes Delacroix
Mais pas moi, je suis droit, respecte les autres et crois
Au pouvoir de la rime dans la destruction des hazas
L'été, les quartiers, postes dans le bus
Que demander de plus, fusse le funk ou des Vénus?
Gus, soi-disant ma ville pue en plus
Dieu t'a-t-il fait avec un anus au lieu des sinus?
Simple dans ma façon de faire mon sang rouge clair
Pourtant, j'ai la peau noire et fier de l'avoir
Je cours à la gloire des quartiers avec mes idées
Le produit, sera toujours enragé

{Refrain}

J'en ai marre de les voir flipper
Y a pas que le mauvais côté
Le rat te le dira, la vie est faite pour s'amuser
Capte le concept des mecs qui s'en battent les couilles
Le bon délire est là, t'inquiète on se débrouille
Mes pensées drivent coolo, coolo
Voilà quelques mots
Pour l'avenir incertain de mes potos
Qui ont quitté les cours tôt
La rage est dans mon âme pour le drame du Front National
J'allume la flamme, la flamme
Fils, comprends ce que tu peux comprendre
Un bon conseil, prétends à ce que tu peux prétendre
Réfléchis un instant avant de faire un pas, tu saisiras
Pourquoi on te lèvera où que tu sois
Avant, je combattais contre des moulins à vent
Maintenant, je fais vibrer les salles et le public en rappant
Satir au soleil, zique à l'oreille
Signe une carte de visite live de marseille
La balle de ping pong d'Ali Kong tape,
De marseille à Naples, pour le rap, je capte les étapes

Le va-car-me des hu-mains par-fois me rend pa-traque

en live de mon ha-mac

des gens qui se filent
et des au-to-mo-biles

J'aime en-ta-mer un texte a-près u-ne re-la-xa-tion

2. ne m'ins-pi-rant de rien sauf du si-lence
j'aime m'ins-pi-rant de rien puis-que j'é-cris dans le si-lence

Désormais, je préfère le silence
Me retrouver avec moi-même en méditation intense
Et c'est dans cet état que me viennent les mots les plus beaux
De rien je fais un tout sonore dicté dans le micro

Je ne suis pas un aigri, oh non
De ceux qui aiment les enfants avec trois cuillères de Nopron
Ni un Marcel regardant pousser son bide
Tout au long de sa vie molle et vide, chrysalide

Il est, chrysalide il restera, mais moi je préfère être un papillon
Créer des oeuvres dans mon sillon
Ce que j'appelle user de mes cinq sens
Ou vivre simplement avec le calme comme essence

Le monde de l'absurdité devient-il un bastion ?
Naître ou ne pas naître ? Telle est la question
Maintenant je suis ici et j'ai le choix de
Vivre dans la douceur ou bien survivre dans la douleur

C'est un chemin tracé dans la tête de chacun
Il faut se décider à la croisée dégun ou de quelqu'un
Soit-disant je suis un VIP, moi je voudrais n'être rien
Qu'un simple citoyen méditerranéen

Quelquefois partir en Corse voir des amis
Un petit saut à Naples afin de saluer la famille
La simplicité règnerait dans les tranches de vie que j'ai dépeintes
Comme un paysan d'Agrigente

Dans mon orangeraie, j'arrangerai
Les fruits de la terre et me vengerai de celui qui les mangerait
Je me souviendrai alors des jours où
Je chapardais des citrons dans les champs de Cefalù

Le pardon est facile quand la mémoire est saine car
L'homme est un cheval dont la raison est les rennes
Efface le lien du bonheur à l'abondance
Je veux vivre simplement avec le calme comme essence

J'apprendrai à mes enfants que la terre est une sphère
Je leur enseignerai que la couleur est illusion
J'apprendrai à mes enfants qu'une guerre est un enfer
Je leur enseignerai le respect des traditions

Car les anciens sont la mémoire, la sagesse, un fils
De métèque ne les met pas dans un hospice, non
Même si l'argent ne coule pas à flots
Il faut se dire que dans la vie il y a des bas et il y a des hauts

J'ai passé plus de temps en bas
Pourtant s'il fallait décrire les moments je ne le saurais pas
Joie et tristesse s'interpénètrent
À la manière du regard intense de deux êtres, par une fenêtre

Éloignez-moi de la multitude pressée
Préservez-moi de la solitude stressée
Loin de métro et des gaz d'échappement loin
Du gris des bâtiments, du train-train et des coups de frein

La technologie était supposée me servir
Et non pas m'endormir pour m'asservir
Les valeurs de base ne sont pas si mal quand j'y pense
Je veux vivre simplement avec le calme comme essence",Le Calme Comme Essence
Akhenaton,"C'était un jour de pluie où l'on n'aime pas mettre
Un seul pied dehors, la tête à la fenêtre
J'étais très occupé à me plaindre de notre concert
Du lieu, du son, des conditions, de l'atmosphère

Qui régnait, mais peu de temps avant de jouer
Une dame s'est approchée et m'a dit
""Cet enfant est condamné
Son rêve est de vous rencontrer""

Elle avait fait 400 kilomètres en ambulance pour nous voir
Ecouter le répertoire ce soir
Quand Steve est descendu, son visage était pâle
Miroir de la maladie, une empreinte du mal

Le concert terminé il était si content
Que ses yeux retrouvèrent les couleurs du printemps

Puis, je lui fis faire des promesses sur une année
Pour empêcher le désespoir de l'emporter
Je suis parti environ trois semaines
Quand je suis revenu, Pascal n'était plus le même

Il m'a dit, tu sais, les plus beaux cœurs ont une fin
Le 23 août au soir, Steve s'est éteint
Je n'ai pas pu te parler, désolé
Mais pour toi ces paroles sont nées, 21 jours après

Moi qui me plaignais de mes vacances
De ceci, de cela, de l'argent que j'ai paumé en France
Chill a perdu 200 balles à Roissy
Et Steve a perdu la vie à 17 ans et demi

Depuis ce jour, le caprice dort dehors
Et j'ai promis d'éviter de chialer sur mon sort
Tout ce que j'ai dit, que je n'aurais jamais dû dire
Je le regrette car ma vie jusque-là n'a pas été la pire

Il y a des soirs où je suis si malheureux
J'ai réalisé être un petit con capricieux
Steve d'où tu es, je suis sûr que tu peux me voir
Ces mots sont à jamais pour ta mémoire

Je ne suis pas à plaindre

Il est arrivé la main tendue vers nous, moi
Je pensais qu'il voulait des sous.
Cette nuit-là à Marrakech je ne l'oublierai de sitôt,
Il demandait seulement un escargot.

Vois-tu le décalage de rêves qu'il y a entre nous enfin?
Le bonheur pour lui, pour moi est un rien
Ce sont des faits effrayants
Il était minuit, lui tout seul en haillons, il avait 4 ans

Je suis parti un nœud dans les entrailles
Mais lui heureux tout plein, les cheveux en bataille
Des images douloureuses alors sont revenues dans mon cœur
Que je voulais oublier à jamais

Comme cet enfant qui pleurait
Battu par son père qui semblait enragé
La ceinture dans une main, de l'autre il agrippait ses cheveux
Parce qu'il ne voulait pas faire des trucs avec les messieurs

Je revois la misère, ces gosses qui ne voient pas
La mort flotter sur les bidonvilles de Casa
Les dirhams que j'ai donnés pour une fleur
Et que ce petit a gardé, une heure sur son cœur

Moi, étant gamin, je partais faire des footings
Et grognait tous les jours pour un trou dans mon training
Une pièce de cuir, autre défaut dans mon château
Les semelles de mes Kickers et les lacets de mes Tobaccos

Je crisais quand mes amis sortaient
Des fois ma mère ne pouvait pas me donner assez
J'y repense aujourd'hui et le mal devient bon
A côté de ces enfants, nous sommes nés dans le coton

Je ne peux rien changer, je ne peux rien y faire
Les jours où j'ai flippé, j'aurais juste dû me taire

Je ne suis pas à plaindre",Je Ne Suis Pas à Plaindre
Akhenaton,"C'que j'te livre, non, rien d'complexe, c'est juste mon texte c'est l'savon
Tu sais, j'ai trop d'scrupules et j'suis lucide sur mon état
Ce qu'ils nous ont laissé ? Espoir et fausses joies, on cessera
D'parler d'ça p'tet jamais ouais j'sais c'est noir
Demain c'est loin, j'l'ai dit ! Si j'le répète c'est mieux si j'foire
Ma vie j'm'en carre, mais j'foire aussi la vie des miens
Je n'vis mieux qu'depuis qu'j'écoute plus souvent l'avis des miens
Ravi d'un rien, parce qu'habitué à rien, j'ai vécu chichement
Chiche man, on s'tire d'ici, vivement c'jour, mais c'jour
N'est pas venu, j'ai passé 10 ans tristement
La rue a eu ton fils, pour oublier, j'fumais trop d'canabis man
Là au milieu des parrains, j'ai vu plus d'fric qu'dans Casino
Avec mes 20 balles au p'tit Casino,
J'ai vécu ma routine seulement dans l'fond
Quand mes potes vendaient la popo et par jour s'faisaient des milions
Le fric ? M'a jamais tourné la tronche, j'pensais p'tit, à fumer
A rimer, à boire mon ponch, à être raide,
Pour les heures qui suivaient, plus j'buvais plus ça passait
Et j'cuvais les mains sur la putain d'cuvette rivées
Et là j'songeais qu'les lech de la classe
Avaient p'tet raison que c'était moi le lâche
Puis on lâche ses études pour un prétexte bidon
Et on lâche son étude de la vie sur un premier texte bidon.

Et pour ça, j'vens mes rimes comme un savon
On sort des tripes tout c'qu'on vit et c'que nous savons
J'applique l'intelligence du turf dans mon giron
Y'a pas d'putes et pas d'place pour les caves que nous bravons
Et pour ça, j'vends mes rimes comme un savon
Lâche des bombes sur les vinyls que nous gravons
J'applique l'intelligence du turf dans mon sillon
C'est plein d'groupes ici c'n'est que du pur que nous vendons
Et pour ça, j'vens mes rimes comme un savon

Toutes ces années stériles, accroupi sur une rampe
Comptant les secondes s'évaporant dans les pertes
L'estomac en proie aux crampes, si violentes et les merdes tombent
Sur la route, tu sais plus si c'est l'doute, la faim ou le stress qui t'prend
Avec nos ganaches de craps à l'écran, j'suis fier d'pouvoir
Poser sur l'écrin avec cran, sans s'dire ma face
D'faits divers fait tâche à leur sens, c'qu'ils pensent, j'm'en secoue
Tant d'silences qui voulaient dire au secours, personne n'est venu grand,
J'me suis débrouillé seul
Sauf quand des potes mataient mon dos, si je m'embrouillais seul
Tu connais l'truc, les shlass et les clans

Paroles fortes et conneries à 2Fr
On en trouvait tremblants par terre dans le hall
En train d'baigner dans leur sang. Frontière mince
Transparente, séparant les mecs biens, sincères, fiers, francs
Des embryons délinquants; des gens brillants, combien s'en sortent 
Combien regardent leur vie sous l'briquet, vont en soirée sous escorte
Ou s'comptent des histoires d'faits d'armes violents
On est loin des légends sur l'pays, qui plaisaient à nos parents
Ma rime je vends bleu, tout simplement à qui l'veut
Et des jours de grand beau temps au fond d'ces yeux, il pleut
Reluques la salive sur ma langue et mes dents
Apologie du précédent, timide, clos stress aidant
A égréner toutes ces minutes, c'est horrible j'veux pas l'revivre
J'me réfugie, derrière ce thème j'me livre. Il joue des notes couleur de
L'air du temps
J'pourrais jamais plus traîner comme avant, j'ai l'sentiment
Que j'perd du temps c'est idiot mais c'est comme ça qu'j'me sens
Evacuer le fiel par la plume, j'n'ai que ça dans l'sang

Et pour ça, j'vens mes rimes comme un savon
On sort des tripes tout c'qu'on vit et c'que nous savons

Et pour ça, j'vens mes rimes comme un savon

C'est comme ça il faut croire
C'est ce qui a été dessiné
Un mic ? C'est peut-être ce à quoi j'ai été destiné
Soit. Mais c'est un autre chapitre du livre de ma vie
Et c'est pour la postérité que je livre un autre plan de ma vie
Et quand je s'rais plus là, pour veux qui m'ont tenu la main
Et ceux qui l'ont lâchée, pour ceux qui firent mes joies
Et ceux qui l'ont gâchée, pour mes soleils et mes lunes

Mon instinct s’est évanoui, il ne reviendra pas c’est fou
J’ai eu ma deuxième chance en même temps
L’attente a été longue, très longue et stressante
J’ai brûlé mes plus belles années comme ça, mais bon me voilà

Quand j’ai vu passer le premier train
De ma life, sous mes yeux, j’ai réalisé, il était déjà loin
J’entends encore la loco' qui sonne
Il s’est évanoui à l’horizon, évaporé avec tous mes diplômes
J’avais déjà du mal à assumer l’appart’
Et les courses, j’aurais bien eu besoin d’une autre carte
Chance ou hasard, un coup de pouce, pas d’épaule
Que ma souris et moi on puisse quitter ce trou à rats
S’entraîner avec nous, trop de regrets dans les pommes
Tout le monde souhaiterait voir refaire les traits
Que la destinée a dessiné, décidé à changer
On attend la deuxième chance comme la pluie au Sahel
Les jours nous semblent n'être qu’un funeste manège
Pourtant la vie n’est pas un tribunal
Tout effacer ne serait pas plus mal
J’ai les souvenirs qui s’animent au fond de mes yeux
Quand la nuit me dit que ça n’ira jamais mieux
Les mains s’ouvrent et se tournent vers les cieux
Moi aussi j’ai été enfant, j’ai pleuré et j’ai ris
Quand la malchance a dessiné une drôle de série
L’air s’est raréfié, j’en ai pris une goulée
Et me suis débattu dans tous les sens pour ne pas couler
Irascible, caractère inégal, normal
Si on sombre dans la parano de l’illégal
Les jours se ressemblent, y’a rien qui dépasse
Les emmerdes sont de briques, y’a rien qui les cassent
Et on fredonne ces mots « Y’a rien qui les effacent »

La belle vie me doit une prochaine danse
Aller ailleurs pour que mon air change
Que je souris, que ma colère flanche
Mon dieu (mon dieu) j’aimerais bien avoir ma deuxième chance

A tous mes soss’ qui ont tenu ces murs
A mes côtés, impassibles, vigilants, quand l'hiver était dur
Cette ville nous appartient plus qu'à tous ces richards
Tous ces aigris et ces vieux pleurnichards
Les rues portent leurs noms, les briques portent les nôtres
Rien à battre des hipsters et ces lieux qu'ont la côte
J'étais là où il en faut pour rester en vie
Équipe de France bitumeuse, brille les yeux dans le gris
Le temps a fait que mes genoux plient
En pleine forêt d'ennui j'ai du creuser ma place, facile
Élu domicile dans l'arbre qui les cache
En attendant le second train, le soleil a tapé
Si fort, qu'on pour ne pas crever, j'ai tracé à pieds
Glissé une cassette dans mon baladeur Jurassique
Vers d'autres horizons, le mien était si dur à vivre
Nan, je n'ai jamais blâmé Dieu pour ça
Toute cette merde sous mes yeux, elle était bien à moi
Comme un grand, j'ai passé l'éponge
Je peux le dire maintenant, la gamberge ronge
Rage au cœur, croiser le fer avec ses démons dans les songes
Personne ne tient ta main quand de si haut ton corps plonge
La fidélité elle te crache à la face
Pour deux billets ou quelques sapes, pour rester à la page
C'est vrai, je n'avais que peu d'options
Et cette corde où je marchais menait droit à l’extrême onction
Même si tous croyaient que la pièce était jouée
Moi de mon côté, j'me surprenais à chanter

La belle vie me doit une prochaine danse
Aller ailleurs pour que mon air change
Que je souris, que ma colère flanche
Mon dieu (mon dieu) j’aimerais bien avoir ma deuxième chance

Akhenaton,"As-tu vu ces fruits étranges pendus au platane
C'est le sang pur qui sonne la chasse aux bâtards
Vieille rengaine donc de vieux moyens
D'abord aux urnes puis on chante aux arbres citoyens
Porter les cordes, les torches, les Polaroid
Qui nous sauvera? Personne, leur conscience c'est les tabloïd
À trop mater les culs, les yeux s'emplissent de merde
Débite des théories teintées de déjections indélébiles
Chantez mon blues à l'unisson lors de mes funérailles
Les amis, n'oubliez pas, les fous sont là où on les a mis
Dans un silence de mort, la masse sera là à mater
Sans rien dire, dans la brise mon corps se balançait
C'est déjà clair, ce n'est pas la peine qu'on nous le prédise
Peuple de bois sur lequel une flamme crépite
On s'est usés à trop montrer qu'on est des mecs biens
J'commence à croire qu'en fait Vichy c'est l'instinct

Pourtant on sait que la vie ensemble c'est possible
Sans se mentir ou se coucher, là c'est docile
Étrange fruit qui se balance sur les branches

Ce blues, triste mélopée du sud
Née du bitume où poussent les nouveaux champs de canne à sucre
Où les hommes libres viennent et passent seuls les entraves
Leurs besoins sont les maîtres dans ces enclaves
Peu à peu, mes idéaux toxiques germent
De sales vieux aigris zémmourifient notre oxygène
Monte au Maroc pour achever ce vécu trop long
Une vie d'balance, ils veulent crever en colons
Fusil de chasse, pack de bières au fond d'une marée d'eau
Ils voudraient bien nous prendre comme Takezo
Donc voici la came que le soir nos vannes portent au box
Salves de vinyles gravés d'un rap orthodoxe
Viendra le jour où grogneront leurs toc aux portes
Qu'on passera du vote aux potes et nous avec la horde au bloc
On achète pas la paix avec la peur du gendarme
À force de bander dessus, ils ont fini par violer Jeanne d'Arc
La tension se répand comme un grand feu dans le bayou
Pourtant nos bancs n'ont pas le monopole des voyous
Regarde les arbres, ici dessine un plan pour nous
Dur de dire ""je t'aime"" et sourire avec la corde au cou

Pourtant on sait que la vie ensemble c'est possible
Sans se mentir ou se coucher, là c'est docile

Les détracteurs pleurent, leurs gueules est dans le rétroviseur

Akhenaton,"Les jours écrivent en moi comme une feuille blanche, (immaculée)
Mon destin n’a qu’une seule branche, (miraculé)
Je ne suis qu’un élève, assis, comprend et rêve
Qui récite la vie du bout de ses lèvres, (ses lèvres)
Les jours écrivent en moi comme une feuille blanche, (immaculée)
Mon destin n’a qu’une seule branche, (miraculé)
Je ne suis qu’un élève, assis, comprend et rêve
Qui récite la vie du bout de ses lèvres, (ses lèvres)

La vanité m’a appris qu’un temps je me suis égaré
Quand vicieusement de mon cœur elle s’est emparée
Puis je l’ai sortie de mes tripes dans un intervalle douloureux
Malheureusement des frères en sont encore habités
Paranoïaques ils prennent tout pour eux, même les petits coups pour rire
Putain d’écho monstrueux qui en fait des gâteaux pourris
On se croit au top, coupé, habits ridicules
Ce n’est pas une montagne, couz’ ce n’est rien qu’un monticule
Alors on revoit les ambitions à la baisse
Faut pas y voir le mal si jamais les mains retournent à la Grèce
Loin des embrouilles de la basse-cour
Le principal est donner, recevoir de l’amour, ainsi
L’amour m’a appris que tout est fleur fragile
Il meurt et fait place à la peur, panique
Peur d’être haïe ou peur d’être seul
Et les draps de l’étreinte deviennent un linceul
La rose est délicate quand on l’enserre ou on l’enferme
En étouffant son paradis on bâtit son propre enfer
En fait, c’est se conjuguer au pluriel
Et se donner corps et âme jusqu’à qu’il ne reste plus rien
L’hypocrisie m’a appris à être méfiant
Et livrer ma confiance à bonne escient
Y’a rien à attendre de ceux qui boivent des larmes à plein pôle
Et qui te disent salam avec une main molle

Les jours écrivent en moi comme une feuille blanche, (immaculée)
Mon destin n’a qu’une seule branche, (miraculé)
Je ne suis qu’un élève, assis, comprend et rêve

L’honneur m’a appris que peu importe la situation
Faut rester droit en toute occasion même si il n’y a pas d’option d’évasion
Revanche contenue avec une mémoire d’éléphant
Laisser passer le temps et la furie des éléments
Transparent aux yeux des puissants en moquettz
L’exhaler un souffle ultime, appuyer sur un bokken
Ainsi quand vient l’heure de l’appel
Beaucoup perdent valeurs et aplombs lorsque approchent les ailes de Raphaël
Je n’ai rien à vendre à part mes notes
Mes poésies où je dépeins la vie des nôtres
Chez nous on ne tire pas à la ras’, baille à l’hôpital
On définit le destin par ces putains de nuits de mistral
Libre, la liberté m’a appris que tout se fane
Et qu’on doit se battre pour, c’est un luxe qui se gagne
Maintenant les boites où les parents bossaient délocalisent
Et les députés hypocrites viennent y pousser leurs vocalisent
Lancent la chasse aux votants
Excitent le patriotisme en chantant la marseillaise d’une voix chevrotante
Liberté? Nah! Ce n’est qu’un Ersatz
Ce n’est qu’un vaste poulailler fliqué par la Wehrmacht
Où tout le monde juge ou condamne
Devient le geôlier de l’autre, mon pays se trompe de combat
Sale hypocrite, être libre c’est d’aimer
Puisse l’honneur nous garder de sombrer dans la vanité

I know that won’t stop me
I gotta fight through the pain
To make a better me

Quel torrent fougueux est ma vie
Je les chevauche avec passion jusqu'au seuil de la nuit
Les cubes m’entraînent au pays où la terre fume petite mort
Emmène-moi auprès de ceux que j’ai perdus
Je t’en prie ne souffle aucune amertumes
L’univers a ses règles, un jour elles nous percutent
46 printemps le cœur plein de rustines
Je m’étais gouré de monde car j’y cherchais la justice
Y’en a pas alors dans la rue m’assure le 
Colt con t’façon on verra bien qui est le plus speed
Faut bien le dire, la plume reste muette
La feuille immaculée lassée par les duels
Quelle importance si la renommée s’étend sur les lèvres?
On pense être fort quand bout le sang dans les veines
Et puis le temps aidant, la lumière change de spectre
La violence est bien l’arme du méchant et du faible
Laisse-moi voir la route, la vie écraser leur régime

Pour réussir y’avait la queue, j’ai grugé cette file
Arrive un âge où on perd le sommeil
Et les souffrances ne sont pas compensées par le soleil
Parce qu’on le regarde comme si il nous devait tout
A force de se mettre au centre, on ne sent plus la terre tourner
Et elle boit doucement sous les coups
Combien d’âmes arrachées en une seule journée?
J’ai appris à contempler la nature
Et ma joie ne se mesure pas à la facture
Entre deux univers depuis c’est la fracture
Comme ces condés qui nous matent comme des singes de la voiture
J’ai mis mon cœur à nu dans les courbes des lettres
J’espère que de là-haut mon père approuve mes gestes
Comme rendre grâce pour ce jour, c’est le minimum
Ta vie est mieux gaulée, elle a ses deux nibards en silicone
La paix n’a pas de prix, la foi n’a pas de maître
Accepter que tout meurt est dur à admettre
Que cet arbre sera la caressé par la brise
Le jour où la terre aura effacé ton sourire
Mon œil court sur l’eau qui tourbillonne
Et les cieux à l’horizon s’habillent en vermillon
Les hirondelles volent sur la citadelle
La ville s’éveille, au loin une voix délivre son appel

Pour que cesse la guerre du Vietnam
Les gens se battaient pour les autres, cause commune
Depuis les idéaux sont morts, fosse commune
Aux antipodes de la pleinitude
Comment ralier le peuple, si on incendie ses véhicules
La confiance mutuelle maigri
Pour ce pays le qualificatif, aigri
Cette amertume se lit dans les forums
Où tout les sujets ont le clash pour des chorums
Où on jette de grandes phrases sans instructions
Répondant seulement à la culture de la destruction
Il n'y a pas que Big Brother qui te fixe
Y'a tout tes voisins en loose qui t'épient et te fliquent

Tout le monde a un avis sur tout
Et n'accepte pas que les autres en aient
Alors les mots se transforment en clous
Crucifié parce que différend
La paranoïa prend le pas
On fuit les sujets qui dérangent
Vraiment, en poids sur les postiches
Et l'illusion débouche sur une révolution en plastique
Les fachos sont deguisés en démocrates
Les criminels en hommes pieux, théocrates
Marche dans le rang, tes consoeurs te regardent
Sans limite, la haine et la jalousie les gagnent
Nos dirigeants n'ont pas compris que le mal est mondial
Quand depuis 15 ans les extrêmes ont colonisés la toile
Auto-flicage, bactéries qui se dédoublent
Tout les tubes uniformisent les coups
Et nous au milieu de tout ça
On a pas d'horizon comme un jeune de 20 ans à Gaza
Dans ce cas le silence est utile
Quand les dés passent dans les mains des ignorants debiles
Je prie de tout coeur qu'enfin la beugle vienne
Qu'au moins s'écrasent un temps, tout ces moutons qui pellent

Ici la lassitude tue plus que l’arme à feu
Les constructions en vrac s'apparentent à l'affreux
Elles sont le fruit de tous ces blazes qu’on a élus
Du bouillonnement d’idées qui chute, s’atténue, disparaît dans l’indifférence totale
Au mépris des lois et de la morale
Partie au beau milieu de leur devoir d’histoire redessiné à leur goût
Je ne peux pas les voir tant que l’or noir pend à leur cou
Pourquoi parler au pluriel? Tous n’en n’ont rien à foutre
Les haineux s’agenouillent à la hauteur de leurs idées courtes
Invoquant Dieu pour souhaiter le mal aux autres
Faut pas s’étonner si c’est le Diable qui vient et toque à la porte
On cherche des ""oui mais"" voici l’argent de la drogue
C’est l’argent de nos votes et peu importe la cause
Pour s’échapper loin du royaume des rêves déçus
Au lieu de jeter des bons, les hommes lèvent des murs

Parce qu’une haine immense baigne les foyers
La colère nous cueille où le cœur s’est noyé
L’aveuglement tourne vite au courroux c’est ça
Même les Anges ne peuvent plus rien pour nous
Quand l’appât du gain brise les passions
Les flammes attendent au bout de toutes façons
Combien de fois on s’est mis seul à genoux
Si bien que même les Anges ne peuvent plus rien pour nous

Les grands ne sont grands que parce que nous rampons à leurs pieds
Et les rebelles de l’an 2000, des singes serviles
Nos gosses ne réussiront pas tous crampons à leurs pieds
Égocentrisme et fascisme, on assure le service
Leur modèle on l'a croqué jusqu’à la moelle
Mais le plat n'était pas doux, y avait que du fiel dans la poêle
Ils ont juré qu’un jour on verrait les étoiles
Tu les as vu toi avec un pied de biche en cagoule sur les toits
Les différences finissent vite balayées
Les hommes ont fait en sorte que même les sentiments soient monnayés
Rangés dans les cases, on sort à l’occase aisément loquace on amenait la France visiter nos cases
Ils y ont vu des génies armés de stylos bille, ni kalashs, ni shit
Que des gamins qui vivent au rythme de leur cœur et leur âme
Mais le glas a sonné, plus personne ne vient ici où même les rats les ont abandonnés
Les pires profs se claquent, dépressifs, défaitistes
Ils n’éduquent pas nos enfants, ils les déprécient
Au lieu de leur jeter une corde si ils se noient
Ils préfèrent passer une corde autour des branches de Magnolia

Parce qu’une haine immense baigne les foyers
La colère nous cueille où le cœur s’est noyé
L’aveuglement tourne vite au courroux c’est ça

Akhenaton,"Dire qu'il y avait cette colère en moi, profonde et étrange
Nécessaire à mes yeux, obsédé par la revanche
Sur la vie, comme si elle m'avait trahi, ou banni de la liste
J'étais de ceux qui dansaient l'insultant sur la piste
En fait on est comme ces gens qui se mentent
La haine est le mal, et la peur est son assistante
Même s'ils se cachent derrière l'offre et la demande
Amère est la récolte, si amère est la semence
Inutiles, nos luttes sont rendues
Quelques euros saupoudrés, lèvent une armée de vendus
Prête à passer tous les voisins sur le fil du couteau
Au nom du baril, du fric et de Monsanto
Je ne sais plus comment le crier, des fois les mots me font défaut
Je prends le stylo, les syllabes deviennent des faux
Qui taillent leur élan comme un champ de tournesols
Au sol comme l'école Yoshioka sous le pin parasol
Comprends quand j'étreins la paix si fragile
J'aime, sentir battre son cœur dans son cou frêle et gracile
Marionnettes funambules, enfants de la ville
Au fond, la vie ne tient qu'à un fil
Et pour ça

Je vends ces rimes comme un savon
On ne chevauche pas le destin à coup de bâtons
On fera couler cette encre pour celles et ceux qui attendent
Je t'assure, aucune tempe au bout du canon

Qu'il vente ou pleuve, tire le spot, volume à fond
Du mouvement intelligent, furtif et diligent
On attend pas la chance, on crée l'occasion

Et pour ça, je vend mes rimes comme un savon
Je vends ces rimes comme un savon

Grandir sous le sceau du silence, peu savent ce que c'est
Stressé lorsque la pression est immense
Quand ces murs prennent le relais des parents
Effarant, toujours à cran, transparent, rempli de vide
Si violent fut l'ennui, que vint l'envie de lire
Même quand les jours furent durs, furieuse envie de rire
Ecrire, assis à table, là où tout semble si stable
Qu'on en oublie de songer au pire
Les fables furent des havres dans mes étapes
Des orages d'amour qui éclatent dans mes étals
Puis vint la nuit à tous les étages
Mon père est parti nous aimer depuis les étoiles
Je n'ai pas su vivre, j'étais occupé à mourir
Souffler, voir le monde, je pensais trop à courir
Tourne la manivelle de cette boîte à musique
Parfois j'envie l'état de grâce de qui n'est pas lucide
Tout plier et panser les plaies, voilà qui est sage
Car je survivrai pas à leurs cages, mon âme, un quetzal
Jeter ces mots au mistral fera l'affaire
J'aurai l'impression qu'ils font le tour de la Terre
Ainsi

Nos voiles gonflées sur les navires de Mare Nostrum
Quatre étoiles sur le maillot, quatre grosses coupes!

On est pas tous des mafiosi qu'on voit aux infos
Trop passionnés, on sourit souvent
En deux secondes, on passe du ridicule à l'émouvant
On chaotise l'ordre, organise le bordel
On a la voix cassée depuis qu'on a la morvelle!
Ça parle que de bouffe, reste des plombes à table
Ou deux euros, café sous les arcades
On respire la vie et la mort on l'emmerde

C'est vrai que souvent, je pense qu'on s'affiche trop
Quand la télé-réalité brosse notre ego
On a l'air arrogants, bêtes et superficiels

Peu hypocrites, on est ce genre de gens qui disent tout

Qu'la graine de délinquant, arrosée au liquide, pousse
Couz, pas de fine bouche, on grandit dans une époque mytho
Où les petits s'retrouvent, en dépit de tout, dans les comicos
Dans des blocs si pauvres, loin de tout le gratin
Où comme tout un chacun ça vise le top niveau
Là où ça shoote les potes, tout ça pour des fautes, idiot
Là où ça joue du glock face à tous les blocs rivaux
Drôle d'époque amigo, où même les liens amicaux sautent
Quand il s'agit de coke, les potes sont des animaux
Les jeunes sont si tentés de faire le million qu'ils braquent et rusent
Car dans cette jungle cimentée, le lion est celui qui palpe le plus
À qui le dis-tu? Tout se dégrade aujourd'hui
Vu le genre d'individu que la société actuelle produit
Immondes sont les faux concepts qu'ils défendent sans soucis
Dans ce monde, je possède, je dépense donc je suis
Inconscient ils vivent du mal sans connaître les causes du massacre
Adolescents ils veulent déjà que la virgule Nike ponctue la sape
C'est nos valeurs qu'ils piétinent, ils sont bêtes, entêtés, têtus
Formatés depuis la tétine, à vouloir être pétés de thunes
On est vu comme des parias, ils refusent le mariage
On a le statut de victime, gosses illégitimes de Marianne
Derrière les barricades, rien ne change j'te rassure
Oui c'est toujours la même merde, derrière l’énième dernière couche de peinture
Les mêmes infos qui ne sont en fait que des leurres
Quand la grande délinquance se sert de la petite pour masquer ses erreurs

Ici, les gestes vont avec, ça joue des coudes, et puis

Aboutie à Dieu pour tous et chacun sa gueule

Au lieu de bonnes mines, tous préfèrent avoir une mine aurifère
Ils vendent leurs âmes par tous les orifices
Ça paraît clair, si tu songes au contraire, je t'assures t'es minoritaire
Trop lisses pour la presse bourge de gauche
Qui aiment le bad boy tant qu'il rackette pas ses gosses
Célèbrent des chanteurs maudits et leurs compiles post-mortem
Au pied de l'hôtel du hip-hop, je dépose leurs têtes

Je joue ma vie comme au stand-up
Technique rodée sur les planches d'une salle miteuse
Je me sens comme un musicien de jazz
Années 30 à Harlem, partition solo, Sooo Bad

Si la baignoire est remplie d'encre noire, appelez-moi Marat

C'est le son du futur, rien à foutre si ta ritournelle fut tube

Si on n'sait plus rêver on s'comporte comme un sale gosse de maître
On la joue rebelle, mais avec des gosses de merde
Si ça nous mène là où certains nous dénient
Défiler main dans la main avec le pire des ennemis
En ces temps troublés, où l'ambiance tendue, est attendue
Je préfère toujours la main tendue, au bras tendu

Je vais te faire une entrevue style Jack Byrnes
C'que tu gagnes? Peu importe, sois correct
Pas d'bluff, pas d'bol la famille est nombreuse

Et passer vite de bad boy à militant de Green Peace
Inutile de la couvrir de cadeaux

Un matin de juillet d'un coup le ciel s'est assombri
Les collines alentours dévorées par l'incendie
Les pompiers m'ont dit ""sors, la maison est menacée""
Je n'ai rien pris à part les photos dans mon sac entassées
Ton sourire sur le parvis à la mairie
Sur la plage aux Lecques avec notre petit à Carry
Ma lune habillée en princesse du Pendjab
Et l'blond que j'ai filmé excité en tenue d'ninja
C'est mon trésor gardé dans le plus sûr des coffres
Il s'ouvre quand j'me perds dans mes yeux qui décollent
J'y mets des images depuis mes premiers jours d'école
Et les flèches intactes ou brisées que Cupidon décoche
Si tu emportes la voiture, le toit et les bijoux
Ce sera dur mais je me dirais que c'est le sort qui joue
Que tu viens pour délester, l'inné de l'acquis
Pour qu'une fois encore je médite la vanité de la vie
Que mes yeux fassent la part entre utile et futile
Pris dans le tourbillon, parfois la diff' est subtile
Quand on a la chance et qu'un grand soupir
C'est comme garder la grenade pour balancer la goupille
Trop d'honneur pour s'abaisser à faire les poches

Je suis le fils de l'homme qui nous a tant aimé
Perdu devant l’avenir, mutilé par mes heures perdues
Quand la colère et les noires pensées me percutent
Y’a que mon (?) qui sépare ton corps des perfus
Dans le creuset beaucoup jalousent la réussite
Pour dire le mal sur l’autre là ils se réunissent
Nombre demeurent où les armes à feu nous pressurisent
Rares sont les jours où les condés les élucident
Mon métier m’a fait croiser des chiens et des lions
Comme partout j’y ai vu des gars bien et des cons
Ceux qui piétinent tout pour les biens et les ronds
Dans la rue c’est tordu, donneraient les adresses et les noms
Tu peux me prendre mon larfeuille avec un glock petit
Armer ton courage et faire ce que la coke te dit
Mettre sur pieds la pire équipe qui puisse te suivre
Mec tu n’saurais braquer mon échoppe de souvenirs, le rap
J’en suis une allégorie, des placards trop p’tits
Moi j’plane hors catégorie
Pendant qu’ignorance et oppression font terrorisme
J’dors prés de la paix, là où mènent mes hiéroglyphes
Produit d’une époque où rien autour n’était carré
Où ça faisait ""po po po po"" dans les soirées
Les anciens pensaient qu’on était mal barrés
Tous évoquent le métro et sa bande de sacrés enfoirés

Les Facebook et les tweets deviennent le prolongement normal de leurs bites
Ils en finissent suspendus au retour de l’écho
L’abonnement à la box pour tremplin de l'égo
Se montrer, être suivi ou encore faire du chiffre
Profils de bandits sans poings, avec rien que des griffes
Des gens tous pourris, pour exister s’créent des beef
Et s’réfugient chez les flics en pleurant si s'abattent les gifles
Match aller-retour comme dans les play-offs
Les gens deviennent fous comme si ils avaient bu du peyotl
Pour faire vrai ça met la schnouff dans le rayon
Ils veulent manœuvrer sombre avec sur la face un néon
Et quand la BAC frappe et les bracelets clipsent
T'étais le soleil du Hood voici ton éclipse
Mec à l’ancienne, nos langues effacent les preuves
On aime les animaux ainsi que tout ce qui ferme sa gueule

Aki Aleong,"Desert shadows creep across purple sands.
Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

You, Misirlou, Are the moon and the sun, fairest one.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

To an oasis, sprinkled by stars above,
Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.",Misirlou

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""

Akinyele,"It's the bomb, baby 
The bomb, baby 
With no ifs, no ands, no buts, and no maybes 

[Verse 1] 
I walk through the projects with stress in my hands 
A bad young man from the Lefrack lands 
They say I got an attitude, that's rude 
Because I walked over Elvis' grave in some blue suede shoes 
PUNK, I got some some stuff that'll bust through your pest LUMP 
Clearing cells CHUMP, you know the Ak shit BUMP 
But every now and then they say (he's wack) 
But deep down in your hear you and them dudes from Ridley's don't
believe that 
Everyone's down with the Ak brother 
Every place I go people be like UDDA UDDA, UDDA 
Trying to get the slang down pat, using verbs and syllables, shit 
But I'll flip the style like half a brick 
So give me space like NASA, one deep like a bachelor 
I turn shit over like a spatula 
You know how it goes by now, word to God 
Lyrics are so hard they'll be Kevin Costner's bodyguard 
Move over Whitney Houston, I'm not losing 
By the way woman, yo, my name's not Susan 
It's the Akenyel, I rock well and with more clientel 
Then a guy with long caps of crack to sell 
I take poetry and start illin' with it 
Homicide police be looking for me from the way I be killing and shit 
You niggas can't push along, with the Ak song 
Because thise shit here's the bomb! 

Chorus 

[Verse 2] 
I catch wreck like an automatic tec 
Ripping rhymes as if it was written with Gilletes 
Rapping over slamming tracks 
My hand's compared to a drug called crack 
Because it don't take much to get your ass smacked 
So you can save bullshit 
Word is bond get your shoehorn 
Because I got a style that fit 
See Akenyele be cold cuttin' brothers up like a DELI 
Keeping my cool like Arthur FONZARELLI 
I kick more black ass than Jim KELLY 
Down with easy shit, this nigga TELL ME 
They give me mines from state to state 
And gettin' so much props, my career should be real estate 
So now it's time to face up 
But if you play your jaw like a sneaker yo it's bound to get laced up 
For the MC's that LOST IT 
I'll treat your rock rhymes like a frisbee, watch the Ak TOSS IT 
Selling out it what ya CAUSED IT 
Charlie Angel rapper make like Farah 
And get rinsed down the FAUCET 
because I'm coming at 'em 
So save your devilish tricks for eve if you don't know me from Adam 
My lyrics are hotter than summer school 
My image, far from an air conditioner beacause I never blow my cool 
No thumbs up, nor a COLLAR 
I won't scream or HOLLER 
I make MC's sit their five DOLLAR ass down 
Because all they do is scream and speak in tounges 
RAH RAH RAH, but I bust your motherfuckin' lungs 
Burning up charts with the rhymes I spark 
Cardiology is the word because it comes from the heart 
Brain is on steroids, keeping the lyrics strong 
Huh, this shit here is called the bomb! 

Chorus 

[Verse 3] 
I keep the mic like glass, because I slash 
Thirsty rappers' ass on a Friday night without no hockey mask 
I make Jason meet his doom 
I hit him with the bass from the room that goes 
Ba-do-doom-do-do-DOOM 
You can't fuck with it beacaue I'm a little to exquisite 
For y'all snake-ass lizards 
Check my style right before you freestyle 
My style's hostile, Teddy Ted heard it he said ""Oooh child"" 
I'm quick to damage you amatures some of you pros 
Know on the downlow that I'll assassinate your character 
To think that they can get with this 
With all those dreams you fuck around and put Freddy out of business 
because I'm a rapper's worst nightmare 
Bringing tears for fears, I'm more bad news than the BEARS 
Say a lot for success, I won't DARE 
I'm not Shadow Stephen so I cease to be just another Hollywood
SQUARE 
I rope 'em like a lasso, you'd better dash yo 
Don't stand around and be another Dennis Leary asshole 
You'll get chopped like vegetables 
I leave plenty many hanging like testicles, huh 
Doing what I half to 
To get room to breathe even if it means knocking out your asthma 
This Ak flow ain't no fad 
I be smoking niggas like cigarettes because they style is just a fucking
drag 
I done blew up the World Trade and Vietnam 
Huh, because this shit here is the bomb! 

Chorus",The Bomb
Akinyele,"I throw incinerators at rappers that talk garbage 
about the Ak, they don't know me from a tree in the forest 
My name's not summer so I don't sweat it 
Most y'all niggaz know I cut ya like cheese that's cheddared 
I been around the world like Lisa Stansfield tour bus 
Tearin niggaz up from here to West Bubblefuck 
So don't front like you don't know what my name is 
Before I start diving up in that ass like Greg Louganis 
That's not my number one AMOS 
You take my style and squeeze your lips 
like probably you see your life stopped, you're freakin FAMOUS 
I dare another rapper try to TAME THIS 
I hit you in the ANUS 
Once y'all reach for the damn A-LIST 
still, this ain't the pretty boy 
Fear sex-appeal it's Ak, a.k.a. the real deal 
I make punk rappers stutter, why-yoyoy-yoyoy-yoyo 
I bring out the Das EFX in a motherfucker 
I livin larger than a mansion, you hear me? 
You fear me, you're just a Little House on the Praerie 
Leave 'fore Hurricane Ak come blowin in 
All you motherfuckers best to breeze like the wind 
Check the news forecast 
I place a con niggaz'll stick ya on your butt 
If you're light in the ass 
Close your eyes, and concentrate it's time to recognize 
The Ak keep brothers on checkmate 

Check over there, and then check over here 
Just lend me your ear, c'mon listen 

Nigga you just can't defeat me 
Child abusers walk around, knowin they just can't beat me 
So don't try to take the winner's belt 
Aiyyo this ain't April 1st so don't dare fool yourself 
It don't get no liver, I'm hittin harder than a chastiser 
I flip rhymes like saliva, poundin on your BRAIN 
With the sick shit I'm SAYING 
I got more GAME than a panhandler on a TRAIN 
Huh, it's rare if I don't catch props 
I'm the Ak I tear that ass out the frame like a benzie box 
You know the rules if you ain't ruff 
Stay on the hush and get played like Sunday school shoes 
and get scuffed, I put heads to bed like newlyweds 
Sing your rap eulogy 
'cause now you're good as dead 
Hit the deck, once I round it off like a Tec 
I play you like a game of chess and keep your ass in check 
Checkmate 

Check all around, and then check for them clowns 
Check the fuckin real sound, break down 

In English, MC's can't last 
Similar to a car crash, I got rap in a smash 
Whenever you want to get loose and hang out 
Remember I done turned enough troops into The Last Boy Scout 
Think you'll last? Then come try 
Otherwise make like a librarian and keep your ass quiet 
I'm out to catch the winner's cup 
All you number one contenders just got knocked to the runner's up 
What nigga what? I'm blowin up the spot with dynamite 
rhymes by the Ak 
Airports they amazed to me 
Shit 'cause I fly so much heads yah have my own travel agency 
Rap's are fat like SUMO, slammin like JUDO 
I won't get abused like numbers, I'm MENUDO 
I got the art down pat, pass the courderoy 
this bad boy about to start to slack 
Fuck how ""I could just kill a maaaan"" 
I'm slick and puttin brothers out with these Edward Niggahands 
Ten fingers of death, grippin micraphones 
Holdin my own, sparkin rhymes up like grindstones 
Rippin up challengers 
Creating a mess on stage out of comedian rappers like Gallagher 
My mind is filthier than a HAMPER 
Dirty like a CAMPER 
On top of that I've been through more shit than PAMPERS 
Fake is what I ain't 
But Constantine the Great, don't know me from a can of paint 
Listen to how the soundwaves vibrate 
You can't relate, I got your whole brain on checkmate 

Rob Swift is his name, with Akineyle in the game 
You're best to maintain, as we aim for your brain 
as we aim for your brain (3x)",Checkmate
Akinyele,"My vocals sound dynamic when placed on track 
Me wack? Your local mechanic couldn't even fix his mouth to say that 
I'll make a rapper change his occupation 
And have him selling hot dogs if he ain't saying nathan' 
I wait for challengers to pick a day to beef 
I'm not a calendar- 
I'll knock your ass to the middle of next week (next week) 
Leaving you OUTDATED, I'm are-RATED 
Niggas on my dick was to fall off if I was to get CASTRATED 
No need to explain 
I'm doper than heroin, so just take my name in vain 
You can't follow the Ak's footmarks 
I'll throw your raps in a shoebox and let the bullshit WALK! 
I straighten up those who be slacking up 
In other words I'm not a film director 
So don't come over here acting up 
You know just who I AM 
This ain't the DAMN Macho MAN Wrestling PROGRAM 
Over here you get SLAMMED on the premises 
remember this, the name Akenyele it don't rhyme with Genesis 
I'm not the one to get played 
This ain't the arcade 
Pull over here and you'll find your fingers in the yellow page 
You can't hang with the kid 
My lrics are so bad they're only taught in school 600 
So all you rappers keep eyeing me 
But just admire me 
And write this shit in your diary 

Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple) 
Write it in your book, kid 
Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple) 
Put it on your pages 
Dear, dear diary (I kicked it plain and simple) 
Write it in your book, kid 
Dear, dear diary...check it out 

Yo Rob Swift! (Rob Swift gets business) x4 

All you got to do is just set it 
Better yet act like you want it and see if you don't get it 
I walk over rappers like doormats 
Save all that Nino Brown chat for all them other New Jacks 
In your CITY, with your whole damn COMMITTEE 
Your butt-ass rhymes are all SHITTY 
So don't riff cause I'm in a class by myself 
Make like a ventriloquist, talk that shit someplace else 
Lyrics you pick are all simple 
And all like swift to come out your face like a dam pimple 
But just so you can't follow this 
My rhymes penetrate to the skin just like a dermatologist 
Best to head to the CLINIC 
Cause Akenyele's style about to spread like an EPIDEMIC 
I don't talk past the speed LIMIT 
One style's a GIMMICK 
I won't change up because I'm not a SCHIZOPHRENIC 
Pushing a wooden box 
6 foot 6 is what you catch if you step to the Ak 
I kill a rapper's better one sec 
If he ever play me like an accident and think he can catch wreck 
Shit (sheee...) 
Once I COMBINE ya, here's another REMINDER 
Niggas can get stomped down to CHINA 
In other words get that ass kicked 
I'll send your wack baby-ass raps right back to pediactrics 
Play the back before you get smacked 
Ask like a Lumberjack, I come from the projects of Lefrack 
AK to the NEL 
Don't give a HELL who you want to TELL 
Not an intercom but my name rings BELLS 
So all you rappers c'mon, if you want to start trying me 
But write this shit in your diary",Dear Diary
Akinyele,"I want to get out this relationship 
But I'm scared that my man will flip 
He always swears how he's gonna kill me 
And fill me with the bullets from his clip 

[Verse 1] 
I met her in Queens her personality was erotic 
She asked me where I come from, and I just replied ""The projects"" 
Love at first sight as she was staring 
Checking me up and down, yeah, at the gear that I was wearing 
I had an office jacket, Polo shirt, diamond on my hand 
Stonewashed pants ticked inside of some Timberlands 
Her eyes just stayed on my face 
She threw her hand on my hip and felt the four-fifths on my waist 
Yo, my name is Ak the hard rock shit that shot a cop with a glock 
Cause he tried to make the money STOP 
She didn't speak, she didn't START, she didn't TALK 
All of the sudden let's take a WALK through the PARK 
But it was dark, she didn't bother 
She probably thought I was trying to play her out 
Like a Central Park jogger 
But that's not my style that's what I'm telling ya 
Give me your number and I'll probably call you up on my cellular 
At night we spoke for hours and hours and hours and hours 
Hot convo turned into cold showers 
Monogamy, yo, increased to pornography 
Miss Astrologist because she looked like a star to me 
But I be dressing sharper than those brothers with Farrakahan 
Throwing a lucky charm without a leprachaun's arm 
Out on the streets dealing and sticking up 
I try to make her look appealing 
I went out and started tricking bucks 
I got her all dressed up, she used to look messed up 
Now all of her friends can't wait to be next up 
I need to get her thoughts fixed up 
She fell into a blender, she got the stuff all mixed up 
She caught me talking about a quits 
But that's that old bullshit 
It's ain't over til I say it's over, miss 
So if you want to catch a fit, you catch a melon split 
Once you in there ain't no exit 

Chorus 

[Verse 2] 
I talk a good game of pain 
Put it in your ear and let it rain 
Benadryl can't stop the migrane 
Once my voice touch your brain 
So you can talk that fast slang dialect 
But I got a tec to keep you in check 
Other words make you come correct 
Think that to stop giving the loving 
You must be smoking pestacide because you're damn sure bugging 
After one hit you're ready to split 
What, are you test crashing cars? 
That's that ol' dumb dumb shit 
You don't flatter me tring to sign off 
You best to take the batteries out your watch if you want some time off 
I write my name on your street curb 
So you can scratchmy letetrs girl if you want to mark my words 
I got the Calimyne BESIDE ME 
In case you want to TRY ME 
And break out on my ass like poison IVY 
You better take it or ease, roll up you sleeves 
And prepare to go all out like New Year's Eve 
Trying to take my dough like a Swaggart 
Girl, I have to bag ya and fall on your head like Niagra 
Shit, you're bound to catch it, once I start flexing 
Ayo bum bitch there ain't no exit 

Chorus",No Exit
Akinyele,"Yeah yeah everything's real!

[Chorus]
I got all my life to live
And I got so much love to give
But I gotta survive, and make papes outta state
I'm ready to make papes outta state, man
I got all my life to live
And I got so much love to give
But I gotta survive, and make papes outta state
I'm ready to make papes outta state

Ak to the Nel to the LE, I'm tryin' hard as hell
To pick my future before my future picks me
Twenty-one years of AGE, not with minimum wage
Don't ever seem like I'ma get paid rhymin' on the stage
College, I always dreamt of tryin it; the only problem here
I don't seem to meet financial aid requirements
Locked writin' rhymes in the crib when would I get out?
Seems like I'm pushin' yo a hip-hop bid
At home the vibes don't feel right
My parents keep lookin' at me as if I'm some type of parasite
My moms separated from her spouse
The oldest of two kids, it's my job to play man of the house
That means gettin' off my ass, makin' immediate cash
That broke shit, save it for an orthopedic cast
I get road maps, learned the interstate
Shit I'm headed out state to make papes man

[Chorus]

I'm ready to get up on a scam trip
The I-95 outta state to make the damn loot flip!
First I need a crackhead with a credit card
So he can head uptown and purchase me a rented car
Just make sure that it's black
And take off the rear view mirrors cause it ain't no lookin' back
I'm goin' one deep, in the driver's seat
Throwin' the vegetarian book cause I'm ready for beef
I got a three-hundred and fifty-seven, faren-degrees-heit
Of heat, better known as a burner on the street
Cool, I got the keys to the CAR
Accelerate on the gas, and have the rubber burn up
On the TAR, I'm out to get money real far
I hear my moms voice, {singing} ""I'm wishin on a star!!""
But I got to go far ma! {sing} ""But I could wonder where you are!""
On the streets just deliverin' packages
So I can just relax and get some type of livin'
Think that it is when it isn't
Easy to see a family, suffer from povery, as bein given
Man, like heck, and when I get back
I'ma rip up them welfare checks
I got a new nine to five mom, so don't wait up late
My job's located outta state

[Chorus]

I reached my destiny and my goal
I done flashed right past the dumb-ass highway patrol
If everything goes well I'm in it to win it
I'm tryin' to find a hotel so I can rest up for a minute
A round of crackheads gonna show me -- neighborhood clowns 
Fear me up and down cause they really don't know me
But all my hits, I see them scopin' out the clip
They want to get open, I can let shit rip!
Whatever is broke got to be fixed, twenty dimes and nicks
Step into my house made of bricks
My man gave me work, home on credit
You think that I'm comin' back?  Tch, black he can forget it
'Cause I got moves to bake, no time to be fake
Bad enough gotta watch out for a snake called Jake
Money nonstop, kept in the hush
At twelve o'clock, I'ma catch, huh, the midnight bus
And watch the dough flow like water
I'm not Taco Bell but hell I'ma make a run for the border
I feel odd, like a extraterrestrial left alone
A calling card number, so I could phone home
To let my people know my mission went great
On my great escape to outta state

Rest in peace to my little brother Donnie Boy
Rest in peace to my man Rakim
Rest in peace to my man, named Understanding
Rest in peace, umm, to Atiba
Rest in peace to my man Wilson from Exena Street
Rest in peace, to all my other peeps
Also rest in peace, to my man T-Bone
You know I ain't forget you
Yeah yeah, and I'm and I'm and I'm
And I'm and I'm out!!",Outta State

You know we goin Worldwide this tour
'Cause yo you know how that go

That's how we gon' bring it to you
We gon' go all around the world

Word up, my man Rhasaan in the house
We gon' bring it to y'all like this, word up
Just give it to 'em Ak  uhh

I been in and out all areas
And all you true hip-hop fans, you know the Ak's takin care of ya
Slap your ass with real rap
I keep it underground, like subways, so I can stay on track
I'm not a carpenter, but I'll cut the rug
Think you can hang with Ak?  Ha, that's your brain on drugs
Smack fire out your ass like a flag from Backdraft
Didn't peep the movie, you don't know the half
Schoolin' MC's until they start learnin'
We don't gotta be Mississippi to watch the Ak start Burning
I kick that shit that's known to hit
So much rap lines, you might fuck around and hang clothes on it
But yo it ain't no thing in it, your static-free rhymes
That you kick, need to be kicked, cause it doesn't got no cling in it
Then you turn around and start singin' it
Hard Akinyele be brought, so I'm here to start bringin' it
First cannibalistic rhymer, eatin' bitch niggaz
By the statistics, like, Jeffery Dahmer's
Huh, scrapin' you like a sculpture, murder you for the vulture
My dozen dirty, my brains be donated to agri-culture
So come on and face it, my skills are like medicine nigga
You just don't want to taste it
You best to slide to the side, another corner of the map
'Cause this here is worldwide

[Repeat x4]
Worldwide yeah yeah 

Put them tired rhymes to bed, and loosen up your laces
Your shoes are too tight, and now it's goin to your head
Me you feel you can pull with
Remember that I'm not a matador, so get off that bull-shit
I put rappers and singers in they place
A real rudeboy with the raz', I write it all over your face
Leavin' you bloodier than a MaxiPad
Crayola crayons, they'd have to Color Me Badd
So play like a midget and forget it
'Cause I put oil to the fire, like an arsonist
When it comes time to set it
I get more run than an athletic
Sharp as a hyper-dermic
Lyrics are flavored up like a dia-betic
I recoups, and they try to step to this
Nowadays I probably have as much kids as Jerry Lewis
My rhymes drip like a razor, punch like Joe Frazier
I don't sell shoes, because I don't believe in favors
Ducks better break North, before I start
Baggin' that ass, like a motherfuckin' washcloth
Winnin' battles cause I'm a hip-hop soldier
Act like you know, and fuck what your girl told ya
No bluff, for years I've been in this
A nine to five employee don't got shit on me
'Cause I done stepped to nuff rapper business
Beggin' for for-giveness
Channel 7 news and people from Jehovah done witnesses
The whole Akinyele vibe
You know what I'm sayin kid, this here is worldwide

[Reapeat x4]
Worldwide yeah yeah 

Ak not catchin' wreck, come the fuck on
Ring the alarm, I drop bombs like the Guard in Vietnam
I kick that shit, niggaz dream to write
My brain so hot that it ignites, but you can't see the light
Fast rappers can't speed by this, you better slow down
Because I'm puttin' the brakes on your ass like Midas
Nope, it don't matter what type of slang you drop
I give you rope and you still can't hang with the Ak
For years I put ears through therapy
Watch a episode of Cheers before you come try the beer with me
I graduated from lobbies, bangin' on walls for a hobby
I battle anybody, even a dead body
I got rhymes that would attack ya
So you better watch your back, or fuckin' hire a chiropractor
Ain't nuthin change from before, slap niggaz with mani-cures
Stomp you down, after a pedi-cure
Here's another lesson, I'm not a quiz
So that talk about me not gettin' biz that's out of the question
It's a Ak, jam, god damn don't get slammed
You catch the backhand, word to my dead man
You best to rest if you want peace
'Cause like a hooker from up the street, I'm down for beef
I'm hotter than a sauna again the drama is rugged
Word to Sinead O'Connor, I be tearin' shit up
'Cause I sprayin' immaculate, like a Mac-11

I take you to London, worldwide
I take you to Europe, worldwide
Come back to Queens, worldwide
I take you to Russia, worldwide
I take it to the North pole, worldwide
I bring it back to Queens
I give it to 'em, worldwide
I take it to the West Indies
I give it to 'em, worldwide

Akinyele,"My name is Akinyele, I be rolling like Pirellis
Knocking niggas out the box like skullies, taking hoes directly to the telly
Make them scream my name two times like Pelle, Pelle
Then I put her on they belly, play it cool like Fonzerelli

From New York to L.A. will they sell they body to me to escape poverty?
Before I started boning chicks, I used to watch the porno flicks
And every night I fucked that same Yoko Ono chick

Anything to get wet, I guess I was just young, sad and blue
Like the Lissette cassette, the world made me like this
Girls very rare gave me a kiss, pulling my dick out only to piss

Now the tables switched and turned no nigga's straight
Like a perm, bank I earn, no time to learn, one girl
Give me all of them, I'll have a ball with them
And when we do change the numbers, so they don't call again

We probably see them at the mall again or the dance hall again
Fuck it if they with it we could do it all again
You're a true baller when they treat you like a King like Solomon
Fuck them like you quarellin'
Who pussy, who pussy? Now bring the chorus in

He's your ho, you know he's your ho
He rocks three different chicks after every show
He's your ho, you know he's your ho
How do you know? 'Cause I told you so
He's your ho

I don't want to be a ho like no more, more, more
I'm ready to find some girl that I can save my love for, for
Complexion

You'll be dick sucking, clit fucking
My dick stuck in your back, gonna find it back
'Cause we heard that you like it like that
So when your man's finished bring your fucking ass back
'Cause he's your ho

He's your ho, you know he's your ho
He rocks three different chicks after every show
He's your ho, you know he's your ho
How do you know? 'Cause I told you so
He's your ho

Go fuck her, then come fuck me
Well, you're shit out of luck 'cause this bitch ain't free
I had a fat piece of twat and it must get bust
But you're hoing everywhere and you want your dick sucked

And you want to come home, pass diseases to me
Have me scratching my pussy like I'm looking for fleas
But I'm not your ho bitch
And you can't fuck me around, 'cause you're a ho

He's your ho, you know he's your ho
He rocks three different chicks after every show
He's your ho, you know he's your ho
How do you know? 'Cause I told you so
He's your ho

One hoe, one hoe, 'cause all I need is one
One hoe, one hoe, 'cause all we need is one
One hoe, one hoe, listen, 'cause all I need is one
One hoe, one hoe

My dream's like martin luther to be the king of this shit
Makin g's and parlay, plus goin on vacations
Overseas, like them dudes who play for the cba
You can catch I, on the streets of n.y.
On some caterpillar shit, dressin butter, lookin fly
Money bulgin out my pocket, cause it just can't fit
Movin like outfielders, cause I'm carryin knits
Even with suits on, or boots on
Gees give me the pee for free like a luke song
Akafella drop dead, holdin dough up in my paws
While y'all make a little bit of bread like croutons
It's on

[ verse 2 (satirizing busta rhymes in a tribe called quest's 'scenario') ]
As I combine all of my love in you girls
Heel up, wheel up, gobble my nuts like squirrels
Powerful impact - boom! - in the pussy
Grabbin, screamin, she starts to push me
But I just kept on lovin
All in a sudden I started comin
Oh my gosh! oh my gosh!
This girl was hairy like that man sasqwash
Ugh-ugh-ugh, that's all that we said
Man, ugh, pardon me, ugh - back on the bed
As I turned her over, I said ""I beg your pardon""
Tried to stick in in her butt, the girl kept on fartin
Pfrr-pf-pf-pfrr - like the human beatbox
Pumpin that ass up just like reebocks
As I turned her over, I said ""I beg your pardon""
Try to put it in her mouth, but the girl kept on maulin
Rrraw, rrraw, like captain caveman
My dick on her breast, and her chest just caved in

Chorus (4x)
My coochie is soo juuicy, yeah 

This right here is for all the girls 
who i used to talk to who didn't amount to be shit in life. 
You know what I'm sayin? All the girls who used to call 
their man on me when I was in front of the building 
just tryin' to get their numbers, 
try'na put my seed up in 'em, you know..
All the girls who gave me a wrong number 
when I just asked them for their fuckin' phone number 
tryin' to call 'em and hook up for a date and all that shit... 
All the girls who left me in restaurants eatin'...
talkin 'bout they gonna use the phone 
and left me with the fuckin bill....

HA! It was all a dream, I used to read Playboy magazine,
Niggaz gettin' their dick licked with whipped cream
Women from all places, no matter what their race is,
Mami want to put punani where your face is
I said ""Ha, Whut?"" Put my face by her trap
Smoke weed, bamboo, lick her in her private spot
Way back before niggaz even started smokin' crack
They used to act, proooo black
Remember Brand Nubian, 'One for all'
Who ever thought Akinyele would get paid for grabbin' his balls
Now I'm in the strip bar, big rap star
Time to get laid, which one of y'all girls want to get paid?
The lieu..tenant, sit behind windows tinted,
Remember when I used to push cars that was rented
Now I cop the drop top, made their hearts stop
Drive another block , they be like ""yo, that was Ak!""
Huah! I stay away from the A-I-D,
pack condoms like guns 'cause that's the way I be,
One love to the late great Easy E
Larry Flynt, Hugh Heffner, and Ron Jeremy
Huah! I get pussy you know how I do,
call the crib last four numbers, ten-eighty-two
What the fuck??

My coochie is soo juuiicy, yeah (4x)

I can take the girl from the local streets
and take her to Cancun and fuck her on the beach
and I'm far from cheap, I make sure all my niggas get laid,
Open your legs girl, make some way, Hey-ay!
Around the way they used to diss me, girls never kiss me,
 Now they writing letters how they miss me,
I never thought that hard work could pay off and shit,
I was too used to jerkin' off and shit
Now the hunnies play me close, like the butter play the toast,
When I'm grabbin 'em, I'll be baggin' them like a Coach
Condos in Queens, head blown for weeks
Feelin' up the cheeks of the 'put it in ya mouth' freaks
Raw sex is what I fear, so I pack condoms when it comes to this here
I hump bitch! A bunch of bitchs grabbed the family jewels,
considered a fool 'cause i get more ass than a mule
Stereotype of a perverted nigga misunderstood....and its still all good

Chorus (9x)

Yea this for all the girls when I used to call they house 
they see my number on the caller ID 
and they never pick up the phone..fuck you...
This for all the girls when I call 'em 
they answer their phone like ""Hello"" and when I say 
""Its Ak"" they act like their fuckin 'sleep..
yeah fuck you...

Bring a ruckas and I'll start shitting on you motherfuckers

Make you whisper like those motherfucking temptations is out
Hey yea
I end careers
By the pier like pliers
This mic get iced once I cream niggas like wires
Paper weight fires
Play them both sides of the fence like barbed wires
But I will make your whole entire empire retire
Once I'm dressed in army atire
All you hear is repeated gun fire
Leaving your chest heated like clunky dryers

We came to fuck you right on up
So if you want to
Get up 
I'll bust you down
We came to fuck you right on up

Even on a blind date
You couldn't get with me
I'll put these hot ass tecs on your neck
And give you permanent hickies
Leave you in lakes like Ricky
Think that I was distributing whisky
The way niggas be riding on me tipsy
The rhyme chief maker, hittin punch lines 
like a rapper who slammed his sister loose leaf paper
It don't get no better than this
I got that medicine
For rock veterans
I'm bad to the bone like skeletons
Or some dracula shit
Biting mics turning niggas into vampires
Cause they can't get no light huh
Kid can't you tell
That it's the Aki-NYELE
I be holding this shit down like a bucket ina well
Jammed like hell
And plus I rock your dome without stones
The black stallion
Pack the certified chrome to make you think I'm Italian
From the way that I roam
I drunk and stuck the microphones like BOOOO
Niggas think it's dial tones
And start looking for Miss Jones
You clones
Are soft like foam
I like rap superstars out of their twilight ass zone
Like doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
When n n n n n
What the hell you think it's the AK
You be like huh what
Like I'm yelling it's my beat huh what

Get up

Akinyele,"[Chorus]
How do you feel now that you know you cheated on me
Was she as good goody goody good as can be
How do you feel knowing that I know
And how do you feel cause I'm out the door
And how do you feel knowing that I cheated on you to

And did she get you open with a 69
Doggy style that's from the back and from behind
Now did she do you well
Did she go down low
Did she take it fast or did she take it slow
See my guy he did me and he did me well
He kissed my lips
He touched my tits and then my panties fell
With some cherry jello and the cool whip cream
I feel man dick go up inside of me

[Chorus]

Now did she get you open with a second round
On the bed the chair or maybe on the ground
Was it as good as good as you though it'd be
Did the skinny amateur even compare to me
When my guy got finished with his love and flow
He showed me many many things that you didn't know
And by the time we reached found 44
It took his time laid me down and we made love some more

[Chorus]

Ha now I didn't even mean to cheat on your pussy
I found another lady who said she'd fuck me for free
And I didn't even like have to eat her out
The first thing she put this dick up in her mouth
Now I'm not saying that I was loving the chick
I was a little astonished from the way she ws sucking the dick
Do get me wrong later on I'll probably be fucking the chick
Get on some Donald shit
Then start ducking the chick
Now the motherfucking moral of the story is
You cheat on me I'll cheat on you that's just how it is
My new sweetie she know I don't come speedy
Before she give me long head like nephrotite
Now what we do with me and you don't go tell he or she
Keep it to yourself like Monica Lewinsky
So we don't blow trial
Or get caught up
When we cheating in the night cause we get hard up
Keep the guards up
When you creeping through
Cause all the bitches that cheat this song's for you
And all the niggas that cheat this song's for you
And everybody that cheat's this song's for you
It goes

Sky's the limit and you know that you
Could have what you want or be what you want
But make sure you live to be everything you say
(?) just doesn't take it away
And yo sky's the limit and you know that you
Could have what you want or be what you want
We never ran we never will
We dressed to kill
Because Sky's the limit and we take why'all

[Akinyele]
Yo before you niggas ain't know match
For this Jimi Hendrix guitar type of nigga with no strings attached
I create, nothing less than great
With my mind stuffed and messed around

Have you niggas break your fucking rewind button
I kill this shit
Similar to guns and clips
When niggas from street corners light fire high bricks

Keep you shaking inyour pants when the guns behind your ear
Get you deaf enough cause you fools wil paralyze a pair
When the Ak start rocking
I put you in that Puff

Daddy mode and keep your while motherfucking back bopping
It's the Ak-nel
But you could catch me maxing that movie about the dog
'Cause I rock with them

I serve rappers like Wimbleton
All I need is a pad and pencil in
Watch me put niggas on the crusher like incylin
Is the Ak-why

Watch me throwing Adolph Hitler signs cause why'all cannot see
Get it Nazi
As in not see me son
Like that great job slash d.v 1 division

I run these streets like traffic police
Walking with irons so I can straighten out beef like a priest
Even without an automatic
I still beat niggas down

Like (?) used to do in 85
Who'd of known they not (?)
I'm ill like that
It's the Aka', Harley Davidson rocker

Because I propel like choppers on top a helicopter
So tell me who the fuck know how to rock this right
And for lyricist of the year
How the fuck you ain't pronounce my damn name right

I'm in it, to win it
Because

[Hook]

[Akinyele]
I make (?) degree patches
Have orgasms on top of flower pots
In other words the ladies know that Ak's the cream of the crop
Ready to rock this mic like crack vows

Nigga ow
Take it back
Like that first movie from (?) Freddy
'Cause I got a wild style

The challenger
(?) from Metallica
Got heavy metal locked
Just so I can watch you punks get rocked

I be stressing you
With Jessica
As we walk all through you're city like damn messengers
So put me through a test like the tubes

Fuck the food
You no longer have to sneeze for the Ak to bless you
As I step to the rhyme biters
You know them cats

Who write their raps in aztec
'Cause they all copywriters
It only take Ak one second eith Ak mic checkings
For Ak to start wrecking

'Cause Ak be representing for
The ral niggas like O.J. did
And Ak told the seconds
'Cause we in it

To win it
I said we in it
To win it
Hey yo we in it

Well I feel

Oh yes you will be lickin' my dick tonight

My zipper went zip
I put my pants to my hips
She put her thumbs up like the father said
I was like 'shit, i dislike her'
She got her thumbs in the air like a hitch hiker
Ready to fight her
But instead I chill
I looked her in tha grill and said

Oh yes you will be lickin' my dick tonight
Oh no I motherfucking won't

Ha, yo
I picked my condescending booker
I put my nuts by your chin so when you look up
I'll be on top of you doin' Bobby Brown push-ups
When you give me head lift your toosh up
When I said what I said 'you should have seen when her whole face pushed up'
She said 'huh,what,ill'

You would swear that she want it from the way she kiss my stomach [huh]
I couldn't wait to start cummin' from it
Imagine if she doin' it like she gettin' blunted
You know, French kissin', puttin' her tongue on it
And then she stopped
And I was like 'doggone it'
Stop actin scared like my house haunted

Oh yes you will be lickin' my dick tonight

I said 'boo, do me and I do you'
She said 'OK, go first, then I do you'
Well I do like the pussy
And you do lick the dick
(And I do do do do do) If this is true (anything for you)

Oh yes you will be lickin' my dick tonight
Oh no I motherfucking won't

Lickin' a dick or lickin' a clit
If we do it together, we on some sixty-nine shit
Lickin' a dick or lickin' a clit
I know mad chicks who ACT like they don't lick dick
Lickin' a dick or lickin' a clit
If I had to pick

Oh yes you will be lickin' my dick tonight

No I won't (I don't do that)

Would they fuck them three girls from 702?
Would Erykah Badu fuck them two righteous dudes
>From the Brand Nubian crew and include Grand Pu?
Did Mary J. Blige ever fuck Case and Nas?
Was ??? ever comin on Kimberly Drummond?

Did Laverne and Shirley ever fuck Carmine?
Was Gina and Pam humpin on Martin?

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

Still, my tongue tied young bride

It's hard to say it

I hate to say it, but it's probably me

And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal

No one would you see
You ask yourself, who could it be
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free

I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way

You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die

It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
The jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die

I'm young in my heart still
I've never been confined see

Now I'm headed to the county,
Gotta do a bid here, im used to living luxurous,
I don't wana live here, the walls is gray the clothes is orange,
The phones is broke, the food is garbage,
A lot a niggas is livin with these circumstances,
Sp's the same i still murk ya manz'z ,
Drug money to rap money work advances,
Niggas ran and told that i shoulda murked to kansas,
Niga got popped for a murda attempt,
Knocked me on d block when i was burning the hemph,
Had a brick in the stash hope they don't take to a further extent,

Go and hit the bar when the reds be out,
Cant wait for the day when they let me out,

Cuz visitation no longer comes by,
Seems like they forgot about me,

Barrel cockin' it immaculate
Learn to move packages in n out of Los Angeles
We savages, bustin' off rounds sprayin' banana clips
Knockin' pills off like Anna Nicole Smith
Shit, I'm in the hood walkin' with choppers
Cock em and pop em coppers glauks be talkin' like
Blockedie block, block I'll probably popped Hoffa and possibly jus forgot where I tossed em
This niggas obnoxious, me and top got your picture in the cockpit
She wanna pit stop, jus see how the cock spit
These boss's deposit the profit they watch as we cop it on top of the ostrich and fox's
It use to be the lil guys in stress now Ima boss where I'm from, with the last stress on my chest

If it ain't a 600 big body then the 6 4-0 honey is spokin'

Still money passed around like we takin' an offerin'
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
When they see the sad happy faces they know the drama is on
Its the west coast back at your front door
We up close and personal, we ain't done till the curtains close
Could be friend or foe, love it or hate it

See when I walk through the door
I wonderin' why these fake Niggas jackin' me for?
On display like I came from the store
Posin' like a mannequin in front of your hoe
Up front blockin' 151 peep now
Convicts Surround the whole compound
Cause you don't really want what your starin' at
Clip full of Bullets, don't mind sharin' that thing

You're an alcoholic
You're an alcoholic red nose reindeer like Rudolph
I'm here to tear the roof off
And if you want to take it to the guns, I'ma shoot off

Your head before you reach for the pistol
And when the bartender turns around I'ma reach for the Cristal
You not ready for this style, I'm straight Psycho wit it
And I bet you in love with, yeah Psycho hit it

A long time ago, I'ma keep doing my thizzle
Till it's time to go, but for now it's time to blow
Good as me in the club popping bubbly
I can't complain life is lovely
Either you hate me or you love me

Fans wanna know when the Nuts is gonna come next
It doesn't matter competition is no contest
I don't mean to brag, I'm just being honest
Where my dogs at smoking up at the college?

Clap your hands to the beat and get your bounce on
Put your drinks up, if your blazing get you ounce on
Girl I'd house you, but this ain't no house song
And no kissing, I dunno what you had your mouth on

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your, booty, booty I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Look, don't approach me in a physical manner
'Cause the cannon I'm holding ain't a digital camera
And I don't care less about women and glamor
Or which one of you rappers is lifting his hammer

I'ma get loose like a pair of pajamas
I speak through those switches, spit like Obama
Trying to get rich without guns and the scanner
Thats A to the K with a fucking bandanna

Seize your empire, believe in no lies
Squeeze the deserties like Jesus inside her
Spit like the shit on my teeth is barbwire
Make your girl suck cock till her knees are on fire

That's it though, no more games
This one right here is gonna blow your brains
If you in the club you better hold your chain
Cause I'm bugging and I just might stomp your frame

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

I won't no not today
I won't cause I came too far

Devil's always watchin' me (watching me)
Evil's always stalkin' me (stopping me)
God has been protecting me (protecting me)
And that's how I got this far
Cause when you look at me you'll see an angel
Can't believe I've been through half the things that I went through
Cause everyday I see a face (my face)
This come true by the human race (my race)
Please don't you judge me unless you know me
Cause I won't let you

You know where I come from
The place where your fate is a mic
Or a bull, or a dum dum
A jail cell, a pine box
And brothers is dumb young
Young boys
Still bustin' guns for the slum
That they come from
Cops is the only ones they gon' run from
That's it
They puttin' they hood up
But nine out of ten of us ain't got good luck
You gon' ride on a man and catch twenty-five
Or get hit and get sent to the other side
You lose both sides of the coin
So me, I play the hood, baby
Not in the
Mama got a little church I could join
But I didn't go yet
Man got a mosque I could join
But I didn't go yet
Cool with the devil on my back
I'm in cold sweats
'Bout to do some dirt
In some dirty black old sweats
If you known, you should've shown the way
Most of the hood 'bout to get blown away

'Cause I was raised up to show no fear
Cowardly hearts'll never last long here
If you ain't man enough to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
'Cause I done seen the block break down tears
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years
Tryin' not to get blown away

See, I ain't never shot nobody
But I'm known for fightin'
So when I strike, man
You'll think you been struck by lightning
Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga
Even a child could take a life by pullin' the trigga
Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion
So you target in the distance and keep on blastin'
They say guns don't kill people, people do
So when you're hit, man
You feel that shit the evils do
Can't see myself get beat down
My eyes swollen
Mom's cryin', they don't know what happened
My pride's stolen
If I ain't got my heat, then I got a blade
That hit ya off

[Chorus]

Keep my eye out for jakes
Ears to the streets
Other eye out for snakes
And these scandalous freaks
If we ain't on good terms
Don't bother to speak
Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me
Same thing'll make ya laugh will make ya cry
And while this nigga quiet nigga, he'll take ya life
Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice
If somebody else could travel
Through the tunnel of life
'Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there
When you're ridin'
But I'll stay to myself
So if you see me out there
With a bear we fightin'
Then, nigga, go help the bear

Where the weak die and the strong survive
Prepare to suffer forty days and forty nights

Just another journey, another journey into time

Just another journey

Walking through the dirty streets of Jersey
A dollar to my name searchin' for that chee
I'm tryin' not to reincorinate my past
Retired from the game, took another path

Destination ninety five dirty south
Where the Devil tried to realter my route
Creator took me by the hand and led the way
To make the story short that's why I'm here today

Just another journey, another journey into time
Just another journey
Who ever thought I'd cross this line

What about that day you said I wouldn't amount to shit
And about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks
What about that time you said I wouldn't make a dime
And about that time you said I couldn't make you mine

Destination to the bank overseas
Where Akon's treated like royalty

Akon,"As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things I have done
And things that have not occurred yet
And the things they don't want to take responsibility for

I'm sorry for the times I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect

I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I am in the streets like everyday
Sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

I understand that there are some problems
And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

Sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
Sorry that you had to go and sell those packs
Just trying to stay busy till you heard from Dad
And you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though Pops treated us like kids

He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away

I understand that there are some problems
And I am not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

You can put the blame on me

Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry that it took so long to see
They were dead wrong trying to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl trying to have fun
Her daddy should never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a twenty one and older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you

And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me","Sorry, Blame It on Me [*]"

Looking like one of them puttie-cat dolls

Steps upstage, didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, shes like, ""you're""

No time to waste, back to my place

And you think nothing of it
I never meant to argue with you, please forgive
Girl I need you in my life and the reason is

(Chorus)
Ya see my moonshine
She keeps me warm when it rains
I forget my problems when she eases the pain
And my friends keep telling me to call it a day
She don't love ya Savage, it's all in your brain
See I don't believe a word
That you say to my face
I'm in love and I know she feels the same
I'll buy you all the ice you want
And I'll keep you safe
Man I love my alcohol, what more can I say

Get you excited and call her boyfriend up

From Senegal West Africa
To St. Louis, Missouri,
Thanks to Katherine Dunham
For giving my pops his glory.
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want.
Mom came a little after,
Gave birth to my brother.
Then all of the pressure
Made 'em fight one another.
See, the pain would never last,
Did the best with what they had,
He knew the world was out for grabs
And he searched to find his

Everything I have, (have) everything I own,
All my mistakes, girl, you already know.
I wanna be free, (free) I wanna be free, (free) yeah.

As a kid I never knew
I'd have to hustle just to make it through.
So, I found myself skipping school,
'Cause the girls don't think I'm cool.
And because of that I didn't care
Whether or not I went to jail,
I just wanna be treated fair,
'Cause that's all I ever knew.
Tellin' me I need to slow down, (slow down)
'Cause everybody in the whole town, (whole town)
'Cause they know how I get down, (get down)
Foreigner from another town. (whole town)
Can you believe we still around? (slow down)
After so many hit the ground. (the ground)
And we ain't gonna stop now, (stop now)
Until we get that

Put your hands up, (hey) put your hands up. (hey)

Never knew a girl could be so god damn cold,
I know, the way she move got me spendin' my dough
And yo, If you would've seen what I seen on that pole
Just know,

That I was wrong for fallin' in love
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(Don't do it yo')

I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)

But I just went against the grain
It was a feelin' I can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singin' in my face like

Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me every day
Singin in my face like
Diddy-duhdee doo-dah-day

Look at me, I'm stuck
That bubble in my pants got me caught up
I never, had no luck
Thinkin' with the wrong head got me jumpin' out there
With no glove
It feels so good had me sprung out all messed up
Now I'm stuck

That's what I get for fallin' in love
That's what I get for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)
That's what I get for fallin' in love
(Don't do it yo')

That's what I get for fallin in love

So thick, so raw
That oil all over her body stole my heart
I'm caught,
The way she drop down won't allow me to close my drawers
'Cause I'm, already in love and I knew better from the start
Oh No,

I was wrong for fallin in love
I was wrong for fallin in love

I was wrong for fallin in love

You ain't got to match with the shoes
All about knowing you I'm into doing things to keep her longer
Stickin' together forever, watch you grow stronger

I made the mark on February 1st
Between me and you you can call it birth
The beginning of our universe
Remind me of Alicia keys verse
I'm falling for you
I wish I had an opportunity to not do
What I did to hurt you
Now I'm here living with regrets

I know that it was my fault,
I know that I got caught,
So please don't loose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me
I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you
So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
To your heart

Get the calendar go to August 3rd first words
Stay we heard our first words
First argument gotta let it go
Cause it could possibly affect what our future holds
Flipping pages now famous thinking back I aint seen you in ages
Wishing that I could of made it less painless
Brings me back right back to the same as

I know that it was my fault,
I know that I got caught,
So please don't loose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me
I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you
So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
To your heart

January February March April May
June July August is just another day,
September October November trying to find a way
In December to mark my calendar to meet again
If only we can go to that place where me and you know,
There's no faith fronting cheating even lying,
The time has come where we stand face to face

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you
So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
To your heart

That step right next to your heart

Akon,"I am here at the crossroad
I got my life as heading I don't know.
Should I stay or should I go
Because everything is better then I been trough
What I would get to get inside my mind for fun
Letting me know that everything should be OK
I wish someone can pull me out of the mud
When anyone out there say to me

I feel, For you
Don't worry 'cause I've got you
Don't trip
Don't stress
My life seems to be headed
Over the edge
Over the edge
Over the edge
Over the edge

Now everyday that goes by,
I see things that makes another man cry
I'm sitting wondering why
I can't find that someone to fit in my life
I was searching, But damn it was worth it
And did she every think I was good enough for her
Despite my suffering I come to loving, That she was
There when I needed her the most.
And that is the sound I received from above letting me,
Know that everything is going to be OK
And that she was that someone that pull me out of the mud
Ad also the one who said to me

I feel, For you
Don't worry 'cause I've got you
Don't trip
Don't stress
My life seems to be headed
Over the edge
Over the edge
Over the edge

I feel, For you
Don't worry 'cause I've got you

Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
'Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way
And now I look forward to every day (welcome to my sunny day)

Block don't stop always stayed hot
No matter how the seasons got
I still remember when they took me away
Kept it on lock den I got caught den I realized dat I had to stop
Den I took the time to explore a better way

Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know, there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way
And now I look forward to every day

A better day
Welcome to my sunny day

Every day

Welcome to my sunny day

Been a long day
On my way to my holy place to pray
Give thanks for every blessing given to me
I know there's more to see, more to me, no more living in misery
Cause this is how I visioned life to be

Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know, there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way
And now I look forward to every day

I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time

Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
That I can do
Gotta keep my baby girl laced up in the latest and the fliest suits
Never one for none, lets get cake up, hold it down, that's all you gotta do
Then I walk up in the place, with a pocket full of money, my brother like, I outta do
Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now

That's the type of girl I want around me
Even though I'm a with her, make a man feel free
Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese
Look like something you would see on TV
She don't mind climbing up that ladder
Similar to the words, it don?t matter
But this time they wanna see us together

Now she wants to start holding on me, like whatever she's smoking on

Never judge a nigga before you judge yourself
You ain't got to help me
Nigga help yourself
They got me up in here
I don't know what they're talking
Well tell them I'm the mob
I don't own them
I'll take the sugar sharks
They can't breathe out the water
I'll tear your ass apart and put you out of order

This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on (no shoes on)
Don't wanna struggle, oh no
Don't want it to become a habit
I've been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody",Hurt Somebody [Edited Version] [Edit]

You want this whopper come and get your beef n****
I'm not a boxer I'm be brief n****
Were on top I will put you underneath n****s
We will take your whole tribe and I'm the chief n****
Your highest title numero uno
I'm not that little pregnant white girl but juno
You no anything within a n**** reach
My dogs will bite you and guess who the n**** leash
I was once told by my n**** Meach
You feed a sucka' he just grow to be a bigger leach
So everytime you hear mine get your hand to your hairline

And I promise my fellows will put your fellow on a canvas
Call me Wezezy F baby Young Money army, betta' yet Navy

Now watch me let that sexy Nina kiss you by my ribs
You won't be satisfied till I send a missile by your crib
Shoot you in the stomach now your pissin' out your ears

And if you come searchin' then your finding out the hard way (ugh)
No matter where your from you better recognize a real
N**** when you see one

Why you look so good, but I ain't ever seen you smile
Got a man that defined you, everything in this world
But I guess he ain't loving you right, girl, no

Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, you're one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I wonder if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder

What he's doing with a girl like you
I wanna know, know, know, know
You're too fine to be looking so blue

With a body like that, girl, you've been his, ain't fair
See, I will love you all time and all around town, I swear
I can see that he ain't been hitting that at night
One ride with me would change your life oh

Ákos,"Hello, hello
Újra itt vagyok
Vissza kellett jönnöm hozzád
És lehet, hogy maradok
Tudom, tudom
Nem láttál rég
Bármit is mondasz, szemedben
A megértés tüze ég
Én szóra váltanám a gondolatot
De félek, hogy nem érdekel
Sajnos nem állnak össze a mondatok
Én nem ide jöttem
Nem ezt akartam
Reményt kaptam csak az útra
Én, az örök átutazó
Azt, hogy minden bûnöm megbocsájtható
Hello, hello
Nem tûntem el
Csak egy távoli bolygón jártam
Lehúnyt szemekkel
De kinyílt lassan e szem
Most is rád ragyog
Könny reszket benne:
Látom, hogy vak vagyok
Én szóra váltanám a gondolatot
De félek, hogy nem érdekel
Sajnos nem állnak össze a mondatok
Én nem ide jöttem
Nem ezt akartam
Reményt kaptam csak az útra
Én, az örök átutazó
Azt, hogy minden bûnöm megbocsájtható
Hello, hello
Én a régi vagyok
Tévedésbôl jöttem a Földre
És félek, hogy itt ragadok
Hiszed vagy nem
Egyszer hazajutok
Nem látsz majd többé
Hiányozni fogok
Én szóra váltanám a gondolatot
De félek, hogy nem érdekel
Sajnos nem állnak össze a mondatok
Én nem ide jöttem
Nem ezt akartam

Akrobatik,"Yeah the weight is over y'all, finally
Yo I'm glad you bought this disc right here
It's my debut LP my name is Akrobatik and the album of course is called Balance
I'm glad you decided to join me on
Yo, I just want to bring a little balance to the game cause you know
Too much of one thing is not good
Especially when it's some...but we ain't gonna get into that
Right now I just want to take a minute to shout out
All the cats that lended their creative talents and soundscape to this album
Cause I think they deserve being off right now
Big up to my man T. the Beat Specialist, this is him right here check him out
Yeah big up to Fakts One, big up my men Edan, Illmind, DJ Sense, Mr. Lif
Big up to a true legend Diamond D, waddup big bro?
To my men The Accomplice Ray Fernandes, DJ Therapy
My man holdin' it down on the west coast DJ Revolution
Big up to the BK representing the Beatminerz
And last but not least my man D-Tension
Oh oh and I made one of them beats too joining Lif, why'know what I'm sayin'
Check it out! But enough talking let's get down to business, let's go

(Verse 1: Akrobatik)
Yo! Prepare for the ride
Cause you just found yourself a product that got somethin' real inside
Take the Time to Remind Your Soul about when brothers used to rhyme right
When it wasn't all about the Limelight
These clowns make me wonder where the Cooler Headz are runnin' to
We gotta be The Hand That Rocks The Crandle for the Woman II
Livin' in the city oh you can't be a Hypocrite
You can't Front with your Steps not even a little bit
Always Bet On Ak to Crush the Feedback
Makin' moves with my peoples as we Wreck Dem tracks
I did it all for you when I was up for the challenge
So Here And Now I present to you BALANCE!",Prelude to Balance

Ladies... and gentlemen... it is now... star time
Let us begin
It's star time time to shine let's begin
Open your mind and let Ak-er-o in
My style come from deeper than Neptune
Akrobatik came to bring the boom from next tomb to next tomb
Old school like Space Invaders or Asteroids
Akrobatik that's the boy he bring the rap world joy
I bring the joy but I can also show the heinous
Of your brain in a darker black hole than Uranus
I swing it for my queen 'cause she love me like Venus
That's Aphrodite blacks rock your afro tightly
This year I hold heads don't take Akro lightly
I rip shit in the Milkyway the stars are unsightly
Deliverin messages with the speed of Mercury
Sonin' emcees like Zeus did to Hercules
I'm breakin shit down to moondust line by line
It's star time so shine

Shine shine shine it's star time
Shine shine shine it's star time

Shine shine shine like moonlight
My style will run a ring around the world like Satur-in
With ill lyric Patter-in
So hot that all the mercury is splatterin'
My brain cells are large like Jupiter
While other kids mentality get stupider and stupider
Talkin 'bout their street star wars
Can't rock for eight bars eyes redder than Mars
Put that rapper on the spot if I don't see that he's tight
Then I'll shower his platoon with verbal meteorites
I'm not the type to sweat what the media writes
Emcees is way off like Pluto 'cause they feed into hype
A lot of kids heads blow up like supernovas
But Ak's down to earth so I maintain worth

Akrobatik,"I've got a question
I've got a question

Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We been lookin' for months and we ain't found nothin'
Please Mr. President, tell us something
We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing!

How unfortunate, it wasn't what you thought it kid, in basic training
They taught you how to slay man as a start-up kit
and you showed up with a gun to load up
Hopin' a college education's waitin', maybe a steady occupation
Now you're weighing many lives against yours
President orders, got you on course, with holocaust, Sargent is lost
General's boss, plans cross, now you in the crosshair
of a sniper's shaky scared, shot of your ear
All fucked up now! one round just hit him in his from some young yet expendable citizen
He's from the other side of the line, fightin' for time
Time to see his kids walk, time to talk with his pops
Time to have a rational thought without the thought of bein' shot
(Damn) his gun jammed now you gotta bombart
It's a soldier's suicide slide know you tried hard to stay alive
When you're catching fire from both sides
and we miss you at home, its time the government truly left you alone
Dropped you off and popped one in your dome
Now we've seen it in Iraq and the Congo America's motto
""Kill their leader then we build a stronghold!!""

Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We been lookin' for months and we ain't found nothin'
Please Mr. President, tell us something
We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing!

I never thought of this the day that I enlisted
That I'd be dodging bullets, seekin' weapons that never even existed
For someone else's personal beef, I risk myself
While the Commander-in-Chief, would never come to fight himself
I feel I'm bein' tricked even worse that the civilians
Nobody ever told me that we would be killin' children!!
Feelin' like the ones that sent me here are the psychotics
but if I say that out loud -- I'm ""unpatriotic""
but would Donald Rumsfeld back me up with the chrome?
Would Tom Ridge fight or would he stay secure back home?
and would Condoleeza Rice cover grenades in a fox hole?
I'm startin' to believe what I was told is not so
What's the reason for the war?
I'm shootin' at these people that I got not animosity for
I wonder if I'm just a pawn in someone else's struggle
or a here even though I'm just a small piece of the puzzle
I know that when I finally return where I reside
I'll make up for the months my wife and moms cried
and carry on for all my fallen brothers that died
but you can't take my pride 'cause I'm a fuckin' SOLDIER

Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We been lookin' for months and we ain't found nothin'
Please Mr. President, tell us something
We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing!

Uta madre, mejor que se vayan a ver ganzitos no

Por la manera que me visto
El modo que camino, 
El gusto que yo tengo de cerveza why no de vino
Me pasan criticando, a quien vi why con quien ando
Que anoche me llamaron la jura me anda buscando
Que me la paso en la calle
Que por eso mismo
No encuentro jale
A que cabrones, no dejan vivir agusto
El dia que me muera les voy a sacar un susto 
Pero en otro rollo, si quisiera preguntar
Quien chingados dio permiso de mi vida criticar
Soy el unico, original en este mundo
Un poco osicon why el pensamiento profudo
En este caso les tendre que placticar 
Porque la vida de un cabron no se vive a lo normal
So ya la saben, no es cuestion pa que se claven, 
Despacios todos juntos como si fuera un ….. 

Mi gusto es, quien me lo va quitar
Hast que yo me muera nadie lo puede parar
Solamente Dios del cielo me lo quita
Disfruta de lo bueno de la vida por ahorita (X2)

Por hay me dicen que les caigo mal a unos 
Es lo de menos, no tienen nada mas que celos
Son cosas que no me importan mi atencion soy yo, 
why dale gracias a mi jefe por los huevos que me dio
Me critican por todo solo digo la verdad, 
Si te ofendes aqui va tu amistad por la ventana
Dicen que por la joyas que yo traigo
Devo de andar vendiendo algo, no hay pedo
Sigo adelante como me gusta
Hasta tu vieja a mi me busca
Pregunta ques lo que tengo yo que tu no tienes,
Es carros, feria why dos tres mas mujeres.
No es pa que te aguites, es para ensenarte
Que hay cosas mas importantes no crees
No gastes mas energia en odiarme
Este es mi vida why mi gusto mejor trata de olvidarme

Como la ves pinche raza nomas anda buscando aver que le allan a uno, pa criticarlo


Mi gusto es, quien me lo va quitar
Hast que yo me muera nadie lo puede parar
Solamente Dios del cielo me lo quita
Disfruta de lo bueno de la vida por ahorita (X2)

Anda animate, ven why ponte en mi lugar, 
Mi mundo va rodeando why nada lo puede parar
A lo macho, yo nunca me porto gacho
Los fines de semana me la paso bien borracho
Creas que aguantes, mejor piensalo muy bien
Son mis gustos escandalosos como el tren 
Sin recores, voy rompiendo corazones
Arriba todos ellos que comprenden mis razones

Las cosas que yo traigo no vienen simpre
Nomas estas pinches squinkles que me siguen
Todo lo demas es duro jale neta
Agarrate los huevos why apprieta  
Si te dicen de otro modo, mandalos a ver galavision
Gente asi acava en el panteon
Has lo que tu quieras pero goza de tu vida
why pon tu raza bien arriba

muy avansado para un guey

Vivo mi vida why diario yo reposo con un 
par de morras con viejas pero no esposos
why me puedes allar en la calle con cualquier
tipo gastando feria con mi equipo

Parese que me hice padrote mis bolsas no estimo asta cambie la moda que camino
si piensas que soy falso, ponteme de frente, 
te pongo estos punos en tus dientes.

why no me jusgues a mi mundo, mi mundo no es fijo 
le acabo de dar feria a las jefas de mis hijos 
why aqui estoy elejible pa' las mujeres primero cumplir con mis deberes.

Como te puedo pagar, todo lo que haces por mi 
todo lo feliz que soy, todo este grande amor (2x)

A pasado mucho tiempo, mucho mucho tiempo 
doy gracias que todo he conquistado, no miento
pa' que seguir sufriendo por alguien, que feliz es solamente siendo infiel, si.

El juego de la vida nunca se me olvida why esto es puro estilo como la bebida , estranarte no es cuestion de explicar , es tristesa verte en tu final.

Chorus(2x)

pa' que maldesirte mejor debo agradeser why doy gracias por que tu me hicistes ver , tras de cada mentira que te pase, me ensenaste todo lo que pudiste hacer.

Desilucion para ti lo que logre, yo soy hombre why esto no parare, no te pasa, el vato te conduce con la raza manera de seguir en la masa

Asta aqui estoy bien no me paso en la esquina soy el mismo perro que salio de la neblina why aqui hacer ruido con la voz mas alta, a mi me sobra lo que te falta

Cuando no stoy en la casa me suena el celular
Apenas de mire ayer y no te puedes aplacar
Ya sabes mi situacion no te salgas del calson
Yo no te debo nada para darte una razon
Donde voy, donde vengo, donde estoy no te interesa
Con que te compre algo pa'que no tengas tristesa
No preguntes con quien hando y quien es ella
Ya sabes cuando quieras mi cañon rompa mi estrella
No soy solo tuyo y bien lo sabes no mas porque no me allas
No es razon pa'que te claves cuantas veces te tengo que explicar
Que pa'que yo este contento nesecito un par y como no estoy amarado
Deja de chingar! yo sigo siendo el ausente y no voy a parar.

Partir de nuestro ojar por lo que te han diciendo
A las voces no hagas caso ni a lo que diga la gente
Me quieres fucilar na mas por que handaba ausente
Te no guste o no te guste decidimos hasta el fin
Me veas pelon a rapa o me veas de malandrin
Te veo de hoy en ocho cosa que me vala madres
Tambien tu no te fijes ni le expliques a tus padres
Ya sabes la rutina no estoy so no me busques
Te explico cuando llege con tus chikles y tus dulces
Como dicen mejor pedir perdon que permiso
Tengo mis guevos puetos y a nadien me le humiyo

Respeta tu papito y me saludas a mi nene

Cuando veas otras tocarme son amigas con derechos
Que yo les doy a ti te toca mañana pero por el dia de hoy
Ya no marques este numero hando por alli
Pero si quieres te llamo para decirte ""hi""
Y para confirmar mañana que te mirare
Pero aguas con tu vato te las tienes que esconder

Las ganas me hacen falta neta
Por handar de callejero
Tomando entre las barras handando de mujeriego
Por eso mismo no me quieren tus papas
Yo no me murtifico y ademas
Nada yo pido de nadien vivo como yo se
Cuando a mi me de la gana llegare!
Tambien no handes mitoteando mis negosios
De eso no sabes nada por un eror haci

Reconocía que eres toda una mujer que tonton fui pensar que nunca te iba perder  cera que lo tiena todo a mi modo pensaba compartir contigo ya ni modo 
Nunca desconfié  de ti a si no poco esperaba que me Abas a mentir  a que fuiste todo para mi savia  que todo cavaría en el tiempo de tu partido manejando loco borracho  por tu censa a un lado penasamento por tu ya no eras mía por tu ya no eras mía so ya adelante de nadie puedo conferías fuerte corazón pero es difícil olvidar.


Un que no puedes ver yo te esperare si que bien te lastima siempre te recurade yo culpable siempre fui pero eso estoy aquí dame otro portunida no quiero estar sin ti 


Desde el día te fuiste se me cavón los problemas why ya mi vida le cameranos
Los temas eras la única mujer que yo quiero why por tus modo fui heredo tienas todo  que una mujer quisiera de  un hombre 
Buscaba como why por donde darte lo que tu siempre as quiera a tu modo why té valo dejar me solo hesité lo que hesité  why a cual quiera hesité why todavía en mi cara mi dijeste  que yo era el único que tu quieras why en mi espalda te reías lo es fui mi misma culpa que yo tuve por andar en mi nubes ira hecho lo posible por nosotros pero la misma ves tes tuve comparando con otros no crees

Akwid,"El tiempo es ahora
De tenerlos bien puestos

Llego la hora de enfrentarte con tu oponente
Todo se ve obscuro entre la gente, 
No busques la salida piensa en tu movida si
Tiempo de desahogarte de esta pinche vida
Bueno mano me pusieron en este dia de hoy
Lo que tengo si muero te lo doy
Maneras me hacen falta pa lansarme con mis punos
Un hombre no conoce de rasgunos
Dos brazos dos manos dos codos why dies dedos
Reventar toda la madre si eso es lo de menos
Pa subir arriba hay que ser el ganador
Ni miedo ni conosco de dolor
En este mundo nadas sirve (no)
Siempre hay que estar al brinco
Porque unos compas no se animan sin los otros cinco
Todo en la linea tienes que representar 
Ni modo te los tienes que agarrar

Para subir arriba no hare falta una escalera
Maneras me hacen falta pa seguir.…..
Para llegar al lo alto no hacen falta un par de alas
El mundo se revela entre las caras (X2)

Agarrate bien traigo peso como un tren
Des hacer al que me cruce no me importa con quien
Se me quiera poner al brinco aqui estoy
Piensas que porque me crusas voy a parar donde voy
Mi camino es marcado why no me puedes parar (huh)
Yo naci para ganar (haste)
Nunca acepto una derrota me sacudo why me levanto
Cualquier cabron yo le aguanto 
Pa lo que yo triago no hay remedio why nunca lo avera
Terminara cuando yo muera
why dudo que sea pronto soy duro como el fierro
Atrevete why tu mundo cierro
No creo que desaguantes
Eres echo de papel, te rompo te arrugo why te tiro como aquel
Que trato de dominarme why no pudo 
Para estas broncos yo no sudo

Para subir arriba no hare falta una escalera
Maneras me hacen falta pa seguir.…..
Para llegar al lo alto no hacen falta un par de alas
El mundo se revela entre las caras

Cuando esta todo en la linea hay que saber representar asi, que no

Mas de dies maneras (si) de expresarme por total, pelon super natural
Batallando con las curves que la vida me dejo
Peleando con las manos del reloj
Sin querer queriendo (que) tengo que seguirme riendo
Pisando fuerte para no seguir sufriendo
Sigueme viendo mira lo que estoy haciendo
Los muros de la vida deshaciendo (ooooh)
Ya que sientes pura lumbre en la cara 
why que te lleva la chigada
Para otra vez trata de pensarlo dos veces antes
De que me ponga yo mis guantes
Haste de mi cara no quiero ver lo que te hice
Boltea para el espejo why ayi tu me lo dices
Podrias ver parado why evitado 
Es lo que pasa cuando me camino es crusado 

Para subir arriba no hare falta una escalera
Maneras me hacen falta pa seguir.…..
Para llegar al lo alto no hacen falta un par de alas
El mundo se revela entre las caras

Cuando me miras asi, se lo que quieres de mi
Sientes ganas de amar mi cuerpo quieres tocar
Cuando me miras asi me pones loca por ti
Tu ojos quieren ver tus labios quieren morder

Primeramente de todo devo decir halgo
Desde muy joven me pasado buscando
Lo dulce nunca lo dejo pasar, why las haynas me hacen hasta cantar
Lo que verdad me vuelve loco why me hare sentir como un dios 
Son las piernas, caderas why los labios
why esa briantina si devo de ser derecho, 
Me encanta cuando lucen en tus pechos

Vieras como loco me traes me esplota la cabeza
Tengo que pausar con mi noblesa 
Quieres ser mi una ves quedarianos encantados
Lucen bien tus pechos implantados
Nadamas una ves como quieras a la vuelta
Tu vato nunca se dara cuanta
Es la cosa que me da vida, nomas para mi
Que me pone tentacion como un candy

Cuando me miras asi, se lo que quieres de mi
Sientes ganas de amar mi cuerpo quieres tocar
Cuando me miras asi me pones loca por ti
Tu ojos quieren ver tus labios quieren morder

Me puedes llamar delicado pero ya sabes como va
Me gustan las mexicanas gueras casi sin ropa
El trasero de “baum!” why los pechos de “whoa!”
Me tiene alta como humo
Tiene un olor que puede estas con ella noche why de dia
Ellas es mi fantasia
Listo paso para la pansa de los pantalones bajos
why su edad es otro caso
Me tienes frotandome las manos como si fuera una rata
Imaginandomela a gatas
Puede calentar a un perro why hacerme infiel
Asi como mueve la piel
Se le ve el brazier why se le nota que lo estira
why unas gorditas dicen que son de mentiras
Es tan exajerado que hasta me puse rojo
Echandome un taquito de ojo

Cuando me miras asi, se lo que quieres de mi
Sientes ganas de amar mi cuerpo quieres tocar
Cuando me miras asi me pones loca por ti
Tu ojos quieren ver tus labios quieren morder

Cuando me ves asi se lo quieres de mi
Sientes ganas de amar siento que quieres mas mi cuerpo quieres probar

Puedes mirar sin tocarlas son las reglas de juego
Seria une loquera enamorarme de nuevo
Viendo por la ventana rozando la baqueta
Subir a dos treces es la meta
Tentacion nunca me iso sufrir ven nena quieres ir
Tengo maneras de hacerte desvestir
Me tienes enloquecido en el modo que te meneas
why en verdad yo te haria donde quieras
Camina como si tuviera comezon en la espalda
Como quisiera rascarla
Ella me hare inios con la mano a la cadera
Con su mirada me encuera
Quiere que la haga respirar why que se lo haga en la mesa
why que la llame travieza
Dice que ella quiere ser mi dulce para mi ojo
why por esa razon la escojo

Cuando me miras asi, se lo que quieres de mi
Sientes ganas de amar mi cuerpo quieres tocar
Cuando me miras asi me pones loca por ti

Akwid,"Siempre que te pregunto que, como, cuando y donde? 
No me contestas, que quieres que te ruegue? 
Ya sabes que yo no estoy pa' rogarle a nadie, 
Hasta cuando no?mira deja y te explico algo

Por que será que, cada vez que te miro 
Te haces del rogar y de coraje yo me trago mi suspiro, 
Estas bonita y eso no lo niego para nada 
Pero en veces me tratas como nada, 
Cuando tú quieres, sola te me arrimas, 
Me confundo por que el rechazo me lastima, 
Mis sentimientos siempre te los he dicho 
Y tu no más por andar con tu capricho, 
Me la pones muy difícil, la situación 
Por eso la razón que te escribí esta canción 
Para explicarte, y que entiendas muy claro 
Que el día que te decidas tú dime y yo te aclaro, 
No se por que lo tienes que pensar tanto, 
Dime, vale la pena si me aguanto, 
Te decides por que ya no puede más mi corazón 
Y ya no quiero tu razón. 

Siempre que te pregunto que
Como, cuando y donde
Tu siempre me respondes
Quizás, quizás, quizás

A dos bloques de mi casa conozco a una morena, 
Todos mis compas la conocen a ella, 
Con ellos, se porta un poco seria 
Y conmigo, tal vez me preste alguna feria, 
Me encanta, pasearme por su casa, 
De todas sus amigas ella es la que mas me pasa, 
Pero siempre, que le digo que ondas cuando? 
Sonríe, y me dice no es pa’ tanto, 
Te digo, si la miras te enloqueces 
Por que a esta nena la he tratado ya por meses, 
Y sus ojos, están como los quiero, 
Se me hace que esta morenita, cayó del cielo, 
Yo quiero, que ya me deje pasar, 
Y deje, ya de hacerse del rogar, 
Se que quiere, pues también se pone roja 
Le tendré que dar por otro lado a ver si no se enoja. 

Siempre que te pregunto que
Como, cuando y donde? 
Tu siempre me respondes
Quizás, quizás, quizás

Que mas quieres, ya la he tratado de todos modos, su manera 
Dios mío, no nada no quieres nada 
La lleve al McDonald, le compre un Big Mac 
Su soda y todavía no quieres nada
No seas Fresa, no seas Naca

Por elevarme te la pasas platicando 
Preguntando, que con cuantas otras ando, 
Eso no es para que tú te preocupes, 
Que tu traes otros colgando es lo que supe, 
Se me hace que contigo ya no puedo, 
Prefiero tener nada mejor solo yo me quedo, 
Por que no buscas a alguien más para hacer menso 
Y así, esto yo ya no lo pienso 
Cada vez al preguntarle, me sale con cada excusa 
Y yo imaginándome otra cosa más sabrosa 
Es difícil, pero con ella me comporto, 
A veces pienso, no será que tiene otro 
Que la anda enamorando y conquistando como yo, 
Pues un poco mas cuidado si la neta tiene novio 
Y si no, pues a ver como le haré 
Por que esta chica de nuevo tiene que caer

Siempre que te pregunto que
Como, cuando y donde? 
Tu siempre me respondes 
Quizás, quizás, quizás","Como, Cuando y Donde"
Akwid,"Si, un tema muy diferente algo serio, no?
te recuerdas cuando estabamos juntos tu y yo?
teniamos un detallito, malentendidos
pensar que estariamos toda la vida juntos, solos sin despedidas
fue un engaño que yo mismo mereci
pensando que todo lo tuyo era para mi
decidiste jugar juegos y perdiste
y ahora te la pasas en la vida triste
cómo pensar hallar otro como yo
estas loca?, no existe en este mundo
fui el unico que te dio todo y te valió madre
y te awitas cuando me ves en la nave paseando
hoy lo que me admira es que quieres regresar
y me dices que soy yo el que quieres mas
yo te dañé tu corazón sin tratar
y por eso sé que no me puedes olvidar

Sé tu no puedes aunque intentes olvidarme
siempre volveras una y otra vez

Cómo he de hacer pa'olvidarte, niña mia
hoy te juro nunca mas volverme a enamorar
no miento sin recordar ningun momento sufrido
sigue con tu vida te lo pido
nada mas una vez se rompió mi corazón
tu decepción mi peor desilusion
y aquellos tiempos salieron por la ventana
mujeres como tu no valen nada
lamento pensar también que fuiste mia
y aquello que vivimos era solo una mentira
por eso mismo te conpuse esta canción
direccionada a tu falsa decisión
ya ves? cómo son las cosas
tiempo que pasé y ahora ¡todo me vale madre!
con este tema aveces siento que me quema
igual que cada trago que corre por mis venas

Sé tu no puedes aunque intentes olvidarme
siempre volveras una y otra vez

Si, cómo no? de ves en cuando
hay que hacer las cosas aunque nos valga madres
pero en esta ocasión se han volteado las cosas
y ahora.. qué sera de ti?

Mi intención no es de hacerte sentir mal
simple decirte todo lo bueno que perdiste
y no me hagas malas caras por decirte la verdad
te lo mereces y no te puedo esperar
ya no puedo ser el mismo o regresar contigo
eso con huevos te lo digo
por qué no buscas otro menso para hacer sufrir
y por el tiempo, asi te voy a dejar ir
que triste es recordar y no saber aprovechar
todas las cosas que siempre te quice dar
y ahora me ves cómo gozo de la vida
mientras que tu finges siendo la sufrida nada te queda
que mala suerte no lo crees?
porque las cosas se voltearon al revés
vive tu vida y déjame vivir la mia
crees que valió la pena tu mentira?

Sé tu no puedes aunque intentes olvidarme
siempre volveras una y otra vez",Tu Mentira
Akwid,"Anda y ve, lárgate con ese que te vi el otro día 
Que tú juras que él es toda tu alegría, no te lo creo 
Lo haces pá que me den celos
Enséñame que es real 
Y el pasado borraremos

Anda y ve, intenta de sentir lo mismo 
Que tu y yo tuvimos, y el amor que compartimos 
Estas llena de ilusiones 
Nada más quieres pasar el tiempo 
Y escoder tus emociones 

Anda y ve, con ese que le diste más lana 
Arrepentida vas ha estar en la mañana 
Extrañaras mi caricias y te darás cuenta 
Que solo son tus fantasías 

Anda y ve, y dale tu cuerpo si tu quieres 
Pero hay un detallito que quiero que consideres 
Cuando estés feliz y me trates de olvidar 
En todo lo que hagas me vas a imaginar 

Pero lo dudo por que hasta veces me has llorado 
Con un beso, llorando de alegría y no de miedo 
Y dudo que te pase igual con él 
Igual con él

Acabo de leer tu carta y me destroza, me presumes 
Que ya tienes otra cosa, otro hombre 
Que te sabe comprender y hace que te sientas 
Com una gran mujer

Anda y ve, vete con él por que te espera 
Que lindos se han de ver los dos como primavera 
Pero lo dudo y eso tenlo por seguro 
Por que el tiempo es duro 

Anda y ve, comentale otra vez que conmigo 
Te sentias flotando entre las nubes 
No es para presumirte nada, me lo decias tu 
Con cada mirada

Anda y ve, dile que estoy sorprendido 
Por que apagas tus sentimientos como cerillo
Que sencillo era todo 
Me pedías lo que querías y lo tenías

Ande y ve, también dile que gritabas mi nombr, 
Sentias morirte, ahora dices que lo amas, lo dudo 
Con mi corazón te lo juro

Pero lo dudo por que hasta veces me has llorado 
Con un beso, llorando de alegría y no de miedo
Y dudo que te pase igual con él 
Igual con él

(Lo dudo, no creo que con otro vayas a sentir) 
(Lo mismo que sentias conmigo, bien sabes que a mi)
(Hasta me has llorado con un beso, pero sabes que)
(Si quieres calarle, vete, pero lo dudo) 

Anda y ve, pero quiero que sepas que de regreso 
No te quiero, que esáas escarbando tu agujero 
Por que cuando realices lo que tu hisiste 
Me buscarás pero pa' mi tu ya te fuiste 

Anda y ve, adiós y te deso mucha suerte 
No creas que traté de detenerte, solo dije 
Lo que siento, ahí tú si mis palabras 
Se las dejas al viento, ojalá 
Y siquiera hayas aprendido, y sepas 
Apreciar lo que tenias conmigo 
Se te hizo como nada, yo fui el único presente 
Cuando te sentías abandonada

Anda y ve, vete corriendo, dile que lo amas 
Pero conmigo en tu pensamiento 
Lo bueno es que los nombres no se dicen 
Pero con tanto amor los dos se consienten 

Pero lo dudo por que hasta veces me has llorado 
Con un beso, llorando de alegría y no de miedo 
Y dudo que te pase igual con él 
Igual con él

Anda y ve 
Anda y ve",Anda y Ve
Akwid,"Uh, ¡que ondas wey!
Hoy sí que me la rifo neta
Tengo ganas de ponerme hasta la madre
Con mis weyes y mis weyas

Suena raro, pues, como crees
La única manera pa' bajarme el pinches estres
No sé si siento coraje o arrepiento
Quisiera regresar y detener el puto tiempo

No quiero nada más que compas y amigas
Chupe de lo que caiga pa' si te animas
Anduve mucho tiempo como perro del mal
Muchos de mis años fuero algo brutal

Creo que mi niñez, pues, no fue muy feliz
Y la vieja que ahora quiero, pues, me pinta de gris
A la gaver, pues, sé que es 1 poco tarde
Para reconciliar y pa' tratar de contemplarte

Estoy roto del pinche corazón
Estoy dolido y me dedico esta canción
A nadie más, más que a mí y solo a mí
Y sigo siendo el cabrón que siempre fui

Es lo que siento y te la dejo de tarea
Diviértete antes que suba la marea

Hay que tirar desmadre como no
Hay que ponernos locos todos y perder todo control
Hay que ponerle a todo y al [unverified]
Sentir la vida y sentir que si existo

Hay que ponerle toda la noche
Hay que perdernos sin guardar ningún reproche
Hay que vivir como el último día
Pase lo que pase y que siga la alegría

Se le acabaron los trucos y llegaron los jefes frescos
De la área 2 -13 pesados
Me tienen miedo los tramposos
Como si fuera 1 abogado

Cuando me echan la luz yo ilumino
Igual que mis discos de platino
Y ya llegue de donde andaba
Pa' calmarle el llanto a esas viejas que lloraban

Y no es que ande presumiendo soy orgulloso
Y disculpa si te ofendo 2 años y 1 par de meses
Avanzados como los pinches Japoneses
Este negocio está lleno de copiones
No comparan son puras decepciones
Todavía paseo bajo en mis asientos

Nomás que esta vez en un 600
Los odiosos me miran con coraje
Y por eso les hice este homenaje
Indio del rancho con Ingles
Y paisa así como me ves, wey

Hay que tirar desmadre como no
Hay que ponernos locos todos y perder todo control
Hay que ponerle a todo y al [unverified]
Sentir la vida y sentir que si existo

Hay que ponerle toda la noche
Hay que perdernos sin guardar ningún reproche
Hay que vivir como el último día
Pase lo que pase y que siga la alegría

Hey wey esta buena esa madre de
De ahí que echar desmadre ponernos locos eso
Es, esta bueno dilo, dilo pa' hay otra vez órale
Échale, wey, échale

Hay que tirar desmadre como no
Hay que ponernos locos todos y perder todo control
Hay que ponerle a todo y al [unverified]
Sentir la vida y sentir que si existo

Hay que ponerle toda la noche
Hay que perdernos sin guardar ningún reproche
Hay que vivir como el último día
Pase lo que pase y que siga la alegría

Esto es para bailar de brinquito
Aganes a 1 lado que ya me puse pedo 1 poquito
Nos la pasamos de weyes con el cheko
Juntos no ni 1 viaje andemos secos

Me encanta a mí las viejas
No te encabrones y enderézate las cejas
Ya sabes cómo somos los machos
O sicones mentirosos y borrachos
Sin embargo esta vez me declare machín
No me agüito y lo grito esto no tiene fin

Y es que lunes a viernes me la rajo trabajando
Los fines de semana son de puro contrabando
Cotorreando haber con quien y pa' donde
S600 gris todo sabor de la única manera de poderme salir
Con el resto del mundo y poder compartir

Hay que tirar desmadre como no
Hay que ponernos locos todos y perder todo control
Hay que ponerle a todo y al [unverified]
Sentir la vida y sentir que si existo

Hay que ponerle toda la noche
Hay que perdernos sin guardar ningún reproche
Hay que vivir como el último día
Pase lo que pase y que siga la alegría

Akwid,"Nunca le hemos dedicado una canción a los morros
So esta canción se las vamos a dedicar a ellos
Son historias, como nos las sabemos así que nunca digan
Que no hacemos nada para los niños

Escuchen he ahí les va

Desde niño yo he tenido cuentos pa' contar
Cosas medias atrevidas pero no vulgar
Algunas son mentiritas pero de a verdad
Déjame, te cuento dame otra oportunidad

Una vez en el bosque, me tope con un chavo
Era de palo con tirantes chapeados
Iba chiflando cargaba su mochila
Curioso yo le pregunte pa' donde iba

Iba de gira el cabrón
Se la había pintado por andar de mamon
Dijo que andaba en busca de una chinita
Porque caperucita le salió embarazadita

Me amenazo con sus pinches amiguitos
Son la pandilla de los tres cochinitos
Ya me conto que cuentearon al lobo
Que fue en defensa propia que fue por un robo

Sin darme cuenta olvide que era jueves
Tenía una cita con mi novia blanca nieves
Ponte las pilas me dijeron sus hermanos
Porque anda de caliente con uno de los enanos

Se me hiso noche y me puse a buscar
En el bosque donde me iba a quedar
Casa de citas bueno ya de menos
Era de pan con arcos de caramelo

Toque la puerta, salió una viejita
Tenía visita fumando una pipa
Me dijo joven que rollos no gusta
Tengo dos morros guisándose en la estufa

Desde niño yo he tenido cuentos pa' contar
Cosas medias atrevidas pero no vulgar
Algunas son mentiritas pero de a verdad
Déjame, te cuento dame otra opo

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Te la contaron mal guey
Pinocho no embarazo a caperucita
Ya todos saben que es flojita

A mí me contaron los enanos
Que es una bicicleta y le gustaban Mexicanos
Les pregunte que donde escucharon
Me contesto el mas menso que ya todos se la echaron

Que no sabiendo quien es
Iban a la clínica los jueyes a sacarse un test
Me quede medio espantado lo bueno
Que no saben que también me la había echado

Ojala y no me toque, ya la manosearon
Todos los compas aquí en el bloque
Y me contaron lo de la bella durmiente
Que es bien borracha y le gusta el ambiente

Según le hizo un hechizo a la viejita
Ni madres anoche andaba pueda agatitas
La vi en la fiesta con la cenicienta
Una morra pobre que antes era una sirvienta
Ahora pasa y ni le habla a la raza
Anda en un carro que parece calabaza

Son jaladoras y bonitas las muchachas
A mí se me hace que las dos son marimachas
Dicen que son amigas desde chiquitas
Y por eso se agasajan cuando se echan sus copitas

Es como me contaron a mí las historias
Y son exactas según a mis memorias
Nomás no estoy seguro del embarazo
A ver como chingados me va con este caso

Ja, ja, ja así es morros ojala y
Les haya gustado la canción
Que les dedicamos
Porque así es como nosotros
Nos acordamos de esas historias

Pero si ustedes se las saben de otra manera
O well, esto ya se acabo nosotros ya nos vamos
Guau bye, bye

Go-go boots and a leopard skin body suit

And you figure that quitters ain't never ever gonna win
And a couple of thorns might come with every blossom
But you ain't never have known a prick like him

Well just pack your pink suitcase with what you come with
And leave what ain't worth taking all behind

Al Anderson,"Black or white, blues or hillbilly

Every time I hear it, I'm as good as gone
Up or down, fast or real slow
That's all ya hear on my radio
I never get tired I can listen to it all night long

It scared a lot of people when it first hit town
They didn't understand it, they were puttin' it down
But it's lasted up until today and we're still rockin' around
And when they look back tryin' to figure it out
Where it came from, and what it's all about
It didn't come from outer space, it came from the south

It came from real hard work, sweat from the brow
From poor people just pushin' a plow
They made up a rhythm tryin' to pass the time
It came from the truth, it came from the heart
It came from an old flattop guitar
On a Saturday night, underneath the 'ol moonshine

It scared a lot of people when it first hit town
They didn't understand it, they were puttin' it down

Al Anderson,"Well, my first love was a little corvette
All done up in lipstick red
I thought it'd last forever till the motor blew
Well, I guess I didn't look close enough
It's a little bit just like falling in love
Looks don't mean a thing if the heart ain't true

It might be a cool ride, smooth lines,
Something been custom made out in Hollywood
But when you get done gazing at the outside
You better star checking out the inside
If you want a love built to last you better look real good
And see what's under the hood

Sporty little model standing by the door
So I took her for a spin on the old dance floor
Headlights shining bright but nobody home
Now I need something that's more my speed
Got a whole lotta time to find what I need
So I put her in park and headed on off for home

Cool wind in my hair 
Warm smell of colitas 
Rising up through the air 
Up ahead in the distance 
I saw a shimmering light 
My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim 
I had to stop for the night 
There she stood in the doorway 
I heard the mission bell 
And I was thinking to myself 
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell 
Then she lit up a candle 
And she showed me the way 
There were voices down the corridor 
I thought I heard them say

She's got the bright red Benz
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys 
That she calls friends 
How they dance in the courtyard 
Sweet summer sweat 
Some dance to remember 
Some dance to forget 
So I called up the Captain 
Please bring me my wine 
He said 
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969 
And still those voices are calling from far away 
Wake you up in the middle of the night

Pink champagne on ice

We are all just prisoners here 
Of our own device 
And in the master's chambers 
They gathered for the feast 
They stab it with their steely knives 
But they just can't kill the beast

Nostalgia, nostalgia canaglia
Che ti prende proprio quando non vuoi

E un incendio che non spegni mai

Di un paese che sogna e che sbaglia

Sempre di più
Guardi lontano e perdi un po' di ciò che sei
E poi perché un'avventura è bella solo per metà

Al Bano,"Il passato è come un vecchio 
Che non ha niente da dire 
Il dolore è come un letto 
Dove non so più dormire 
Metterò le mie speranze 
Sopra il nostro davanzale 
Come rossi tulipani che ritornano a sbocciare 

E prima o poi 
Tornerai lungo la strada 
Che attraversa la mia vita 
Curerò con le carezze 
La tua anima ferita 
E guardandoci negli occhi 
Scopriremo dolcemente 
Che far finta di lasciarci non è poi servito a niente 

Per te 
Chiederò alla primavera 
Di fermarsi tutto l'anno 
Ti darò filtri d'amore senza trucchi senza inganno 
Per rientrare nel tuo cuore 

Poi ti aiuterò a volermi bene 
Fino all'ultimo domani 
Come il primo giorno insieme 
Sorridendo al dolore 
Così come si fa se è vero amore 

Gli anni passano per tutti 
E anche noi siamo cambiati 
Più padroni del destino 
Forse meno innamorati 
Ora è più di una speranza 
Ritornare come prima 
Quando mano nella mano ci svegliammo una mattina 

E dai 
Richiamiamo i vecchi amici 
Invitiamo anche I parenti 
Tutti in abiti eleganti forse pazzi ma felici 
E gridiamo a tutti quanti 

Io ti aiuterò a volermi bene 
Fino all'ultimo domani 
Come il primo giorno insieme 
Sorridendo al dolore

The sleepless nights I've had about the boy.

On the silver screen,
He melts my foolish heart in ev'ry single scene,
Although I'm quite aware that here and there,
Are traces of a cad about the boy.

Lord knows I'm not a fool girl,
I really shouldn't care.
Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirl,
In the flurry of her first affair.

Will it ever cloy?

And all because I'm mad about the boy.",Mad About the Boy

If love must have it's day, then
As it came, let it go

No, no remorse, no regrets
We should part exactly as we met
Just easy come, easy go

We never dreamt of romantic dangers
But now that it ends, let's be friends
And not two strangers

Easy come, easy go, here we are
So darling au revoir
It's easy come, easy go

It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream 
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind

Love is a feeling that's a friend of mine (love)

When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim 'My God, how great Thou art'

Al Green,"
Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see.
 
'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.
 
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home.
 
The Lord has promised good to me.
His Word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.
 
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.

I'd eventually go
And take you for the Lord of my life?

How did you stand the shame
When they laughed at your name
Your Father felt such pain
Well how'd you take it
