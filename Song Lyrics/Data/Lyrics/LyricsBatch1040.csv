Miles Davis,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Miles Davis,"Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you
 
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
'Round wonderful you!","Just You, Just Me [#]"
Miles Davis,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you 
Just the way you look tonight.

Mm, mm, mm, mm,
Just the way you look tonight",The Way You Look Tonight
Miles Davis,"Won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems,
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-sirree
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues

Basin Street, oh Basin Street
Is the street, mama 
New Orleans, land of dreams",Basin Street Blues
Miles Davis,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast",I Fall in Love Too Easily
Miles Davis,"I'm gonna love you
Like no one's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
Deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true
If you'll let me

You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
And won't it be fine?

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

I'm gonna love you
Like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together
And won't it be fine?

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine",Come Rain or Come Shine
Miles Davis,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon",East of the Sun
Miles Davis,"Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending
Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo
Goodnight my love, your little Dutch dolly is yawning
Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day
Your doggy's fast asleep, my but he's smart
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight my love
",Goodnight My Love
Miles Davis,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night
Miles Davis,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Miles Davis,"Hello baby, I had to call you on the phone
Hello baby, I had to call you on the phone
`Cause I feel so lonesome
And daddy wants his baby home

It's a down-right rotten,
Low down dirty shame
It's a down right rotten
low down dirty shame
The way that you're treatin' poor me
I know I'm not to blame

Jelly jelly jelly
Jelly stays on my mind
Jelly jelly jelly
Jelly stays on my mind
Jelly roll killed my pappy,
And wrung my mama stone blind.",Jelly Jelly
Miles Davis,"You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'
I don't know why
I stay home each night
When you say you phone
You don't and I'm left alone.

Sing the blues and sighin'
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear
I must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't, for can't you see
What you mean to me",Mean to Me
Miles Davis,"Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
I know it drives you crazy
When I pretend you don't exist
When I'd like to lean in close
And run my hands against your lips
Though we haven't even spoken
Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Don't worry I'm not looking at you 
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
I know you see me see you
As you see me walk on past
When there's nothing more I'd like to do
Then come in close and hear you laugh
Though we haven't even spoken
Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Yea whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Hmm whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home",Whispering
Miles Davis,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru [Version]
Miles Davis,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""",52nd Street Theme
Miles Davis,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Don't go nowhere

Miles Davis,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?",How Deep Is the Ocean
Miles Davis,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Miles Davis,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight

Miles Davis,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Miles Davis,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Miles Davis,"Of the wonderful things that you get out of life there are four.
And they may not be many but nobody needs any more.
Of the many facts making the list of life,
Truth takes the lead.
And to relax knowing the gist of life,
It's truth you need.

Then the second is honor and happiness makes number three.
When you put them together you know what the last one must be.
Baby so truth, honor and happiness
And one thing more,
Meaning only wonderful, wonderful love that'll make four.

Miles Davis,"Back home again in Indiana,
And it seems that I can see
The gleamin' candlelight,
Still shinin' bright,
Through the sycamores for me.

The new mown hay sends all its fragrance
From the fields I used to roam.
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
Then I long for my Indiana home.

Oh, I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea,
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me;
A vision fair I see,
Again I long to be;

Back home again in Indiana,
And it seems that I can see

Miles Davis,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood

Miles Davis,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low

Will she answer agin today or pray that love'll kick it?

Kick it love, mama gettin' busy
Got no time 4 games

She just got a pair of tickets to the opera in her mind
No applause, no encore if she dies

Kick it love, visions of her childhood
When her heart was gold

Die before you're old? Kick it love, covenants of promise lay before your eyes
Stick wicked will trick you, lick you, then it kicks you aside!

When you wake up sticky wicked don't go away

Miles Davis,"It begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Miles Donahue,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Miles Donahue,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

Miles Donahue,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Miles Donahue,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Miles Donahue,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings
Miles Donahue,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Miles Donahue,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

Miles Donahue,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Warmer than winds of June

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

I could live without love

It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

Like I'm under inspection
I always get a ten 'cause I'm built like that

I go through guys like money flying out the hands

I'll tell ya I'm not here to sell ya

The 7 things I hate about you (oh you)
You're vain, your games, you're insecure

You make me laugh, you make me cry

And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now
Is your sincere apology

If you text it, I'll delete it

I probably should mention

Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
And when we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry

And all night long, we'll turn it up
And we'll dance

When the night says hello
Yeah, get ready to go
Turn it up, turn it loose
Yeah, you've got no excuse
Just take a chance
Get out on the floor and dance

Let's dance, what the weekend
What the night is all about
Let's dance, grab your girlfriends
Grab your boyfriend, sweat it out

Let's dance, move your whole body
Let's start the party to much rock for
One girl can make her go crazy
I need someone to dance with me, baby

Ever bring you down
No, no, no, no

So let's make it rock
Life's what you make it
So come on, come on, come on, everybody now

Why be sad broken hearted?
There's so much to do
Life is hard or it's a party
The choice is up to you

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now 
It's the same old same old

It's the same old, same grind
But we don't feel we're wasting time
Not so bored that we can't find a better way
My friends, my kind
No one's gettin' left behind
If they did, it'd be a crime
That's why we say
Let the music start a revolution
No time to play it safe

[Chorus]

They can't
We can
Parents might not understand
Having fun without a plan
But that's what we do
We're all here (Let's go!)
Gotta make this party grow
Together we can make it blow
Right through the roof
The music's gonna start a revolution
Too late to play it safe

We don't have to paint by numbers
Let our voice come out from under
Hear it rise
Feel the thunder
It's time to lose control

Miley Cyrus,"Sometimes I walk a little faster
In the school hallway
Just to get next to you
Some days I spend a little extra
Time in the morning
Just to impress you

Guess you don't notice
Guess you don't need this
Sad you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a rock star

Sometimes I wish when the phone rings
That it would be you
Saying let's hang out
Then you confess
That there's something special between us
Why don't we find out

But you don't know me
Guess you don't need me
Why you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a

Rock star
If you only knew the real me
I might even be a rock star
I'm telling you that we are meant to be
Now wouldn't it be nice if you could see
That I really am a rock star

Commit or not commit in such a crazy tide
It's sooner than I thought but you called me out
I've lost control and there's no doubt
I'm gonna start all over

Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here it comes straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over

Fantastic and romantic all a big surprise
You've got the warning hesitation pushed aside
It's sooner than i want but you caught my heart
I guess I'm ready now to start

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear
My dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and it's silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it If you text it I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

Compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

Miley Cyrus,"It's been in the past for awhile
I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy
Still miss you baby
It was real
It was right

But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left
Is all these ashes
Where does the love go
I don't know
When it's all said and done

How could I be losing you forever
After all the time we spent together
I had to know why
I had to lose you
Now you just become
Like everything I'll
Never find again

At the bottom of the ocean
Dodod dododo
Dododo dodod
Dododo dododo
In a dream you appear
For awhile you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me

I draw a map
Connect the dots
With all the memories that I got
What I'm missing
I'll keep reliving
Where does the love go
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever

After all the time we spent together
I had to know why
I had to lose you
Now you just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

This is it
Let go
Breathe
You don't have to
Love me for me too
Baby ever understand
Just know I love the time we both had
And I don't ever wanna see you sad

Be happy
I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna tell me
You love me babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for the both of us
To say be happy

Stuck in school, so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at eight a.m., is crazy
Tired being told what to do
So unfair
So uncool

Till I hear the bell ring

We're gonna breakout,
Let the party start,
We're gonna stay out,
Gonna break some hearts,
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart,

We're gonna wake up,

We're gonna have some fun,
Gonna lose control,
Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh

With my friends and the mess we get into,
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a buck for the things we'll never use

Won't pretend it's too soon to tell
What's 'round this bend
No disgrace, about face
Anything not to have to chase

You know
Nothing hurts like losing
When ya know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosin'
To hold too long

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

A lot to say, but not today
Let the radio break the silence
As we drive
A kiss goodbye, not this time
Don't remember what about this song
I ever liked

You know
Nothing hurts like losing
When ya know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosin'

But I got nothing to show

Will be the end of the road

I thought maybe we were getting somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watched your tail lights fading
I try but it still won't fall
I remember what it feels like
To know love and have it taken away
I can't think of what I learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday

I look at your photograph all the time

I still feel it in my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember til I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget
Is goodbye

I woke up this morning
And played our song
And through my tears, I sang along
I picked up the phone and then put it down
Cause I know I'm wasting my time
And I don't mind

I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember those simple things
I remember til I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget

Suddenly my cell phone's blowing up
With your ring tone
I hesitate but answer it anyway
You sound so alone
And I'm surprised to hear you say

You remember when we kissed
You still feel it on your lips

We talked til we cried
You said that your biggest regret

This madness

Bumper on bumper on bumper
Horns honking
Nobody's looking
But everyone's talking
It's another day
On this highway

They whisper to me
They know a secret
I knew they would not keep
It didn't take long
For the room to fill with dust
And these four walls came down around us

It must have been something to send me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

It's hard now to let you be
I won't make excuses
I've made my peace
It didn't take long
For me to lose the trust
Cause these four walls
Were not strong enough

It must have been something to send me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

Yeah
It's difficult
Watching us fade
Knowing it's all my fault
My mistake
Yeah, and it's difficult
Letting you down
Knowing it's all my fault
You're not around

It must have been something to send me out of my head

You know that you got to wake up America

Miley Cyrus,"After 12, not so well
Won't pretend, it's too soon to tell
What's round this bend?
No disgrace, about face
Anything not to have to chase you down again
You know nothing hurts like loosing
When you know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

A lot to say
But not today
Let the radio break the silence
As we drive
A kiss goodbye
Not this time
Don't remember what about this song
I ever liked
You know nothing hurts like loosing
When you know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosing
To hold too long

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll

I thought maybe we were getting somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watched your tail lights fading
I try but it still won't fall
I remember what it feels like to know love
And have it taken away
Can't think of what I've learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday

I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same

How could we make out?
And now suddenly thunder and everything's changed,
There's this big dark cloud

Hovering, hovering, hovering
You always said that we'd make it through
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling
For the words to say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

We go through the motions like everything's settled,
But it's inside out
And it makes us uncomfortable still holding on
When there's all this doubt

Hovering, hovering, hovering
You always said that we'd make it through
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling
For the words to say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

And maybe we're just older,
Just a little older
'cause the fact that this is over.
The fact that this is over with you's been

Your fire is so jealous
Restless

Woohoo, woohoo

Now were out in the street
And were sweatin' the heat
And we move with the traffic and the beat
I don't care if you choke
When you light up your smoke
It's the one thing I can call my own
It's so tragic
I'm so mad and

I'm so jealous

Times up, you pushed me to surrender (tonight)

Wherever the wind blows
And I'm there as long as were together

Everybody needs a song

When the night's so long

That this life is easy

Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone

Just like Kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful?

Miley Cyrus,"I know this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it come this far
Just thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are

We were young and times were easy
But I could see, it's not the same
I'm standing here but you don't see me
I'd give it all for that to change

And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go

Standin' out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone

I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah, before the storm

With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

Standin' out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone

I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

Trying to keep the lights from going out
And the clouds are ripping out my broken heart
They always say that a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

Standin' out in the rain
Knowing now it's really over
Please don't leave you alone

I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing I'll never hold ya

Miley Cyrus,"We both lie silent, still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has it's thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
Yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could let you know somehow

Every rose has it's thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
Yeah it does

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar will remain

Every rose, every rose
Every rose, has its thorn

I know I could saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
And to hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Every rose has it's thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
Yeah it does",Every Rose Has Its Thorn

Searching for the words to say
I feel it when you fall apart
Our lives are our greatest art
I don't want to change your mind
'Cause I accept you
For everything you are and will be
Stay here with me now

The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end
No one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love

You don't ever have to read my mind
You can see it when you close your eyes
Don't believe it when you lose your faith
Another moment is a moment away
I can't tell you what the future holds
Or how to live
All I know is
What feels right lights up my life again and again

The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love

Got lost in the shadows

Heard cries and the suffering
I walked through the darkness
Left broken and heartless

I'm calling out, can you hear my voice?

Ooh whoa
You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
Shine your light as I reach for you

It breathes in my chest and
It runs through my blood

And I've been told at least a thousand times
It's not worth the struggle, the hurt or the trouble
I keep running up to these front lights
No I won't surrender
I'll wait here forever

Standing here with my flag held high
Oh can't you see that it's worth the fight?

Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No I'm not breaking
I may not know it, but
These are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most
I've just gotta keep goin', and
I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side
It's the climb

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side
It's the climb

Keep on movin'
Keep climbin'
Keep faith baby
It's all about, it's all about
The climb
Keep the faith, keep your faith, woah",The Climb [Live]

Pulling out the steering wheel right from the seat
Pumping his brakes to the sound of the beat

A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well, light a ale
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls 'em off, starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail

Are you sure you wanna ride with me?
If you scared don't lie to me
I'm a crazy mother fucka from the mid west
With a Mississippi flow and all in dress
And a four by four with the alter steps
Doing donuts underneath the old chest
I need a chick on time 'cause mine be early
Think I ride or I die down to six thirty
Straight up chick like twelve o'clock
I don't know where yet, that's what she tell the cops
Sits down for a nigga, raise her hand for a nigga
I solemnly swear he was with me all day
To the judge, he the one I love

Look at what you found

They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack

One day he wants me, one day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sitting 'round here waiting on a man

I slick caught her, eying down my purse where the dollars at?
I love when all the rents due on the first,
They can call a hearse 'cause if there's any violation I go off with that

Cat walk, slick talk, flirting with them big dogs
(Why I need his milli's when I got Billy on the speed dial)
(You know I'm on that meow) Quick to scratch your eyes out
Struttin' on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

Baila tango y rock 'n' roll

Hope in life there's something better
Now she draws the line on you
Her freedom feels like sweet surrender
Breathing is so pure and tender
Now she draws the line on you

His jealousy was something nex
She tried in vain but he can't hear the thruth
His only colour turned her blue

Oh what can free the tase of sweet surrender
A trip away from love's own cruel pretender

Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing woman into life
She has danced into the danger zone
When a dancer becomes a dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-build iron sanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard warm place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push of the world but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold connective heat
Struggling, stretching for defeat
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

Felt like we made up so entirely

You stick around, you got it bad 
But no one's out there you can listen to
It seems to be so hard to find the colorful state of mind
But still you're trying to catch it all, 
Blame it on your own philosophy
Eventually, your empty dreams come back 
And out into the sun, into the sun

Now we have a lot of love to give
But it's not released through all the misery
I dream of a past that we could have
Felt like we made up so entirely
Now we have a lot of love to give
But it's not released all the misery
I dream of a past that we could have

Out of nothing on a fragile ground

Can you better hear the storming folks
Whispering in fear, roars the most

Can you better hear the storming folks

Will you ever find a way out there

Put your hands in the air
And give me all your money
This is the story of Ma Baker
The meanest cat
From old Chicago town

She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really mowed them down
She had no heart at all
No no no, heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh she was really tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'Cause they were mean and strong

Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, but she knew how to die

They left a trail of crime
Across the U.S.A.
And when one boy was killed
She really made them pay
She had no heart at all
No no no, heart at all

Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, to handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, she never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, but she knew how to die

And then a man she liked
She thought she'd stay with him
When he informed on them
They did away with him
She didn't care at all
Just didn't care at all

{Here is a special bulletin
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall
If you have any information about this woman
Please contact the nearest police station}

Don't anybody move
The money or your lives

One day they robbed a bank
It was their last foray
The cops appeared too soon
They couldn't get away
They all gonna loose their heads
It made them mighty mad

And so they shout it out
Ma Baker and her sons
They didn't want to hang
They died with blazing guns
And so the story ends
Of one who left no friends

Millie Jackson,"It was a hot afternoon,
Last day of June,
And the sun was a demon,
The clouds were afraid,

One-ten in the shade,
And the pavement was steaming.
I told Billy-Ray,
In his red Chevrolet,

I needed time for some thinking,
I was just walking by,
When I looked in her eye,
And I swore it was winking.

She was 31 and I was 17,
I knew nothing about love, she knew everything,
When I saw down beside her on the front porch swing,
And wondered what the coming night would bring.

The sun closed her eyes,
As it climbed in the sky,
And it started to swelter,
The sweat trickled down the front of her gown,
And I thought it would melt her.

She through back her hair,
Like I wasn't there,
And she sipped on a julep,
Her shoulders were bare,
And I tried not to stare,
When I looked at her two lips.

And when she looked at me,
I heard her softly say,
I know you're young,
You don't know what to do or say,
But stay with me until the sun has gone away,
And I will chase the boy in you away.

And then she smiled and we talked for a while,
And we walked for a mile to the sea,
We sat on the sand, and the boy took her hand,
But I saw the sun rise as a man.

Ten years have gone by,
Since I looked in her eye,
But the memory lingers,
I got back in my mind,
To the very first time,
And feel the touch of her fingers,

It was a hot afternoon,
Last day of June,
And the sun was a demon,
The clouds were afraid,
One-ten in the shade,
And the pavement was steaming...",Summer (The First Time)

But his love must’ve been too strong
But even a dog will get tired if you keep on doing him wrong
He won’t even come to you if you offer him his favorite bone, so she told him
Put your rags in a brown paper bag
Go on and hit the door

Early in the mornin'
Before the crack of dawn,
Sittin' here thinkin'
Oh why was I born?
So broken hearted,
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

I was so happy
With you by my side,
You told me you loved me,
But honey you lied.
You left me here cryin',
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

The night seems like a million years, mmhm,
Waitin' 'til the break of day appears, oh oh oh.
All night long weepin' like a willow,
Tossin' and turnin' on my tear stained pillow,
Guess I'm gonna drown in my own tears.
Gonna go walkin'
By the railroad track,
I'm gonna let the choo-choo cross over my back.
Life ain't worth livin',
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

A call from his mother. 
Sophia says ""Come quick, 
Macgyver's been hurt. 
He was just on his way home 
From saving the world again, 
He got jumped by some kids, 
He went down, now he's dying."" 

So I threw on my coat 
An ran out the door, 
Sped through the night 
To the old hospital, 
Where the doctors said to wait, 
So I camped in the ward, 
Watching the clock 
As it haemorrhages time so slow. 
And I've lingered here so long. 
The air in here so cold. 
The shallow breath so quiet. 
The Shibboleth of Macguiver laid bare, 
Flat on a table, 
Blackened by bruises he couldn't explain. 
And there was nothing he could build 
To save himself 
Out of biros and blue-tack. 

They opened up his cavities 
In the operating theatre, 
But the doctors couldn't find a heart, 
His lymph glands running motor oil. 
His calloused fingers lie inert, 
Their intricate ability 
Punctured by the God-shaped hole 
In adolescent consciousness. 

He couldn't build a bomb to mend 
The splinters of his broken heart. 
His home-made radar couldn't find 
A way to make his weapons art.

Of inverted discrimination, because it's getting old.

I’m cold and holed up in the back of the van, 
Devoid of eloquence or elegant plan. 

And I’m paranoid, 
And I can’t help but think 
That somewhere someone 
Is listening in. 

But all the words that I kept in my pockets, 
Jotted down on supermarket receipts, 
At base turned out to be solid masonry. 

And I’m scared of the kids 
Who come to our shows, 
And scared of the words 
That they seem to know, 
Because in truth all my high ideals are in ruins, 
In truth I don’t really know what I’m doing. 
Growing out of these clothes turned out to mean 
Losing certainty. 

So sing 
""Your"" voices level the land, my Jericho, 
My rock and sure foundation. 

Every love that made me lose my reasoning, 
Every chord that made my conscience ache, 
Every day spent counting hours 
Well, none of them comes close 
To singing back a song inside my head. 
I always had a song inside my head. 

And yes, there are times when I am tired and stressed, 
When I am hasty and I’m under duress. 
I’m a narcissist and I’m not at my best  
I have to say I’m not impressed. 
Of all the things that I believed in my teens, 
I’m left with unread books and badly made 'zines...
Some might-have-beens that somehow even yet 
Bring a spring to my step. 

I remember calloused hands and paint-stained jeans, 
And I remember safe-as-houses self-belief. 

Sing  
""Your"" voices of destruction,
My rock and sure foundation,
My rock and sure foundation.

Every love that made me lose my reasoning, 
Every chord that made my conscience ache, 
And every day spent counting hours
Well, none of them comes close 
To singing back a song inside my head.

And every line that made me lose my reasoning, 
Every chord that made my conscience ache, 
Every sound a memory
That’s all I ever need. 
I always have a song inside my head.
I always have a song inside my head.
I always have a song inside my head.",Living the Dream
Million Dead,"You wouldn’t know it to look at me, 
but I’m a superhero 
I’ve got x-ray vision and everything 
My frail frame belies my strength  
I can lift tall buildings 
with one hand tied behind my back 

But the morning after each episode 
I wake up at home, alone 

Despite my mediocre looks, 
I’m daily dared by damsels 
to fight international crime 

In the end I always win the day – 
I save the world, I get my girl 
But the morning after each episode 
I wake up at home, alone 

The comfort of knowing that 
I’ve saved you all wears thin 

My superhuman efforts largely go unrewarded 
The government won’t take my phone calls 

On my days off I hang around the centre of town, 
but I don’t get stopped 
But the morning after each episode 
I wake up at home, alone

The comfort of knowing that 
I’ve saved you all wears thin 
The day after each episode 
I wake up and wish that I 
wouldn’t be expected to get out of bed and help mankind 
I’d comb my hair a little differently and put on some glasses, 
find somewhere to hide, 
tell the United Nations they’ve got the wrong number and I’d live a quiet life",Margot Kidder
Million Dead,"How should I begin? 
I find myself residing 
At the dried out end of a dead history. 
All my thoughts are dirt 
Scattered on a coffin, 
And I a dilettante funereal spectator here. 

How should I presume? 
A besuited bourgeois mourner, 
Virgin to surrender and vivid sense, 
I scour lichened stones, 
Desperately seeking 
Daedalus’s paternal secret of where we will land. 

Well I was born with four fingers on each hand, 
And with my eight fingers and my thumbs I do maths. 

Once again, how should I begin? 
I’ve started weak and I’m stuttering, 
But I have remembered all my lines. 
It seems that I have thus presumed 
To talk of maths in front of crowded rooms, 
But I’ll make the two times table mine. 

How should I begin? 
I find myself residing 
At the dried out end of a dead history. 
How should I presume?

Virgin to surrender and vivid sense,?

Calculus finishes me, 
I don’t follow trigonometry, 
I’ve got nothing to add to algebra 
(the more complex functions I don’t remember). 
But arithmetic… 
The absolute zero 
Is arithmetic on fingers and toes. 

I have remembered all my lines, 
And I’ll make the two times table mine. 
I will not presume, but I will thus begin.",Murder and Create
Million Dead,"Honestly, why the hell are you standing there,
And what the hell are you waiting for? 
Your expectant smile is starting to get on my nerves. 
So tell me now, if you’re so fucking rationalist, 
So ruthlessly atheist, why the fuck are you a positivist? It doesn’t work. 
Because honestly, if you ignore the terminology, 
Mainstream political philosophy grew out of Christian teleology. 
Despite the claims on the packaging, all the liberals and the communists, all the people making promises, are pigs to a man and their premises are all the same. 

Everything is getting worse, 
Which hardly comes as a surprise 
No one guaranteed anything else, 
So dry your eyes and pull yourself together, 
Because things will keep on getting worse. 
The guys in white will never win, 
And I doubt we’ll ever heal the world.

But we can begin by learning how to deal with 
The conflicts that arise between us, instead of pretending they’ll go away. 
It’s better to light a candle than to fantasize about a sun.",Plan B

Million Dead,"Tonight will be the last night of my record-breakingly successful run in the lead role of the greatest play of the century.
Unprecedentedly warm praise from critics and public alike has met my portrayal of a man at his desk who gives a damn
And I'd like to thank all my friends and fans for always pushing me to soldier on.
So one last time (for the cameras)
My greatest soliloquy
""Oh, oh, oh, if I could only see the clear blue sky from my office window.
Oh, oh, then it would only take a steel grey day and I'd take my bow""

And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Stay with me and I'll change things in your life
But you look like you don't care
You stammer and you swear

Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
With you

Oh I don't need to see you social
I say I do but that's a lie I taught you
Oh lying by your side
Tongue tied mesmerized I try

Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
With you

Weather is in disarray
Like all the things I've seen today
Come on take me away
Oh is it the clothes you wear
The color of your hair
Or your eyes they shine and shine and shine

Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
Which way should I jump
With you

Ah which way should I jump
Ah which way should I jump
Ah which way should I jump
Ah which way should I jump

Borrandome las dudas con tus ojos

Te miras al espejo y te mueres de la risa
A ti viejo sostén de ilusiones, palabras sin acento
Y caminos de dos vías

A ti que mil razones que te hacen feliz
A ti que para amar siempre has dicho que si
A ti que eres el bueno de los buenos, la mano que se extiende
Y llega al cielo

Vive que la vida te sonríe
Que te da los buenos días
Aunque llueva o se te caiga el mundo encima
Vive que la vida es una sola
Aunque guardes bajos llaves los papeles
Que aseguren tu parcela allá en la gloria

A ti que frente al mar te cresen alas
Y sin más nubes que tus sueños va lloviendo la esperanza
A ti que un simple beso es un milagro
Y sin golpes en el pecho ya te sientes perdonado

A ti que ahí mil razones que te hacen feliz
A ti que para amar siempre has dicho que sí
A ti que eres el bueno de los buenos

Vive que de muerto solo sirves
Pa' los muertos de los vivos, esos mismos que no te dejan crecer
Vive, toma y deja que la vida no es tronco
Al que se tira y se recoge, de el debemos aprender

Aunque guardes bajo llave los papeles
Que aseguren tu parcela allá en la gloria

Ahógalos entre tus ojos en tu, fabrica de sueños
Rompe la voz del adiós que hay en mi esquina

Visteme con tu esperanza, envuélveme en tu vida
Subo la bandera de mi amor sobre tu pecho
Te hago un traje de pasión que llevo, dentro

Baño tus espacios con la miel de un solo beso mio
Sirvo por la calle tu canción, sobre tu lecho
Un nuevo amor no avisa nunca nunca cuando

Llega pequeño fuego que se convierte, en hoguera y te quema
Y un nuevo amor se acuesta, de tu lado sin permiso
Sin, importarle el silencio frio de la espera

My expression's erased
I'm stuck in this place
I wanna feel my face
I wanna feel my face

I'm wandering through the city
This calm summer breeze
Brushing across my case

I'm charging up myself
Through these streets I should know
These buildings once covered in snow
Just yesterday

I'm pushing through the years
These warm, younger years
That brought me here

I'm listening as they whisper in my ear
Pushing me back to what I wanna be
What I try to be
That calm, tame beast inside of me

Can you see my face?

I didn't sleep all night
I didn't sleep all night

Made a phone call last night
I've been thinking about it all day
I made you cry last night

I floated in those words
I floated in those words

I don't even know why I feel what I feel
I don't even know why I think what I think

What's good about me

So I'll keep on tapping my way
This song as my cane
For someone who dares
Take on this man inside of me
You could hardly see

Falling away

So I'll keep on swimming my way
Through that pitch black part of me
Singing this tongue tied and twisted melody
There you go falling into that sea of people

Falling away

You're falling away
It's gone without a trace
I'm singing love songs again

You're falling away
Those dark streets inside of me
How further can they be

Now I can finally see
That pretty seed inside of me
The one thing I need inside of me

And that beast ingrained in me
Is bursting to see
What you and I can be

Even though that place for me and you is dead
Things keep running through my head

Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets

All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road

And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind

Milow,"She was a friend of a friend of mine
I noticed her as she passed me by
She didn't even look me in the eye
I tried to think of things to say
Poured some wine, but she looked away
I didn't even talk to her that night

For a while, I thought I stood a chance
The way she smiled, so sweet
For a while, I thought I'd figured her out
That we were meant to be

But she said, ""No, no, no""
She just said, ""No, no""
She said, ""No, no, no""

People put me in my place
I felt the door slam in my face
Spent a long time standing in the rain
I've been on the losing end
All my dreams seemed just pretend
Once or twice, thought I would go insane

For a while, I swore I stood a chance
But I was back on my feet
For a while, I had figured it out
That it was meant to be

They just said, ""No, no""
They said ""No, no, no""

Funny how your worst mistake
Can lead you to your lucky break
It only made me who I am today

All the while, always stood a chance

To see the forest for the trees

Milt Buckner,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,

Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,

And candle lights on little corner tables

Milt Jackson,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

You're out of my heart

Milton Brown,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Milton Brown,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying

Milton Nascimento,"At the start of the conversation
I didn't have too much to say
I was needing some inspiration
And you just got in my way
I took a shot at an easy target
You were too stunned to say anything
You were the unsuspecting martyr
You were not the most dangerous game

Bring my courage back now
Bring it back to me
I'm tired of being afraid of what I can't change
I want to be living free

Well it could be that I was mistaken
Or maybe I deceived myself
But it's hard to understand somebody
Doesn't want to understand himself
There's an ocean of unlatched windows
And a world of unlocked homes
The only reason anybody can still feel safe
Is most people still knock on the door

Bring my courage back now
Would you bring it back to me
I'm tired of being afraid of what I can't change
I want to be living free
I don't want to be a prisoner
Bound in these chains
Don't want to be a prisoner
I want to be free again

And though we all return to dust
There's a lot of us in a terrible rush

Some take the road to Damascus
Some take the road to Hell
I'll take Highway One to the evergreens
And everything will turn out well

Bring my courage back now
Would you bring it back to me
I'm tired of being afraid of what I can't change
I want to be living free
I don't want to be a prisoner
Bound in these chains
Slave to my fear
I want to be free again
I want to be free again",Courage

Somente aprendi muita dor
E vi com tristeza o amor
Morrer devagar, se apagar

Quero voltar
Poder a saudade não ter

E mesmo se a dor encontrar
Sabendo o que sou
Não peço mais perdão
Porque já sofri demais

Que me aquece e me faz carinho?
De onde vem essa coisa tão crua
Que me acorda e me põe no meio da rua?

É um lamento, um canto mais puro
Que me ilumina a casa escura
É minha força, é nossa energia
Que vem de longe prá nos fazer companhia

Pois não posso, não devo
Não quero viver como toda essa gente insiste em viver

Se a conversa acabar na cozinha 
Já é da família 
Melhor pra você 

Ê amor, ê amor 
Os namorados no meio da tarde começam a sorrir 
E eu aqui neste morro 
Na frente de um touro 
Falando de mim 

O sol 'tá descendo agora 
O silencio deixa ouvir 
Será o sinal de um anjo 
Essa brisa a traduzir

Milton Nascimento,"Pensas disfarçar a sensualidade que nasce daí
Brotou ao mesmo instante da tua chegada
Só engana a quem nunca sabe de nada

Coração de fogo
Nenhuma grade vai prender
Teu sentimento, a joia do momento
Nossas almas lentas, um próprio amanhecer
Coração de ouro
Nem teu silêncio vai conhecer, vai não
Essa inquietude, essa vida
Essa música escondida
Doida de explosão

Olho de criança é
Festa de esperança, mundo a renascer
Não cabe o sofrimento de novos Messias
Anuncia a vida, alimenta a sorte, sorte, sorte, o sol

Dói, mas carece acontecer
Em cada segundo, a porta deste mundo
Ver nessa beleza, a cor do sim

Ser, de dentro e de fora
O que a paixão
Pensa que devora
Mas que só o amor pode entender
Teu jogo de cintura vai dizer

Todo mundo espera acontecer
O que esse amor tem pra contar
Harmoniza o coro, o maior tesouro
Só pode ter futuro se cantar

A minha mão diz sim
Teu medo quer que não
Acaba com isso
Esse compromisso
Que é meu, que é teu, que é nosso
E de qualquer país

A minha mão diz sim
Teu medo quer que não
Acaba com isso
Esse compromisso
Que é meu, que é teu, que é nosso
E de qualquer país",De Um Modo Geral...
Milton Nascimento,"És menina do astro sol
És rainha do mundo mar
Teu luzeiro me faz cantar
Terra, Terra és tão estrelada
O teu manto azul comanda
Respirar toda criação
E depois que a chuva molha
Arco-íris vem coroar
A floresta é teu vestido
E as nuvens, o teu colar
És tão linda, ó minha Terra
Consagrada em teu girar
Navegante das solidões
No espaço a nos levar
Nave mãe e o nosso lar
Terra, Terra és tão delicada
Os teus homens não tem juízo
Esqueceram tão grande amor
Ofereces os teus tesouros
Mas ninguém dá o teu valor
Terra, Terra eu sou teu filho
Como as plantas e os animais
Só ao teu chão eu me entrego
Com amor, firmo tua paz

Mas onde já nem sei
Em Vera me larguei
E deito nesta dor

A moça que se foi
De nossa Vera Cruz
É o pranto que ficou
Do norte que sonhei
Das coisas do lugar
Dos mimos me larguei

Correndo sem parar
Buscar Vera Cruz
Nos campos e no mar
Mas ela se soltou
No norte se perdeu

Se ela em outra mansidão
Um dia ancorar
E ao vento me esquecer
Ao vento me amarrei
E nele vou partir
Atrás de Vera Cruz

Ah, quisera encontrar
A moça que se foi
Do lar de Vera Cruz
E o pranto que ficou
Do norte que perdi
Das coisas do lugar

Milton Nascimento,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17

Mimi Fox,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Mimi Fox,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Mimi Fox,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light

Mimi Fox,"You don't know what love is 
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues 
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose 
You don't know what love is 

You don't know how hearts burn 
For love that can not live yet never dies 
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes 
You don't know what love is 

Do you know how a lost heart feels 
The thought of reminiscing 
And how lips that taste of tears 
Lose their taste for kissing 

You don't know how lips hurt 
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost 
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost 
You don't know what love is 
",You Don't Know What Love Is
Mimi Fox,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Mimi Fox,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful

You are so inviting

As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Mimi Fox,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You

That is always haunting me
Funny little strain 
Running thru my brain
It's as sweet as can be
It has such a pleading way

When I hear someone playing
I walk right up and say
 
Please play for me

Called doodle doo-doo

But what I like best
I doodle doo-doo

Simplest thing
There's nothing much to it
Don't have to sing

Wherever I go  
I doodle-doo doo die doo doo
 
I've heard all the melodies
From the blues to rhapsodies
They all come and go 
But there's one I know 
That'll linger and tease
I've found all the blues a pest
Rhapsodies to me a jest
So if you want to please me
Just take this one request
 
Please play for me

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Who tell you fate supplies a mate

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak

Like a building thrown up overnight in one of those reverse earthquakes

They emptied out all the asylums, they emptied out all the jails
The ""new bruise"" was the name of a dance craze
By ""Jesus cross and the cruel nails""
Followed up by ""torturing little beaver""
With their contraption of barbed wire
Between the fear and the fever lies all the rejection they require
They'll be howling by midnight, they'll be drooling by dawn
Skulls shrunk down to the size of their brains
Heads shaven and shorn

Where bitterness always ends so pitifully

Whose ever bad intention has been purged
You could've walked out any time you wanted but face it you
Didn't have the courage
I guess that makes you a full time hypocrite or some kind of
Twisted dilettante
Funny though people don't usually get so ugly 'til they think
They know what they want
Scratch your own head stupid
Count up to three
Roll over on your back

So ill with the flow I need a M.D.
Somebody call a doctor
I make 'em all sick when I hop out the Phantom of the Opera
Opposite to what I call a failure
I am the reason y'all can't look in the mirrors
But don't worry: I see shit a lil' clearer
Go ahead and act funny, but you ain't stackin' money
And therefore we ain't here for the best

Moving too fast but I can't slow down
Doc said to rest, time to cancel the show now

Behind the fame man I'm a regular person
But I feel worthless, the gift and curses
If I fuck up my voice then it ain't worth it

But I gotta give them what they purchase
If I'm the disciple then what they worship
Is hip hop not just a couple of verses
But doc hold up I'm just touching the surface

I mean damn doc
I can't take this no more man
I'm cracking under pressure
It?s a little too much for me man
My mind's going crazy right now, check it out

I said doctor, doctor I'm losing my mind quick
Ain't been shot, but it feels like I'm hit
Who would have thought after all I did
And all I gained I would call it quits?

Five nine but I'm tall as shit
The sky is the limit, then watch how tall I get
Wait, this is what other niggas would call dreams
For me this is life meaning it was foreseen

So why am I complaining?
God bless me man
I'm an angel in training
Now they came in the game with a dash like Damon

Predicted the rain man, just like Rain Man
Down in the sun on the Island of Cayman
While you and your main man, still on the mainland
Even real niggas know what I'm sayin'
Ya shit change but I ain't changing for nobody

I mean God damn doc
I been coming to you for the last three years
And you ain't say shit
Seem like I talk my way out of my own problems
See now I pay you all this money

As soon as I hit the club 
But in the Midwest 
They love to take it slow 
So when I hit the H 
I watch you get it on the floor 
And if you needed hyphy 
I take it to the bay 
Frisco to Sac town 
They do it e'ryday 
Compton to Hollywood 
As soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in that low, low
I do it the Cali way 
And when I hit the Chi 
People say that I'm fly 
They like the way I dress, they like (they like my) my attire 
Move crowds from side to side 
They ask me how I do it, and simply I reply

[Chorus]

This is why I'm hot 
Catch me on the block 
Every other day 
Another bitch, another drop 
Sixteen bars, twenty-four pop 
Forty-four songs, nigga, gimme what you got 
I'm in there driving cars 
Push them off the lot 
I'm into shutting stores down so I can shop 
If you need a bird, I can get it chopped 
Tell me what you need; you know I get 'em by the flock 
I call my homey black; meet me on the ave 
I hit Wash heights with the money in the bag 
We into big spinners 
See my pimping never dragged 
Find me with different women that you niggas never had 
For those who say they know me know I'm focused on my cream 
Playa, you come between; you'd better focus on the beam 
I keep it so feen the way you see me lean 
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean 

[Chorus] 

This is why I'm hot 
Shorty see the drop 
Ask me what I paid, and I say, ""yeah, I paid a quap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top 
So chicks around the way - they call me cream of the crop 
They hop in the car 
I tell them all about 
We hit the studio; they say they like the way I record 
I gave you black train, and I did you wrong 
So every time I see them, and they tell me that's their song 
They say I'm the bomb 
They love the way the charm hanging from the neck 
And compliments the arm which compliments the ear, then comes the gear 
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare 
Then niggas start to hate, rearrange their face 
Little do they know I keep them things by waist side 
I reply, ""nobody gotta die""
Similar to Lil' Wiz 'cause I got the fire 

[Chorus]",This Is Why I'm Hot [Remix]

[Chorus]
Shortie wanna ride 
Don't worry bout a car

And we gon be rollin rollin choo choo chooin

They beggin for a ride on my big black train 


[Verse]
Now some like whips and some like chains 
But her she got a thing for that big black train
Not just a metaphor to how I'm ridin on tracks
From up north to down south wit niggas ridin in lack's
Since I dropped I got the whole world ridin ma back
To much chit chat is he back pack or is he gimmicky
Lyricaly he's sick he know the ring of remedys
Jealousy breathes envy got a lot of enemys
Shorties I probly wife I keep a lot of those too
Bitches all in my pockets I know a lot of hoes too
Ill yellin all aboard they takin off they clothes too
You tryna figure why and I already told you
Most chicks is infatuaed with all my vocals
Niggas hate in the hood cus I'm no longer local
All around the world got ladies screamin ma name
And for what they lookin for a ride on my big black train


[Chorus]
Shortie wanna ride 
Don't worry bout a car

I ain't got spinners I'm a winner by nature
I can't stand a broad thas just into ma paper
You find me in the club sippin henny no chaser
If I don't hit it now I bet I'm hittin that lata
See when I swing through the bling I bring through
Brightin up the room turnin everything blue
And everything new is everything new
Can't choose to and everything you ain't used to
Now have you eva seen a nigga lay his game down
Hop off the leer jet come through and bring the train round
I'm just playin with the game see its a shame now
They say I'm cocky since industry know my name now
But now its back on board see off to my train we go
Check a id make sure that this thing legal
She gave me head crack and I ain't talkin bout cee-lo

MIMS,"Uh,(don't cry) just follow me for a second 
Le let me take you all some place

(Verse 1)
I remember When I was young my momma said she was goin out
You see the problem is she was always going out
Grandma mad 'cause my mama left us in the house
She was grown but granny thought she was showin out 
Know you sayin damn they ain't shit to be mad to
My momma told me well that she did what she had to
But see I ain't like that she was datin them bad dudes
So everytime she went out I gave her an attitude
Yeah I was straight throwin a tantrum
Try to mess up her plans I was hopin she canceled
But ain't nobody told her what she could and she can't do
Yeah ma I was a handful so yeah
I cried and I cried and I tried to show her my side
But she wasn't hearin her kid took the key to the crib
Out the door she wavin bye bye
She had me thinking that my tears meant nothin'
Years later found out it means something
You see all those nights mama left me alone
I had to learn how to stand on my own (2 feet)

(chorus)
Don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride
And don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride (don't cry because its okay)

(Verse 2)
So now I'm grown up rap performer
Give thanks to the mirror where I practiced so much
Thanks to my grandma after so much
Sacrifice I feel so loved
And thanks to my auntie ann 'cause I be damned
If I ever said can't when I probly can
To my brother my blood my right hand man
Won't hesitate to put my life in yo hands
And this is to my young sis, 2 'cause nothing could stop you
Roy hand and troy p I ain't forgot you
My uncle joe and serita even my pops to
If I'm on top then we on top too
Chris and be you know that I got you
Will and ill see you know that I got you
The whole 6-4 you know that I got you
Black get yo hustle on I can't knock you
See-l slim and k be 
Niggas in the hood that failed to pay me
I still got love for you niggas don't know why
So I know the meaning of when mama said don't cry

(chorus)(2x)
Don't cry don't cry don't cry it'll be alright
You only get one chance to live yo life
Up and down homie enjoy yo ride

(outro)
",Don't Cry (Outro)
MIMS,"I wanna be a little bit more like, like laid back
See, y'all do is cool but me homie, I'm calmer
Like what surround her neck? I charmed her
Me I milked the cow, I'm a farmer

Her guards up but I removed the armor
You just seem to be the part of the problem
Introducin' me, the solution
I rocked it just like I'm from Houston

No, not the ball playa, more like the mall playa
Soon as I touch down, I shut down the store playa
Look, I'm already on playa
See, I'm like the stars in the sky early morn' playa

So just listen to the song
So we could end all back and forth like Ping Pong
She is my queen that makes me King Kong
I'm the leader of the jungle dog
Ain't nothin' left to say but, hey I'm the bong

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it
Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC

Lets just say that we slid off
Gallardo spider so we can take the lid off
She just made that jump like Cris Cross
Right in the passenger side you pissed off

Ain't my fault I just handle my biz
You can't handle your wiz, so it is
What it's gonna be? I'm in the sun sittin' under palm trees
Lookin' life big

I won't hate, I'll just tell her how it is
If I show you how I live, you would think I was hidin'
And mic is my Trident, I'm Poseidon
And she is my Afro deity, stop lyin'

You not as fly as I'm
And some say I'm the flyest plane on the runway
Some day I would be the one day called king
And till that time your girlfriend can call me

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it
So don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC

I didn't come here to brag
No amount of money could match with my swag
You know I got wrapped in the bag
Livin' in the past
And I'm the future do, all washed up like the Guadalupe

Your own home team won't root for you
And that's 'coz they look for me
So truthfully as truly yours
Your girlfriends favorite MC

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it
So don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC

Don't be mad at me 'coz I'm your girlfriends favorite MC
She's all meant to me like the wrist and the bracelet
And I ain't need no one of she, she's beggin' me to chase it

Fat boy, I'm watchin' you put on that act boy
I thought you was my man, you gonna do me like that boy

But you know what they say and I'm callin' it out
When the pressure cook up the true colors come out

We into big spinners
See my pimpin never dragged
Find me wit different women dat you niggaz never had

So everytime I see 'em and dey tell me dat'z their song
Dey say I'm da bomb
Dey luv da way da charm hangin from da neck
And compliments da arm which compliments da ear den comes da gear
So when I hit da room da shortyz stop and stare

MIMS,"(Where I belong)
It's in a place with no racial barriers
And we all ride high in chariots
Where love means love

When we all have the finer things
So we don't gotta buy 'em diamond rings
Just to marry us

Instead I'm where they livin' for bling
As people manage to sing
Over the material things

Where hip hop it?s no longer just a lyrical thing
Tell me God where did I go wrong?
This ain't
(Where I belong)

It?s in a place where bad souls never get in
Instead I'm in Hell's kitchen
It?s sickenin' to my stomach

I'm runnin' a 100 mile
But still can't escape from it
I pray you show me the light

It?s only right, these lonely nights
I call on my momma to hold me tight
Show me right from wrong

This road I'm on, I passed my turn
But please, don't allow me to crash and burn
Just give me a chance, watch how fast I learn
(Where I belong)

I'm tryna keep my head up to the sky
'cause I'm stuck in this life until I die
Lord, stop me from being crucified as soon as I
(Where I belong)

I'm tryna keep my head up to the sky
'cause I'm stuck in this life until I die
Lord, stop me from being crucified as soon as I
(Where I belong)

Is somewhere
In someone's memory
Where we're all friends and ain't no enemies

And there ain't no one minute you're wrong
Next minute you're gone, so I hope that
By the end of this song, I am
(Where I belong)

Where fathers don't leave when you're born
And every page in the book ain't torn
And everyday that you lookin', they gone

And you wishin' they came
You see I know I ain't from here
I'm wishin' I had remained
(Where I belong)

No followers, no leaders
No burners and heaters
No dimes, no divas, it?s pure

No cancer, AIDS, God leave us a cure
No more violence
No need for police to appear

No schools to drop out
No snitches to cop out
No drugs to sell, meanin' no fiends to knock out

I'm talkin' a perfect place where we all get along
That's why I know
That this ain't the place
(Where I belong)

I'm tryna keep my head up to the sky
'cause I'm stuck in this life until I die

I'm tryna keep my head up to the sky
'cause I'm stuck in this life until I die
Lord, stop me from being crucified as soon as I

It's in a place where women don't trade money for sex
So cops harass you in front of your steps
Where taxes don't equal a half your check

Where people give respect in order to have respect
(No gold diggers)
Tryna figure how much cash I get
(No speed limits)
So it won't matter how fast I went
(Take the time to think)

No decisions
Is brash an' shit
No alcohol so drunk niggaz won't crash their whips

The same place where Big and Pac's at
The same place they buried hip hop at
Right there

Me and my mom reunite there
Then it's off through the Pearly Gates
To sit down in that white chair

Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye
Barry White dead
Carry Mims Senior, Joanne Phnell right there

I don't need money
All I need is a mic there
I can see it so clear, I'll be there in the light, yeah

Fitted to the side, 20?s on the ride
Some say I'm fly, they say I'm the best
Catch me in the sky with the S on my chest

Chicks call me Superman, super duper lover, just in case it rain
Keep the Coup Ville for covers unless it rain dollars
Then your talkin' money, bein' broke ain't a joke
Bein' rich must be funny and me I'm tryin' ta laugh

Count a lil' cash, walk in, walk out
Grab shorty with the a**, take her back to my pad
But no not the crib, I mean the helicopter
Let me show you how I live

See I could take you high, spend a little dough
Shut them all down, take you out them plain clothes
Baby I could make you fly, do it in the day
So tell me if you down, baby what you got to say

Had ya neck filled with ice, juicy Couture, Velor jumpsuit
Princess for the night, keep ya draped in the best blue marine dress

They call me Mr. Fly I keep the S on my chest
See I move faster than a bullet
So I can hold ya down
I could jump big buildings in a single bound

that's why they call me Superman, super, duper lover
Imagine what the boy Mims do beneath the covers
I ain't 702, but you complete my stillo
Look up in the sky, got you flyin' in the G4

See we flyin', better yet we soar and it?s lonely at the top
But the bottom is so boring, bottom of the pot
Ya'll n*** in sole order, whenever they see me like

MIMS,"[Chorus]
You could be my hustla
I could be your fiend
Girl you make me lean like a cup of codeine
Give me that good shit when I call you
Baby cause I just can't face withdrawals
Be my hustla, hustla, hustla,
Shawty won't you be my hustla, hustla, hustla

MIMS! look here

I said,
Shorty she know the game
She said she love the chase
Im trying hard to bag her, but she love the wait
Never half, she rather give in wholes
Please part'on my French, but she give me good blow
In return I give her dough
When she see me give n go
Other dealers give me out,
But for me she gives me mo'
Cause its never stepped or cut up or chopped down
But to get it is a risk,
I can't get locked down
Since the hit so good, I'm left fieding for a fix
Heard she got some new shit
So I gotta move quick
She's like,
You're dealing with a mind of a hustla
I'm like,
Fine I'm your #1 customer

[Chorus]

Let's go!

Look,
I love the way she flips it
She loves to cook it up
No need to look around town, her shit is good enough
She takes me to, places I've never been
She is my heroine, get me high like heroin, love
Forgive me for my sins
I just keep giving in
To what I call fatal love
Caught up by the way of drugs
But,
Some don't get it
It's so addictive
This relationship, so vindictive
First I love it, then I hate it when it's gone
Can't settle for no dirt
I need it in its purest form
To perform
I'm searching for my hustla,
And in return
Shawty I can be your customer

[Chorus]

Look,
I can't let this addiction get the best of me (oh noo)
Physically, she's taking me to ecstasy
My highest point is taking away every breath
To the point of no return
Til' there ain't nothing left
What's next? 12 steps
Since the bond we had
Provide me with the proof that I belong in rehab
Cold sweats
Night and day
I just can't relax
Breath in, breath out
Relax

MIMS,"I used to think the better way was to get away
Chasing sunshine trying to put the leather away
When your wheel of fortune is just a letter away
And the chick you been with, you trying to let her away
For that Vanna White chick
Load the tall van with white chicks
Hit the hotel
Hit the light switch
While I was out trying to spend a night with
I was the one she was trying to spend her life with
I could've sworn the money wouldn't change my motto
But why want a little when you can have a lotto
Why sip the glass when you can have the bottle
We live for the now but what about tomorrow?

[Chorus]
I got sunshine on my face but I'm not happy
(i am so senseless I lost all senses I'm telling you that)
I'm not happy I got my eyes so closed so I can see you
(i got nothing)
If I don't have you

Blinded by the fame I can hardly see her face
She blinded by the love she can hardly see mistakes
But there were mistakes which we cant replace
But visualize the place maybe you can relate
For her I give my arm hoping she amputates
But still it aint enough
Its way to late but I'm like wait
She like she did she said she tired of waiting
Its already been years and theres been tears shed
I was gone til November than I show on that lear jet
Like yeah I'm rich man I really don't care
Throw a little money in the air
Blinded by the cars I was blinded by the ice
Millionaire lens I was blinded by the light
One look at her face and I was remind by the life
That I used to live that she used to light

[Chorus]

All we do is argue
All we do is fight
I'm just tryin to get it back to which shit is too nice
But it will never be that she said
And you can never be that prepared as long as your aware
She don't know how to stop the hurt
So for now I'm just a tear
And since I was a jerk she wish I would disappear
But that's what got us here and that's whats gotta go
You reap what you sew
So I'ma let her know

(i am so senseless I lost all senses I'm telling you that)
I'm not happy here
But I got my eyes so clear so I can see you

Ohhhh, 
Can anybody hear me, 
Cause I've been down, that road, so long. 
I'm trying to clean up my ways
Some times I feel like I can't
When I repent all my sins
Then I just do it again

I never wanted to be a regular nigga
No funds, chased by crack hittas
So I poured my soul out, like liquor
But I guess ya'll niggas didn't get the point, like scissors
I told cats I went to church and got saved
Old heads looking, like 'NO', do not say
Called my old hoes, told them I'm gone stop pimping
They looking at me like, you mine as well stop living
Trying to rid the demons from my system
But da game won't let me, it's steady pulling me in
But I thank you, since you kept a nigga breathing, eating, sleeping
Been up another week, another weekend
Days, hours, minutes, seconds
Feeling like I could, never pay you back 4 this blessing
So when a nigga pray, I don't pray for wealth
I pray for my family, I pray for health
If anything, I just pray we get closer
To the point, you become my main focus
Focus on, every word I say, I hope you soak this

But I'm saying I do

Retire my jersey let 'em hang my shoe 
Right on the telephone wire 
Lets grow, let's go higher 
Till we're both old and tired 
Cause even when we die, our souls won't expire

I do it all for you, my feelings are true from the very depth of my heart 
And don't you never, ever ever forget it babe

Yo! I'm about to lose my mind 
Hey girl you know you're so damn fine. 
Yo! I'm about to lose my mind

And no you shouldn't change for me 
You should change for you, wherever change may be

But the prettiest flower seems to have the most thorns 
We as stubborn as a bull with both horns 
All you got to say is I do, and maybe we can go on 
And no this ain't no song 
If loving you is right, then there ain't no wrong 
Therefore we can't grow long 
Like a man with no arms I just can't hold on 
Knowing that you ain't mine officially

Whether club or studio she want to know who I'm chilling with
Riding on that roller coaster none of us is feeling it

Money or relationship please don't let me choose this
Shes on a constant mood switch but I say theirs no right or wrong
She swears that shes right I'm wrong shes always trying to prove shit
I be on that cool shit she be on that bull shit

Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Where do we start time apart, so many years so much heart
So many tears but still I couldn't cry them
Knew I was hurt but all I do is hide them
Wish you was here to see the places I've been,
I knew you would be proud to see the cars that im driven,
The home that I live in, I know that you listen'
But if you were here, I wonder would it be different?
What would it be like if I could add a few years
To the times she wasn't here to experience so you could see life
Man that would be like, changing the ending of a book that we like
But that ain't the story that I wish you would rewrite
Gotta keep going until they give me the green light
Livin' it up but still somethin' don't seem right,
Be gone in a physical but lifted my dreams like
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Even though it's a dream to me,
It still seems to be what I perceive to be perfect scenery
What if your lost could come back at a cost
But they told you the price would be whatever your fortune is
Would you spend it in a minute, for a minute,
For a second just to ask one question about how life is in heaven
I would give it all back, to the point of no return
Just to feel one hug, or to hear one word
But it's the same what we learn what to value
But we still mall when there's no one around you
But mama I miss you, one day ill be with you
As long as I live you know you lifted my men too
Ill never forget you, you know that I love you
You know that I am the that I am because of you
Before I leave, you see, imma believe that you ain't in the flesh
You will come in my dreams
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Last night I had a dream and it felt so right
You held me in your arms and it felt so tight
And it felt so real, why would I wake up
I even day dream now, I don't wanna stay up
So you can take me to a place where I can go
And let my mind draw the picture that I control
Cause I'm dreamin', yes im dreamin'
If you catch me asleep just leave me
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)

Our love will live forever (every night)

And even if I could it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall it reminds me
That it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again and even if I'm there
They'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking
Through and through then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you, and even if my house falls
Down now, I wouldn't have a clue

Da quanto non lo so
So che affondo così 
Dentro l’odio che ho
A tratti sentirei 
Di svegliarti ma poi 
Ci penso e dico no
Ora meglio di no

Ti guardo mentre sei 
Abbandonato lì
Odio tutto di te 
Oramai è così
E te lo griderò 
E tu saprai il perchè
Non c’è niente fin qui 
Che salverei di te

Certo visto così 
Da vicino 
C’è il sonno che ti da 
Un aria da bambino 
Certo visto così 
Da vicino vicino
Da bambino che sei
Guardo gli occhi che hai 
E le ciglia che hai 
Le ciglia lunghe in cui 
Imprigionavi me 
Bugiardo più che mai 
Più incosciente più che mai
Che tristezza però 
Un amore con te
E ti odio di più 
Perchè alle altre tu 
Tu non hai dato mai 
I giorni tristi e bui
Quelle certo che no
Non correvano qui 
A consolare te 
Ma io stupida sì

E a vederti così 
Da vicino vicino 
C’è il sonno che ti dà 
Un aria da bambino
E a vederti così 
Da vicino vicino 
C’è il sonno che ti dà

Io ti odio e fra un po’ 
Quando ti sveglierai 
Basta, non tacerò 
Tanto è inutile ormai 
E sceglierò per te 
Quelle parole che 
Fanno male di più 
Vanno in fondo di più
Me ne vado, dirò
Ma un rimpianto ce l’ho 
Avere amato te 
Senza un vero perchè
Non so cosa darei 
Per non dovere mai 
Pensare che son 
Stata insieme a te

E a vederti così 
Da vicino 
C’è il sonno che ti dà 
Un aria da bambino
E a vederti così 
Da vicino vicino 
Che bambino che sei

Ti muovi e so già che 
Un sospiro farai 
La testa girerai 
I pugni allargherai 
E tra un secondo tu 
La bocca schiuderai 
E quasi sveglio poi 
Il mio nome dirai

Ecco guarda son qui
Mi chino su di te 
Ma questa volta no 
Non cederò perchè 
È quasi dolce sai 
Poter gridare che
Nessuno al mondo mai
Ti odierà più di me

Sto per farlo però
Ti svegli al tuo richiamo
Rispondo sono quì

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear

Va détruire le bonheur, fais ton travail sur Terre.
Va faire couler des pleurs, va déclencher des guerres.
Ton joli corps sans cœur, va le vendre aux enchères.
N'attends pas trop longtemps, les rides n'attendent pas.

Que ton dernier client soit l'homme que voilà.

Ogni semaforo rosso
È un insulto alla mia libertà

Col lampeggiatore giallo e blu

Poi lo scrivo dentro una canzone.
Non so neanche se l'ascolterai
O resterà soltanto un'altra fragile illusione.
Se le parole fossero una musica,
Potrei suonare ore ed ore, ancora ore e dirti tutto di me.

Ma quando poi ti vedo c'è qualcosa che mi blocca.
E non riesco a dire neanche 'Come stai?'
Come stai? Bene, con quei pantaloni neri.
Come stai? Bene, oggi.

Come non vorrei cadere in quei discorsi
Già sentiti mille volte e rovinare tutto.
Come vorrei poter parlare senza preoccuparmi,
Senza quella sensazione che non mi fa dire
Che mi piaci per davvero, anche se non te l'ho detto.

Perché è squallido provarci
Solo per portarti a letto.
E non me ne frega niente
Se dovrò aspettare ancora,
Per parlarti finalmente,
Dirti solo una parola.

Ma dolce più che posso,
Come il mare, come il sesso,
Finalmente mi presento.

E così, anche questa notte è già finita
E non so ancora dentro come sei.
Non so neanche se ti rivedrò
O resterà soltanto un'altra inutile occasione.
E domani poi ti rivedo ancora.
E mi piaci per davvero neanche se non te l'ho detto.

Perché è squallido provarci
Solo per portarti a letto.
E non me ne frega niente
Se non è successo ancora.
Aspetterò quand'è il momento.
Non sarà una volta sola.
Ma spero più che posso
Che non sia soltanto sesso
Questa volta lo pretendo,
Preferisco stare qui da solo,
Che con una finta compagnia.

E se davvero prenderò il volo,
Aspetterò l'amore e amore sia,
E non so se sarai tu davvero,
O forse sei solo un'illusione.
Però stasera mi rilasso, penso a te
E scrivo una canzone.

Come il mare, come il sesso.

Direbbe lei cretina ma lui che gran coglione

Oh, quante bugie mi hai detto, dove ti ho trovato
In quale maledetto giorno t'ho incontrato
Lo sai che se ti guardo adesso non mi piaci 
Ridammi le mie chiavi, dimentica i miei baci 
Non voglio più nemmeno toccare le coperte 
Dove ti sei sdraiato, dove ti senti forte
Che cosa c'è da dire, cosa c'è da fare

Non c'è niente da dire, niente più da fare

Portati via i fiori finti, la tua faccia, la tua gelosia
Vai via, portati lontano da me
Portati via tutto questo amore che non è mai amore

E mentre brucia lenta questa sigaretta 
Sorrido fingo e ti accompagno sulla porta
Io nei tuoi occhi leggo ""scusa un'altra volta"" 
Poi la tua schiena si allontana quanto basta 
Così ti vedo andartene su queste scale

Mind Games,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

With flowers and my love

Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
Paint it black, oh

I look inside myself
And see my heart is black
I see my red door
And it's painted into black

No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing
Happening to you

I see people turn their heads
And quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens anyway
Paint it black, oh

And I want it into black

Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me

Never listen to those truly strong.

For somebody to change my very core.

Doomed to love only myself forevermore.

Shallow people flocking to my banner.
Always trying to make easy amends,
Cherishing my own overbearing manner.

The shadows of my past bogging me down.
Feeling lost in turmoil and crisis,
My face forever set in an endless frown.

I have been hurt beyond mental repair,
Thence destined to suffer eternal damnation.
No one can be there for me to care,
But without I will never find salvation.

To be carried by the sound
I let it all just happen

I could not hear my thinking
The din was drowning it all out

I went further and further
The music swallowed me whole
I had to push more and more
To know how deep I could fall

And my time was running out
There would be but one instant
For me to vanquish my doubt

So possessed by you
Hiding from the day
You were showing me the way
There was something new

Then you cried out to the moon
Don't you come back to my room

Just go away
You are the fire
I am so afraid
Can't you tell me why

Dark reality
An somehow you call on me
Are you fantasized
Got no other choices
'Cause I know the voices
Can't be exorcised

Then you cried out to the moon
Don't you come back to my room
 
I once had a dream
And I thought that I would scream
And then there you were
I know it's a lie
I see it in your eyes
How can I be sure",Possessed by You

So why don't you 
Shape me 
Make me 
Wash me whiter than the snow 
I gotta find my way 
Back home 

Master upon my knees i pray 
I just want to be the clay 
Put your arms around me 
Place my life in your hands 
Lord, I know I'm just a man 
I know you understand 
This time I'm not letting go 
Till you 

Anoint me 
Appoint me 
Sometimes I feel so alone 
See, I gotta find my way back home 
So why don't you 
Chastise me 
Baptize me 
Wash me whiter than the snow 
I gotta find my way 

Cause I'm lost and alone 
I've been wandering 
Long enough to know 
Humbly I search for you 
And I'm not gonna rest 
Till you 

Choose me 
Use me

Aye baby, love is what you want

Aye baby, I feel so lucky
Aye baby, hope this feeling don’t pass
Aye baby, and you’re the drum of my heart beat
