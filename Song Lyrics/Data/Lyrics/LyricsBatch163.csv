Harry Nilsson,"Here comes the daylight, it's makin' me sad
Here comes the sunlight, makin' me sad
Had a good time last night, best I ever had
Here come the sunshine that's makin' me sad
So sad, so sad, so sad, so sad

Here come the daybreak, it's bringin' me pain
It's causin' me heartache, I wish it would rain
Had a good time last night, just me and my friends
But here come the daylight and now it's the end
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Here come the daylight, it's bringin' me down
Causin' me heartache, it's spinnin' my head around, yeah
Here come the daylight, it's bringin' me pain
It's causin' me heartache, I wish it would rain
Had a good time last night, just me and my friends
But here come the daylight and now it's the end
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no (oh no, oh no, oh no)

Here come the sunlight, it's bringin' me down
It's causin' me heartache, it's spinnin' my head around, yeah
Here come the daybreak, it's makin' me cough
It's causin' me sunburn, it's pissin' me off
Had a good time last night in the moon's glimpse
Now all that'll save me is a total eclipse
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no",Daybreak [From Son of Dracula]
Harry Nilsson,"You're not the only cuddly toy
That was ever enjoyed
By any boy

You're not the only choo choo train
That was left out in the rain
The day after Santa came

You're not the only charity light
That was left in the night
Who gave up without a fight, yeah

You're not the only cuddly toy
That was ever enjoyed
By any boy

You're not the kind of girl to tell your mother
The kind of company you keep
I never told you that I'd love no other
You must have dreamed it in your sleep, bop bop

Harry Nilsson,"Freckles was his name
He always used to get the blame
For every broken window pane
And how they'd yank him
They'd always spank him

In school, he'd tease the girls
He always used to pull their curls
The way that boy would carry on
It was a shame

And when the teacher found a tack on her chair
Though a hundred children were there
Everybody said, ""Freckles""
He always got the blame

Freckles was his name
He always used to get the blame
For every broken window pane

In school, he'd tease the girls
He always used to pull their curls
The way that boy would carry on
It was a shame

And when the cat had kittens up in the hay
One was black and seven were gray
Everybody said, ""Freckles""
He always got the blame

And though his marks were lower
Then the kids much slower
His marks were perfect
With the old bean blower

Freckles was his name
He always used to get the blame
For every broken window pane

In school, he'd tease the girls
He always used to pull their curls
The way that boy would carry on
It was a shame

Harry Nilsson,"It's been so long, it's been so long
It's been so long since I kissed you

Harry Nilsson,"She sang hymns out of tune
And carried a yellow balloon
She traded her love 
For a Spanish doubloon
And talked to the people
The people who are

Now I have a clock on the wall
It keeps time and that isn't all
It tells me how long she's been gone
Gone to the people 
The people who are

She lived in a sorcerer's room
And pounded the table 
And brandished the broom
She turned ten thousand 
When she touched the moon
And turned to the people
The people who are

Waaa waa waa 

Rain came down and scattered away
The old antique caretaker's children that play
Early that morning she passed away
Passed to the people The people who are

She sang!
She sang hymns out of tune
And carried a yellow balloon
She traded her love for a Spanish doubloon
And talked to the people
The people who are",She Sang Hymns Out of Tune
Harry Nilsson,"Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
She's silently closing her bedroom door
Just leaving a note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
She's quietly turning the backdoor key
She's stepping outside, and she is free

She, we gave her most of our lives 
Is leaving, sacrificed most of our lives, home
We gave her everything money could buy
For so many years

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
She picks up the note that is lying there
She's standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
""Daddy, daddy, our baby, she's gone!
How could she treat me so thoughtlessly
Tell me, why would she do this thing to me?""

She, we never thought of ourselves 
Is leaving, never a thought for ourselves, home
We struggled hard all of our lives to get by
Oh, yes we did
Struggled for so many years

It's Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
She's got away
She's waiting to keep an appointment that she's made
She's meeting a man from the motor trade

She, what did we do that was wrong
Is leaving, we never knew that we did anything wrong, home
Fun is the one thing that money cannot buy

Something inside that was always denied for so many years
Why should she treat us so thoughtlessly?
Why should she do this to me?
Our baby's leaving home
I've been living alone for so many years
Bye-bye, oh bye-bye, goodbye",She's Leaving Home
Harry Nilsson,"Ten little Indians standing in a line
One stood looking at another man's wife
Then there were nine

Nine little Indians
Their hearts were full of hate
One took another's goods
Then there were eight

Eight little Indians
They just got down from Heaven
One told a lie about another's best friend
Then there were seven

Seven little Indians
All trying to get their kicks
One thought he'd found another way
To get to Heaven, then there were six

Six little Indians
All trying to stay alive
One took another's life
Then there were five

Five little Indians
All trying to find the door
One pulled his mother down
Then there were four

Four little Indians
All thinking that they gotta be free
One little Indian forgot to say his prayers
Then there were three

Three little Indians
Deciding what they're gonna have to do
One took the name of God in vain
Then there were two

Two little Indians
Thinking that they oughta have some fun
One took a liking to a picture of himself
Then there was one

One little Indian
Out looking for the sun
At six o'clock, the moon came out
Then there was none

",Ten Little Indians
Harry Nilsson,"Gordon Warren

This is our last dance together
Tonight soon will be long ago
And in our moment of parting
This is all I want you to know

There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you

There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never, ever be another you?

Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never ever be
Another you?

",There Will Never Be
Harry Nilsson,"I'm leaving here this morning but I don't know where I've been
I'm going home to take my bath but I'll be back again
Yeah, I'm leaving here this morning with a smile upon my face
I'm beginning to think there's hope for the human race

I'm leaving here this morning but I don't know where I've been
There's a lot of talk about the place but I'll be back again
Yeah, I'm leaving here this morning with my eyes upon wide
And I'm awfully glad you let me come inside
Do, I could do, I could do, I could do,    
I could do, I could do, I could do, wa-ha

My mouth so dry it hurts my throat when I begin to speak

There was a time 
When you were mine 
An' not so long ago 
I used to say 
You'd never go away 
You'd never leave me lonely

Think about the happy times 
The groovy times

Harry Nilsson,"Oowah oowah ah ah ah-ah oowah oowah ah

My old desk does an arabesque,
In the morning when I first arrive 
It's a pleasure to see, it's waiting there for me
To keep my hopes alive

Such a comfort to know its got no place to go,
It's always there
Its the one thing I've got, a huge success,
My good old desk

My old desk never needs a rest,
And I've never once heard it cry
I've never seen it tease, its always there to please me
From nine to five

Such a comfort to know, it's dependable and slow,
But its always there
Its the one friend I've got, a giant of all times,
My good old desk

Oowah oowah ah ah ah, ah oowah oowah ah

My old desk isn't picturesque,
But its happy as a desk can be
We never say a word, 
But its perfectly alright with me

For when my heart's on the floor, I just open the drawer
Of my favorite guest
And what do I see? 
But a picture of me working at my good old desk

Oowah oowah ah ah ah, ah oowah oowah ah",Good Old Desk
Harry Nilsson,"I said goodbye to me,
I looked in the mirror,
Then I began to cry.
I'll leave my things behind for all to see,

And hope that she will understand why.
Ending the game is like changing the name of your favorite song.
Step out of rhyme for the very first time and the song is gone.
There's nothing left to say,

I'll pack up my memories then I'll walk away.
I hope I'm doing right, but by tonight,
The horse and coach will be on his way.
I said goodbye to me,

I looked in the mirror,
Then I began to cry.
I'll leave my things behind for all to see,
And hope that she will understand why.",I Said Goodbye To Me
Harry Nilsson,"Little fellow you're so tired
You can hardly lift your head
But you wanna hear a story
Before you go to bed
So if you'll be quiet
And listen patiently
I'll sing you a song
That my mother sang to me

Little cowboy, put your saddle in the barn
Tie your horse up tight, so he'll know no harm
Put your hat and your gun
Beside you on the chair
Don't forget, you've got to say a little prayer
Little cowboy, you'd better hit the sandman trail
Or you'll be late for roundup time you know
If you wanna be a cowboy, you'd better rest a while
Little cowboy baby of the old corral
Little cowboy baby of the old corral",Little Cowboy
Harry Nilsson,"When he was young, he sang in the band and his fans all looked the same
And the fans he had were younger than he and they loved to scream his name
They'd leave at the end of the third show, go home to talk of the fun 
Well, isn't nice the parents would say, well isn't nice you've got someone
Someone to idolize, he must look twice his size
I think it's great you're going through a phase
And I'm awfully glad it will all be over in a couple of days

Well, the calendar changed and the pages fell off, but the singer remained the same
And he never grew tired of singing his song, and his fans still called his name
They'd leave at the end of the second show, go home to talk of the fun
For most of the fans were married by then, so they had to be in by one

I'm awfully glad, the husbands would say, I'm awfully glad you got someone
Someone, I realize, who used to look twice his size
I think it's great you still remember his name
And I'll bet if he knew you were there for the show
He'd be awfully glad you came

""The time has come,"" the Walrus said, ""to speak of other things""
Like a fallen star who works in a bar where yesterday is king
The fans will stay for an hour or so, they still remember his fame
But the time has come the Walrus said, ""to call your fans by name""",Mr. Richland's Favorite Song
Harry Nilsson,"One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one
It's the loneliest number since the number one

""No"" is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
Because one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know

It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday

Because one is the loneliest number
That you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number
That you'll ever know

One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number

Harry Nilsson,"Listen to the wailing of the willows,
Listen to me crying on my pillow
Crying cause I know my love is gone from me

Living in a world of different places, 
Looking at a million different faces
Yet I see a face in every face I see      
Love must lack a sense of humor, 

It laughs when other people cry
Love, would love to hear the rumor, 
That you and I have finally said goodbye

I know that every heart was made for breaking
And my love was ready for the takin',
Still I won't complain for someday love will call again

Must I take a memory as a token,
To replace a heart that love has broken
Will the wailing willow always weep for me
Must I see a face in every place I see
Listen to the wailing of the willow tree",The Wailing of the Willow
Harry Nilsson,"Well I'm down and I'm out and I've had it to here with the city life. 
Gonna grab me a plane that'll take me back home to my folks.
Maybe real soon.
Just as soon as I get a few dollars ahead well you'll see,
Gonna show up in person instead of those letters I never write,
How does that sound 

You joke that I got a deal that's gonna make me a million tomorrow

Harry Nilsson,"If only I could find a place
Where smiling strangers knew our faces
I would take you there

A place with constant melody
Where you and I could wander free
I would take you there

Seems like such a waste of time
Just trying to unwind the facts of life
If I could find a place, I'd take you
Where the pain don't cut you like a knife

If only there were time enough
Or word enough or rhyme enough
I would take you there

Harry Nilsson,"I knew a man,
Bojangles,
And he'd dance for you
In worn out shoes,
With silver hair,
A ragged shirt,
And baggy pants.
The old soft shoe.
Jump so high,
Jump so high,
Then he'd lightly touch down.

I met him in a cell
In New Orleans,
I was down and out.
He looked to me to be the very eyes of age
As he spoke right out,
Talked of life, talked of life,
Laughed, slapped his leg and stepped.

He said the name ""Bojangles""
And he danced a lick
Across the cell.
Grabbed his pants,
A better stance,
And wow he jumped up high.
Clicked his heels.
He let go a laugh,
Let go a laugh,
Shook back his clothes all around.

He danced with those at minstrel
Shows & county fairs,
Throughout The South.
He spoke with tears
Of fifteen years
Of how his dog and him,
Had traveled about.
His dog up and died,
He up and died,
After twenty years he still greives.

He said ""I dance
Now and every chance at
Honkey-tonks,
For drinks and tips.
But most of time
I spend behind these country bars,
Cause I drinks a bit.""

He shook his head.
And as he shook his head,
I heard someone ask please,

Harry Nilsson,"Open your window and take a deep sigh
Think about letting the rest of the world go fly a kite
Taking it easy, is easy as pie
And holding your hand is such a natural high

Harry Nilsson,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence","Daddy's Song [New Vocals, Guitar/Piano Out of Sync][Mix]"

Had a little fight with my baby last night and it's early in the morning

I went to your girlfriend's house
But she was out
I knocked on your daddy's door

Harry Nilsson,"Everybody's talking at me 
I don't hear a word they're saying 
Only the echoes of my mind 

People stopping staring 
I can't see their faces 
Only the shadows of their eyes 

I'm going where the sun keeps shining 
Thru' the pouring rain 
Going where the weather suits my clothes 
Backing off of the North East wind 
Sailing on summer breeze 
And skipping over the ocean like a stone 

Everybody's talkin' at me 
Can't hear a word their sayin' 
Only the echos of my mind 
I won't let you leave my love behind 
No i won't let you leave 
I won't let you leave my love behind

I had a drink or two
An hour so ago
It made me think of you
And now I know it's not the last time
Last time
Flying high up in the sky
I wonder why
I think I'm gonna fall
Think I'm gonna fall
There I go again, I'm up again, there I go again
I hope this isn't all
Hey
As long as were up here
We might as well stay
In sweet harmony
Flying high up in the sky
I wonder why I have to have another
Point of view
To see me through
And now I think I'm gonna fall
I hope this isn't all
And on top of that
I hope it's not the last time",P.O.V. Waltz
Harry Nilsson,"Sit beside the breakfast table
Think about your troubles
Pour yourself a cup of tea
Then think about the bubbles

You can take your teardrops
And drop them in a teacup
Take them down to the riverside
And throw them over the side

To be swept up by a current
Then taken to the ocean
To be eaten by some fishes
Who were eaten by some fishes

And swallowed by a whale
Who grew so old
He decomposed, ooh
Doo-doo
Doo-doo

He died and left his body
To the bottom of the ocean
Now everybody knows
That when a body decomposes
The basic elements
Are given back to the ocean

And the sea does what it oughta
And soon there's salty water (not too good for drinking)
'Cause it tastes just like a teardrop (so they run it through a filter)
And it comes out from a faucet (and it pours into a teapot)
Which is just about to bubble
Now
Think about your troubles
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah",Think About Your Troubles

A sigh is just a sigh

'Cause everything's stranger
Than it used to be
You're a scary old place out there world
But I couldn't be happy without you
And I swear all my thoughts are about you
The most beautiful world in the world
Well the light can be bright there
And everything's right there
The end of the night there might be a big band
Or a heavenly chior--Or it might be the fire
But no matter what happens
I bet it's OK
You're a scary old place out there world
But I couldn't be happy without you
And I swear all my thoughts are about you
The most beautiful world in the world
Your mountains when you're mad
Your rivers when your sad
And those deep blue seas
I love you for your snow
Your deserts down below
I love the way you wear your trees
The most beautiful world in the world
And though there are times when I doubt you
I just couldn't stay here without you
So when you get older
And over your shoulder
You look back to see if it's real
Tell her she's beautiful
Roll the world over
And give her a kiss and a feel
So long, folks!
Goodbye, Harry.
See you next album, Richard.
GOODBYE!

Harry Nilsson,"Here's why I did not go to work today
Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day
Thursday has its own peculiar way
Of saying ""hey""

Sometimes Thursday almost
Makes you want to run away
Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day

Yeah, Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day
Let's go have a picnic, Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day
Hope it doesn't rain

When I'm feeling Thursday
I go and have a drink
If Thursday was a boat I bet it'd sink

I did on Monday
I tried on Tuesday
Wednesday's simply not my cup of tea, oh
Thank Heaven it's Friday
Thank the Lord for the weekend
Thursday now, that's such a crazy, lazy day

They say Monday's child is full of faith
Tuesday's child is fair of face
Thursday's child has far to go
And it's no wonder
When the week becomes a rat race
You can bet, win, show or place
But never bet on Thursday
'Cause God's not on its case

Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day
Don't get me wrong
It's just that Thursday's twice as long as it should be
It's twice as long

Mondays, Tuesdays, weekends, Fridays
Don't get in my way
But Thursday's just a crazy, lazy day

Monday is a blues day
That goes for Tuesday
Wednesday's just the middle of the week, yeah, hmm
Friday is just another payday
The weekend's just another heyday
But Thursday's surreptitiously unique

That's why I didn't go to work today

Thursday's got its own peculiar way
Of saying ""hey""
Sometimes Thursday makes you want to run away

Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day
Thursday's such a crazy, lazy day",Here's Why I Did Not Go to Work Today
Harry Nilsson,"How to write a song
How to write a song
How to write a song
How to write a song

If you write it on guitar
Place your guitar upon your knee
If you write it on piano
Don't do that

Place your fingers on the
Strings of your guitar
Not your piano
If you write it on piano, don't do that

Now strum or press together
Feeling, this might take a little time
Now think of something sad or something funny
Which inevitably brings us to the rhyme

Let's assume you're just an asshole
And there's nothing in your pain
It might help if you remember
These helpful little hints

Don't try to rhyme (sumba?) with anything
That goes for homage as well
But notice how cleverly
I just used them both
And all I have to do
Is rhyme well

You've got to be tricky
Because to avoid these words takes talent
So never ever trap yourself
Like that, or you'll end up saying words like

Oh, balent or falent
Or dalent or
Oh, I'm sure you'll catch on fast

Now some tips on tempo
And some subjects to avoid
Like the use of the word bandit
Unless you really have to say it
And that's for 'tempo'

And if you say 'time'
That's strictly up to you
Because that depends on how you play it

Now let's do (it) once
Now think of a rhyme
Now that's it, you're doing fine
Think of the good time
We just had together

If you practice these instructions
On the board of some new sale
If you listen very carefully
I'm sure you'll shout it there

I said shout
Shout it
Why, heheh, That rhymes with talent
That takes talent
That is talent
Oh my God, oh
Shout it rhymes with talent
That takes talent
That is talent
Oh
I cannot stand it

Harry Nilsson,"Deep down in my soul I hate rock and roll
And I don't like the way that them drummers beat on them drums
They always hum along, out of tune
But I can see Valentino and me when I hear a tango.

Electric guitars have gone about as far as electric guitars can go
If you're talking 'bout loud man, it's more than I can stand
You can go down the hole with your sweet rock and roll
I'll take a tango.

I can see me dancing
Oh, I'll glide across the floor.

You know, down in my soul I hate rock and roll
And I don't like the way that them drummers beat on them drums
They always hum along, out of tune
But I can see Valentino and me when I hear a tango
Yeah, I can see Valentino and me when I hear a tango
Yeah, I can see Marlon Brando and me when I hear a tango",I'll Take a Tango
Harry Nilsson,"Jesus I said Jesus I said Jesus Christ you're tall
I bet nobody I bet nobody I bet nobody wanted to dance with you at all
I said Jesus, I said Jesus there hardly ain't no room here for you at all
I said Jesus. I said Jesus I said Jesus Christ you're tall

Well we could dribble our way down a courtship
Get married for a little while
I would shoot a little love inside your basket mama and in a little while we'd have a child
He'd be a little boy, he'd be a little boy

But he'll get taller as the time goes by
He'd be a little boy, he'd be a little boy
But pretty soon he'll hear the other boys cry
Because they're saying to him

Jesus they'd say Jesus they'd say Jesus Christ you're tall
I bet some day at least some day I hope he finds a basketball
So maybe a big scout from a big town team will come and sign him to the meadow larks
And then someday. Someday he'll play as good as van dyke parks

He'll be famous he'll get married, he'll be happy,
He'll be happy with the girl next door
They'll have a little boy, they'll have a little boy but at birth he'll measure six foot four
Each generation as the time goes by

Will grow and grow until they reach the sky
And finally someday I said someday they'll bump into God
And he'll say ""hi""

And then he'll say Jesus, Jesus look at 'em, Jesus Christ they're tall Jesus. Just look at 'em. Jesus

Hey' you guys want to play a little basketball
There will be a big court up in heaven
Softer than the softest cloud

They can play all day, they can play all night they can play as long as they can play

It'll be a half court game until the other boys show it'll be a full court game and then, when it's over we'll hear a high score. It'll be over, then the end amen hey' Jesus, oh Jesus. Sweet Jesus Christ you're tall no nobody. No no nobody

You guys wanna play a little basketball

C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon Jesus
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon Lord
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon do a hook shot baby
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon shoot that ball
C'mon Jesus let's get together

I loved you a long time ago
Way up in heaven, up in heaven, that's the hell of it baby all night long",Jesus Christ You're Tall

Can't go nowhere
If it wasn't for the daytime
There'd be nothing to fear

If it wasn't for the daylight
They say there wouldn't be no light at all
But if it wasn't for the night life,
I wouldn't be here at all

I wouldn't be here at all
Daylight has caught me
Can't run away
Daylight has caught me

Looks like another day
I'm waitin' for the moonshine,
Come moon shine on me
Looks like daylight has caught me,

Daylight has caught me
Well, I'm a friend of daylight
Daylight's no friends with me
Moonlight's an old friend of mine

Keeps me drinking
Keeps me up all the time
Keeps me down by the river side
Countin' stars, lookin' for some moonshine

Moonshine is all I need
Daylight comes sneakin' up on me
Moonlight is all I want
Daylight is all I can't stand

Daylight has caught me once again
Again, again, again, again
Looks like that daylight's
Caught up with me as fast as it could

Looks like that daylight
Won't let another day go by
Well if I had some darkness 'round me
I could really see

But as it happens,
Daylight has caught up on me
So I say
Damn damn the daylight

It's gone and caught me for another day
Damn damn the daylight
It does it every day
It does it anyway

It wants to
No matter how I fight it
Why, I could put out the candles
At night time

But god's gonna light 'em
In the morning
Daylight's found me once again
Daylight is chasin' me all over the world

I'd like to jump on some airplane
Just to get away from it all
Daylight is after me,
I don't like to see it smile

That's why I pray for night time
And darkness
Just for a while
If I could sleep in the mornin'

And I could play at night
If I could have the evening
I wouldn't need the daylight
Damn, damn the daylight

It's gone and caught me for
Another day
Damn damn the daylight
It does it every day

Let it rain on Monday
I'd be happy as a king
But here comes the sun-king
Every morning",Daylight Has Caught Me

And all the windows were tight
And there were thirteen people in the house
The owner and his wife
The butler and his wife
Cook with her knife
A couple named Smythe
The Andersons were there
With another strange pair
And the scary caretaker and me

The clock struck one, there was the sound of a gun
And I heard somebody run away
And the twelve who were alive had terror in their eyes
And I overheard the Andersons say
Who could have done it?
Who could have done it

To call the police, but just then
All the power went out
And we heard a great shout 
And we knew for some-one else it was the end
And when the power came on
We were shocked with alarm
For instead of being twelve we were ten
Who could have done it?
Who could have done it?
The Andersons were such a nice pair

Now the owner and his wife
Both afraid of their life
So they hurried to the door to run away
But before they got there
There was a whistle through the air, 
Then another, then they both had passed away
There were seven of us let now

But I knew it wasn't me or the Sloans
Cause when the power went out
And we heard the others shout
We were out there in the hallway on the phone

That left the butler and his wife
And the couple named Smythe
And the old scary caretaker too
So the Sloans and I
Who were both afraid to die
Had to think of something quick we could do
So we called the Smythes 
And the butler and his wife
And we gathered in the drawing room
But before we could call for the caretaker too
It was too late for he had met his doom

Harry Nilsson,"Well in 1941 a happy father had a son
And by 1944 the father walked right out the door
And in '45, the mom and son were still alive
But who could tell in '46 if the two were to survive

Well the years were passing quickly
But not fast enough for him
So he closed his eyes through '55
And then he opened them up again
When he looked around he saw a clown
And the clown seemed very gay
And he set that night to join that circus clown and run away

Well he followed every railroad track
And every highway sign
And he had a girl in each new town
And the towns he left behind
And the open road
Was the only road he knew
But the color of his dreams
Was slowly turning into blue

Then he met a girl, the kind of girl
He wanted all his life
She was soft and kind and good to him
So he took her for his wife
And they got a house not far from town
And in a little while
The girl had seen the doctor
And she came home with a smile

Now in 1961, a happy father had a son
And by 1964 the father walked right out the door
And in '65 the mom and son were still around

To bring down the curtain and one thing's for certain,
There's nothing to keep them together

How does it happen that two can be tender
And one be the lender of love and emotion
That covered the ocean of sadness that kept them together?

Love when it started was easy to measure,
Each day was a pleasure, each night an adventure,
Each morning was something that had to be shared together

Love when it's growing is full of surprises
As temperature rises from higher to higher,
Then turns into fire that has to be shared together

Then came the sadness which follows the laughter
And shortly thereafter the dream had exploded,
A promise was broken, now few words are spoken together

When I think of all my sorrows
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know

Harry Nilsson,"Well in 1941 a happy father had a son
And by 1944 the father walked right out the door
And in '45 the mom and son were still alive
But who could tell in '46 if the two were to survive
Well the years were passing quickly
But not fast enough for him
So he close his eyes through '55
And he opened them up again
When he looked around he saw a clown
And the clown seemed very gay
And he set that night to join that circus clown and run away

Well he followed every railroad track
An every highway sign
And he had a girl in each new town
And the towns he left behind
And the open road
Was the only road he knew
But the color of his dreams
Slowly turning into blue
The he met a girl the kind of girl
He wanted all his life
She was soft and kind and good to him
So he took her for a wife
And they got a house not far from town
And in a little while
The girl had seen the doctor
And she came home with a smile
Now in 1961 a happy father had a son
And by 1964 the father walked right out the door
And in '65 the mom and son were still around
But what will happen to the boy
When the circus comes to town?",1941 [Remix]
Harry Nilsson,"Years ago, I knew a man,
He was my mother's biggest fan
We used to walk beside the sea
And he told me how life would be
When I grew up to be a man

And years ago, we used to play
He used to laugh when I ran away
And if I fell and hurt my knee
He would run to comfort me
And the pain would go away

Years ago, I knew a boy
He was his daddy's pride and joy, pride and joy
But when the daddy went away
It was such a rainy day
That he brought out all his toys

And how the mother did explain
Trying to take away the pain
But, he just couldn't understand
That his father was not a man
And it all was just a game

The years have passed and so have I
Making it hard for me to cry
And if and when I have a son
Let it all be said and done
Let the sadness pass him by",Daddy's Song

My old desk doesn't arabesque
In the morning when I first arrive
It's a pleasure to see
It's waiting there for me
To keep my hopes alive

Such a comfort to know
It's got no place to go
It's always there
It's the one thing I've got
A huge success
My good old desk

My old desk never needs a rest
And I've never once heard it cry
I've never seen it tease
It's always there to please me

Of my favorite guest
And what do I see?
But a picture of me

Harry Nilsson,"When he was young, he sang in the band and his fans all looked the same
And the fans he had were younger than he and they loved to scream his name
They'd leave at the end of the third show, go home to talk of the fun 
Well, isn't nice the parents would say, well isn't nice you've got someone
Someone to idolize, he must look twice his size
I think it's great you're going through a phase
And I'm awfully glad it will all be over in a couple of days

Well, the calendar changed and the pages fell off, but the singer remained the same
And he never grew tired of singing his song, and his fans still called his name
They'd leave at the end of the second show, go home to talk of the fun
For most of the fans were married by then, so they had to be in by one

I'm awfully glad, the husbands would say, I'm awfully glad you got someone
Someone, I realize, who used to look twice his size
I think it's great you still remember his name
And I'll bet if he knew you were there for the show
He'd be awfully glad you came

""The time has come,"" the Walrus said, ""to speak of other things""
Like a fallen star who works in a bar where yesterday is king
The fans will stay for an hour or so, they still remember his fame
But the time has come the Walrus said, ""to call your fans by name""",Mr. Richland's Favorite Song [Remix]
Harry Nilsson,"Life isn't easy when two are divided and one has decided
To bring down the curtain and one thing's for certain,
There's nothing to keep them together.

How does it happen that two can be tender
And one be the lender of love and emotion
That covered the ocean of sadness that kept them together?

Love when it started was easy to measure:
Each day was a pleasure, each night an adventure,
Each morning was something that had to be shared together.

Love when it's growing is full of surprises
As temperature rises from higher to higher,
Then turns into fire that has to be shared together.

Then came the sadness which follows the laughter
And shortly thereafter the dream had exploded,
A promise was broken, now few words are spoken together.

Life isn't easy when two are divided and one has decided
To bring down the curtain and one thing's for certain,
There's nothing to keep them together.",Together [Remix]

Without her, I can't go on 
Without her, I can't go on

Harry Secombe,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Harry Secombe,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star

Circling your lips.

Then I will loosen up the knots until it feels right.
If your ears just ache from listening,
Then I'll supply the remedy in the melodies I sing.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Harry Verbeke,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Harry Verbeke,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Harry Veygel,"I decided to take a stand,
not knowing I'd lose my best friend.
But I'd rather live right
than in hell, lift up my eyes.

Stand
Stand
you stand.

Stand for holiness,
stand for righteousness
and be counted among them 
that shall reign with Him.

You stand when friends are gone,
stand when you're all alone,
and believe He shall receive His own.

Stand

Harry Warren,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

Cause I'm awfully fond of getting
Love in an actual setting.
This is what I call the simple things:
Just a winding stream where I can drift and dream.
And now I'm waiting for you.

By a waterfall I'm calling you.
We can share it all beneath a ceiling of blue.
We'll spend a heavenly day
Here where the whispering waters play.
There's a whipper will that's calling you.
By a waterfall, he's dreaming too.
There's a magic melody
Mother nature sings to me
Beside a waterfall with you.

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I am in denial for in you was the vision of discipline, truth revealed. I won't let you fall away from my memories. The heart endures unyielding, the times with you won't fade. Burned by the sting of loss for someone so close. Afraid. Receive forgiveness. There's no one to blame. May you live on. No one believed that you held it inside. Blind is the fury that concealed your cries. May you live on. I try to erase this face that brings me pain and leaves me behind this wall, but I won't forget that part of you that would catch me when I'd fall. You will survive in my heart. Engraved in my mind.

Gaining its pulse breeding inside

And almost definitely make more of it 
Than it was 
But everyone around us would know 
Everyone watching would know 

This is not a walk with walking wounded 
Here's the ball, here's the pole, now where's the tether 
Where's the tether? 
Hands can grow together 

If you're not careful or grateful or whatever 
And I never much cared much too much to begin with 
I will not take your possibilities under my care 
I will not see you on the bus 

You want me to hold your hand 
It's a courtship I can't stand 
And here I thought you were crying because you were happy 
But no no no 

Friends will turn against you 
People disappoint you every time 
So if you've got greatness in you would you do us all a favor 
And keep it to yourself? 

Keep it 
Keep it to yourself

Quit your job and move away with me

They'll take the world apart and break my baby brother's finger 
So he can't shake my hand 

Guard the dead against my legacy 
And lack the wound no more

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

i couldn't let this be a goodbye

Controls your thoughts but you can't see

He feels no pain, he has no mercy or no fears
He gives the message and your mind is filled with blue

Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

They cursed and buried him
Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning Hell-unholy one
But now he's returned to prove them wrong

Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

And when he finds who he's looking for

When the plastic actresses take off their clothes
Just to demonstrate all their curves and cleavages
And subtleties quite forgetting their hair

Haunted by Angels,"I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind

My Moms said be strong
But I'm feeling kind of lonely
Yeah Mr. Havikk feelin' kind of shadey
I realize where gangs hanging
Ain't the place to raise a damn baby
Tryin' to be an OG means you gotta G-Ride
But if you G-Ride one time is gonna who-ride
Put the guns on lock down
Keep your head up
My homies dyin' day by day I'm gettin' fed up yo
I reminisce about the way back times
When you used to hang out, shoot hoops and kick rhymes yo

''cause Hav stopped the bangin'
Stopped the dope slangin'

Only jail keeps me sweated on the daily

They swear a G jack a G but to me yo it's all good
I rather be a punk OG

Then switched gears, pulled out of here like last year
Now everything gets smoothed, like jasmine, chinchilla
Puff so white, that’s Mac Miller, for some kind of wait then blast, nigga
Worry me that’s the good one, fear nothing, add ‘em
‘Round here ain’t no fab one, we knocks it without no flare gun

[Chorus: x2]

I stay down, I’m a chaos, havoc and mayhem
To be in the streets you gotta be a brave man
Talk about you coming up and do the main band
‘Cause ain’t no telling what these motherfuckers would do
Be prepared in case anybody fuck with the crew
They was in the club, watching, you was in the VIP
Throwing hundreds around like money ain’t nothing to you
They be the ones that fall back, up in the cut and probably in all black
Mean motherfuckers and they all strapped, looking you, acting like you was all that
Acting like you untouchable ‘cause you tripping till they catch you slipping
And then what you thought you’d see?
Better be on top of your chip when you walking through the shots
Same demo when you walk through Queens
Shorty like I doubt that, I got things and I’m ‘bout that
This hood life what it look like, probably snatched up still ain’t felt that
The game is better, it’s cold or vice versa depending on what you see, so
Learn when to check your ego, watch your people, money is evil
When you learn to keep your

[Chorus: x2]

Either with me or against me, there ain’t no in-betweens
Don’t walk around fearing no man when they bleed just like me
I represent that bad block, I’m mascot, is that real dope?
Roam around with that fuckery and get stomped out with them steel toes
Mashed up on that sidewalk, can’t go against that current
Taking turns whipping that ass, we gonna give respect that’s earned
And to whom it may concern, got a problem, be my guest
We will play fair but you will ‘cause you’re not keeping no death around
Keep those

The elevator ride to the top'll make you woozy 
Either shootin' the Uzi or the MK 
Starter in the game, you just get in when the bench play 
At your door with the four, ""bonjour"" like the French say 
Nigga you just plain, cut you up like a sensei 
Take you down like the statue at Penn State

Gold medalling them niggas, ain't nothin' 'bout me average 
Cannons bigger than me, we go deaf when we shoot 'em 
And niggas on the floor with they cerebellum oozin'

I'll have 'em bag 'em up, butt-ass in the kitchen 
I'mma leave bitches foamin' at the mouth 
Fuck what you heard, it wasn't drought, they lied 
Over here it's all the way gully 
In the morning, answer to God's calling 
Snoring, I can't afford to sleep, the cousin of death 
The city never sleeps, so why the fuck would I rest?

NYC to my casket
Got a nigga workin in that since, did you back it?
See why niggas hatin cuz they money like molasses
See that’s how it is when you hustle it backwards
They handlin that ratchet, have you dippin in and out of traffic
Hand out the window, throwin out my blunt ashes
Money on my mind so it appears like magic
Fuck around illusion, motherfuckers all vanish
I only fuck with family
One day when one nigga had that cavalry
Back when Knicks had that nigga Marcus Camby
Had to make it work, a nigga never had a plan B
Go get a status, salute in yo Gucci fabric
Everything fly, gotta have it
Might sound shallow, got a fetish for a bad bitch
A true believer, ain’t nothing that I can’t get
Get it!

Here’s sneak peak, show you what I’m involved in
Death to anybody, get it’s the order with coffins
It’s a hood thing, going in the belly of the beast
A C-section couldn’t pull me out of this geef
All my niggas is warriors, get hit with a spear tip
Closing on the end of that bitch, that’s the end of that bitch
Niggas clinching, I ain’t friend of that shit
I leave a nigga naked like a coke nose drip
In them powers did you with, yea I seen em all dip
I’m like salsa, no tortilla, shut yo mouth up
Niggas on the outskirts, make you feel threats
For years getting bread, it ain’t go stale yet
Niggas said your name, it ain’t ring a bell yet
I’m talkin lot of shit now, money on my breath motherfuckers

As the sun shinin on my face
I thank the higher power for another day
Try do it better than I did it yesterday
Tryin at the studios, stay above the fray
It’s a ill world that we live in, I’m a work in progress
Phase one executed, I’m out of the projects
You really take a fool to box this
I made this far, why would I defy logical?
What got me here won’t get me there
I’m focusin, I’m on my square
Put it on everything that I love
I would never aks, take mine some blood
They say a prophet loved everywhere but home
No wonder I’m so compelled to roam the globe
I’m outta here, success is the best revenge
That failure’s not an option, me and that will never play

Gotta get mines – find now how this rooftop shouted
Gotta get mines – show the world that you bout it
Gotta get mines – from the top to bottom they’re crowded

They say great minds think alike
And two wrongs don’t make a right, make us even though
Life a bitch, yea I put in the sleeper hold
Got me sayin shit is all good just a week ago
Try to park up the bullshit but the meter low
But the small talk, only tell you what you need to know
Not a follower so naturally I took the meter road
Let the haters hate, couldn’t wait to let them see me blow
Lookin now, can’t hold back ambition
Honesty, real faith and no ass kissin
I’m on a have mission, gotta have everything
That my heart desire on the bigger better things
I may control on my destiny
And never let the fuckery get the best of me

Hollow-tip slugs that’ll pierce through the vests

I ain’t talkin’ bout textin’, I get down in the trenches
Hang ‘em like Texans, give ‘em just enough rope
To do it on his own, after that, I’m ghost

Guap over hoes, get your hands out the pot
Fuck a #1 spot, and your little rap favorites
Young, rich and famous, I’m amongst the hood’s greatest

Put niggas on mute, use the .9 like a remote
An end to the fuckery you tryin’ to promote
We was in the same boat ‘til I threw ‘em overboard
Fed ‘em to the sharks, give you what your hand called
Fall – know I keep the goons on call
Ball ‘til I fall, hope you niggas all crawl
Fuck your life - I ain’t never gave two fucks
Ain’t nothin’ to us to have that ass tied up in the trunk
In the middle of nowhere, they probably won’t find you
Do a nigga dirty, you don’t wanna be my rival
Now you caught up in the mix, in some real deep shit
I can spot a mile away, niggas never peep shit

Motherfuckers thought they knew me, but nah they was laid off
Niggas tradin cars, yappin out the mouth
And could we talk about a life they ain’t move about
And wondered why niggas try to run up in they house
Gotta do the math on a bitch fore you get the stuff
Some of these hoes straight nut gags
And how you try to bend the crib butt ass

People see you want chops, so many clapped feelings
Middle finger up to the sensitive
Go fuck yourself, dose of your own medicine
I’m on the cheddar bands, never was a settling for less
‘Cause anything less was just stress
Fuck distractions and the company you keep
We play for keeps, fuck you and your little beefs
Tryna grab that something your arms can’t reach
Could be of many other patients, me and my niggas feast

How I make out a shit hole

Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are tonight

A thousand heart beats beat in time
It makes this dark planet come alive
So when the lights flicker out tonight
You gotta shine

When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight

Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight",Shooting Star
Hawaiian Escape,"I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

The teacher's that taught me weren't cool

A little better all the time 
I have to admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine 

Me used to be angry young man 
Me hiding me head in the sand 
You gave me the word 
I finally heard 
I'm doing the best that I can 
I've got to admit it's getting better 

I used to be cruel to my woman 
I beat her and kept apart from the things that she loved

and I don't mind about the things you're gonna say, Lord,
I gave all my money, and my time
I know it's a shame, but I'm givin' you back your name, yeah, yeah

It was plain to see that a small town boy like me

It was wishful thinkin'
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy,
and you gave me nothin' in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say, ""Would you please just go away,"" yeah, yeah

HAWK,"[Chorus - 2X]
I'm chilling with my broad, and you already know
And if you want to reach me, hit me on the down low
If I don't call back, don't put on a show
When I pass by your house and blow, instead of knocking on your do'

[H.A.W.K.]
You know that opposites attract, and hoes choose macs
And how some girls act, when playas don't call em back
Why is that, is it cause I'm hard to ignore
The kind of man you adore, but already spoken for
Or, are you caught up in the fame
Holding your head in shame, cause you don't know my real name
Who's to blame, cause it ain't my fault
It's another lesson taught, when you fucking with H.A.W.K.
Caught up in the rapture, wasn't hard to catch you
With my heavy weight frame and my 6-4 stature
I snatched you, whatever this game planned
Wanted me to be a man, but I had other plans
It was a one night stand, now the shit hit the fan
Everytime you see a nigga, you want to hold my hand
Girl you don't understand, that you not my type
I got a wife, and you're just my late night hype

[Chorus - 2X]

[H.A.W.K.]
Now I admit I was wrong, for leading you on
The long talks on the phone, you thought our bond was strong
But my woman's at home, so girl leave me alone
And all the plans you had for us, they been postponed
Now I ain't being rude, I'm just a type of dude
Buy you a little food, and get you into the mood
Now we're both in the nude, catching an attitude
Acting crude and shrude, and showing no gratitude
You broke all the rules, and I'm glad I peeped it
You couldn't be like Victoria, and keep this secret
You wasting your time, cause you star 69
but the cell phone I called you on, ain't even mine
It was strictly bump and grind, cause that's how I play
You said you didn't mind, so I behaved this way
It was just the other day, when you said this
And why you think I act funny, when you ask for a kiss
(you silly bitch)

[Chorus - 2X]

[H.A.W.K.]
Now you rubbing me, kissing and hugging me
Infatuated with the thug in me
You say you loving me, the situation's getting ug-ly
Got your partnas mean mugging me
Girl you bugging me, getting on my last nerve
And then you wonder why, you got kicked to the curb
You puzzled like crosswords, and asking me to choose
Either you or my wife, girl you know you'd lose
Now your ass got the blues, rich goody to-shoe
Sitting there all confused, feeling like you been used
Your privilege is world view, and now you know
Instead of knocking on your do, I'ma pass by and blow
Gotta go gotta go, gotta chill with my broad
So I toots my horn, since you been acting fraud
I hit you with the raw, and you went outrageous
Should of warned you though, that my love is contagious

[Chorus - 2X]",You Already Know
HAWK,"[Z-Ro]
I'ma maintain, all about fortune, not the fame
Feddy, cold cash and a diamond ring, it's all about feddy when I
Rap sing
I'm sick of this struggling all damn day
Never see the sun cause skies stay gray
This for the little kids that can't go play
Cause everybody outside playing with an AK
Come around my niggas you bust you fuck around get lost
Better not set trip, fuck around get tossed 
I be a fool with that break them off 
Lay it down little daddy straight take them off
Yeah I'm living a sin when against the grain
You don't know Z-Ro you don't know my pain
Tears be coming on down like rain
It's a full time job, trying to maintain
Want to stay right but right be broke, a nigga can't eat with
Dreams and hopes
Steady be thinking of sell some dope, or trying to get paid from
Songs I wrote
In it to win it, don't plan to lose, got to be a real nigga fill
My shoes
Got to pay the rent, got to pay the light bill 
Got to pay the depend, deposit and pay dues
Me and that H-A-W-K, got to deal with stress when it come my way

But one of these days gone be out there
It's a bitch took a ball, ball and parlay
Until we make it we mash together
Ooint seven by the nine we blast together
South sive for live, S.U.C. for life, nigga we get cash forever

Maintaining, hustling struggling but I got to survive
Keep maintaining, it's a burden up on my conscience just staying
Alive

[Hawk]
I'm a real hustler stacking funds, riding around with a loaded
Gun

Some of my niggas that's on the run, with all that weed up in
Your lungs
Get your paper, get your dough, buy it off the show room floor
Go about this process slow, and feel the pain of my nigga Z-Ro
Over money I lose sleep, sell work, fuck sheep
Spit heat on beats, to make my, ends meet
Press hard on tablet sheets, everything else is obsolete
Victim of these ghetto streets, you don't work, you don't eat
I strive to, gain fame, struggle to maintain
Stay away from no names and flip bricks of cocaine
This rap thang's been good to me, feeds my, family
Forever keep my sanity, and do this shit for P-A-T
Must keep a leather head, for all my partners let's make em
Spread
Me and my niggas we break bread, until the whole family's fed
You heard what, I said, in this, over bull
All that, I say, I speak, the truth

(Chorus - 2x)

[Z-Ro]
Looking at this little light of mine, never did glimmer, never
Did shine
Cause I resort to a life of crime, and I know I'm wrong, but I
Got to get mine
Got to feed my mouth and five more, I grind every day but I stay
Broke
Responsibility baby, taking a load off my little day
Steady be working her fingers to the bone, aching and tired when
She come home
Bout to pull a stunt, last of the month
Ain't no more work, just riding on chrome 
No rocks in my pocket the on my neck
One slip and I'm tripping one growing up thick
Give me a couple of zeros on a check
I might sweat, but never gone let up

While everyone is around I'll take a moment
To let you know that I'm down

Have all my questions been ignored
This time I'm walking out the door

I don't know if I'll ever know why
Or hear the sound when angels cry
What you said to me late last night
I'll remember for the rest of my life

I see the ways that you've touched my life
And I want you to know that I'll

I feel like I'm alive

Whenever you're around

You can find me hiding in the crowd

Each time you come to town



Every time I want to say hello

Every time I want to stay I go

I never find the words to let you know

Sometimes you plague my mind a million times



Every time I want to say hello

Every time I want to stay I go

I never find the words to let you know

Sometimes you plague my mind a million times



I try to somehow let you know

That all the way from here to Mexico

You're the one and only girl for me

He-he tu es un, bonjour oui oui

And my tongue gets tied so quick

I get so nervous I'm feeling sick

I turn into the world's worst Romeo

Every time I try to say hello



You're so fine

Been on my mind

Get nervous every time

I see you hop on by



Every time I want to say hello

Every time I want to stay I go

I never find the words to let you know

Sometimes you plague my mind a million times



Every time I want to say hello

Every time I want to stay I go

I never find the words to let you know

Sometimes you plague my mind a million times



Every time I want to say hello

Every time I want to stay I go

I never find the words to let you know

Sometimes you plague my mind a million times



Every time I want to say hello

Every time I want to stay I go

I never find the words to let you know

Sometimes you plague my mind a million times



Every time I want to say hello

Every time I want to stay I go

I never find the words to let you know

Sometimes you plague my mind a million times",Hello

Twelve days later and I can't start over 
I left her, she hates me 
We've been friends since 1990 
Don't tell me it's over 

I need you more than the sun 
She's telling me that we're done

Go separate ways,
And leave it long forgotten.
I'll hang my hat, and

On my way out,
I'm feeling lame.
Am I to blame?
Or am I just too jaded?
And I won't be back,
What'd ya think of that?

When it feels like life's wastin' away,
I can say: that when
There's something on my mind,
It takes my concentration.
Just wanna lay it on the line,
Avoid all confrontation.

For all my generation,
You'll never, ever pull my lever
Not today and not forever

Take the fame
And change my name
Because my jacket's faded
And I'll change my hat
No we can't have that

Hawk Nelson,"Some girls tell you what you wanna hear
Those girls always make it very clear
But I know things are not what they appear
Nothing from nothing gets you nothing at all

But you shut down when we're alone
You stop us from being close
Nothing from nothing gets you nothing at all

And sometimes it takes someone to break the seal
You can't negotiate a one-way deal
Nothing from nothing gets you nothing at all
I'll wait I've got the patience of a saint
I just don't want you to hesitate
Cause you don't ever wanna mess with fate
Nothing from nothing gets you nothing at all

Hawk Nelson,"This evening at sundown
We meet in our small town
Everyone's going without ever knowing
To meet for the countdown
Our friends and our families
All hangout at Riley's
We stay for a while and jam out Guiel
Then walk on down George Street

And this road we choose, nothing to lose at all
That's the way it was and the way it is

[Chorus]
Gone are the old days
Now we're on to something new
Our lives in the fast lane
Though it's not the same without you
It's not the same without you

Shows at the Gordon Best
And hockey at Northcrest
Our malls were a disgrace
Remember Portage Place
When we got kicked out
And told to never show our face

This road we choose, nothing to lose at all
That's the way it was and the way it is

We will keep, on our feet
In the streets that will never sleep

No it's not the same without you",Not the Same
Hawk Nelson,"I know sometimes it's hard to find the strength to turn the page
When all of our tomorrows look like used up yesterdays

Maybe this path we're taking
Could really be the road to breaking free
Are you with me

[Chorus]
One little revolution could turn it all around
Back to the Kingdom we once knew
Just a little bit of me, just a little bit of you
One little miracle to get us through

Broken, empty promises are all we knew before
Our father's dreams of better days lay shattered on the floor

It's not too late to start believin'
Take me by the hand I'm reaching out
How about now

Would you hop on a bus and leave just because would you

Are these dreams overrated?

I'm holding out for a good reason
People around me, they all seem to tell me that I tend to change like the seasons
I used to be somebody else

This dream that I chose is too big for us both it's true
It hurts me the most now I feel like a ghost around you

Are these dreams overrated?

She just broke up with a nice young fellow
All those tears you cry, now it's time to say goodbye
You're on your own, you're all alone

We're better than the words you speak
So much more than incomplete
Figure out what life means out on our own
Words you say can't bring us down
We've all failed and hit the ground
Now it's time for us just to take control

Can't comply we're perfect in your eyes
We fall down but it's just a part of life

All those tears you cry, now it's time to say goodbye you're on your
Own you're all alone

To all the boys and girls with disconnected souls
See the dream awakening before your very eyes
We feel alive inside for the first time

We've got to run not hide, from the former lives
We gotta take it, make it, never gonna fake it
This time we're breaking free, and making history

Now whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

They say the dreams that we're chasing are just a dead-end road
We don't have to embrace the lies that we've been told
The only thing we're missing is a whole new state of mind

We feel alive inside for the first time
We've got to run not hide, from the former lives
We gotta take it, make it, never gonna fake it
This time we're breaking free, and making history

One day we will see through our tears and our pain
When we stand with the shame in the light
There's a hope that we know, and we can't let it go
We've got to hold on tonight

Whoa whoa whoa whoa

As you walk away with half of what is mine

Nothing's gonna change

Goodbye to my friends
New life begins
Without you
These were the days the choices we make
Decide who we will be
And where we go
As we say goodbye
The look in your eye is screaming silently
Remember to never forget
Move on, watching you live

Dying to be like you
I'd go back in time
But I can't press rewind

Back where we came from?
When we didn't have no worries

It would be so easy
Oh, if it was that easy
I can't sleep tonight
So tell me one more time
When I dream, it will be you that's on my mind
It's my heart you hold, so never let it go
I still love you like I loved you long ago

Saw you out on the freeway, and later at the show
It could be my imagination, but I know I'm not alone
All the lights in the city are burning out with time
But there's a light that hangs above, and it's keeping us in line

I can't sleep tonight

When I dream, it will be you that's on my mind
It's my heart you hold, so never let it go
I still love you like I loved you long ago

All this time that's running by won't stop 'til we stand still

We'll listen together as the bell rings from the dale
And it summons me with a sound so sweet like my Savior who is calling me

When leaves turn color

And walk along these
These old back roads
Where no one lives and
And no one goes
With all their hopes set
On the railway
That never came and
Then no one stayed

Gets you remembering

Just make you cry

Whisper into my ear
Don't waste your breath
On anyone else

Let us wake up and talk a while
I tell you I'm scared
I tell you I'd fight for
Us both
But you come from the town
Where Gandhi was born
And you say I always talk tough
When I get drunk
So why don't we pray
Whispering the
Future language of slaves

I should rejoice
Maybe give voice to a song
For what brought me here to your arms
Into our painfully true love
And god maybe close
God only knows
Really to say.
And what would we do in our last moments
In time.
Would we make love
Or make haste to a mobile phone
Or would we break bread
Drink the blood that is shed
And pray to our god

To ride us up to Ilfracombe
And over the ravenscliffe
And it won't be the fancy kind
Ride before the easy wind
And take me in the corners
Be careful to hold on tight
And we would never highway ride
We'd take the quiet roads beside
And park along the cornfield

To ride us up to Ilfracombe
And over the ravenscliffe

And my brother will be terrified
He's had some friends that nearly died
I said that I'd be careful
And try not to ride at night

I want you holding flowers there

Lock the city down
And the riot police gather all around

And we practically fantasized
About the downfall of a city
About the downfall of a country
About the downfall of a lifetime

That we can pack a picnic in

If you are making love it is imperative
To bring all bodies to orgasm simultaneously

Do not waste time blocking your ears
Do not waste time seeking a sound proofed shelter
Try to get as far away from the sonic source as possible

Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic
Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic

Use your wheels it is what they are for
Do not attempt to use your own limbs
Small babies should be placed inside the special cocoons
And should be left, if possible, in shelters

If no wheels are available metal, metal, metal, metal
Metal, metal, metal, metal
Not organic limbs should be employed whenever practical

Remember, remember, remember, remember
In the case of sonic attack survival means
Every man for himself, himself, himself, himself, himself, himself
Statistically more people survive if they think
Only of themselves, only of themselves, only of themselves

Do not attempt to rescue friends, relatives, loved ones
You have only a few seconds to escape
Use those seconds sensibly or you will inevitably die

Do not panic, do not panic
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself

These are the first signs of sonic attack
You will notice small objects such as ornaments oscillating
You will notice [Inaudible]
You will hear a distant hissing in your ears

You will feel dizzy, you will feel the need to vomit

Hawkwind,"News had drifted on the wind of many minds that this was to be an
Occasion of great importance. For it was said by some that Earth City
Had somehow uncovered a single time sleeper from the time before

Although the cryptic writings upon his tomb were now faded beyond
Decipherable reading, it was said, by the disembodied members of the
Ruling kind, that the entombed was from that time on Earth before the
City stretched its metal web from pole to pole leaving green things only
In the wells of immortal minds

Upon the third revolution after its arrival, the tomb that slept without
Life was removed for inspection. The day was programmed for a clear dome
Above, with a mild breeze wafting from the central weather post, below
Throngs of class three occupants were gathering from various sectors to
Observe the opening, as per standard procedure, their data input
Stations were fed appropriate propaganda so that their reports would
Coincide with what the rulers had predetermined

And so it was upon that day of opening, his spirit did appear and confuse
Once again. It was evident to all that what lay within was not of mortal
Composure. Thoughts emanating from deep within its dimensionless cave
Conveyed this belief to all within the medi-dome.

What is this apparition now amongst our kind?

Quickly thereafter, all pressure was released from within the stillness.
Earth City, unknowingly at that time, was about to enter a new phase of
Its existence

Violent quaking began to shake the towers of sector 63, manifestations
Of melting speed its wings over the structure until once again, ancient
Soil kissed the sky

And the beginning of the end swept all that was into its eternal grasp",Fall of Earth City

I think that what I'm getting is a warning
Messages are scrambled but they're urgent
Something in the cortex 'bout detergent

I think it's coming clearer
I can see it in the mirror
Heading for a relapse
Clogging up the synapse
Or is it just Cassandra yawning?

Killers in the streets are wearing striped pants
They are interfering with my larynx
My brother and my sister joined the army
They promise that they do not mean to harm me

Messages messages Persecution Persecution messages messages.....

Now it's growing dimmer
I can see the mirror shimmer
Sounds are getting stranger
Warning me of danger
Or can it be that I am merely tired?

There's a roaring in my ears that will not die
And signals in the sky I can't identify
My eyes are melting and my lips are moving
And the words that I am hearing are not soothing

Breathing's getting harder
There's nothing in the larder
The building's falling over
Or the Sun is going nova
Or is it my old-fashioned paranioa?

I think that it's important information
Giving me my future destination
Fragments of mysterious conversation
Lend the game a frightening complication

I know they're trying to tell me
What can they want to sell me?
The floor is undulating
My bones are soft and aching
Or have I temporarily lost my bearing?

Every little sound is charged with meaning
Percentage bandits riding out of ealing
Stuttering, shouting, crying, and declaiming
Sentences are waxing, now they're waning
I'm nearly out of letters
From my elders and my betters
The Killer's moving faster
He tells me that he's my master
Or was he just asking me ""the time please?""

Would turn his priceless empire into fool's gold

Called up his brakes on the radio, he said ""My supplies are running low""
They're running low you can see
Where they go. They're running low I see where they go

Hawkwind,"Jack of Shadows, nocturnal outlaw
Daemon of darkness, brother to the night
Jack of Shadows, what's he hanging out for?
King of the dimensions, the other side of light

And when he passes
He casts shades of mystery black
Flowing like molasses
It's only Jack of Shadows on his way back
To the kindom of thieves
Before the skies crack

Jack of Shadows, cloak of constellations
Draped around his body, blanking out his face
Jack of Shadows, don't believe in God, he
Steals from the future, fades without a trace

And when the flames flare
Flickering forms of velvet dark
He plays his games there
It's only Jack of Shadows, he's lit up by a spark
To run into the umbra , as fast as a shark

Jack of Shadows, ultravoilet eyesight
Giving him the vision that cats-eye infrared
Jack of Shadows, watch him as he flies right
Through all of the umbras, quicker than the dead

And when he passes
He casts shades of mystery black
Flowing like molasses
It's only Jack of Shadows on his way back
To the kindom of thieves
Before the skies crack

Jack of Shadows, Jack of Shadows
Jack of Shadows, Jack of Shadows

And waiting still as fresh in your flesh for my
Return to earth
But your father refused to sign the forms to freeze you

By the time I return to earth
My time held dreams were full of you as you were
When I left, still underage

When she comes she moans another's name
But that's the spirit of the age, that's the

I am a clone, I am not alone
Every fiber of my flesh and bone is identical to
The others
Everything I say is in the same tone as my test
Tube brother's voice
And there's no choice between us, if you had ever
Seen us you'd rejoice in your uniqueness
And consider every weakness something special of
Your own
Being a clone I have no flaws to identify
Even this doggerel that pours from my pen
Has just been written by another twenty
Telepathic men

""Oh, for the wings of any bird other than a

Hawkwind,"On board the craft, I noticed a lot of electrical-like ceiling lines, like the lines in the human brain. There are windows or screen areas all around the ship. They're like a two-way mirror - a kind of projection place. It is as if these window screens are made of a combination of metal, crystal, or mirrored glass.

I see a cloudscape or landscape on suspended plastic sheets. I notice slanted surfaces on the tops of machines with instruments on panels. Small creatures are busily moving around. They are seated at the controls at the base of the slanted walls. Robot-like creatures, with large black eyes that appear to have reptilian and insectile facial qualities. 

I don't have any problem facing the little ones that are so blissful, but the ugly ones scare and repulse me. It's like the larvae inside the leather faced skin of a hard dark scary machine. The reptile-faced insect bodied robots, they are being brought forth to perform specific functions...

With a happy ending",We Are So Last Year
Hawthorne Heights,"I guess I could've sent a letter from the womb
With words then meant more then updates on the phone
The signals fading fast and the ink is running out
The words repeating as I'm better from my mouth

Please hold me tightly, I don't care if I can breathe tonight
Forget these lungs their jealousy your burning up but I can't leave this all behind
Forget these lungs their jealousy your burning up but I can't leave this all behind

Behind your back talking like knives
And I can hardly breathe
Sharpen your tongue the rest of your life
And I can not believe anything that you say

Please hold me tightly, I don't care if I can breathe tonight
Forget these lungs their jealousy your burning up but I can't leave this all behind
Forget these lungs their jealousy your burning up but I can't leave this all behind

So your the fire and I'm the water
I am the balance and you are the color
I won't forget you when we're not together
This is the ending, it's my surrender

(So your the fire and I'm the water
I am the balance and you are the color

Hawthorne Heights,"Don't hesitate to remember, everything
From this never ending drama monologue
Don't leave your hate in surrender and try to save
All the friends that you have lost

Save yourself from everything that you have learned
Save yourself from all the trust you never earned.
We will all learn from the burning out
We all learn from the liars' mouth
Save yourself from everything, you have learned

It's easy to forget,
Where you are and where you've been
So far in this business of,
Inconsistent paper stars

So let us die, or let us live
If you want blood, well there's none to give
So just stop asking for the right
To trade us all, try tonight.

Save yourself from everything that you have learned
Save yourself from all the trust you never earned.
We will all learn from the burning out
We all learn from the liars' mouth
Save yourself from everything, you have learned (you have learned)

It's easy to, forget who you are
In this business of, these paper stars
It's easy to, forget who you are

Hawthorne Heights,"Come back home you're all alone
Everyone is waiting for
The words to say
To make you stay
To keep you in their arms

Hold still so I can feel the words that hurt, that hit, that kills
The latest fight that lasts all night
Turn off the lights and leave right now

[Chorus]
I know, I know
I'm too slow to catch you here
I know that she knows
She's running far far from me

Come back home
Pick up the phone
Or just call my name out loud
So I can hear, so loud and clear
Our time is running, running out

[Chorus]

Slow down, or not
So I can catch you now
Slow down, or not
So we can work this out

I'm cold and tired
Let's start a fire
And then we'll fall asleep
You and me, oh, you and me
I'm cold tired, lets start a fire
And then we'll fall asleep
You and me, oh, you and me

Forget what you're not, not what you lived.
I know where you are I know you got there.

Slow down, or not
So I can catch you now

Hawthorne Heights,"And all of the corpses
Walk step by step
To the rhythm of your once beating heart
Over and over they march, on and on
To the same old songs
Trying to find something worth living for

No more ghosts or memories to hold me back
A fresh start is all I have ever asked
I watch my body slowly turn from blue to black
And on and on and on
Some times it hurts the most to be who you are
You can change your mind, you can't change your heart
To find the end you gotta know where to start
And on and on and on

You said she is so evil but
She looks like heaven to me
I'd follow her to hell and back again
I swear I'd sign my name in blood
That dripped down from my veins
I swore I'd never tell

I know where to go as skyway stars align
Point the blame, clear your name or just kill the time
My dreams slowly turn, they turn to black and white
They die, they die, they die

You said she is so evil but
She looks like heaven to me
I'd follow her to hell and back again
I swear I'd sign my name in blood
That dripped down from my veins
I swore I'd never tell

And on, and on

You said she is so evil but

You're sleeping and you're still
I'm wide awake because I can't take it
And this is how I feel

Set my mind at easy
I'm worried and upset
My front door isn't on anymore
I'll be living with regret

So listen up And just let the music play
If you listen hard enough
You can hear me say

This is the sound of desperation
This is the sound of me wearing thin
This is the sound of desperation
This is the sound of me wearing thin

You've heard it all before
Now you'll hear it all again
I never said I would rather be dead
but i thought about the end

Soon as its starting over and over
The nights keep blending in
The only way I can get through the day
is to try to make ammends

So listen up And just let the music play
If you listen hard enough

Hawthorne Heights,"How should I say
That I never wanted anything to change
If I rearranged the pieces of
A broken down faith

Do you believe in me
Because I'm not sure
I believe in anything, anymore

Pick up the pieces and
Make me understand
Why we can't move any faster
We're losing all demand
I've broken all my plans
This year was a disaster

What should I do
I never thought anything would come true
The solution for the broken down abuse
I'm waiting for, waiting for
To let me fall on through
I'm getting closer to letting go, letting go of you

Pick up the pieces and
Make me understand
Why we can't move any faster

Hawthorne Heights,"All these staggers and these swords can cut me like the words from your lips
Can you feel my fingertips?
Tracing all over your body
My knees are weak as I whisper softly while my hands rest on your hips

It takes time to get close enough to you
I didn't want to be a curse
It won't be the last girl or the first
To tell me I should go straight to hell
For better or for worse
The best news I have ever heard
Was when you said I was doing well

All the doctors and the pills
Can cure the way I feel about myself
Afraid to ask for help
From everyone, For everything
Prescribing ends to society
I feel addicted to this prescription
All the lies within the help


It takes time to get close enough to..
I didn't want to be a curse

Let go if it hurts so badly
I just smile and suffer through the pain
I be had enough and I say this sadly

I'll ask the nurse for bandages
And send me on my way

Rescue me
From everything
I just wanna live
I wish I could breathe

Every other day
I sit and wait for the same bad news
Can you hear me say
I've got nothing left to lose
Someone please start making sense
And beg the lord for accidents
I've seen the worst case scenario

Hawthorne Heights,"You're an angel, I'm a devil
But we'll meet somewhere in between.
Heaven, Hell, or the bedroom,
I'll take you away from everything.
You're a dream and I'm a nightmare
But we'll meet somewhere in between.
Your sheets, your covers, and the headboard.
I'll be a king if you are a queen.

I just fell in love for the first time,
Watch as I move myself up off the ground.
In the dark I'm so far from the spotlight,
Can You see me now?

[Chorus]
I turn my back
And walk away, away from the pain.
Screaming loud,
Drowning out from the sound of the rain
Listen up,
I've had enough of all this waiting.
I need you more right now than I ever did.

You're the minutes, I'm the hours.
But we'll meet somewhere in between.
Never, now, or too soon,
I say we meet at a quarter till three.

I feel the friction and tension here
Sprinkle salt on the injured
It's been such a controversy here
With such a conversation here

Life isn't what it seems to be sometimes
Act lonely,
And just hope one day you'll feel alive

There's smoke all around the ceiling
I get the feeling that no one's safe
Let's concentrate on our healing
Gather round, you know it's worth the wait

Look closely
Life isn't what it seems sometimes
Act lonely,
And just hope one day you'll feel alive

Close your eyes and make a wish
You'll need more than a crucifix to survive
I know I'll never make your list
I just hope one day I'll feel alive
One day I'll feel alive
One day I'll feel alive

Chapitre 1
Tout commence dans le XV Barbar
Avec Dis et Ino, jeunes et fous nous étions
Sur une pluie des plus battantes, au coeur du boulevard
Sans vergogne, des coups d'cross et de coudes nous mettions
Mon métier c'est la rue, salarié depuis bambin
Envie de porter du Zilli, du Lanvin
Carpe diem, on veut des lovés sans lendemain
Demain c'est loinguin
Ours polaire d'la banquise, vi-ser les pingouins
Elle sait que je fais du blégué, elle veut mon painguain
Regarde-moi bienguin
Demande au frère Lum', je t'allume, tu t'éteingueins
Bitch, pour toi l'amour n'est qu'un chiffre
Snitch, pour toi l'honneur n'est qu'un mot
Avec ou sans shit les mots fusent dans ma tête au rythme du piano
J'suis mineur, j'fais des liasses
Avec Niaks, Mbi, Papada, Kamel et Nass
Y'a pas d'heure pour brasser, y'a pas d'âge pour les bracelets
Rusé mais hélas, pris dans la mêlasse, la juge nous menace
Y'a pas d'heure pour brasser, y'a pas d'âge pour les bracelets
Rusé mais hélas
Weed et cocaïne, j'voulais des filles coquettes
Insolent, j'fais trembler les murs de ta ville en compèt
Loin des cocktails, je voulais brûler le top ten
J'dérangeais les rageux, j'n'avais peur de sonne-per
J'parlais du game comme si j'étais son père
J'ai pas attendu l'rap pour sabrer le Dom Pér'
Soulever des bastos, piétiner Harkos
Guidonner des gamos, fonce-dé sur le corner
Dans la rue, j'ai vécu
J'ai vécu, j'ai dû apprendre et rendre des coups
La Batmobile au cul
J'ai failli, j'ai échoué, pas toujours pris des sous
Esclave du capitalisme
À l'affût de Tom Ford, de toutes formes de confort
La Faucheuse t'a sur sa liste
Et ton cercueil est trop petit pour ton coffre-fort
Polyglote armé d'un B4, de C4
Pour mes frères au D4
Vas-y tire si t'es cap
N'oublie pas que mes erreurs sont le reflet d'mes actes
J'suis filoch' par les RG
Mon oseille, j'suis allé le chercher
Tu voulais produire qui? T'es barjot
J'suis pas ta poule aux œufs d'Faberger
Bienvenue dans ma dynastie
M'en voulez pas si j'ai trop d'inspi
De le-sty, trop deuspi, les has been se rassirent
Moi? Dans 10 piges on m'appellera ""Sir""
Toi? Tu m'observes d'un air oisif, d'un air oisif
Dire qu'avant c'était qu'un loisir
Maintenant elles me veulent toutes hashtag #RochVoisine

J'suis un putain d'maître de cérémonie

Sixty chargé contre les obliques
J'fume la verte avec parcimonie
Par ici la monnaie, magnum pour mes homies
Ignorance pour les médisants
J'me dois d'être le rappeur le plus puissant
Sache qu'à mes 10 ans j'me l'suis promis
Elle me tire dans la chambre par le chibre
Si je vends plus, ces salopes me tchipent
Mais j'tiens plus que la Muraille de Chine
Ils ont du pétrole, j'ai du gaz de schiste
Lyriciste hyperactif, ils disent que j'love la coco
Que j'ai des phases d'autiste
Les rappeurs me d'mandent encore en freestyle? Sado-masochistes
On tire sur poucaves, mauvais payeurs
Rappeurs, usurpateurs et flutistes
Le procureur nous prive des meilleurs, j'pense à Ulysse D5 cellule 10
On regrette jadis, le monde part en couilles
Les hommes veulent une chatte, les femmes un pénis
La prochaine étape
Ils emmènent nos gosses en vacances scolaires sur des plages nudistes
J'ai toujours la barre à l'enterrement d'un flic
Ils ont mis 2 piges à Sango pour une 10
Voilà mon 17, j'encule la jet set
Je reste ghetto, même quand j'baise une actrice
Rentre dans la matrice, naissance en Afrique
J'ai vu toute ma population stagner
J'ai toujours le seum, Marianne sur nos sols
133 putains de longues années
J'veux plus voir la SPIP partir au casse pipe
J'vais vous faire la guerre comme le fils de Bush

Ouais, c'est bien moi l'DZ qui t'ait traîné sur le sol
J'donne les ordres, on m'escorte
Paris Nord, mes bikos sont baisés
Pas sûr que d'ici tu ressortes
Si les forces de l'ordre me délogent
Envoyez de la bonne zèb à mon petit reufré Volts
Je m'endors sous Dom Pér' car mon or dort sous terre
Motherfucker, biko, y'a rien dans le coffre
Deux backeux dans la voiture, donc un dans la nature

Sit in while lee tries
To tell me I should know,
Tell me I would grow,
Sticking fourteen stones
Gently up my nose. 
So I shoved one up
Until it got stuck
Five more then I'm done
Playing with lee's no fun,
Dad came out the front door and he saw
Only lee sticking a rock 
Up his nose while I just watched
Dad chased him around the block 
Dad caught him real quick
Then he gave him shit

His nose the doctors fixed.
I sit on the drive
Waiting till they arrive

Give you my phone number
And not be so afraid?

When I go to the washroom

I return to the table

This may sound silly such honour and 
He protected all those he loved
With such power it made me glad

When we left the show I know it's so

I held your hand, didn't let go

It surely wasn't walking,
Our friends thought we were dead.
And I can't recreate those times we used to have

Let's meet, next month at my parent's house
They'll be
Away like they were then
Away like we were then. 
Time, you met someone new

But not like I liked you.
Time, you ask him if he'll mind
Of course he'll surely mind.
So just leave him for me.

Tight mouth and eyes glazed
Eyelids just half-raised

And I looked at him, he looked at me
He looked so sad, I had to see
What did he want, what could it be
What had he been through before me seeing him
In the store I worked for that year, that year

Ice skates he asked for, In the middle of summer
He wanted a good pair, the price he did not care
I looked for his size, our best pair he tried
Costom back and sides, excitement in his eyes

I asked are you a pro, he looked sad and said no
These skates are my last hope
Without them i cannot cope

And he said my wife, she drowned this summer
Behind our house, the river took her
I cannot swim, I need to find her
I will wait till it freezes over

And then I will skate, as far as it takes
I will skate as far as it takes, to bring her back home

Windy day, the petals flew
From the stem into the street

I slept at your house the night before
We couldn't wait to get up to go forth
A big breakfast in an old-fashioned diner
A full meal, six coffee refills later

Let's call in sick, I suggest to her
I'll call your boss and tell her that you're under
the weather, you'll call mine, you will tell her
that I am very sick and that you're my mother
So we walk down the street
Looking for a phone booth, we
Rehearse what we're gong to say
So that we can have this day
Away...

We find a phone booth with room for two
I call your boss and I don't speak the truth
They're pretty mad about you but they'll get through

Criticize myself way too much
I will utilize the energy I have left
To say goodbye
To you and I will survive. 
'Cause I lost what I once found in you.

'Cause I lost what I once found in you.",You Were Loved
Hayden,"You once told me
The reason that
A lot of people
Choked to death
Was because they get up
And walk away
Right when they feel
Their throats give way
They leave the table
To avoid a scene
So no one hears them
And no one sees
And I just realized
That if you
Started Choking
I wouldn't know 
What to do",Choking

We're entwined.
And I can't tell if it's day or night outside,

I can't wait till you come home,
And your skin will replace
The phone.
I don't know, is that your eyelash or mine?
I think it's mine.

Decide
Whether we should even try

In the middle of July.",Middle of July
Hayden,"Remember the day
We went to an old fashioned way
To get my haircut
By an old fashioned barber,
He sat me on his chair,
Sharpened his blades and cut my hair. 

I asked him if he'd shave my beard,
He said he stopped doing that last year.
Tradition ends in fear.

we walked down the road
New haircut, feeling good I know,
Things will get better,
Summer is right around the corner.

I stopped and looked into your eyes,
Somedays I'm depressed
Don't know why.
Today I'm glad
To be alive.",Old Fashioned Way

Then I call the cops, or chicken out.

I'm better off inside

In your eyes, I see you in disguise
You're talking backwards, telling lles
Telling lies

Hayden,"I taught you to play guitar last night
We've been sick for a days and were stuck inside
And I held your arms you hit the strings
I pressed your fingers down 
And started to sing

The heater was shaking 
Cause the city was cold
And my favourite guitar was between us to hold
And I held your arm as you hit the strings
I pressed your fingers down 
And started to sing

Hayden,"When I said I, would try and be calm
I lied to prove myself wrong

The truth is in the details first
And the writings on the walls
And the closer I get to, being strong
The less to go wrong

I thought he meant
Times where changing for the better but they weren't

And the closer I get to, being strong
The less to go wrong",The Closer I Get
Hayden,"With your summer hat and smile
You came here to leave there
And as the sun stained your legs and your arms
The men arrive with their one-track minds
You like that they're there when they ask you the time
They say what they do, and they'll do what you say
And they'll tell you some lies if you let them . . . stay

And you laugh, but not too hard
And you look, but not too far
Your eyes drift across the beach
And just before you reach me, he speaks
His face is red, and he's talking to breeze
You get up to leave as the sun hits the trees
And you jump in the water with him at . . . your feet

And I laugh, but not too hard
And I look, but not too far",The Hazards of Sitting Beneath Palm Trees
Hayden,"I remember the day it came
Flashing lights and sirens rang
They took you and put you inside
I walked the house ten times

And I'm riding down to let you know
That I love you although it doesn't show
When we argued about the car

I want you to know
That I am so
Thankful that you're here

How come everything has to change?
I wish were 4 and 6 and in the rain
When we were 6 and 8 we dressed the same
When we were 24 and 26 I wrote this down

I got a bucket and I'll get some ice
We'll watch a movie and we'll feel alright tonight
We'll watch a movie and we'll feel tonight

On the way to my room, I saw you in the hall
Our rooms were side by side in this huge hotel
I could hear through the wall you were watching what I was

Hayden,"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave?
I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me ""friend""

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal

Put your trust back in me the least I think you should. 
We'll call it my pathology so I misunderstood! 
A bit selfish I should be if I could change I would. 

See it on my face! 
All I wanted was a friend to look in me to comprehend. 
All I wanted was to fly how could you sit and watch me die? 
All I wanted was you there your cruelty was my despair. 

You just killed me so the story goes. 
Once upon a time there was a girl who loved me more than life itself. 
By the duck pond she said, 
Carved our names into the bark we climbed the tree. 

I slipped and fell behind, 
Now I'm sorry.

See it on my FACE!

All reminds me of your name we sought fortune through the rain. 
Every day and every place everywhere I kissed your face. 
All the sacrifice in vain how could you put all the blame on me? 
That's not fair so the story goes. 

Once upon a time we had the moon we had the stars we were divine. 
Upon my shoulder she cried. 
Now she hides the faith she fears she throws herself. 
Before her bed of lies. 

She'll be sorry.

No that's alright man I ain't got nothin' to prove
I'm rich but I still live like I got nothin' to lose
Look man, I don't know what you been drinkin' I don't know what you been thinkin'
But get outta line and it's oops upside ya head

And the cops stay on my ass so I stay on the news

Went through a bunch of bullshit while I was paying my dues
They say my music make a gangsta want to pop somethin'
Well tell them niggas to get poppin' & stop frontin'
You heard of me but do you know how I get down
Stay with a vest on, roll wit a couple tre-pounds
In case you motherfuckers want to jump bad now

I don't dance, what I look like signin' wit Diddy?
I got plans, grenades and the G-Unit wit me
And on command, we spray give a fuck who we hittin'
What's in my hand? A tan 'bout a hundred and sixty
Hollow tips, four-fifths with the rubber grip
Crips and Bloods they show me love like I'm claimin' a set
These industry niggas know they better pay me my check
I get a kick outta seein' these broke ass rappers
Ten people showed up that's why your show got canceled

Hayden Tee,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Hopin' I might fly away anew
Cause they'll love you when you're wrong
And then leave you when you're right
Tell me baby, what's a boy to do?

Well I came to town a stranger, not knowin' how to act
Figured I'd hang out and just get found.
Made me some new friends
They climbed way up on my back
Been gone so long they ain't comin' down

You can kiss the sky good morning
You can say your prayers at night
Hide your soul way down in your shoes,
But it's the same old scene
Borrowed love and faded dreams
And you just can't hide from those Arkansas blues.

Well time is playin' tricks on me
Makes me thing I'm movin' fast
I don't think I'm movin' at all
And every stranger's face I see reminds me of the past
Come on big and leave you feelin' small

So I took to drinkin' liquor on the other side of town
Way up in those woods beside the moon
Where every graceful dream I had got lost without a sound
Tell you what, I can't leave this place too soon.

And it don't take no rhyme or reason
It don't make no sense at all
Just one of those things that you don't choose
It's the same old thing
Broken hearts and busted strings
And you just can't run from those Arkansas blues.

Everybody's asking questions about whose side are you on
I don't see how it matters much to me
And all these midnight celebrations
That are ended by the dawn
Leave you feelin' low as you can be

So I'm leaving town this morning, gonna lighten up my load
See if I can't lose what I have found
And it's one drink for the memories
And one kiss for the road
Look out, I believe I'm Texas bound
California, Oklahoma, Arizona, Tennessee
I been all around this land to pay my dues
High, low, and right behind me
Wherever I go they find me
And I just can't run from the Arkansas blues.",Arkansas Blues
Hayes Carll,"Jamie was a barmaid at the Underground Longrail
Seems like every Friday evenin'
She'd find herself in Jail
Not a friend this side of Houston
With the time to throw her bail
But she'll be fine, she'll be fine

Spent a lifetime walkin'
Through the walls of a broken home
Not a man round here still standin'
For the girl to call her own.
Every time she tried to hold him
She just ended up alone
But there's still time, there's still time

Through the streets of Boston town
Like the billboards up above him
The world just wore him down
Only soul he'd ever cared for
Was the one he'd never found
But He'll be fine, He'll be fine

Broken half of winter, with a wind chill ten below
Davey sittin' in his kitchen laughin 'bout
How the world had done him so
Then the postman burst his bubble
With a letter from below
And now it's time, now it's time

And there's a lot of people runnin' round
Not quite sure which way to go
But as for me I believe I finally found

Packed her whole world in a suitcase
And tossed it in the car
Woke up in Texarkana
Wondrin' how she'd got this far
And on her own, on her own

Stranger at the motel let Jamie stay for free
She was gone before the daybreak
On her ways to Tennessee
Lookin' to make the whole world over
Into a place she wants to be
But not alone, not alone

Davey left his taxi
In the bottom of a Beantown lake
He said this whole world's full of chances
And this is one I gotta take
So he caught the line to Nashville
To finally find his break
And make a home, make a home

As the train flew out of Boston
His whole world passed him by
He said I spent a lifetime runnin'
And now's the time to try
If I can't find someone to hold me
My dreams will surely die
And I'll be gone, I'll be gone

When Davey hit the pavement
The sky was almost gray
He lit a smoke off of the sidewalk
To drive the storm away
And when Jamie turned the corner
With the world upon her brow
Davey said I must be dreamin'
How could this happen now
And then she walked right towards him
Looked him right up in the eye

And maybe it just wasn't meant, all things have a reason
And maybe our hearts were just to careless and free

There was a time, you would have had me
There was a time when I could have had you

Hayes Carll,"Well, I'm doin' ten to twenty
In the frozen granite state
And every day I go to work
To stamp out license plates
Everyday I got to work
And every night I cry
Cause every license plate I make tells me to
Live Free or Die

[Chorus]
Live free or die
Oh Lord tell me why
Can't they say seat belts fastened
Or Oklahoma is okay
Vacation land sounds mighty great
I wouldn't mind stampin' out the Garden State
It's enough to make me cry
Live free or die

Well I didn't mean to shoot that man
Why the gun just went off in my hand
I caught him with my wife
And it cost that man his life
I'd just got home from the factory
And that man was sittin' where I'm supposed to be
Now he's up there in the sky and I'm stuck with
Live free or die

[Chorus]

So let this be a lesson
To all you married men out there
That patience is a virtue
So make your plans with care
So if you catch your wife with another man
It's best to hold off as long as you can
Then shoot him in another state where they got

Hayes Carll,"Well it's hard to write a song
When your three-fourths gone
And Crazy Legs keeps pickin' on my guitar
I try to clear my head
And reflect on what she said
But the only thing reflectin'
Seems to be the bar

A shot of bourbon
Never hurt no one
So I reckon two couldn't do no harm
Well I know my eyes are red
And I'm a little bit underfed
But baby please believe me
That ain't cause for no alarm

I'm pleased to meet you
My name is Lost and Lonely
That's spelled with one L not two
And don't you think you
Could be my one and only
Baby just long enough
For me to make love to you

So tell me what do you see
Standin' in front of thee
Oh yes I get poetic when I've had a few
But Lord I swear it's hard
When you've been dealt all your cards
And the only thing you've ever known
You've done forgotten how to do

So let's pour another round
For dreams we never found
And laugh until the tears fall from our face
And when they finally send me home
I can't make that walk alone
There's just too many memories,

I need a new word just to whisper in your ear
Baby right now I am open to suggestions
I'm gonna tell you all the things you need to hear

Hayes Carll,"Richey Lee was his Father's boy
Big, loud, Hard-drinkin' bundle of joy
A walkin' laugh wrapped up in corduroy
Richey couldn't do no wrong

Grew up with a fast runnin' crowd
Good bunch of boys, just a little too loud
Can't fault a man for being proud
Richey kept rollin' on

Spent his days in a rock-n-roll band
Tellin' jokes, a guitar in his hand
Tryin' hard to meet every demand
Of all of those late-night shows

Whiskey-drunk on a Saturday night
She caught his eye comin' out of the light
Half way there he had to get in a fight
Back home that's just the way it goes

Strange days, they leave you in a wonder
And good times, they don't always stay
And true love, it will shake you like thunder
But old friends just fade away

Fishin' poles and a two-dollar grin
Ain't ever gonna laugh like that again
Fallin' right to the ground

Count the miles down to New Orleans
Borrowed cash and dirty bluejeans
Couple of boys lookin' for Cajun queens
Thinkin' they own the town

But we all left to find work out of town
Even the wild ones, they slow down
Richey felt like he was comin' unwound
Got tired of playin' the game

You've been crying all the while
Could you lean upon my shoulder
In case you die or just get old
So what are we supposed to do
Just walk around forever blue?

With your back turned to the crowd
In that little bar on Murphy
Where they play guitar too loud
There were people drinkin' whiskey
There were hearts about to leave

It was almost New Year's Eve

All the way from Beaumont
With a white rose in my hand
I could not wait forever babe, 
I hope you understand

The night was feelin' lucky
So I asked you to dance
And the way you looked up at me
Made me think I had a chance
When I put my arms around you
I knew you weren't givin' in
I hope it will be different if I pass this way again 
All the way from Beaumont, with a white rose in my hand 
I could not wait forever babe, 
I hope you understand

I walked the road to get here
With a guitar and a case
I'd stopped in Pasadena
If I'd known about this place
But you looked like forever
Where the water meets the shore
I've been thinkin' about you, baby
I can't do that anymore

I saw you leanin' on a memory

Just hold me tight, right now what I need's a friend

Some old memory to keep in my heart
And I ask forgiveness from those I've forsaken
Forgiveness don't come in and it tears me apart

Higher than a Christmas moon
Empty as my wallet on a Sunday afternoon
I come around too fast, and I always leave too soon
Ain't that what they all say?
Ain't that what they all say?",Wild as a Turkey
Hayes Carll,"I drink too much and I smoke too much
I laugh at all my own jokes too much
I'm hard to tell and soft to touch
And easy at sayin' goodbye

I broke your heart, a thousand times
With wasted nights and ramblin' rhymes
I thought I'd leave, you thought behind
But time just wouldn't, let go

[Chorus]
I walk the streets, I kick the cans
Tore down walls with my two hands
And still across, my floor you stand
Willing, to love, again

Out of all the dreams, in this whole world
How'd you get so unlucky girl
To find a shell, that had no pearl
And a man who couldn't, find home

I feel too much, I protect too much
And most times I probably expect too much
I spend my life, on this broken crutch
And you believe I can fly

[Chorus]

And still across, my floor you stand
Willing, to love, again
And still across, my floor you stand
Willing, to love, again",Willing to Love Again
Hayes Carll,"Well, we'd all head to Waco, for the birth of our Lord
My folks and my brother in an '82 Ford
We'd pull in the driveway filled up with cars
Old aunts and old uncles, Lord I see stars
And then we'd run to the kitchen, you know kids and their games
Play fetch with old Buster, call each other names
Aunt Betty'd be singing while supper was cooking
We'd unwrap the gifts when no one was lookin'

Let's all gather 'round, Grandpa say the blessing
Aunt Jane, she fell asleep, Mary Kay burned the dressing
But we got all of our friends and family here
And I'm grateful for Christmas this year

Well, this year, we're in Houston, let's all get together
Man, I almost saw snow, can you believe this weather?
Who's gonna be here? Uncle Frank can't make it
Since Grandpa died, I don't know if Nana can take it
Well, this present's a sweater and the pie don't taste right
And Dad, and the TV, are startin' to fight
I wish I had a drink or maybe a dozen
Lord, what I'd give for one good lookin' cousin

So let's all gather 'round, Dad you say the blessing
Aunt Jane, she fell asleep, and Mary Kay forgot the dressing
But we got all of our friends and family here
And I'm grateful for Christmas this year

Hey Mom, how you doing? Yeah, I miss him too
Nah, the Christmas lights don't make your hair look blue
The cousins ain't coming and Jon's overseas
And I guess my wife loves her folks more than me
But the ladies from the church said, they might stop by
I brought you this picture, ahh, mama don't cry
Let's play cards and watch the news channel
I love you too, and thanks for the flannel

So let's all gather 'round, I guess I'll say the blessing
Aunt Jane, she fell asleep, and I never cared for dressing
But we got all of our friends and family here
And I'm grateful for Christmas this year
Oh, I'm grateful for Christmas this year",Grateful For Christmas
Hayes Carll,"You were smoking on a cigarette
Talking 'bout the deficit
Putting all them wild boys down
Like a drunken Mona Lisa 
Or the Leaning Tower of Pisa
You were hangin' off the edge of town
I overheard Afghanistan 
Is safer than a minivan
Left me wonderin' what to do
Ah, you're like a four-leaf clover
I just had to come on over
I have never seen a woman like you

You were fallin' like the Alamo
Drinkin' fast and talking slow
Looking like it's time to go home
Were you hittin' on the stripper 
'Cause you can't afford to tip her
Or just afraid of being alone
You was openly frustrated
You said, Dylan's overrated
While singing ""Tangled Up In Blue""
I don't know what I was thinking 
I can feel my heart a' sinkin'
I never seen a fella like you

Ain't that the way we do, it's true
We fall for the first one
How come it always ends up the worst one?

Well you're probably a Democrat,
Well, what the hell is wrong with that?
Nothing, if you're Taliban
Ah, I see, well, I bet you slept with half the south
Ah, don't you ever shut your mouth?
Yeah, how much did you pay for that tan?
More than you paid for your boots
Ah, shouldn't you be purgin'?
Well, you're probably still a virgin
I can't believe you're not on ""The View""
Let's get another round, 
It's lookin' like we're trouble bound
I have never seen another like you
Ain't that the way we do, it's true, you take the breath from me
It seems like you are bound to be the death of me

Oh, well, a couple hours later, we were in the elevator
Makin' out like Bonnie and Clyde
We were dizzy from the love we found
Throwin' up and goin' down
Lord it's been a hell of a ride
I'm a'havin' trouble breathing
I probably should be leavin'
Well, I'm up in room 402
Well I gotta hand it to you
There's a chance I'm gonna screw ya
Oh, I have never seen another like you
I don't know if it's forever but I'm glad that we're together
I have never seen another like you.",Another Like You
Hayes Carll,"Well, I followed my feet across this land
A tune in my heart and a bottle in my hand
From the cold, cold east
To the woods out west
Ain't no home just lucky I guess
I've seen the sunrise over the water
Howled at the moon by the embers glow
Stole me a kiss from a poor man's daughter
Threw on my pack and away I go

Well, it looks like rain and it tastes like hell
Ain't nobody ever wished me well
Tried to make me stand in the welfare line
I ain't see free in a long old time
Well, every town is gone by morning
Hitch to another till the sun goes down
Find me a boxcar, one or two brothers
Take out a bottle and pass it around

There's trouble at the border and a far off war
Oil in the water and the shut down store
Big banks closin' and world ain't round
Jail filled up and the deal gone down
But I got all I need on the highway
Little bit of luck and a rainbow stew
Sing a little song for the ones who ramble
Hard to carry on like the way we do

Now I've had friends who've walked that line
Spent life workin' for a nickel and a dime
The come home ragged at the end of their day
Feet on the table, not a word to say
Sometimes I might have to wonder
How's it gonna end for a man like me 
Slept with the rain and danced with the thunder

I get a little bit older
I get a little bit older
I'll get a little tune on my fiddle
And then I'll be on my way

I followed my feet across this land
A tune in my heart and a bottle in my hand
The mines in the east
To the woods out west
Ain't no home just lucky I guess
Never had a home just lucky I guess",Bottle in My Hand
Hayes Carll,"You laughed and called me lucky
For having you around
Then you stepped up to the bar and started swayin'
The crowd all sang, Ophelia
As we drank another round
Oh, bye, bye, bye, bye baby

Rain feel on the window
As we watched the sailors dance
You kissed my hand and said, you were beside me
I held onto the moment
When I thought there was a chance
Oh, bye, bye, bye, bye baby

I'd read you the letters
That had blown in from the west
And we'd whisper of the dreams we'd been savin'
You said, you'd have it all
Nothing more and nothing less
Oh, bye, bye, bye, bye baby

Now there's an emptiness standin' at the door
Tryin' to take me back to the way I was before
I used to feel alone here but it's not that way no more
Oh, bye, bye, bye, bye baby

Now the drunks have turned to strangers
And the stars are out of tune
As I think about the one who might've saved me
I know you're out there somewhere
Between the highway and the moon
Oh, bye, bye, bye, bye baby
Oh, bye, bye, bye, bye baby",Bye Bye Baby
Hayes Carll,"Chances re I took the wrong turn
Every time I had a turn to take
And I guess I broke my own heart
Every chance I had a heart to break
And it seems like I spent my whole life
Wishin' on the same unlucky star
And as I watch your cross the barroom, I wonder
What my chances are,

Well, I know you've been around
And you've seen what you needed to see
And at night when you're dreamin'
You're probably not dreamin' 'about me
Oh, it's safe to say I've stumbled but I've managed
To make it through this far
As I take one step and then another, I wonder
What my chances are

I have watched the world go by
Hand, in hand, and wondered why I'm still so alone
Could I lay down my foolish pride
Maybe finally find my heart a home

The band has started playing
A simple song I used to know
I take you hand and walk you out
Dance to the rhythm way down low
Every heart has got a story
Mine just has a few more scars
But they could heal if you would hold me and tell me
What my chances are
Well, they could heal if you would hold me and tell me
What my chances are",Chances Are

Leavin' worries right where they lie

Kids runnin' wild in the heat

They say ""boy, you ain't a poet, just a drunk with a pen.""

Lord I'll make it perfectly clear, it get's hard out here

Ah, I guess there must be something I'm missin'
My mama told me I should've gone into easy listenin'
Joined up with a band 'cause I thought it was cool
Lord I probably should've just gone back to school
Ah pretty darlin' it'll be okay

You know we might get lucky but it won't be tonight""

They can shout it down the line
I can't lose what was not mine

I raise my glass and make a toast
We're better than some, little harder than most
Left our mark on every town
Chased our dreams and stood our ground

Can send me back the same way too

Said, it was a good source
Danger, love, and money, but it only led to divorce
Ended up in Abilene
Working at a Dairy Queen
Put me in the Army on the day that I turned seventeen
Here I am standin' in the desert with a gun
Thought of going AWOL but I'm too afraid to run
So I got myself a new plan
Stealin' from the Taliban
Make a little money turning poppies into heroin
Sergeant didn't like it so they put me in a hole
I said ""It's easy shootin' when they don't know where to go.""
Threw me on a lily pad
Sent me home to NORAD
I knew I'd be in trouble but I didn't think it be this bad

Met me on the tarmac
Told him I was sorry but I ain't ever going back
He said, you ain't in trouble son

Gonna get a trip, wouldn't tell me what it's for
Gotta serve your country, gonna help us win the war

Send me off to deep space

Sitting on a bad dream
Thousand pounds of gasoline
Ain't leavin' nothing but some rubble and my slipstream

Never would've guessed that I'd be passing by soon

Came down in a bad scene

Hidden by the break of day

She plays above the water
Watching sailors, tramps and daughters
Live their lives and slowly fade away
Night afternight, year after year
Once she knows she'll disappear
Into a world she never gets to stay

But she would give most anything
To open up her heart and sing
But no one hears her tune

She's just a jealous moon

No one ask her how she got so high
Way up there forever in the lonely sky

She watches through the seasons
Hoping without reason
That someday someone will call her home
But life goes on without her
No one ever ask about her
Or lets her know that she's not alone

It breaks her heart that down below
Rivers run, flowers grow
But she can't feel them bloom
Poor little thing
She's just a jealous moon

The nights are getting colder
Stars are growing bolder
As they paint their final light across the sky
But closer to the atmosphere
She prays for clouds to disappear
So she could say goodnight and say goodbye

We go out walking
We don't talk much
We lie down together
But our hearts never touch

Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
We got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need

We never go to bed angry
Cause we never fight
Yeah we never go crazy
In the middle of the night

We could stay here forever
Just holding on
We both had our reasons
But our reasons are gone

Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
We got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need

In our hearts we knew better
But we couldn't let go
Now it's time to quit our island
What we've always known

If something was missing
We were too scared to look
Too busy telling our stories
Instead of writing the book

Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
We got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need

Oh baby it's a hard way

Hayes Carll,"If you're nobody's business or you're front page news
Rock, Country or Delta Blues
Tell your truth however you choose
And do it all for the sake of the song

Yeah, hitchhike, and bus ride and rental car
Living rooms coffee house and rundown bars
Ten thousand people or alone under the stars
All for the sake of the song

And there's a man who wrote ""Your Cheatin' Heart"", now he's blind to it's truth
And he plays it on a stolen harp, his soul is hundred proof
And there's one who might be happy with a foreign baggar's purse
She's lost the crowd's attention at the forty second verse

And it's the travelling salesman, the girl next door
On the empty room to the bird on the corner 
Less is less until more is more
And it's all for the sake of the song

And there's the young man on the marquee, He's fond of somewhere unknown
And his father bought the two of us so he could strike out on his own
And there's the brooding contradiction, he's holding Van Gogh's ear
And he's taken to his guitar, in the hope someone will hear

It's life back stage and Nudie Suits
And the next big thing will get 'em back to you roots
High five flannel and duct tape boots
And it's all for the sake of the song

And there's the mystic, there's the legend, and there's the best that's ever been
And there's the voice of a generation who wants to pass this way again
And there's record deals and trained seals, and puppets on a string
And they're all just trying to figure out what makes the caged bird sing

It's lights, camera, on with the show
Lifetime to get ready, now go cat go
Where it all ends, nobody knows
B it's all for the sake of the song

So if you're nobody's business 
Or you're front page news
Rock, Country or Delta Blues
Tell your truth however you choose
And do it all for the sake of the song",Sake of the Song
Hayes Carll,"Billy built cars that never went nowehere
Only thing working was the dull radio
He sat on the front seat, listening to baseball

Make up new words that meant nothing at all
Curse the stories that had left him in
Hum an old tune, cry as they fall

Away from home
No plans worth making

But one look from that girl and he settled down
And he laughed right out loud when she said Mississippi
He said ""I've never been there but I like how it sounds""

Can see the universe/
Spinning round like a pin in your hand

Dip your fingers in paint/ go and skip up the street/ just try
To lighten up some
You're living your life like you're dead and in over you head

But checking numbers isn't how
To know how old you've grown
It's only what you want
It's only what you want

Say you want purple hair/ there's the truth now the dare/ I think
It's such a shame that
Growing old before our time is just a way to survive now

Stop and look at the sun/ tell me what have you done today
That left you dreaming
Cause living life's not a goal/ it's been happening all along the way

And checking numbers isn't how
To know how old you've grown
It's only what you want
It's only what you want

Laughter all over the world
Is doing all it can to have its secret heard
It's only what you want

It's only what you/ it's only what you want
It's only what you want/
It's only what you want

I'm trying to show you
I want to come clean

The one that you see in your dreams
The one that you hide your true self from
The one you want to please

And I know that it's wrong to want something
So false and so fake
It's not that I want to fix you
I just want to get my way

'Cause you're the one that I put on a pedestal
The one who keeps coming back to me
The one that I gave my whole heart to
The one who makes me believe

I want a love that's side by side (side by side)
I want a love that holds me tight (holds me tight)
I want a love that feels like a dream (like a dream)

And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere

From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show

And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends they're acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well somethings lost but somethings gained

I never saw a blue like that before

I never saw a blue like that

I can't believe
A month ago I was alone
I didn't know you, I've never seen you, or heard your name
And even now, I'm so amazed it's like a dream
It's like a rainbow, it's like the rain
Some things are the way they are and words just can't explain

I never saw a blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You're giving me all you have and more
No one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now, oh I
I never saw a blue like that before

It feels like now, it feels always,
And it feels like coming home

I never saw a blue like that before

You're giving me all you have and more

Lyrics: Charles Hart

No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me
Every waking moment,
Turn my head
With talk of summertime.

Say you need me
With you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light
You're safe, no-one will find you
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom
A world with no more night:
And you always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me
One love, one life-time;
Let me lead you from your solitude.

Say you need me with you,
Here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too.
Christine, that's all I ask of you.

Say you'll share with me
One love, one life-time;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.
Say you love me!
You know I do.
Love me, that's all I ask of you.

Anywhere you go, let me go too;




",All I Ask of You (from Phantom of the Opera)
Hayley Westenra,"I dreamed a dream in days gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted.
There was no ransom to be paid,
No song unsung, no wine untasted.

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame.

He slept a summer by my side,
He filled my days with endless wonder.
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came.

And still I dreamed he'd come to me,
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that can not be
And there are storms we can not weather.

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living,
So different now from what it seemed",I Dreamed a Dream (from Les Misérables)
Hayley Westenra,"
Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamp light
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile like the old days
I was beautiful, then I remember
The time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sun rise
I must think for the new life
And I mustn't give in

When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And the new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me !
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with my memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is




",Memory (from Cats)
Hayley Westenra,"We're walking in the air'
We're floating in the moonlit sky;
The people far below
Are sleeping as we fly.

I'm holding very tight
I'm riding in the midnight blue
I'm finding I can fly
So high above with you.

On across the world
The villages go by like dreams,
The rivers and the hills,
The forests and the streams.

Children gaze open mouthed,
Taken by surprise;
Nobody down below
Believes their eyes.

We're surfing in the air,
We're swimming in the frozen sky,
We're drifting over icy
Mountains floating by.

Suddenly swooping low
On an ocean deep,
Rousing up a mighty monster
From his sleep.

We're walking in the air,
We're dancing in the midnight sky",Walking in the Air (from The Snowman)
Hayley Westenra,"Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love you, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask you to stay
Close by me for ever, and love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children in your tender care",Away in a manger (Tune: Cradle Song) (New English Hymnal 22)

That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found;
Was blind, but now I see.

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fear relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far,
And grace will lead us home.

Than when we've first begun.",Amazing Grace

Will change into years gone by

Then our hearts would not be broken
When we let each other go

If I could steal this moment forever
Paint a picture-perfect smile
So our story stayed alive
We would never say goodbye",Never Say Goodbye

Lying in your arms we'll drift to
Islands of wonder that gleam and glow under the stars
As we glide through the dark
To the heart of the night

River of dreams gently hold me again
I remember all you told me
All of the secrets you whispered as we crept away
From the daylight and melted back into the night

Was I awake
Or did I dream
The kiss of waves
The silver slipstream
That tumbles as it turns again towards the sea

River of dreams softly flowing away
Let me follow where you are going
And make me a part of you
Deep in the heart of you
Let my reflection be clear
In the water of life

Hayley Westenra,"Out on the wiley, windy moors 
We'd roll and fall in green. 
You had a temper like my jealousy: 
Too hot, too greedy. 
How could you leave me, 
When I needed to possess you? 
I hated you. I loved you, too. 

Bad dreams in the night. 
They told me I was going to lose the fight, 
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering

Come home. I'm so cold!

Let me in-a-your window. 

Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely, 
On the other side from you. 
I pine a lot. I find the lot 
Falls through without you. 
I'm coming back, love. 
Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream, 
My only master. 

Too long I roam in the night. 
I'm coming back to his side, to put it right. 
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering,

Hayley Westenra,"Today we took a walk up the street,
We picked a flower, climbed a hill above the lake
Secret thoughts, you said aloud,
We watched the faces in the clouds
Until the clouds have blown away
Were we ever somewhere else you know

I never saw a blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You're giving me all you have and more
No one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now, oh I
I never saw a blue like that

I can't believe
A month ago I was alone
I didn't know you, I've never seen you, or heard your name 
And even now, I'm so amazed it's like a dream
It's like a rainbow, it's like the rain
Some things are the way they are and words just can't explain

I never saw a blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You're giving me all you have and more

Will be yours to share for always, always

Can only come from deep within

Cause my heart belongs to you

I lie awake to hear you breathe
Only you can feel the need
That builds and burns so deep inside me, inside me

As the moon lights up the sky
There's a thousand reasons why
My heart will only beat for you

You're the reason that I live
So now all I've got to give
I give it to you
Just don't fight the feeling

Will soothe, so close your weary eyes

Through the dark of night
Will your angels hold us

In the universe inside my room
And the world was really mine from June till September

And if it wasn't really so I was lucky not to know
And I was lucky not to wonder why
'Cause the summertime is all that I remember

A summer fly was buzzin' every night when I was young
In the gentle world my childlike senses knew
And the world was just my cousin, and the wind was just the tongue
In the voice my lonely moments listened to

And I look at me today all the dreams have gone away
And I am where I never thought I'd be
Seein' things I never thought I'd see happen to me

And I lie awake at night till the darkness turns to light
Hearin' voices callin' out my name
Callin' over and again the same message to me

Cryin' who's your partner, who's your darlin', who's your baby now?
Who wakes up at night to pull you in?
It don't matter, you'll just make him lonely anyhow
Don't know why you even try to win

Cryin' who's your partner, who's your darlin', who's your baby now?
Who wakes up at night to pull you in?
It don't matter, you'll just make her lonely anyhow

And the wreath is on my brow;
Satin and jewels grand
Are all at my command,
And I am happy now.

And my lord he loves me well;
But, when first he breathed his vow,
I felt my bosom swell -
For the words rang as a knell,
And the voice seemed his who fell
In the battle down the dell,
And who is happy now.

But he spoke to re-assure me,
And he kissed my pallid brow,
While a reverie came o'er me,
And to the church-yard bore me,
And I sighed to him before me,
Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
""Oh, I am happy now!""

And thus the words were spoken,
And this the plighted vow,
And, though my faith be broken,
And, though my heart be broken,
Here is a ring, as token
That I am happy now!

Would God I could awaken!
For I dream I know not how!
And my soul is sorely shaken
Lest an evil step be taken, -
Lest the dead who is forsaken
May not be happy now.",Bridal Ballad [The Merchant of Venice]

Mary did you know that your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered, will soon deliver you

Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary did you know that your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?
Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when your kiss your little baby, you have kissed the face of God

Oh Mary did you know 

The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak, the praises of the lamb 

Mary did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know that your baby boy would one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding is the great I am","Mary, Did You Know?"
Hayley Westenra,"For you, there'll be no more crying
For you, the sun will be shining
And I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

To you, I'll give the world
To you, I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

Hayley Westenra,"I knew I loved you, before I knew you
The hands of time would lead me to you
An evening star, watched from afar
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here

Now wrapped in moonlight, at last together
Here in the incandescent glow, we are all we need to know
As we softly please each other 'til the stars and shadows glow
And we sing with our dreams among us

Ah
Ohah
It guided me here, It knew you'd be here

I knew I loved you, before I found you
And you had built my world around you
Now all my days, they're now my nights
And my tomorrows will all begin and end with you",I Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme)
Hayley Westenra,"Malena canta el tango como ninguna
Y en cada verso pone su corazón
Al yuyo de suburbio su voz perfuma

Malena tiene penas de bandoneón
Tal vez allá en la infancia su voz de alondra

Tomo ese tono oscuro de callejón
O acaso aquel romance que solo nombra
Cuando se pone triste con el alcohol

Malena canta el tango con voz de sombra
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Tu canción tiene el frío
Del último encuentro
Tu canción se hace amarga
En la sal del recuerdo

Yo no sé si tu voz es la flor de una pena
Solo sé que al rumor de tus tangos, Malena

Te siento más buena
Más buena que yo

Tus tangos son criaturas abandonadas
Que cruzan sobre el barro del callejón
Cuando todas las puertas están cerradas
Y ladran los fantasmas de la canción

Malena canta el tango con voz quebrada
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Haystak,"Everybody wants to ride....
Everybody gonna die....

( Verse 1 )
??? slow rhymes to the top in no time
Stay showtime, I showshine, running like I'm on the goal line
Grabbed the chrome nine, proceed with caution
Around here shit's rougher than Stone Cold Steve Austin
Floss, ridin dirty with strikes against me, say what's on my mind
And the critics can give me some empty ink pens like clips
Fuck a mind game, welcome to my fully automatic mindframe
They say ""Fuck Haystak,"" they don't say that when they see me
No, because in reality I'm bigger than on TV
Rolexes don't tick they glide, you can run, you just can't hide
My shit's hotter than pepper spray, bitch ain't barring me
I'm roundin everyday, you weaker than R&B
My life is between ??? enough to make me psychotic
I was born up around the projects that's why I speak ebonics (And?)

( Chorus )
Everybody wants to ride, nobody want to die (Come on now)
Why be afraid of one place on the other side (You ready?)
Why live in fear, death is guaranteed (Come on now)
Take it why you're here, money, hoes and weed (Let's ride!)

( Verse 2 )
Motherfuckers think I'm rappin for no reason for rhymin
I'm motivated about the paper, pussy and diamond
But in the back of my mind, a part of me still exists
And still writes rhymes for the thrill of killin lyricsists
I'm serious with this like a massive heart attack
Talk that shit but you don't know part of Stak
Drop bombs like quarterbacks, be	-52's
Went from interrogation to magazine interviews
Most of my life the situation was win or lose
You died on the drugs, money, or your tennis shoes
This shit is deep, wolves dressed up as sheep
The enemy has got you thinkin their your motherfuckin peeps
I learned one thing comin up in Tennesee
It's that they're people like you and they're people like me
So point your fuckin finger and say that's the bad guy
Turn green with envy when my posse pass by (And a?)

( Chorus )  Repeat 1x

Nobody by your side, lookin at the phone rapidly
Your thinkin this motherfucker just blasted me
Hopin it was a bad dream, the sad thing is, this is reality
And three seconds and you gonna be a fatality, like...

Three, two, one, we're losing him
No resisting, it will do you no good, if you try to fight
Just talk to me into this light, eventhough your heart is full of fright
Don't be afraid, relax, your tension is makin it worse
There's no point in callin an ambulance
somebody get this man a hearse (Now you ready?)

Ah ah Come on.
You are not the only one
Going through what your going through you know what I'm saying?

Ah come on ah come on
I don't give a fuck what position you find yourself in
Just find security knowing somewhere else
someone is going through the same struggles you are right now
and it's probably me

I remember December middle of a bitter winter
Ass on the trunk feet swinging by the fender
Arguing with you in the freezing cold
I was wrong you ain't have to leave me though
Out here fucked up all alone
And what I really want to say is come on come home
But I got this load on me
Couldn't be worse than my momma died or my main homie told on me.
Hold me grand mom standing in front of her house
Tears trickle off my cheek and onto her blouse
And I realize now that once she's gone
I'ma truly know the meaning ah being alone when I'm...

What's up to all the home girls?
Caught up in this world
Preoccupied with money and sex powder and x
Little momma I promise its not the solution
I'm aware your life's style is full of confusion
I saw you at my show I had no time to talk
So close your eyes and imagine were taking a walk
Compliment you on your beauty your handsome behind
But at the same time tell ya god gave you a mind
And you should put it to use go back to school
So you can have something with or without these fools
Don't let no dude beat you miss treat you
You deserve to be loved I understand you attracted to thugs
But pick a real motherfucker that's gonna treat you well
Not no dead beat staying in and out of jail
Its hard when you out here alone and cold
That's the shit that make a stripper chick work that pole 'cause she's...

We don't die, we multiply

A damn fool for letting Cathy leave I contested
Every convicted felon that had ever been arrested
Every quiet child that had ever been molested
Every struggling rapper that had ever made a record
Every average cat that ever came in second
A proud father changed diapers and warmed bottles
Made a honest living and now I'm a role model?
A good dude for your son or daughter to look up to
Be here when the world got em feeling like... fuck you
Help them see better days and overcome obstacles
They go to school and hurt somebody I'm a feel responsible
Something I could a said something I could have did

Haystak,"She was the prom queen, the world was hers
With a wave of her hand, whispered words
Hearts broken by her abilities
Addicted to the sweetness of a gentle kiss
Lost in a search for something she might never find
Never know if she don't try, the results will come in time
No time to smell the roses, let alone slow dance
Too many bad memories of forgotten romance
She walked out slammed the door
Damn him, she didn't need him
A child game she had to cloth him feed him
Alone after so long gave up hope
Convinced all men were abusive
Undependable heathens and sold dope
Mister right wasn't coming
A fact that she would have to face
She didn't have no time to waste, she had a man to raise
No man to chase, sick of living in this blasted place
No time to sit around weeping like a basket case
Her  son made it all worthwhile
The only man that got to see her smile
She reminisced about her lifestyle before the baby came
She did what responsible people do, she changed

[Chorus x 2]
She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood

She was my best friend, my playmate
Moved in next door just before the first grade
We ran foot races, climb trees, caught insects
Before money and sex, powder and x
Before popularity came so crucial
She had love and the feeling was mutual
We used to cut our feet barefooted in chipped glass
Now we blow smoke as we skip class
New friends came, and with them came change
The pressure was all, would lil mama maintain
She began to drift away, the distance between us grew wider
Didn't have to speak to me, I could see the hurt inside her
I hear the words out of her mouth
But they don't reflect what she really feel
I've seen the smile before I know it isn't real
Artificial happiness, superficial friends
A nonstop whirl wind, when will it all end
Her eyes roll back, she began to convulse
They searched for a heartbeat, but she had no pulse
Autopsy results show she mixed powder and downers
And none of her new friends were around her
When her family found her, but a

[Chorus x 2]
She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood

She was a young girl seventeen, if I recollect correctly
A baby with a baby, that baby was me
She worked everyday still it wasn't enough
World was rough, ol' girl was tough
Drop me off in the morning
Come back and get me in the afternoon
Free spirits lost being guided by the moon
Used to take me to church, try to make me a man
But hard times put drastic changes in plan
She was out there, every time she got up, she fell again
In love with a bastard, stay in and out the pen
Alcoholic addict, never tried to change himself
Beat her to a pulp, and make her blame herself
I tried to talk to her, mama you don't have to stay
Just pack your bags and go, you can walk away
She tell me about this pain, hoping I'd never experience it
Baby boy love is some serious shit, I pray for change
Eventually it came, like rays of light after days of rain
She turned her life around, walked away never to return
Still tempted by the fire, just tired of being burned

[Chorus x 2]
She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood",Different Kinda Lady

Let me hear them speakers go

Know what I'm saying, Big Haystak
Street Flavor Records, bitch, represent
I remember when I was young
All my people told me I could
Be anything I wanted to be when I grew up
You know what I'm saying, and that's it for us
I was a big old white boy from
Tennessee that wanted to be a rap star
And that was fucking impossible

I over came opsticals did what they said couldn't be done
I went from murder dog to fire?? I'm the one
The only one who held it down for white class
Before it was cool to be white trash
You can't change the world so why try
Watch them chains to tidies
From fist fights to drive bys
I be out there late night and I'm white guy
So when I'm gone say goodbye to that white guy

I dedicate this to the hags and fags
Who associate Haystak with racism and rebel flags
You fucking bitch
When you mention me speak on killer weed and body bags
Hi proportion? And burning the flag
My grand daddy's mammy was half Cherokee
My grand mamma family came from an island in Germany
And me I'm just a mixed breed from Tennessee
Everything you fake mother fuckers pretend to be

But never ran a mother fucking thing 'round here
Pioneers lets get one thing clear
We been making music for years ya hear
Hardcore you better ask about hay
I get love 'round the way like e-40 in the bay
I'm from the land of the brave
Home of the free
And there's five million other fools just like me

We the have-nots little badass kids
Momma doing bad, dad der doing a bid
And we was set free to do as we please
Reek havoc on the streets of our communities
And we didn't have no curfew
We didn't have no rules
We don't need no book bags cause we don't go to school
Imagine my middle finger
In the mother fuckin sky
Screaming CWB till I die

Auh twenty, I don't have no twenties
But I got some fat dimes
Auh you like that huh
Come back and fuck with your people ya hear


Born a bastard child who struggled with love
We congregated on the corners puffin and pushing dubs
A lack of love a lack of understanding
A lack of compassion a lack of better parenting
The sad thing is either they don't know
Don't show
Or just don't care, well
That is till tad and rad?
Come to school with gauges
And start shooting up the rich kids in the faces
Mom and dad ducked in their shoes
""It was the crowd they hung around
Music that they listed to""
White boys been dying around here for years
But it never make CNN
You know why
We were put here to die
So when we kill one another
It comes as no surprise
We animals in their eyes
I represent the trial when I'm behind the mic
Can't tell me nothing about no damn stereotype

Sometimes I write about something, that like something I went through
Or something my people went through
And I felt like they needed some motivational shit
And it usually ends up going something like this...

( Chorus )
My first day, without you in my life
Things felt strange, a bit deranged
Even so, I hope you're doin okay
Take it slow, you just never know... ( just never know, oh!)
Yo, you just never know... nooo (just never know, oh!)
You just never know... nooo (just never know, oh!)

( Verse 1 )
My systems caught in conniption, stomach in knots
Feedin for my medicine, overcoming addiction
The first step is quittin, nah the first steps admittin
I got a problem, I need help, this is something I can't beat myself
I almost felt like I can't be cured
Rehab won't take me 'cause I ain't insured
Layin in the bath tub, shakin like a new born
Searchin for the courage it'll take for me to move on
I've been livin life like this way too long
Beggin God please, bring me home
I stopped before, three or four days
Always end up back in the same place
People call me a junkie, dope fiend
How they gonna judge me, they don't even know me
Lights off, want to be left alone, I'm tryin to enjoy the methodone
Put a Jimi Hendrix record on, and excuse me while I kiss the sky
Dosed off, woke up, sick to my stomach, ran to the bathroom
Started to vomit, the methodone wore off and the withdrawal started
That first day was the hardest...

( Chorus )

( Verse 2 )
Stayed strong, endured the rough weather
I ain't fully recovered but I'm doin much better
I can keep my food down to shakes and calms
They lowerin the doses of methodone
I eat V's and blow lots of dro
It's like chewin gum when you're tryin not to smoke
Keep my mind occupied, calm my nerves
It's not the same high, deep inside I...
Just want one more but I can't turn back this week for it
But I done made it, almost a month
With just a couple of V's and I blew some blunts
But that weed and gonna make me OD
That other shit was gonna kill me
Six weeks, and everything seem so clear
Before I knew it, time flew and I was clean for a year
Can't believe something started off socially
Something I almost allowed to take over me
Days went by and it was sixteen months
And I swear to God I didn't fall off once
I, feel like a brand new guy and I'm definitely livin a brand new life
Some days I still resist the thirst but none's worst than the first (believe
that)

( Chorus )

( Verse 3 )
Two years and I ain't touched it
Got a lot done, I been so productive
Rebuilt, I was so constructive
Can't believe I was so self destructive
Got a good job and I make big bucks
Went to the lot and got a new pick up
Got a brand new crib and a brand new kid
I think anybody can quit if I did
If you want to quit, get up and go get the shit
Walk straight to the toilet, drop it, flush it, fuck it, fight it
Just resist it and if this helps then just keep listenin
When you start slippin I'll send you another one
Sonny, wasup?, we just saved another one
I know it's so hard like there's no God
But through him you're able to go so far
Hey, I don't want to sound corny
I'm just like you either hungry or horny
Seems as though we get hooked so easily
Quitting becomes an impossibility
I ain't sayin treat your body like a church
Just don't let dope put your body in a hearse
The streets inside you, you just gotta search
And know that no day be harder than the first

Who turned they, backs on me when I needed em most
And even though they my enemies, I'm keepin' em close
Cause I can, either sink em or keep em afloat
A while the ship jumpers go searching for life preservers
I'm a stay here and try and repair the holes in my ship

And maybe one day find somebody that really loves me
Stands beside me through anything
Loves my when it's sunny, the same as when it's raining

Who'd have thought you'd see me in
ICU?
Prob'ly thought I'd see you in ICU.
You can't see me, but I see you.
Wish you could hear me sayin' ""Baby,
just be cool.""
I know it's gon' be hard without me
there.
You can make it, baby, just hold me
down.
I'm on the other side, where it's all
clearer.

For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road
Hazami,"Katakanlah dengarkanlah percayalah
(Sampai bila harus aku menunggu)
Ucapkan sayang cinta padaku setulus hati
murnimu

Katakanlah dengarkanlah percaya
sesungguhnya
Ku serahkan jiwa ragaku hanyalah untukmu

Katakanlah dengarkanlah percayalah
Daku dambakan senyum manismu tawa
mesramu lirikan manja

Katakan kau cinta padaku
Kan ku serah segalanya
Ku pasti kita bahagia
Tiada lagi keraguan

Cintaku takkan persia
Walau ribut getir melanda
Bukan paksaan atau mainan
Usah bimbang lafazkanlah

Ke mana saja ku lari
Wajahmu selalu di hati
Suaramu menghibur kalbu
Ku terlena sejenak merindu

Katakan kau cinta padaku
Kan ku serah segalanya
Bukan paksaan atau mainan
Usah bimbang lafazkanlah",Kata
Haze,"Como en un mar eterno quiero ser yo libre amor
Para que cuando cante llegar a tu corazón
Para que cuando estés solo poder oírme
Como si se tratara de sirena oírme

Siente la llama de la libertá y no tengas miedo para volar
Abre tu corazón extraño y miéntete a diario
Miente y di que no me quieres, miente y di que no me quieres
Miéntete como haces siempre, miéntete

Siente la flor de la alegría puesta en tu corazón
Yo la riego to los días y le pregunto la razón
Todavía quiero que vengas porque te guardo mi amor
Siéntete como la flor de la alegría puesta en tu corazón

Yo la riego to los días y le pregunto la razón
Todavía quiero que vuelvas porque te guardo mi amor
Porque te guardo mi amor

Como en un mar eterno quiero ser yo libre amor
Para que cuando cante llegar a tu corazón, para que cuando estés solo
Poder oírme, como si se tratara de sirena oírme
Siente la llama de la libertá y no tengas miedo para volar

Abre tu corazón extraño y miéntete a diario
Miente y di que no me quieres
Miente y di que no me quieres
Miéntete como haces siempre
Miéntete

",Como en un Mar Eterno
