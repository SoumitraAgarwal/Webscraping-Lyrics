Not to go against me or it?s R.I.P
I'm stupid rich, got retarded money
I'm special ed, I got special bread

It's easy now, please believe me now
I dismiss a hoe, bitch leave me now
I fuck when I want, I do what I like
She want the same chick I want, the bitch is a dike

She a super freak, the freak of the week
I give her something to suck, she give her something to eat
It never enough, she like it rough
We keep it going and we switch positions, listen

I like the way she do it

I need a dollar every time that my heart beat
Now how much was that?
I can breathe on a track and make money
Hhh, hhh, now how much is that?

I'm getting money baby, my truck a Lamborghini
I'm in Ali be-be, where the girls are freaky
Haters wanna be me, hoes glad to see me
Ma, I love it when you lie and say my eyes are dreamy

Certain niggaz fall in love with a bitch
Patron in my dick, I fuck the blood out a chick
I'm in the club frontin?, I'm in the club stuntin'
Ten grand buy the bar, Ma, it ain't nothing

If homegirl wit it, I'ma get it, hit it, split it
She'll think about me every day, hour, minute
Second to nobody, baby, check it
You look as good as a check

And when you're naked, I'm ready to fuck, a little head in the truck
If her tongue getting good, I'ma let her come up
And when the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down with the mack in the pound

I'm with G-Unit, see-unit
Nigga you're not ballin? on a G2 jet
Everything you wanna ever do you need D
O-P-E, on a fucking CD, it?s me

I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it
I like the way she do it

She got a nigga on the countdown
Waitin? on it like, 3, 2, 1, yeah right now
You got skills in them high heels
When we leave this club, I'ma take you where I live

Do me before I get up
I might eat out tonight depending on how I feel
Baby girl got a thang for me
She do whatever I say and I ain't gotta make it rain money

Go get it then she ghetto with it
Told shawty, don't do it, but she already did it
I'm all on her back, when she move like that
You can find me wherever she at, like yeah!

I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let her ass drop, like my '64

Uh, the game took a turn crazy, it's all gravy
Thanks to 50 Cent and Shady, they gon' play me
These lil' niggaz can't fade me, they just babies
Play me and I'm crazy, I'm Tom Brady

Emeralds and baguettes when I'm hoppin? up off the jet
A nigga reach for that and I'm choppin? him in his neck
One big remix and she'll be on my penis
If my flow had a phoenix and my paws are the cleanest

9-millimeters in the bars and arenas
If you hood then you seen us with wood in the Beamers
I'm that new nigga, they all over Adidas
When they see us they don't charge that shit, they wanna be us
(Let it go)

When we pressed to go, body restin? up
They wan' mop up all that blood but he's testin? us
The moon eclipse, is a mess and ah
We'll compose the new and then test it oh

I'm the high school dropout, crack game genius
The mac'll turn your back into Kill Bill arenas

I'm criminal minded, you've been blinded
Feds lookin? for my bricks but can't find it
Maneuver with the Ruger, the grip is rubber
My Frank Mueller, is dipped in them rainbow colors

Bein? broke is a disease, I need that guap and that cheddar
I learned that, in the Maybach with Fif' and Mayweather
Mix the milk with Amaretta, my beretta's in my leather
My tiger striped eagle make your people need weather

G-Unit,"I came to get somethin?, I ain't worried 'bout nothin?
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin?
Strap like it's legal, ridin? around bumpin?
If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em

I never liked these niggaz anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a buildin? today
Hey, nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

I got the burner burner, I come to burn and burn ya
Revolver turn ya, call it murder murder
I ain't smilin? I ain't smirkin?, I ain't muh'fuckin? jokin?
See if you think somethin? sweet when your head open

Cross me, force me, go 'head, line me up
I found where you rest at, you grimy fuck
I be out front your raggedy ass crib on a stake out
With a pound, two clips and Chinese take-out

You make it rain, I make it lead shower
You say your prayers, you in your last hour
I have you pushin? up daisies, the coke dump crazy
You chumps amaze me, the wolves they raised me
You don't like me then spray me

I came to get somethin?, I ain't worried 'bout nothin?
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin?

I never liked these niggaz anyway
They could drop dead, fall off a buildin? today
Nobody gon' miss you anyway
No days off, keep the pistol e'ry day

This is that face down on the floor, ski mask shit
If I fall off I rebound quick
Like Greg Odin, Tony Yay' I be holdin?
German mouths on my hip ?cause my wrist be frozen

How these rappers claim blood and the books is closed?
How these rappers claim cars and they gun don't smoke?
I catch a nigga on his deathbed
And rip the IV out his arm then jump in the Optimus Prime

Dust the yellow Enzo with the Dalvins on
In my bulletproof Ac', who you stylin? on
When the sun is gone, and the wolves come out
You coward ass niggaz bring your jewelry out

I came to get somethin?, I ain't worried 'bout nothin?
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin?

You may have to bring that, ain't nobody trippin?
Shit, niggaz is hungry, I ain't nobody chicken
I think a screw is missin?, I'm pimpin?, I'm livin?
Nice with the dice, deuce-deuce six'n

Look how the game change, bad for the system
Niggaz on game shows, two dudes kissin?
Listen, we're not the same, we're not for fame
The industry's punked out, we're not to blame

These niggaz been perpetratin? so long
If they can make it rain, I can make it storm
He's makin? a scene but I can make him calm
I just got a N.B. that'll break a arm

I came to get somethin?, I ain't worried 'bout nothin?
Child of the hood, I was put here for stuntin?
Strap like it's legal, ridin? around bumpin?
If you can't beat 'em don't join 'em, jump 'em, fuck 'em

The mighty mighty mighty Unit

I make the airline and pop to it, N.Y. bop to it
No frontin here shorty, niggaz know how I do it
For the paper let the gat pop, jackpot
Find me trippin, ridin slow through the back blocks
Red Coupe switchin lanes, top down, party frame
Diamond rangs, diamond chains, diamonds on e'rythang
Mo' flows, mo' dough, money come, money go
New straps, new clip, stack chips, don't trip
Play playa, go hard, stunt nigga, oh God
Party ain't never over, niggaz hardly ever sober
Different day, same shit, different city, different chick
Show you how I do this shit, you notice how I do it kid

Bitches recognize when I'm walkin in
Smokin that piff, goin where dolphins swim
44-Colt, that's tossin him
And that four-do' car is what I'm flossin in (YEAH!)
I'm in the black, you in the red
You owe your label money, I'm gettin bread
Can you feel it, feel it? Nothin can save ya
In my purple tag Polo and neon Gators (break it down now!)
Bitch play cute, I don't get upset
'Til her ass get a facial and a washin set
I'm in a private jet, but before the deal
Hoes was like, ""He's all right, but he's not ill!""

You might see me yawnin, four in the mornin
But the party ain't over
Then it's back to the crib, to cut shorty that's how we on it

Gon' do what you wan' do, twerk it for me
Now get low, shorty work that back
Now get low, yeah just like that

Six-four droppin, you still window shoppin
I'm ridin round rockin, knockin, Rakim
Slick Rick, Rick James; big stack, big chains
I'm so sicker, the flow liquor, you're broke nigga
I toast wit'cha - if ya got a cup
Hold your fuckin bottle up, I really want a model but
You can get behind the truck, if you swallow nut
I'm just playin, unless you gon' do it
You put your back into it, the rest is all fluid
Don't pull that thing out unless you gon' use it
Ain't nobody bleedin, I guess it's all music

Shawty the kush still burnin, Aston Martin wheel turnin
Higher than Mount Vernon, the passenger she German
Bottles is still poppin, clubs is still rockin
Feds is still watchin, but fiends is still shoppin
I got vitamin water money like I signed a deal
How would you feel if you niggaz just got 400 mil' (like me)
My bad bitch do her thang in her Vera Wang
She let me have a brain, I let her wear my chain
I'm on the plane smokin on that Mary Jane

Hand of a hustler, I'm all about a dollar
Everybody?s a customer, nobodies a friend

Don't be out there snorin?, one eye blink and you're gone

And my sense of humor's shot, I don't take jokes funny
My paranoia rolls with my bullet holes
Givin? me a third eye, my foes can get a magazine full of those

Focus through my new designer lens
Tell her not her friends
Beaucoup dollars spent, new jewels line 'em in
Too cool time to win, I'm on top again
You gon' chop me off and 'scuse me out
Bullshit you about, front, them rugers out
Face the sword, no risk, no reward
Peace talk won't go nowhere, gets ignored
Price you can't afford, white man at your courts
Get you more, right here like before
Seen it all my life shit end like this
Come back filthy rich, still not guilty, bitch

Say you'll never be a winner, show up at your parade
Outside showing you smiles, inside hoping it fades
Rather be low now, money over the stage
Sanity over fame, eye-candy calling your name

Fog up your aim, there's a million ways to hit them cages
Shit's contagious, forget my favors

Gettin' head in the VA, they got your bitch on the film
I got to bust a couple heads with my nigga Soulja Slim
Talked to C-Murder, he 'bout to come home from the pen

And when he come home, I might be the one that's goin' in
Just hit your block last week, this week I'm goin' again
You don't know who you fuckin' with, I'm the one they come and get
You know what you gonna get, I don't know which gun to get
You ain't ever shoot nothin', got shot at
Shot back, pull the stock back, gave his waves a stockin' cap
I'm 'bout that, I'm gettin' the chopper right now
I know where Buck hide 'em at

Y'all niggas better ease up
Cause I ain't for the sucka shit
Better figure out who you're fuckin' with
Hoes down, G's up
Don't get me on my other shit
Cause then we get to shootin' and cuttin' shit
Y'all niggas better ease up
Cause I ain't for the sucka shit
Better figure out who you're fuckin' with
Hoes down, G's up
Don't get me on my other shit
Cause then we get to shootin' and cuttin' shit

I've been with the bullshit, niggas sayin' I'm slippery
Did peoples with my car door, them niggas wasn't hittin' me
Niggas say they aired me out, boy you hit the stop signs
Said you tried to take my head off, you better stop lyin'
I take a nigga's work, murk, all I do is diss
All I, all I do is diss, all you, all you do is miss
I'm my town, boy I'm what they wanna talk about
I show a country nigga quick what New York about
City slicker, slick nigga talkin' slick shit
The slick kinda nigga niggas better stick with
If they're tryna eat, out there on the street
Pop shit, pop a nigga, watch a nigga leak

Y'all niggas better ease up
Cause I ain't for the sucka shit
Better figure out who you're fuckin' with
Hoes down, G's up
Don't get me on my other shit
Cause then we get to shootin' and cuttin' shit
Y'all niggas better ease up

Chuck Norris vs. Bruce Lee, in the kitchen chop a key
Money comin' in, ain't no time for sleep
Blunt look like a twig, one hand on a cig
Stashbox for the pigs, yah dig
So your claim to fame is puttin' work in
I'm on the Cayman Islands gettin' brains like a surgeon
In solitary pursuits, and nothin' but the fuckin' door
If niggas ribs touchin', kick your fuckin door

Fuck outta here with all that money shit, ya' scrambling still
Foot 'em, let the damage build, 357 cannonfield
Realest on the planet, still, steal a nigga just because
Mayor Miller country club yo he don't mean it, yes he does
Bimmer leanin' hefty drugs, I hope you niggas rest in pain
Peel 'em off a rind of piss, my feelings gone since I was 6
I steal a corner, rocky wrist
I hear you're boring, I'm convinced
I was born to double dead presidents

Y'all niggas better ease up
Cause I ain't for the sucka shit

G-Unit,"All I see is dead people
Come through the hood, niggas starving
If you ain't tryna pay what I'm charging

No deals, I ain't giving no bargains
My Glock 9 give you 16 ways to die, choose one
Give it to ya how you want it
My .45 give you 32 ways to die, choose one
It's shoot 'em up bang, bang, shit, we still on it, nigga

Every day a star's rising
It ain't no love here, but your heart's tied in
Soul's slipping, sparks flying
Masterpieces is an art dying
Crime release, we break apart lying
Man down, the parts crying
Tears of joys heal a real McCoy
Bury your worries, don't wonder who rides for ya
Know yourself, relax and study
Bloody your uniform, no rest, keep moving on
Anybody who do you wrong, wrong turn, it's on

Somebody chain got took, somebody life got lost
Somebody water not working, somebody lights cut off
I watched my partner OD in '03 in front of me
Took the plea, went on a spree, damn near downed the whole key
Paranoid, nose dirty, 'bout to go for them thirty
You keep saying he's hurting, now all his homies is worried
Second-guessing this gangster, they don't know what he said
They don't know what he told, but now you know that he dead

HK, SK, turn niggas vegetable
Live past 22 like climbing Mount Everest with one shoe or flip-flop
Middle finger to the opp'
Bacon, egg and cheese at my clip from last night
Smoking, think about that drama from last night
Emotion in your mind, love and hate cause casualty
These old dogs wack in that cave mentality

Dope boy salary, block ground athlete
Move so much weight I lost a couple calories
The palms sells the size of deep batteries
Get hit like Jay Rock when that fat nigga squeeze
My homie Kenny Booth doing life over 8 racks
He broke down in court when they played the tape back
I’m from Mazant, 6 shots, I ate that
Now I won't pay back, let my kids slay that

I roll up 'till the cash come
I'm on my cool shit, new bitch, doper than my last one
Dope-doper than my last one
I got loud in by the bag more potent than the last one
I've been the latest fashion
I've been cold, but my new flow doper than my last one
Dope-doper than my last one, dope-doper than my last one

War, spoils, and all my props in order
Take me down, good with old green
He ballin', pocket lawyer new town, now tally more cream
You're a borderline performer nightmares
Mixed with my tall dreams
My songs ignite the corner, all I got is my word and my soul
My style a half man, convertible gold
Got bitches jumping off the vertical
Oh, thought I forgot?
You dissed me when I wasn't hot
I guess you miss me now
Bitch, you see me, don't flip your frown
The rich get richer, you skip the needy, they strip you down
Your name graffiti, go get my CD, I'll lift the town
Now probably amazing, ain't no winner promise
Generous summers lead the club with all the strippers on us
How can it be I made a pepper promise
My game a cannon, blow your chick Bahamas
And pet pajamas, time as real as it can get, don't find us
You have official problems
Immediate response to all the shit you hollin'

Fuck is niggas thinking matching me up, won't be even
And I sound like where I'm from, don't gotta freeload off a region
I deebo all the seasons, snakes and leaches only feedin'
Speeding till you crash and burn
Reckless in this white man's world, no blacks concerned
This dose label reality
I'm on the prowl, but get too close taking your battery
Me and my power pen against the world won't rattle me
You been clouded
Thought to gossip me, ain't care about it
I believe the game'll switch to make emcees all fear the profit
Gotta do my own addiction in the V inhaling chocolate
Fit the sickest flow description, clips are hard narcotic
Money standing by the hobbit
We managed, ran back out of product
The hottest topic, killing shit, don't know how to stop it
Deposit, you ho for chromo, you a Bozo really
Gun sign in your photo like you gon' go nilly

I own Rolexes and Frank Muellers
I do what the fuck I want to
I'm grown, I own lots of shit, proper shit
I bought a couple before the dealership got the shit
Rich nigga, six figures
I double up every flip, my stash bigger
Plane hoppin', globetrottin'
A nigga blow a little paper when it's time to move
Fuck old money, for the new money

Wanna smoke, but I'm still on paper
I mix purp' and yellow like a Laker
Headed to the moon and I just might take ya
Split my blunt with a little bitty razor
While this thick bitch just twerk on the table
Big lips, look like Fantasia
She ready, willin' and able
Just got a piercing, her navel
Working nine to five and she stable
Said she flying down to my city
'Cause she got a birthday coming in April
We ain't got no kind of commitment
Why you worried 'bout if I'm hitting it?
Don't worry about how I'm getting it
Stay the fuck up out of my business

That love gon' get you like BDP, PSA, I'mma be okay, I'm the iron G
Fix flash and I'm a fly emcee, I put a duffle on all of y'all
Trouble can't ignore me, I was born to ball
Fuck is up? I'm one of one, I need a custom cut
Hear the summer come, I want the number one
Bitch, walk in with a freak behind me
Shades damn near to the sticks, Gianni
Too nights and no repeating, mami
I'm guttered up, my streets define me
Now drop your ass to the floor, here to be more
Rob me I'll make a detour, robbery how I get to her
Probably want out like I knew her, I done got colder
Chip on my shoulder, head when I sit in the Rover
Bought me a zipper of the odor, phone numbers slid in the folder
Bullshitting how? Show you my pimping diploma

Nine calls for the Nine Ward
Mardi Gras, take your top off
I'm a nasty nigga, might slide and roll
Fly your girl out to Miami
Sent her back home like they done LeBron
I ain't tripping if you ain't tripping, party hard 'till he calls the law
Got my own house so I can throw you out
I got my own blood so I ain't putting it out
This is my car and I can smoke it out
Got my own money and like four accounts
Bought my own bottles so I can pour it out
Got my own shooters and they scoping out
Bought my bitch an ass, now it's poking out
If she throw it back then I'mma throw her out
My condo money don't fold out, wild all out
Hoes out, let's roll out, funeral when I go south

But I can never now be true

I think I'd better leave right now

Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

I'm here so please explain
Why you're opening up a healing wound again
I'm a little more careful perhaps it shows
But if I lose the highs at least I'm spared the lows

Now I tremble in your arms
What could be the harm
To feel my spirit calm
So I say

I think I'd better leave right now

Feeling weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper

I wouldn't know how to say
How good it feels seeing you today
I see you've got your smile back
Like you say your right on track

But you may never know why
Once bitten twice is shy
If I'm proud perhaps I should explain
I couldn't bear to lose you again

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper

Crowd up around why'all listen to the sound
Yo, this is for the way we rock
Thinkin' Bad Boy gonna stop, we not
Yo, we step up in the scene like oh!
You hear their flow and then there they go
In the Range Ro' see the ringers go blind
There the brain go every single time
Put it in perspective, reflection in step
Step to the left while I rep it to the death
Easily approached, smokin' on the roach in coach
til I'm so high I'm on another plane
Hey, every fucking spot we go, we just rock you see now we know
Fuckin' news cameras they want to get the footage
want to grind out find out where my hood is
Let's just say that this is how we put it, down
why'all niggas cool out and lounge
Fuck around, radios down this
Say we go round this bullshit straight to the plate
Now, every fucking spot we go
Gust when you thought we would stop, we go
Came a long way from them nice hallways
What you talk about we could do it all day, what you say now

G. Dep,"A yo, I walk down the block with my stomach in knots
Spent time hustling, running from cops
Broke as a joke, no ends at all
Can't play ball and my Timbs is small
Can't buy trees with government cheese
I rather be where its breeze, niggas bubbling ki's
My moms got two jobs one on her knees
and writin letters to the governor ""Please call off the deeds""
My baby mother with another brother with cash
and drive by roll down the window and laugh
I solve all my problems with indo and hash
Bought my daughter a Nintendo now she calling it Dad
My landlord's a jerk, the water don't work
My little sister twelve and she bought her own skirt
Rather do Kirk than do her homework
Talk blunts and boys and she'll jump for joy
Shit's twisted, opportunity not but I missed it
Out in the park gettin lifted
So now I'm sittin here shit out of luck without a buck
and it don't make a difference

So do you hear me?
'Cause if you don't I'll come up close and say it clearly
I got to know I got to go
I strive for my pay each and every way
but this type of shit it happens everyday

It's like I'm trapped in a maze walk around in a daze
I won't rest 'til I'm paid or I'm down in my grave
I want to look tough, but my sneakers is scuffed
Everyday pants in the week is enough
I had a little money but it came and it went
Now its either pay the rent or stay in a tent
and it don't make sense how the shit is intense
and all you got up in your pocket is lint, you get the hint?
I had a cigarette for breakfast, just for beginners
Cried for my lunch and sleep for dinner
I tried to go to church, priest called me a sinner
He called me everything except for a winner
I'm walking in the rain wishing things would change
It ain't a game, mad I pawned all the rings and chains
Emotionally scarred form losing my job
Pass the nod nigga, times is hard

[CHORUS]
So do you hear me?
'Cause if you don't I'll come up close and say it clearly
I got to know, I got to go
I strive for my pay each and every way
but this type of shit it happens everyday
Now would you check me?
If I was you and you was me, would you respect me?
I got to know I got to go
I strive for my pay each and every way
but this type of shit it happens everyday

I ain't gonna front, all I want is a blunt
a pair of blue and yellow dunks and my hundreds in chunks
But, people see me, put they purse to the front
I'm waking up early on the first of the month
Honeys don't respect when you call 'em collect
and it's 25 cent you can call 'em direct
I put my life on the line I ain't making a dime
Nigga call me ""Never mind , man you're wastin' your time""
A yo, I'm livin' in the ghetto and I'm tryin' to survive
At the same time a nigga rolling by in a five
Can find a drive for a 9-5
It's like I only get by when I'm feeling the high
And I ain't got no smoke, the elevator broke
I'm at the end of my rope tryin to find a way to cope
I'm sipping on Gin thinking how I could win
I don't know where it begins but this is where it could end

Everybody high, don't nobody say hello
Even when the sunshining it ain't yellow
Get out of the borough
If you know it ain't thorough
Niggas play ball, AWOL, on the furlow
Still came down on the furl and pumped hero
Red and grey Macs
Keep it clean as Ajax
Ghettos sling cracks
While you niggas pay tax
Now how ghetto is this
you can catch me in your hallway taking a piss
One hand on my dick one hand on a spliff
Burnt lips from the roach clip, yellow tips
If we ain't closed it I get ferocious

Five boroughs of niggaz do his ? a ? flip weight

I want it yo I got warrants in six states
They come in a stolen whip with switched plates
Stickers hate I never leave a bread to trace
Only evidence I leave is hickies on chicks' face
In the corner with the crooked niggas
But yo shit's straight
We start war to leave with these seven revolvers
Sell case never test the floor
Sticky yank slicking enough why'all
I'm a man enough to put on a dress
To creep up like grand-moma and bust why'all
Get close enough to part your vest and tux off
Who would have thought the lady with the car would crush why'all
Too smart to get caught
But I got fam up north
So if they put me in coughs
I'll call fuck why'all

With the hands toast
Close and stand opposed
Rubber bands she knows
Grams of the coke
Razor blade tuck the side the line
The banter of the coke
Watching niggas die with my hand on their doe
Singing with the bass
And wash up the ?land? when they float
Choking on your own words
Should have watched the ground when you spoke
One last final approach
Make your whole family ghost
Bust bottles of cham and and we toast
Till your photo stamped in the post
Sex gland cut off jammed in you're throat
Man are you gross
Bitch hanging from the lampost
We shoot from up close
Blow canners the most

Plush slut, bucks, guns and ?duffs?

You thought I wasn't, yea hehehehe
Yea look at me, look at me nigga
Come here, know one thing nigga

[Verse 1: G-Dep]
I think you need to know I'm holdin it down
Wit a hole in this town
It's a hole in da ground, where I stomp
Got these niggaz steady on the watch
Like it's Teddy on da block
If your ready or your not here I come
Nigga you can run you can hide
You can dip you can slide
You can duck you can ride you can flee
I give a nigga, one test now it's one less
That's how easily you can be eliminated
Program to scan rock jams
Get down from where I stand to Scotland
Dustin like Hothman
If that'll stop what you got planned the shot's ?
Ask your man, ask your girl, ask your crew
I'm hittin high, I'm hittin low what a nigga have to do
You want drama I'm a have to act a fool
Had to laugh at the aftermath now I'm after you and

[Chorus: G-Dep]
One way or another I'm a find ya
And I'm a getch ya, getch ya, getch ya, getch ya
One day maybe next week, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna getch ya, getch ya unngghh

[Verse 2: Black Rob]
Cowardest cats, names don't ring no bell
Been grabbin niggaz up by they coat ?
Coke rhyme but It's dope as hell
Nigga four tooth the ?
Still had to broke in jail
Wit a parole hold just the systems so cold
Had me thinkin under pressure that this kid won't fold
When the feds came in extremely vocal, ain't stutta
Shoutin out my ? name and my social
Wasn't to hard to find I stay local
If I would of known you was sinkin I would of bin by coastals
See I'm a do what I'm supposed to
Even if I gotta dress up and knock on your door like I'm the postal
Your ass is grass and that's that
Better strap up your vest and that's that
Come through wit ski masks and black ?
With the boomshack with the crack crack fuckin rat nigga

[Chorus: G-Dep]
[Verse 3: G-Dep]
Just when you thought it was over
But that ain't the code of a soldier look over your shoulder
Came through low in the rover knowin ya nova
Trouble was seen then see trouble was me
Double your speed, punch through metal fa sure
I got the metal in store, whatch you medallin for
I used to boost pedals ?
NowI'm ? vocal peddal the four let this settle the score
Now check it
Won't have to rest to switch hands and
Six mill-e-on ree-sons you should switch plans
It a happened all too fast to ? fans
Like a wind brass, shoot glass, shit sand
Thinking it would all sink in like quicksand
But, this is why I direct the shit and
Cut now it's done, what now it's won
Like the Wild Wild West it's Dep and ?

First off, how you gon' come off
All this rap shit, get done off
Man listen this a passionate mind
I come through, gun drew splashin a rhyme
Wet dat, dead dat, cash on the line
In an orderly fashion in the back'a the line
Can't talk now, I got cash on tha mind
Bitches and dolla signs dance in they mind
I love dat doe, but y'all niggas love dat flow
Man I don't love dat hoe
All I see is cash flow
Brains an occasional ass hole
What I need is a, whole lotta money involved
I might run into Rob and run in ya job
Real cats take chances
Then I make ya +head spin+ like +break dancers+

[Chorus]
My niggas in the front don't front
My niggas in the back, where you at
My niggas on the side, bout to slide
My niggas in the middle we rock just a little
Then we ride, the ride

My bitches in the front don't front
My bitches in the back, where you at
My bitches on the side, bout to slide
My bitches in the middle we rock just a little
Then we ride, the ride

[Verse 2]
If raps don't work, need ta put some in
I hear y'all knockin' but ya can't come in
Said I'd get cha, wrote the scripture
Chick roastin like motion picture
Have you any idea, how many nice MC's
And how many I feared - None
Just trust me son, I do what must be done
And I just begun, I let em-
Count sheep, rock em to sleep
Got me, cocking the heat, poppin a Jeep
Let's go, Expo top of the line
Exo, Yes ho, hoppin in mine, I got a-
Big Bad Boy you could meet
Men use beef and its all you can eat, I be the-
Dep with a G in the front
Front, fuck around and be in a trunk

Ain't no games if you're curious be	
Can't be serious G, seriously, I'm out ta-
Put a big hole in the joint
Like I, sold her the joint, told her to point, its like-
Mind over matter with this
Mad Hatter with this, battle with this
Like a +sentence+, it just +run-on+
I'm pro and you a princess, come on
y'all ain't ready, ain't crazy and ya name ain't Eddie
And ya aim ain't steady
Dream big boy but ya chain ain't heavy
Brain ain't ready, my game ain't petty
Must be stupid or somethin'

One question: What you gon' do?

Yo, this for my niggas, though, special delivery
Spit like this, get my wrists all glittery
Get cake, snakes get slithery
Lean in, show why'all the meaning of chivalry
Rap ruler, you could ask Buddha
Right jab like Zab Zuda
Every member on my team is the shooter
Tight like a womb, no room for intruders
Spark Buddha, twistin' the Philly
And Good Humor, don't be silly
It's gravy baby, I got it all smothered
Like makeup, I got it all covered
Want a jewel, don't be cruel
It's authentic, don't be fooled
By these phony accusations
Backlash and slanders
Front, and they put pits in ya
Stunts and propaganda
Keep it private, 'cause I'm the commander
In chief, I never stop like beef
Gimme a break, I might shake the building place
Say vacate all women and children

I need

Can I have that

Come give it to me

[Verse 2]
If you ain't ready, I'ma bust through ya curtain
Encore, you're not sure, I'm certain
Wait, make sure the mic workin'
Make cake, sorta like Earth Wind
And Fire, the rap vampire
Retire in the morn'
Warm like campfires
Matter of fact, I'm blazin'
Raisin' the roof up
Slide off with ya rooster
Took her to the stu and seduced her
Let her do a skit, then she hit my producer (Oh)
Not whatcha used to, I'm looser
Ya need to stop fuckin' with them losers, now who's up
The mystic ruler, grand imperial
Filthy, but milky like cereal
Bang this in ya stereo
MC's is dead and I'ma get head up at they burial
And that's disrespectful
I'm strong like Exo mixed with X, yo
And that's the high capability
And yes, I possess that ability

Yeah, ayo, Dep so bright, light looking halogen
Spit that bar, car low mileagin'
Let's go, metropolitan
Area, 'cause I'm hearin' ya hollerin'
The earthquaker, Harlem bread maker
Gimme two hands, few grams and the shaker
Hit the block, watch the kids bake up
Your girl keep coming around
Then I'ma take her to Jamaica
And I give her a reason to get curious
But ya pain, it ain't that serious
MC's ran with this and that
But change your name to Saran 'cause it's a Wrap
Your rap is like a sedative
You sleepy, defeat me, negative
So it's over and I guess you gotta live with it
And you can tell by the records that's distributed
I spit it out

G. Dep,"Yeah, check it out, uh yo

Yo, I was sittin' on the block with the deuce-deuce, the bubble goose
Nigga popped up in the blue Coupe, this nigga Moose
This nigga fishy, this nigga he stay pissy
Run up behind niggaz, the blizzy and get busy
I seen niggaz resent, some nigga wrist be broke over this coke
Or pocket full of crispy
Dollar bills make nigga swallow the steel
And most niggaz can't swallow a pill, know how that feel?
But back to the skit nigga, in back of the whip
With the windows half way down about to clap on some shit
And I'm rappin' and shit to this platinum chick
It was fucked up, I got shorty back of the whip
I'm paranoid but still got the gat and the clip
If them niggaz spit, I got to spit back at the whip
If it go down, shorty whole back'll get ripped
And that's low down, real life theatrical shit
So I grabbed shorty hand, took a couple of paces
Said some ""Hail Mary"" maintain my patience
Oh shit, this nigga spit four quick
I threw shorty down and let off the whole clip
Then reloaded but holdin' the whole whip
In broad day, so niggaz done witnessed the whole shit
Had to flee this shit is blasphemy
I took a couple of steps and the nigga blasted me
This nigga Moose got loose from the caboose
Ain't thinkin' about a truce, try to knock my dick loose
My deuce-deuce ain't fuckin' with Moose point forty
I try to save the chick but the nigga done lose shorty
Two to her gut, one to her chest, one to her head
Now shorty layin' puddles of red, fuck it I'm fed
I'm tryna figure was it somethin' I said
That got this dumb nigga bustin' out lead, discussion is dead
I understand this man, he got a cannon in his hand
The sound alone, this shit is bananas
My one plan was to hit him and run fam
But God saved my life, when he made his gun jam
Time to leave but he still tryna squeeze
Instead of tryna buy him some time on his knees
Nigga please, you got no reason to buck up
Knowin' that you 'bout to get shot the fuck up
Duke was brave but his stupid ways
Is the reason why I'm 'bout to twist Duke toupee
And I'ma squeezin' but the gun wouldn't shot no strays
Now we even but the nigga like six two, what would you do?
I'm 'bout to out fox this nigga
Son at one sixty-five, I'ma box this nigga
But what he don't know, Loon 'bout to ox this nigga
Hit him dead in his fuckin neck, when I chop this nigga
But thoughts in my mind, tellin' me let it slide
So I'ma get in my ride and catch Duke another time
Just circle the block smoke a purple of choc
This nigga heart stop, nigga died right on the spot
No bullshit, collapse right on the block
Crackheads went in his slacks, hit him right in his knot
Save me the trouble, now my phone on bubble (they comin' for you)
Feds tappin' my line, like nigga condone the trouble
Walk out my motherfuckin' home is a struggle
Fuck them pigs, I don't own no shovel

What the fuck
Now all that bullshit I done been through with this nigga
I ain't lay a single solitary motherfuckin' hand on this nigga
This nigga drops dead, these motherfuckers is all on my ass
Like I did somethin' to this nigga
Word to my mother, this shit is some real bullshit man
This nigga killed my motherfuckin' bitch
Now I'm runnin' around like motherfuckin' Harrison Ford
Like I'm some motherfuckin' ""Fugitive"" or somethin' man
This is some real bullshit man
But I'ma ride this shit out man

Keep your head up to the sky

Too many problems in my life I find myself unable to maintain
The nigga that was takin over my brain
Redesignin my main frame
Developin so much hatred I feel like fuck all of y'all
And for the slightest disrespect I would gladly touch all of y'all
Dedicated to doing bad and addicted to drama
People think I'm missin manners at home training but I'm just missin my momma
It's like I don't fit in this bullshit world
Surrounded by bullshit boys and bullshit bitches
Better murder they own people before they come up
And that's why I be mean muggin every son of a bitch that walk or run up
I'm paranoid my nigga, I keep one in the chamber
Willing to trade my freedom for life and live among strangers
My goal is to become one hundred and ten years old
I found myself but I can't grow until I find my soul
Stuck on 25 but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it
Receiving hard pain from L.O.V.E., but I'll take it

[Chorus x2]

[Z-Ro]
Dear Cookie I know you looking at ya son from heaven
Totally clean and blessed without ???, drugs, and weapons
Wish I could open up the pearly gates and see your face
But I gotta sinful life momma and I may not get to see that place
I just can't keep my cool, mother fuckers messin with the wrong weapon
I pull out my Jimmy Bone switchblade and start cuttin'
Nigga you ain't never known pain, you don't want this in your ??? vein
Rusty blades make aim cream spread like mayonnaise magn
I can't think of nothin' that ever made me feel like that dro
Not even a woman, cause as quick as she comes she out the do'
Can't put my trust up in Eve, cause she got tricks up her sleeve
All I want to do is live until I'm D.E.A.D.
Of natural causes I don't need nobody knockin' me off
Just let me fall bitch get out the way you blockin' me off
Stuck in the same spot but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it
Disrespected by the people I love, but I'll take it

We was working at the snack bar on my vacation admiration infatuation elation we were kickin it for the whole damn summer
From freinds
To best freinds
To part time lovers
Now you're moving in the first date of September
I can remmember when I saw you back in December
It was so cold outside
You was breakin up
And so was I and
Neither one of us wanted to give love a try
But we would talk, talk, laugh and have a ball
But then we got drunk and fooled around and had a booty call
A booty call
Ain't nuthin wrong with a bootycall
Everybody like a bootycall
Now and then
Sing
I can tell that were gonna be freinds
I can tell that were gonna be freinds

now were getting serious
Living together
We've had our ups and downs
But you know that we'd whether the storm
And if we ever had some fights they always ended up in the
Quiet storm, warm in the bedroom
A lil bit of heat
And alittle bit of spice
But no 2 people got along all the time alright
So lets stick together like the Al Green song
Cause you always do make me fell brand new
And ill always be lovin you my baby boo
And only do I think that your sexy as hell,
But your independent, strong willed, hard workin
And I liked cha
You like to step up to the party and
Get down on the dance floor like nobodys business

Skinny dippin
With me road tripin with me
But know she flippin on me yeah
And I'm gonna tell you that that ain't all

With my eyes on the prize
Just sitting round strummin' guitar
Wasting time.
Now I'm fish in the water
Swimming all the seven seas
Lots of people throw their nets
But they can't catch me
And I know if things go my way
It just a matter of time
So nothing left for me to do
But stay like the altitude and get high, so high.
My fingers sticky like Spiderman,
And here's a quintessential part of my master plan.
Stay blue like the sky
And if my luck changes
It's about that time.
And I know if thing goes my way
It might not be too soon
So nothing left to do but jam
An afternoon on the stoop
While my foot stomps a loop
And the whole world revolves

Problem solved.
And I know that if things go my way
Well it's about that time
So let me rise like the sun
And just shine go for mine.
Rewind and playback another funky hot track
Cause my record consoles
Stacked with ten sides cause I'm like that.
Lemonade I'm drinking
Sinking into this music
Like some country blues,
Ethiopians,
Abyssinians grooves puts me in the state of mind now
I'm zoning.
Check the phone off the hook
And cook some Thai noodles for you

*and I'm going where the summer never ends
Yes I'm going where the summer never ends

And I know if I play my cards right
I'll get some loving tonight
That's why I chilled the wine
And put the glasses on ice
And put the baby boo boo to bed,
Yeah,
Lay your head
And I know if the last summer sun
Sets pink tonight and the stars come out
And the vibes all right
It's just a lil daydream
But I really can't pretend
And I hope someday I find a place
Where summer never ends.

You kept me from buggin
Na na na na... (X4)

Well let me tell you about a girl I met one time
She got the looks and the books gotta make her mine
She told me things that nobody ever told me
And if she taught me well I learned that I loved
All the time we would spend in the night just talking
The morning I would leave her, then I'd come back knocking
For you girl

Always looking for you girl
Always looking for you girl
I got to give it to you
All of my loving
I got to give it to you
All my kissing and hugging
I got to give it to you
Don't you know I got to give it
I got to give it to you
So pretty mema come on with it
And I was all out of luck 
You brought me the jackpot
All out of luck
The kissing and the hugging
On a nervous breakdown
I tell you a little something
I want to thank you babe
You kept me from buggin
Na na na na... (X4)",Give It to You
G. Love,"Well it's a hustle, it's a hustle every day of life, 
And it's enough to keep your head above the water, see.
It seems the older I get the more freedom I have, 
But everything is complicated to me.

Responsibility's parkin?,
Take the stress, oh my god, get off my back before I snap and break.
Know I gots to elevate. Rob my fate. 
Take it to the highest when I'm rhymin'
On the city streets, the rhythms in my freaky sneaks, sneaky freaks, 

Stoppin by the diner 
To recharge my cells. 
Get with the breads, and have a cup of laughs. 
Take a long drive, cause I'm still alive,
And if the pressure didn't get me then, won't get me now.
Stay high as the sky and bust the fuck out.

cause playin' is a hustle, 
Runnin' is a hustle.
Everything's a hustle but love.
Livin' is a hustle when you're workin' every muscle, 
And you're just tryin to keep you head up.
Keep your head up, ohh.

Hah.
Dig.
The music is the thing that always made me high.
And it's the one thing left in life that never told no lies, 
And it's the feeling in my heart 
And the tear in my eye 
And the chill in my spine 
And the freedom on my mind.
And it's the more love that I gave you know it gave me back. 
And if ya ever borrowed something then I paid it back.
But if I ever did you wrong, then forgive me, 
But please don't put no evil on me
Cause I'm just another brother from a father and mother 
Trying to make my way in the world, ya see.

Livin' is a hustle, playin' is a hustle.
Everything's a hustle but love.
Livin' is a hustle when you're workin' every muscle, and you're just tryin' to keep your head up.
Keep your head up, ohh.

Loving Me Lyrics
Artist(Band):G. Love & Special Sauce Review The Song (0)

Will you let me know
If I have done you wrong today?
Cause you won't say nothing to me
And I can't help feeling that you're mad

I can't fight you anymore
I forgot what I'm fighting for
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad

Shall this moment of unsurity pass
Would you speak kind words to me
All that I'm saying is, ""Please treat me nice""
And I promise I won't do no wrong

Ohhh won't you let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad

If you have plans to leave me girl
Won't you just let me know?
Cause you finally got me loving you
And now you wanna let me go

I feel like I could explode
Won't you help to ease the load?
Will you help me understand
How loving me could be so bad



",Loving Me
G. Love,"Well now okay, you want to run me out, run me down
But I heard, you're concerned
Baby that you going down
Gettin' down while I'm gonna roll out of town
Rumors flyin', people lyin'
I'm just tryin', tryin' to keep my head up off the ground
Oh yeah

It's getting harder and harder
I check my pride but you runnin' high
With some other guy and I'm about to die
Tellin' lies, runnin' and cheatin'
And doin' what you please
And no one was surprised
The only thing you need me for is the money

And now I'm so damn confused
Cause even though I paid my dues
Ain't no matter what I do I'm gonna lose
Cause you stone me, stone me, stone me

And now we known each other so long
How we're goin' on and on
I wish I was never gonna be alone
So long, I was dead wrong
Cause you're moving on with your life
Left me in your past, you're past
You're with some other guy
You used to make me high
But now you just stone me
I thought we was in love and now you say
You rollin' holy, left me living lonely
Mmm, what about our son

You have your own child
What you wanna run around
Baby you a wild child
Play on, play on
She get to play on, play on

Then you come a runnin' back
Workin' hard, all alone, too late
Baby I am solo
You hurt me so bad, it took me so long to rise
But baby I survived
Now I don't even wanna see your eyes
You stone me
You hurt me so bad, it took me so long to rise
But baby I survived
Now I don't even wanna see your eyes
You stone me, stone me

Two roses budding in the spring time

we'll be like the rain fallin in the desert

We'll be like two peas in a pod
We'll be of the same mind and god

I don't want to live without you babe.

Standin' on the corner for the end of time
Hangin for some seconds in the soup kitchen line
I'm too tired.

I won't tell you never been too good at talkin' any how

To become the woman that she want to be
I waited five long years, pretty mama
Tell me when you gonna wait for me?

Hmm, mm, mm

Evening dies
My friend rise up to the sunrise
Brand new day
New chance
Some say
If I can make a difference
In this world
Then I may
So I must
So I trust
All my lyrics just bust
Into this new day
Like I was busting a nut
Ohh feels so good
Rising up the ""mornin-ornin"" (morning)
I just got on the radio
It's a positive moment
It's something like
Just the perfect moon
Sonic the waves glaze
For days
In the sunlight haze
I feel good to be alive
All the shit that beat me down
Been doing this
I still survive
It ain't at all complicated
I'm glad I found ya
It's when you open your heart
That love surrounds you

Mmmmmm yeah baby
Mmmmmm aint that right.

I wont live my life
By any rules or regulation
Walk the road less traveled
Stay away from aggravation
As I assure
Like ???
A good time to ride the vibe
So we could all get nice

You want some advice
Stay on the hustle
Do it once
And get it right
I don't just walk
I'll take a hike
'Cause every day's an expedition
I don't just run
I'll take a bike
And put myself into position
Take the car, take a bus, take a train
Rock it with precision
I'm decisive like decision
But yo
I'm only human
And I have my doubts
I wanna know where I fit it
And what this world is all about
It seems when I had my song
That learning was love
Love is what I'm teachin'
So let me show you some

Mmmmmm yeah baby
Mmmmmm aint that right.

Send me sweet kisses darling
I'm a catch them before they fall
Ain't nobody's business
What we do
Ain't nobody's business at all
Ooh not at all
They say that love is all you need to heal your wounds
And not be consumed by the everyday evils the man do
It's just one of those moments that feels too good to be true
When I look in your eyes are you feeling love too?
No fear
No worry
No doubt
No concern
Just the brightest light
And let it burn
I said damn it feels good to hold your hand
Love's the simplest thing
And now I start to understand
It ain't at all complicated
I'm glad I found ya
It's when you open your heart that love surrounds ya
Mmmmmm yeah baby
Mmmmmm ain't that right.
Send me sweet kisses darling
I'm a catch them before they fall

I wonder what you're doing every second that I'm not with you
And now I see what I put you through, I should be gone
Something keep me hanging on
This instinct all this pain I feel don't phase you
It's funny what them drugs will do
And now I'm crying now, how could someone spend so much time so close
And always feel so far away
How could two people stay together so long just because they're afraid to walk away

Won't you let me kick it just one more time
Won't you let me love you and hug you and squeeze you tight
Won't you be my darling tonight
Kiss me one more time before you turn your back forever, now you walking away
Look me in the eye, smile, like you did the very first time I called your name
Tell me everything's gonna be alright, even though I can't stop these tears
For five long years I was afraid to give it all
Now you're gonna leave me and my best friend is gone

So many different towns, 
So many different places and

I'm gonna lean that it's time 
For me to come home

If I could close my eyes for a second and 
Take this moment for my own
Is been comin' and I've been so long 
Yes, it's time for me to come home

And I'm gonna lean that it's time 
For me to come home
Come on home

Li-light rising from the flower, golden'in
Left door comin' from the screen door openin'
Children in the back playing hide and catch me
While the sun is sinkin' in the yard

I'm gonna lean that it's time 
For me to come home
Come on home, come on home

Warm smell comin' from the kitchen cookin' in 
Old folks sittin' on the back porch lookin' for 
The time I get off this train that keeps runnin' me
Far from the place I want to be

And I'm gonna lean that it's time 
For me to come home
Come on home",Home
G. Love,"I got bills to pay, overdue since May 
But paying bills ain't something I'm a do today 
I'd rather write a rhyme about the life I threw away 
Are you the reason that my skies went from blue to gray? 

I wasn't me, love ain't nothing but a four letter word 
When you heard what I did, my bridges were burned 
And now I'm stuck on the wrong side, it's gonna be a long night 
All the fine girls in the world, they don't mean nothing now 

[Chorus] 
'Cause women come and women go 
But for something real, you gotta take it slow 
I ain't too smart, but one thing I know is 
Nobody wanna live alone 
Say you love me one more time 
Say you need me to get by 
Say you love me and I'll be just fine 

[Repeat: x3]
I'll be just fine 

Oh yeah, I'll be just fine if you give me just half of your time 
'Cause your kiss is so delicious like this glass of fine wine 
I'm a drink it up, see I can't get me enough 
And when you're gone, I'll write you letters just to send you my love 

And it ain't cool what I did, but I made a mistake 
Then made a fool of myself when I let your heart break 
I'm laying with this girl, but I don't know her name 
And I don't love her half as much as this guitar that I'm playing 
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]

I'll be just fine when I know that you're mine again 
(I'll be just fine) 
Lets do this thing one more time again 
(I'll be just fine) 
'Cause I'll never feel fly again 
Till we're walking down the street in time again 
(I'll be just fine) 
Won't you throw me a sign again 
(I'll be just fine) 

I'll write your name on my rhyme again 
I'm on a corner and I'm begging for change 
Like a bum out of luck, I'm holding a sign that says

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x6]
I'll be just fine

Oh yeah",Just Fine
G. Love,"Dear Katie, 
I'll miss you when I am on the road 
But I'll write you a letter, 
And I'll seal it with a kiss

I miss holding you, 
In the starry starry night 
But I'll dream of you instead, 
While the moon is shining bright 
I miss you, my Katie Miss 

Dear Katie 
I'll miss you when you so far away 
But I'll write you this song 
So you know my heart won't stray 
I miss you my Katie Miss

And gone is sorely past, 
I'll remember to the days 
That I said would always last

Girl was the type you have dreams about on Sunday afternoon
The kinda girl you see stopping traffic down town on a sunny day in June
It wouldn't be right if I didn't pull up to tell her she looked good
Hey ma you know that your looking kinda fine, maybe you and I should?

Hook up, go out, a few drinks, get down

If you got a man don't crowd my phone

If you got a man don't crowd my phone

She got into my ride, I put it in drive and said, ""I'm gonna take care of you""
She was free for the night with nothing to do even said the time and place
Almost felt too good to be true when I heard my girl say

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Me and my band
All must agree we like to get groovy
With the sounds of the old time
We like to jam cause man
Sounds from the Bandstand
Hand for the cause man
Hang from the old ones
The tones the gear the props and the ride very much in
Chilling outside
Going way back 
From where music really started
I'm a child of the eighties
From where I departed since then I started
A collection of the people
Who started it all
I reckon
I kept them
In my sock like money
Blues music
It's all about rocking the van not rock to roll
Sway to sway
Shocks work out I play
What that fly girl Sabine say
About eight miles to the gallon that's some
Highway sailing
Cool cool lounging
Atlantic City bounding
1920's to the 1970's a stream
Pool solid steady
Getting ready real cool
The earth amp sock hat hi-hat dope
Dobro D'Addario strings for my things
The bass wail sings
Let the rhyme bring
The tense of the time
The old time
Blues music
Blind Lemon Jefferson and juice
B.M.W's the proof frosty Albert Collins bukkha white
Booker T James Brown
Jimmy smith at the console
The soul with the girls Aretha
Chakka Khan the show Solid Gold
Cisco and Sonny Lead Belly too
Peoples that rode with Woody and you Bob Dylan
A million Sears Silvertone guitars
Heard the licks no need to take them nowhere
Blues music
It's like chewing gum with your headphones on
Drinking lemonade
Chilling on the front porch after running ball
Like you lost a twenty dollar bill
You got a free ticket from the scratch and win
Its like the swimsuit issue
Could I get a tissue?
It's like you and your baby got nasty cut off and left alone now making eyes
On the city bus again grandma cooks blueberry pie
Little sister got a boyfriend
It's like smoking the ride
The final right
The vinyl rides

The special find for the special fill
A littel bit on top of but laid back cool
Wind the thread from the tale spun
Back on the spool
Not too blue but azul
Stomping my foot with my sneak
Kicking it for the back beat
Fly girl undressed in the backseat
I might look a sneak
I won't steal a peak
Caught a glance from some good sounds
Don't eat from the Ground Round
Time to get up in a get up
Shake your butt back down
Got more vapors in action
Like Halls Mentholyptus
Misted as I kiced this hold on and I'll twist it

Should've stayed home
Poor child coming gonna be a rolling stone

Catch the Cool-Aid kid I'm all hogging it
Earl's got the 64 wet cause he sloshed it
Christmas time comes I'm egg nogging it
Look the crook snook a hand in your pocket
Took your keys then he took your wallet
But you in your eyes then your head he clocked it
All you could say was stop it
Fuck you and die
Get away from my piece of the pie
I'm past all that
My eyes have miles
Not necessarily clever
I bring from the soul hold my vocal
Handle for a hold as I walk direct
I roll for the old
Never be sold out
Cause the sell won't gel
I told you my clams inthe shells
Already I don't sweating
Just chill cuddy
Celebrating
It's those doggone kids ever since
They was born the shining
No musically reweriting the phrase
Relighting the page as the joker pays
For the dare on the outside
Just chops I ain't impressed
The licks are removed I just can't digest
It's too artificial man
I can't dig it I don't want affects
So I say so on and Imma go on
To the real next all wood tones

I tumble with direction a reflection

Summer with sunrays
While sunshine blazed
My eyes were kind of glazed
To put some cream in my coffee
I'm making a call
Cooling by the fence of the street
With the sex stalls
So many freaks geeks rats
Cool cats and fat girls
I'm that kid lounging in my own world

Dig daydreaming firl
I think she's a dancer
I'd like to catch the ho-show
But my visit was cancelled
I was hungry my takeout had been fixing
Ordered fried rice eggroll wonton and big chicken
Then I went to meet the mac lil'
Cool elixing drinking tipping wine from the bottle
Models fly girls with sauce
Buns who are lost
More garbage that's tossed
From the doors and windows
Roof tops and building
25 cents a show

Lyrics:

The things that I used to do
Lord I just won't do no more.
The things that I used to do
Lord I just won't do no more.
I use to sit up and hold your hand baby,
And cry... oh baby please do not go.

I would search all night for ya darlin
Lord knows my search would always be in vain
I would search all night for ya darlin
Lord knows my search would always be in vain
But I knew all along, that you was hid out with
Your other man.

I will send you back to your mother babe
Lord know I'll go back to my family too.
I will send you back to your mother babe
Lord know I'll go back to my family too.
Ain't nuthin I do will please ya girl,
Lord knows I just can't get along with you.





Never do them no more baby

Things that I used to do

I ain't never gonna do them no more


Used to bother you around

Tears in my eye, low to the ground

Try and get slower, we been nowhere

You would leave me

Like twinkle soul

Is where to go

Baby you and me

Get with the roll

Here's a love song yeah

And I'm gonna sing it to you so slow

In your eardrum getting ready

All night long I rock steady

Always glowing like rudolphs nose at

Christmas time

Sure to glowin

Shining, undermining,

In your veins all in your mind

Upside you brain

Knock down deliver like hot tamales

I start to simmer


Things that I used to do

I ain't never gonna umm do them no

More

Things that I used to do...yeah

Never ever gonna do them no more


Used to bother you around

Tears in my eye, sinkin low to the ground

Lower than the ocean, swimmin in the

Sea

Like I m a sword fish, check me

Baby shinin all night long

Just to get some


The things the house man used to do

Never ever gonna do them no more

Yeah the thing that the marshmellow

That man didn't eat but he goes to sleep
Gets up at dawn not to see the sunrise
But because it's too damn cold outside
Underneath the bridge they pump the city's bilge
Into the alley they sweet the city's filth
The flowers wilt the flowers wilt
Don't tell me about no game
Cause that is a man
And his family
Revolution family
Look at the family
Dig the family
They're living the wrong way
Can't get nothing
Don't get nothing all they wanted was
Something like a job, mercy mercy
But its robbed, mercy mercy
And there's so many street side
Beggars and disabled veterans
Glass-eyed and peddling
Drunk and just meddling
So you conclude it's their fault
They like the street they must like the asphalt
But that is man woman and children
The system has stalled shelter's home
That's not what I call it
I call it bad health
Some say help themselves
Yo if you you gots it
Everyone hundred people a dollar in change
Everyone hundred people a dollar in change
This ain't living
This ain't living
Oh no
You know it's rough, had enough fo holding a
Cup full of spare change
The doctor diagnosed me as a
Dome full of bad brains
So, toe to toe with employers
Cause they're telling me no
Hooked on prescription drugs
So I stay broke, I'd run away
But you can't run away from
Yourself or your health so
I deal with the cards that I'm dealt
Tweet-a-leet-leet
This morning bird sounding sweet
Though I sleep on the streets
I have a feeling I'm free
From society's hand picked hypocrisy
Mercy mercy don't give a damn for me
Mercy mercy now what am I going to eat
Peek through the windows of the restaurant
People eating caviar fifth bucks on lunch
A hand-me-down meal
Full of God knows what
Put it away in my gut
Quick and then I wonder
Why I'm sick, brick for brick
I know the city like my hand print
Just a pit in the gutter
Of a skid-row ditch
But I'll survive the pain
Let me know I'm alive
But I still feel that
This ain't living
Check my beat dig they rhythm
Me belly full but me hungry so I fill it
Once I start gaining taxes start taking
Cause the governments perfected funk faking
Breaking me down striking me down
What goes around comes around but
I keep rising seeing through the lies and
The surprise comes when I see myself
The music I felt
I'm on
This ain't living
This ain't living
Oh no",This Ain't Living
G. Love & Special Sauce,"I may had forgot that
But it seems I'm here to stay new
Town to town
Room to room
Room to move
Time to lose in my room
Or call to telephone my baby's house
She ain't never home
Ain't there ain't nowhere
She lets it ring
I keep thinking to home

Of thinking for home
I keep talking
Just for talking

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Spring has sprung cause all it does is rain
Again outisde is dull walls as dull drive
The sea has called fog from the waters
City screams for suns and daughters
Owned by the nights
But they ain't all of that
Tainted cats freaks to roll
Cool in the packs
I'm in the basement mixing
Tripping off my lips and
Elixing my mind with the nightlife
Spring comes misting
Drunk and listening to AM radio
Remembering pump up the volume cause
I know I got it
The soul of speakers thought
I shed skins of old
When I'm taught by the older
Records that I caught I get fat
In my pad I'm not bad
Not smiling passing for time to take a while
Wasting from the wild as I walk to slide
I bring from inside from the center
Epicenter radius oval roll you smooth you
Mold you, I'm like that
Moon to sun to start this seed
Water drip drop drip drop
Your boggie ball your rubber ball
The smooth of a weathered wall
The cycles of the systems
The circles within them
I walk to slide
Walk the slide on the outside
Walk the mile on the in
Keep it clouds on the outside
Keep it cool on the in
Lost in the spin
The face folds to melt the mask
It's hard to get help when
You're coming from the down low
Growing to know the smooth
In change
I walk to slide
From the tombs I got tunes
Like the spoonful
House to groove French to groove
The falling sun
We've had our fun
The sunset came to still
Stays the same

I can remember a spring just like this
I was 19 yrs. old
Now the time is sorely missed
The first year that I left my mother's house
Out to make my way in this world somehow

I can't believe how the times they have changed
All the dreams that came true still seem so far away
I remember the days sittin' on the front porch with
The sun beatin' down in my neighborhood

I'd sit out all night singin' songs to the moon
Or try and get some sweet honey back to my bedroom

My friends they were few but to me they were true
All we was trying to do was just to make it through
Always thought for the future, but we shouldn't have cared
All the best things in life we shared them right there

So to all those old friend God be with them
I wish, I wish I could see you again
In the same corner bar where it all started from
Dig your plow so deep now the stars have all gone
So wherever they shine may it be warm and bright
Out to ease my mind on this worried night
It all seemed so simple and good tidings I send
I'll never forget that one year that we spent
",When We Meet Again
G. Love & Special Sauce,"Let me be your weeping willow tree
Surround you with my long limbs
My dear, let me grow in the shade
In the sands by the bank of your river
Let I drink from your streams
The cool breeze fill my leaves

We will sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
Sweet river caress how softly
Stir my searching roots
Shading the sun in the summers heat
Let I cool you
We have been dancing so long
In the winters freeze and the summers drought
We survive
We belong
Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was your weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

We can sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

",Willow Tree
G. Love & Special Sauce,"Yo, it's a black thing
Yo, it's a white thing
If we talk this teach
We say the wrong thing
Blackness is blackkness
Whiteness is whiteness
Despite this why
We have to fight between us
Nothing to discuss
On the back of the bus
But a cold stare
Avoiding contact
Oblivious to others
This is the social contract
Lack of sensitivity
Lack of sinsibility
Lack of the notion
For better compatibility
I don't fron tnothing
I am what I am
I do what I can
I nod or I shake your hand
For a greeting
That's the common and pleasing
All right, my man,
Yeah, it's that easy

Yeah, it's that easy
As easy as pie
That shit goes on forever
So make a conscious try
To improve, nothing to lose
But a free ride on
Some old news
Your pop says, your ma says
But their values could be old news
Not knowing the truth
Blaming their troubles
Some problems in the jungle
On certain races
And faces
But I say yo sit
Just because
They're different
You didn't lose your job to
Some immigrant
You lost employment
From corporate exploitment
Packing up to cash out on
Mexico's mint
Stint your vision
Stunt your growth
It ain't a land to boast about
'cause it raised you
Left you in a daze of
The vision contrt
Sacrificing many for the
Rich man's comfort

The clouding, the cover-ups,
The myths, and
The scandals
These are the ones
That destroyed america
So don't you see hysteria
I remove with incision
Pinpointing facts
Pinpoint precision
It ain't your fault
Or mine on the back of the trolley
We're just people living
Trying to find quality
Not cold and windy
Yes cool and breezy
All right, my brother

Yeah, it's that easy

Yo, you and me used to run ball in the league
We ran the championship team
The best they had seen
But so much to talk about
Now that we've grown
We've been in different scenes
Of a different act
And in the fact we sold out
To the social contract
Meaning we don't hang
And even worse than that
I heard your boys
Fought my boys
With baseball bats
And bats lead to ax
And ax lead to gun
And gun lead to mothers
Losing their sons
I live how I live
I ain't asking you to try it
The problem's too big
To fit me to buy it
The weight is too heavy
The length is too long
Slowing down the everybody get along
If the teachers were to teach
Would you listen to the sensei
Goodnight my brother
Yeah, it's that easy
","Yeah, It's That Easy"
G. Love & Special Sauce,"You keep takingand taxing
Faking and I can't relaxing
You're making me way too uptight
When you push and fight
Pull and funk your way to the front
You think I'm on stage to pull a stunt
I'm amazed by your capacity
At winding me up
So that I can't release you see
You see me backstage
And engage me in your rhythm
My head is swimming
This place is filled with smoke and women
You told me that the music couldn't be much phatter
I said I got a girlfriend
You said it didn't matter
She started pressing up
And I was getting kinda heated
The pressure's building up
And release is what I needed
She's begging and pleading
Begging and pleading
I'm pressed against the wall
Like a piece of graffitti
She needs me, she needs me, she-needs-me

Could you do it for free?
Could you do it for me?
Could you do it for free?
Could you do it for me?

Late last night I had a crazy vision
I was on stage on my musical mission
Aiming at love of a godly kind
Til love's light shone out
Nearly making me blind
I've heard of flying doves
Birds of a feather
I've heard of loving lace
I've heard of loving leather
I've heard of loving one night
And writing love letters
The way I love this girl
I could never forget her
Sometimes lovers wait
Sometimes I want to get her
Sometimes love is worse
Sometimes love is better
I've heard of love passing
And I've heard of love severed
The way I love this girl
I'm gonna love her forever

Could you do it for free?
Could you do it for me?
Could you do it for free?
Could you do it for me?

I had a feeling of hunger
When I first met your eyes
There is no surprise
I can feel you over years
And many miles
Though separations occur
It's all part of life
Some people wait forever
Some never wait a night
You have to give it time babe
Please let love breathe
You're the one I desire
I'm the one that you need
Our love will be complete
Just like a seed that's planted
The loving comes strong
I hope that you can stand it
I never planned that it would work out this way
So when the sun rises please don't leave me babe
I could love you forever tonight
",Do It for Free
G. Love & Special Sauce,"I saw you at the bar
I was laughing with some friends
I saw you turn your head
I was checking you instead
I asked you if you would like to dance
I really wasn't trying to get into your pants
Not to say that you're not a beautiful young lady
But I drive a chevy nova
And I thought you liked mercedes
Soon enough though
We were allured
Bumping and grinding out on the dance floor
With the system so loud
The vibrations so pulsing
You whispered in my ear
But I couldn't hear nothing
Steered me over in the corner
And kissed me on the neck
That's when I decided ok what the heck
I put my hands on your hips
And I kissed you right back
You kissed me like a shark
That's sniffing on a snack
And then you said ""my boyfriend never kissed me like that""
I said ""boyfriend"" you didn't say he was around
On this Friday Friday night
When I came and rocked your town

On this Friday night
When the feeling's alright
Rockin rock steady grooves
In the middle of the night
Everything is heated up
And nobody's standing still
With my arm around my girl
And a hundred dollar bill

The song was over
So we headed for a drink
And whatta you think
She gave another guy a wink
Who came over for a kiss
And asked the girl ""who's this? ""
She said ""that's g. love you know g. and special sauce? ""
Then he said ""I'm getting louie kid you better get lost""
I asked the girl ""who's louie? ""
And she said ""that's my man""
Women women I just can't understand
Then I says ""I don't want to hear about girl problems
And if you got a problem babydoll I can solve them""
But I feel you're gonna get me in trouble
So c'mon let's leave this bar
And go out clubbing on the double
Girl's putting me in a trance
All because she wants to dance
And get down with the man
Who brought the sound
On this Friday Friday night
When I came and rocked your town

On this Friday night
When the feeling's alright
Rockin rock steady grooves
In the middle of the night
Everything is heated up
And nobody's standing still
I'm chilling with my girl
And a hundred dollar bill

I can just tell
A girl like you's a deadend
Pressing up against me
Talking about I got a boyfriend
Now here he comes looking for you
On the dance floor
While you're pusing on my knee
Talkin' 'bout I love you more
I'm new in town
Bout I'm no stranger to this
I'm not trying to exit
With a hit and run fix
I get my lvoing on the run
And I like having fun
But I don't sneak around
And I don't gotta gun
Now give me three steps
Like the boy lynyrd skynrd
There's more drama in this room
Than a soap so I figured
Maybe I'll get your digits
And maybe I will call
And maybe we'll slip
Into the backroom down the hall
Or maybe I'll get jacked up
By your angry boyfriend louie
'cause his eyes are getting redder
While his anger's busy stewing on the fire
The little trick in your brought out
On this Friday Friday night
When I came and rocked your town

On this Friday night
Everything is alright
Rock steady grooves
In the middle of the night
Everything is heated up
And nobody's standing still

And a hundred dollar bill

I could wait that long, but I don't think I might
Come on, give me love in the morning light

Need your attention to get me started right

I'm going to wake you up with a kiss on the cheek

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Baby we've been through a lot
And times sure have changed
Everybody's leaving town
Looking for better things
But I found what I want
And I got no problem working
I wish to god
That my heart would stop hurting
Shops closing down
Factories outdated
People so frustrated
My whole life is changing
Just trying to find some solid ground
A little house with a picket fence
How's that sound

Love is all I need
Love is all I need

I've seen tears that are
Falling like leaves from the trees
Houses boarded up and they
Threw away the keys
But this town is where we're born
And this town is where we're staying
I'll never ever turn my back
On you ever again
Come on let's be together
I got some money put aside
And if I make it big
Would you take a little ride
Would you promise to always
Stay by my side
Woudl you give me true love
And have nothing to hide
Would you give my your love
Would you give me your love
Would you give me your love
If you want to give me your love babe

It's alright
It's alright
We can make a change in our life babe

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Praise god, for it was written in numbers
Soon you'll know of the great joy we feel
Today day to be able to speak freely
And talk eye to eye
With a small group of americans
We feel that the time has come
For your nation to awaken
To it's true spiritual import
And we wish you everything in our power
To that realization

Four mourning doves searching in the park
Saying don't be confused when the night is dark
Eleven white swans swimming in a black lake
Told me keep it real and you'll find who's fake
Two cedar trees half submerged in the water
Don't prophesize about sons and daughters
One new master of the form tai chi
Friends of the accuser and the accusee
One pimp using songs as his hussy
Won't be here next year to tell you 'bout nothing
Two happy kids playing basketball
Til a war broke out and killed them all
A bunch of ideas like fireflies
An eighteen-year-old girl with stars in her eyes
We saw the gentle trickster on the highway tonight
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes open wide

Though the roof may leak in many places
Shining faces shining faces
May she sleep in peace
And wake up in my arms
Some day soon some day soon
Some day soon some day soon

The separation from unity
Is the descent of the angels upon the ladder of consciousness
The return to unity is the ascent of the angels upon the ladder
The descent is good
But the unity that comes is expressed diversity
But in diversity there would be no concept of separation

Those that were numbered
Had a path to follow
Fly as swift as the swallow
Where no enemies can follow
The path that was laid for the righteous man
Don't promote the fool
Claiming he's the wisest man
As they slander our name in shame
When our aim is to do what comes natural
We're hatchin' the fireflies on a river
Feelin' straght from my toes, knees, kidneys to my liver
Clouds drop down the dew
My friends what about you
Clouds drop down the dew
My friends what about you

Though the roof may leak in many places
Shining faces shining faces
May she sleep in peace
And wake up in my arms
Some day soon some day soon
Some day soon some day soon
Though the roof may leak in many places
Shining faces shining faces
May she sleep in peace
And wake up in my arms
Some day soon some day soon
Some day soon some day soon

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Let's all just relax
And get into this groove
The room's starting to move
Now turn the red lights on
You know the kind that I like
Deep blues and reds
With purple highlights

But don't forget my oohhs
And fade in my ahhs

Fade out the parades
And the charades
Making music like love is made
And lovers wait patiently
And with joy
For the right moment
To explor in passion
Why everlasting love is everlasting

But don't forget my oohhs
And fade in my ahhs

Ther's no need to argue for better position
Realize the moment that you're in is magic
Stellare regions cry everything has it's season
Everything happens for a reason
So who are we to worry at any rate
The plane that crashed
We missed 'cause we were running late
And if success eludes you
Then you must choose to do
What other people wouldn't do

But don't forget my oohhs
And fade in my ahhs

So as cold night fades into darkness
Harken to the fire
Where you may find some peace
As many people pass
Some good and some bad
But this fire glows stronger yet
And burning bright reminds us

To ever be reborn
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon

Back to the rappers
A lot of people stake claims
Saying hip hop doesn't matter

But really what could be phatter than
Jungle J.B's beats and streetside sounds
Profound are the sounds
That i was hearing

When at the basketball league
This kid said ""Yo come here and
Put these head phones on your ears""
I was converted then

And practiced it for years
Rap music, like Jazz, Funk and R&B
Blues Reggae Rock n' Roll, and rock steady G.

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Everyone starts with the sweetest dreams
Living long life living beautiful scenes
Make a million dollars wearing gold and jewels
Drive a big black Benz or a Caribbean cruise
Or maybe you dream that you just can't lose
Or playing blues is the path that you choose
Or perhaps your dream of going back to nature's plan
And just live off the land and be a natural man
Or of a beautiful girl who's holding your hand
Loving the one you're with, with her beautiful tan
Like you're holding the riff that laying in your hand
Or you dream of playing band from electric lady land
Riffs just like Jimi Hendrix

Are you feeling the feeling that I'm feeling

Are you feeling the feeling that I'm feeling

""stop daydreaming!""
That's what my teachers used to say
While they kick a bunch of crap that I forgot anyway
Educatin's important to make a man complete
But everything I learned in school
I learned again on the street
Now my time is booked cause I've got the look
And when I walk on my path
You know I can't be shook
Stay alert in this day you have to go for yours
The force conspires to help brothers
That help others open doors
Wars and battles, rage round us everyday
While the real troops keep our heads up while we play
This game of chance that they busy calling life
Can be quite a disappointing ride
You can't blame the youth and you can't blame god
Now who you gonna blame when the dogs in the yard

Higher than the liars melting in the fire
How high can you ride?
The greatest victory it was
When we believe in legends getting busy like the man
They call ""school's in session"" addressing all you people
Like I know who you are 'cause streets are universal and the world is wide
But no matter what you're running from you just can't hide
If you seek the truth, the truest kid you'll find

I'm not falling in love, rather I'm standing
She's not demanding

And lets me be a man
I must be in love 'cause that's how I feel
Butterflies in my stomach when
You whisper in my ear
My life's been a rollercoaster up and down
Could it be I found the one that makes my heart sing
Pound for pound.

I rubbed the bottle and I found my genie

And if that is a sin father forgive me what I do

Mind games, injustice everyday
I'm so glad I found the one
To take me away from the world when my day is done
My fantasy is my reality that's how it's gonna be
She makes me fly so free that's my philosophy
Everlasting love for everlasting G

Meaning love is universal this love is not blind
She knows what I am thinking 'cause
She can read my mindits time to stop fooling around
'cauase when she calls me by name
That's a beautiful sound
She lets me know that I still got game

But I love her just the same and I'm not ashamed
To be graced by her presence

I praise her like I praise the heavens

And your eyes, everlasting shades of blue

Rolling down hills and climbing

I grab the tab snap the cap pop the top

When I start with much heart

This world seems numb blind deaf and dumb

There's many ways to be living

But your only living once

From satellite tvs we see right overseas

In the eyes of the refugees but we're blind to their pleas

Falling down like leaves no one feels what they see

It ain't me it's just a special on your cable tv



It makes you feel so removed

But you got to free your mind

Come alive in the nick of time

¡®cause if you didn't

You might end up suck a waist

And that would make you be another

One of those hopeless case



I made plenty of friends

And I thought they were true

But at the end of the day

Do what you got to do

You came in this world alone

And that's how you're gonna leave

You better walk with some love in your heart

You best believe

No man is an island to stand alone



It makes you feel so removed

But you got ot free your mind

Come alive in the nick of time

¡®cause if you don't

You might end up sucha waste

And that would make you another

And your eyes, everlasting shades of blue

Rolling down hills and climbing

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Oh snap
My plans come undone
I'm free falling, darling in the rising sun
Brushing on your cheek 
Shining steady through the blinds
I thought I told myself
I would take my time
I sure I said I wasn't ready
She said, she wasn't looking
It's not my fault
That she's so good looking
But she took her time
But I was holding onto the single life
I'm plain available
She said, she's emotionally unavailable
But that means
I'm down with that
She kick the cat out, kid
So I didn't call her back

[Chorus: ]
Castles burning thorough the sky
Shift to shake
And I know why
They say life is what happens
When you're busy making plans
(?)
You and I were meant for each other
And we're going to stick together
When the world starts to crumble
Hey yea, let me hear you say
Hey yea, (you can fall on me)
Hey yea, let me here you say
Hey yea, (you can fall on me)

Two weeks past and I still didn't call
But your name was in my brain
Like graffiti on the train
I didn't mean to buck you out
But I didn't have your number
I saw you on the bus
And you were chilling with some other guy
I was like, damn, I was jealous
But you gave me a look
And your smile's the same
And then three hours later
My phone did ring
And it was you telling me
Would I like to chill
At this corner bar
On the block that was real laid back
And I'm like 'yeah it's on'

[Chorus: ]

When no one knows what tomorrow will bring
But you can fall back on me when you can't win
This world is moving faster, tougher everyday
Oh baby just take a deep breath and 
Let your troubles all fade away

I showed up late 
That really teed her off
We couldn't agree on much
But the vibes was strong
Basically, I fell in love with those big green eyes
You could say what you want
'Cause I was mesmerized
Now three years later
And the feeling so fresh
We stick together
Sunshine, stormy weather

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Way down south in Georgia
Close to Augusta GA
Down where the peach trees grow
Where Elvis Presley used to stay
On the Friday night
When the sun was low
And the house was warm and bright
I'd pick up that guitar and start play
And everything's alright
Talkin' 'bout...

Hey, hey, hey
Hey Georgia
Hey, hey, hey
Hey Georgia

We would dance to the music
Get that 6 string way
And everybody in the house was gettin' along
Oh on serenade
You never seen somebody 
So sweet and dirty all in one
I've never seen the peaches kiss
So ripe, that's what I want

Going down, going down
Going down, Miss Georgia Brown

Well Georgia Brown was a dreamer
Oh what a pity
So she jumped on a Greyhound bus
And headed straight for New York City
The big city was rough and tough
It almost beat her down
She got the gig, she rocked the crowd
She's the talk of the town
Now we're singing 'bout...

[Chorus: ] Everybody sing about

Going down, going down
Going down, Miss Georgia Brown

Hey, hey, Georgia
Do you still remember me
I've been sitting on the front porch
Just waiting to see
Your big old bus comes rollin'
Right around the bend
You need to jump right out
Into my arms 
We can play that funk again

G. Love & Special Sauce,"Chilling out on a ridge, by the sea, in a ranchido
Cool breeze through the trees sings a song so sweet
For my baby and my boo boo
Asleep they lay
So I picked up my guitar and then I start to play
The music was pulsing blood up to my eyes
I surmised the horizon, sun rising, surprising the hell out
Of the clouds
Like they were kissed for the first time.
The sun was steady rising and I'm sitting in the sunshine

I hear my baby crying and he's just waking up
So I walk through the screen door and I go pick him up
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka back and forth
Baby quit crying then I'll go and play some more

[Chorus: ]
Soft and sweet melodies while your momma's sleeping
Let her sleep in late this morning
Let her sleep 'til the sun is burning down
Burning down down down

Baby baby hold my fingers with your little tiny hands
While we lounge in a hammock checking out all the land
I smell the sweet scents of papaya and lime
I smell the ocean breezes, the salt
And my mind is captivated by your big brown eyes
Which remind me of mine
Now I know we're two of a kind
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka back and forth
Baby quit crying then I'll go and play some more

[Chorus: ]

The day is getting brighter and the wind is breezing down
The whole tree is shaking, fallen fruit is on the ground

Now's it's time I put my foot on down
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same
No, no

Well they say that love is all you need
To heal the world
Plus a trillion billion dollars
Have you heard
That President Bush, Santa Claus and Green Goblin
Sadam Hussein, Spiderman and Bin Laden
Britney Spears, Jesus and the whole cast of Friends
Met for brunch last week
To solve the world's problems
Would've called on me
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same

Well if they called on my name
Don't you know I'd do it
Shine my signal all over Gotham
I'd be true
It's my distinct pleasure
To come down from my grass
Get off my front porch
And save your asses
And in the nick of time
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same

Well change has come over me
My muscles blown
So I freestyled my ass across the U.S.A.
Solve the economy, the homeless problem
Save what's left of the environment
Create jobs, for everybody to be doing something
They want to be doing
Yeah

But if you can't do smack
Then you better do something
'Cause this is the time
When you so can't do nothing
That means you and you and you and you
And me too

Then I fly overseas
And set all the slaves free
From prostitution, sweat shop, child labor
South America, the problems in the Middle East
Make a sun power car
We don't have to fight in oil fields
I'll take all the troops back
From wherever they roam
And wherever their fightin'
And whatever side their on
And I'll send on the first plane
Home to their moms
And we could make coffee tables
Out of all these bombs
And save the whales
And the pygmy marmosets too 

Oh baby

Well all this seems kinda hard
But it really ain't nothin'
All you got to do is
Get bit by a spider or something
We could change the world
In a week or a day
And if you got problems
Man, I sweep 'em away
You find yourself in a world full of trouble
Just call on G. Love

Here they come, walking down the street, big and bouncy look so neat.

No-one could understand.
Each night he'd go out shooting skag,
Met a pusher who sold him a bag.

That's why he was 
Dead on arrival 

Ran out of money so he stole a car,
Tried to run but didn't get far.
Sent to prison, no turning back,
Saw his arm, weaned him off smack.

Out on parole tried to keep calm,
Finally died with a needle in his arm.

G.B.H.,"Lycanthropy is in his blood,
And spreads to those he slays.
Uncontrolled metamorphosis,
Undetectable by day.
But when the moon is waxing,
And all the world's asleep.
Through woods and fields,
The werewolf he will creep.

Even a man who is pure heart,
And says his prayers at night ..
Can become a werewolf when the wolfsbane blooms,
And the Autumn moon is bright.

He instinctively seeks to kill,
The thing he loves the best.
He'll bare his teeth, growl and snarl,
And wish upon you death.

His suffused eyes will glare in hate,
Silver-grey hair will shine.
He'll grip you in his muscular arms,
And on your your flesh will dine.

A Marfisa flower is a start.
Silver topped cane, a crucifix,
A silver bullet through the heart.

Do you want to see this country bleed?
Stuck in a rut full of rot
complaining about things you haven't got

But no-one hears you when you start to moan

That man is not guilty you don't give a toss.
Pull the lever, watch him swing,

As the people you kill in the government's name.
Slip on the hood, open the hatch,

But how could they stop me with this magnum in my hand ?

Just a kid now he always will be.
Gunned down gunned down.
Fell like a stone in a war of his own.

It can blow a hole in a steel door it can blow a hole in you.
It can blow the guts out of any cop, but then what would I do ?

The blood is spilt it burns my eyes a pain I cannot bear.
I'm lying in the gutter crying in despair.

So I've failed in my quest of crime my one and only vice.
Gunned down by a sniper, for trying to improve my life.




",Gunned Down
G.B.H.,"The adrenaline flows as the shadow grows.

Heavy discipline, no one should be listening.

You'll get a gut feeling as they send you reeling.
You'll feel the heat as they knock you off your feet.

There's no escape .. from this social rape.
You've gotta pay, being young today.

So the pressure's on and the freedom's gone.
The line gets thin with all this discipline.




",Heavy Discipline
G.B.H.,"They shocked the world cause they wanted to live.
They had no food, no alternative.
Lost in the snow weak in the mind.
Starving and cold ate their own kind.

Had no choice, lost and alone.
Eat the flesh, spit out the bone.

Malnutrition was setting in.
They needed protein and a will to win.
Cannibalism the only way ..
The logical answer to live another day.

No sign of help coming from the sky.
How much longer can they survive ..
With only human flesh to keep them alive ?

There's no one up there there never was.
Only in vain is there a god.
There's too much suffering for him to be ..
An almighty power, a heavenly being.

My god, your god, whose god, there is no god ?

The fabric of prophet's ages old.
Drones on and gathers mould.
Gets a weekly airing from a fool on high.
Who talks and talks till his throat's dry.

A fund for a roof with a hole.
It's the money they'll save not your soul.
Persistent begging from men of the cloth.
Refuse his offer and see his wrath.

See fields and barns float up.

Got us in his evil eye.

Bats are flying high but, the owls don't give a hoot,
No birds singin', seems the whole world's mute.
The slightest noise, echoes through the streets,
Slumber-lands bounce, to a tiny heartbeat.

Walls of old houses, still creak after all this time,
Explanations don't contain no reason or rhyme.
The moon stays awake with ease,
Bangin' car doors are annoying me.
The rain is coming down, started to lash,
And I'm waiting for the glass to smash.

Empty cans rattle just like skeleton shakes,
To live by night is a chance I take.
Seedy streetlamps spill, a pool of white light,
Banshee screams of another cat fight.

G.B.H.,"He'll be buzzing in your head, when you're long gone.
Fever burning, stomach churning he can take you on.

Maniac, he's a maniac and he's on the loose.

A wild eyed maniac seeks you out, he wanted some revenge.
A man obsessed, a man possessed he'll get you in the end.

He can read all your thoughts so don't run for cover.
There's aftermath in his path, he's gonna maim another.

Your face will turn a ghostly white as he comes into view.
To slice you up is not enough, he must disfigure you.

He's wicked as sin, his mind is narled
He's got plenty but he doesn't share
And to ask for help they wouldn't dare
A wall heath man with wife to keep
Did his duty and stole a sheep
Refused to grovel he refused to beg

Four men died today, someone's gotta pay.
Why did four men die today ?
The culprits can't be found, they're hiding underground.
Why did four men die today ?

Hoboes and underdogs strike a new chord, they're sick and tired of acting bored.
Legions of damned citizens try, while all around the rotting die.
Concerned committees study and gen, the final word from Number Ten.

There's dead bodies all around, you're told to carry on.
Death is not right, war cannot be won.

March along you see a flash,
fall to the ground and make a splash.
You awake you're lying in the bed,
eyes are shut you think you're dead.
Lost your arm, you've lost your leg,
lost you're job, you'll have to beg.
You'll get loads of sympathy, a picture in the Evening Post.
But where were the generals when you needed them most ?",Generals [DVD]

When you can't resist its call
I got you in my crosshairs
Waiting for the sting
You know what they say
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing

Firewall round my heart
Stereo set to stun
You're pushing against a locked door
You're just a dead man walking

Reality is death and blood
Not a Che Guevara poster

It's pointing at you the invisible gun
Do you put your hands up or turn and run
Pointing at your children the invisible gun
Draw a line in the sand while you still can

The cruel lead the weak
It's the bigotry of religion
No questions ever asked
And no quarter ever given
You know every trick
You cover all the angles
But you're easily offended
By a vulgar display of ankles

You've heard some frightening news on the radio, 
about little boys running away from home,
And the parents don't see them no more.
You wanna stop to hitch a ride, I know,
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go.
 
Streets are dark and deserted, not a sound nor sign of life.
How you long to hear your mother's voice, 'cause you're lost and alone.

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water

And the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough of this life
Well, hang on

When your day is night alone

When you think you've had too much of this life
Well, hang on

Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the Holy Lamb of God

And did the Countenance Divine,
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?

Among those dark Satanic mills?

Bring me my arrows of desire!
Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my Chariot of Fire!

To the seat with the clearest view

G4,"Regrets, I've had a few;
But then again, too few to mention.
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption.
I planned each charted course;
Each careful step along the byway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it my way.
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew.
And through it all, when there was doubt,
I ate it up and spat it out.
I faced it all and I stood tall;
And did it my way.
I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
I've had my fill; my share of losing.
And now, as tears subside,
I find it all so amusing.
To think I did all that;
And may I say - not in a shy way,
Oh no, oh no not me,
I did it my way.
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.
To say the things he truly feels;
And not the words of one who kneels.
The record shows I took the blows -
And did it my way!",My Way

Il nome mio nessun sapra!
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo diro,
Quando la luce splendera!
Ed il mio bacio sciogliera
Il silenzio che ti fa mia!

In your virginal room,
Watch the stars
Trembling with love and hope!

But my secret lies hidden within me,
No one shall discover my name!
Oh no, I will reveal it only on your lips
When daylight shines forth!
And my kiss shall break
The silence that makes you mine!

Nobody will discover his name
And we shall have to die, alas! Die!

Depart, o night! Set, you stars!
Set, you stars! At dawn I shall win!

Maybe you're still here
I feel you all around me
Your memories so clear

Deep in the stillness
I can hear you speak
You're still an inspiration

Can it be that you are mine?
Forever love
And you are watching over me from up above

Fly me up to where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight
To see you smile

If only for a while
To know you're there
A breath away's not far
To where you are

Are you gently sleeping
Here inside my dream?
And isn't faith believing
All power can't be seen?

As my heart holds you
Just one beat away
I cherish all you gave me everyday

'Cause you are mine
Forever love
Watching me from up above

And I believe
That angels breathe
And that love will live on and never leave

Fly me up
To where you are
Beyond the distant star
I wish upon tonight
To see you smile

And the warm winds (and the warm winds)
That embrace me (that embrace me)

And cold day light buys the pride I'd rather sell

Thinking of my going
How to cut the thread
And leave it all behind
Looking windward for my compass
I take each day as it arrives
But these miss you nights
Are the longest

It's only me who's killing time

O homem tem que ser durão
Se ela não chegar agora
Não precisa chegar

Mas eu vou me embora
Vou ler o meu Pasquim
Se ela chega e não me vê
Sai correndo atrás de mim

Mas eu vou me embora
Vou ler o meu Pasquim
Se ela chega e não me vê
Sai correndo atrás de mim",Coqueiro Verde

Gabe Dixon,"There's a corner cafe
It stays open all the night
I went inside to escape the world
It's my favorite place to hide

Old man in the corner
Been complaining about the cold
Put on your smile and coat
Your mind doesn't have to grow old

Tell 'em that it's raining inside my head again
Look at us we're struggling to make this life begin
Tell 'em I'll be waiting for that sunny day
Look at me I'm struggling, I just can't find my way

In the meantime I'll be waiting,
Hoping for a sign
Share a cup with me my lover
You always ease my mind

Tell 'em that it's raining inside my head again
Look at us were struggling to make this life begin
Tell 'em I'll be waiting for that sunny day
Look at me I'm struggling, I just can't find my way

There's a corner cafe
It stays open all the night
I went inside to escape the world
It's my favorite place to hide



",Corner Cafe
Gabe Dixon,"I saw Theresa yesterday
She shaved her body for a play
You know she looked so very fine
I just can't get her off my mind.

I saw Theresa yesterday
She told me ""Everything's okay,
I'm so in love with you today""

Theresa asked me to commit
I think that I could go with it
I never thought I'd have a wife
But I could see her in my life.

I saw Theresa yesterday
She told me ""Everything's okay,
But I'm leaving you today""

The night I climb toward the sky,
Above the city lights I'll fly
How can I live without that girl?
I wanted her inside my world.

I saw Maria yesterday
She asked me up for some cafe
Now I think its gonna be okay
I think its gonna be okay
I know its gonna be okay



",Everything's OK
Gabe Dixon,"Music goin'
Ooh and all the room is high
Drinks are flowin'
And I'm just hopin' to catch your eye
Rare diseases
Swimming in seas of love
A plastic Jesus
Could be a sign from above?

My door is open
Won't you come follow
One thing's for sure
Gonna make you a happy woman
Gonna make you a happy woman

Go ahead then
With your dirty apes and all your thugs
Take it elsewhere, besides
Your broken down gait's makin' me bug
But I see you comin'
From down the hallway
One thing's for sure

Gonna make you a happy woman
Gonna make you a happy woman
Gonna make you a happy woman
Gonna make you a happy woman
Happy Woman

",Happy Woman
Gabe Dixon,"I was sleeping soundly once upon a night
When I had a simple dream
There you were not saying a word
All I heard was our heart beating.

You were bent on picking apples from the apple tree
When you glanced my way.
With a hand you blocked the sun from your eyes and
Smiled an everlasting smile.
It was so unfortunate
That my alarm clock told me

you're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream,
But I'd just love to make you real.

you're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
But I'd just love to make you real.

Next night I saw the end of
Bloody miscommunication.
All the sides they
Dropped their weapons and they
Drooped their heads in shame and clarity.
All of us who watched from the sidelines
Breathed a sigh.
Then I awoke and saw the paper with the people dying on the cover.

you're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
But I'd just love to make you real
But I'd just love to make you real

I was sleeping soundly once upon a night when I had a simple dream




",Just a Dream
Gabe Dixon,"Too many times you were all alone
He left you behind cryin' by the phone
You weren't born to lose but losing him is wise
You've got a new fool
And he's just about my size

Live your life just how you love to live it
And things will all fall into place.
Take your strife and try your best to sing it.
In the end you meet your friends.

There is something I must tell you girl,
Been building up so long
See, all the times I served as your love consultant
I wanted to be there myself

Live your life just how you love to live it
And things will all fall into place.
Take your strife and try your best to sing it
In the end you meet your friends.

I love you more than it would seem
I love you more than it would seem

Love to me is not a total stranger
But love to me don't make no sense.
Love can be a capsule full of danger,
But that's a risk I'll have to take.

I love you more than it would seem
I love you more than it would seem

I'm sorry I waited so long but the
Time was so wrong.
I know its just a song but I love you
Things ain't what they seem to be
I have tried to conceal but love overwhelms me



",More Than It Would Seem
Gabe Dixon,"Sitting on the wall
Watching future goin' past
A million births a single day,
A million flags at half mast

The eyes bear holes in creation
A visual vacation

""Would you care for coffee sir?
I can't help but notice your weary head.""
""What's wrong with sleep"" I answered her,
""I think I'll have some milk instead.""

The eyes bear holes in creation
A visual vacation

We work our whole lives
For happiness and bread
Don't let me know
The truth about where we've been led.

Every day it's the same old thing
Get up, get dressed, I got to sing

So I'm sitting on the wall
Staring into the eyes of a girl
Everyone is staring at me
Ratio is one to the world

The eyes bear holes in creation
A visual vacation

And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible

Gabriel,"So many stories to be told across the ages young and old.
Could it be that we've become immune to all we hear on daytime news,
Where is the passion to unite?
Because divided we can't fight all the troubles in this life.

There's so many things that we are fighting, yeah.
There's so many people out there trying, yeah.

[Chorus]
And there's a little girl only six years old.
Her daddy does drugs.
Her mama's on the road.
She's a latchkey kid before she's even grown.
What we really need to do is give the girl a chance.
Put her on the road where there's no way back,
To a life that she's always known.
We gotta do something, yeah.
Can't do nothing, yeah.

Somebody's son got in a fight.
Doctors say it's touch and go,
So nobody's going home.
Friday night is where it starts.
Kids all high and having fun.
There will be a loss of life.
Trivial things that start a fight.

There's so many things we could be fighting. Yeah.
But do we give a damn and are we trying? Yeah.

It's a crazy world we're living in. Yeah.
It's a crazy world we're living in. Yeah.

Across town in a club, a girl's on the floor.
She's lying in the dark.
She did it once before.
Her body's full of drugs.
She did it for a rush.
Don't it make you wonder just how many more?
We gotta do something; it's not right.
Can't keep saying our hands are tied.
Gotta do something but it's too late:
There'll be another mother digging a grave.

There's so many things that we are fighting. Yeah.
But do we give a damn and are we trying? Yeah.

The world's gone crazy that we are seeing in.
The world's gone crazy more than a little bit.

And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Gabriel Garzon Montano,"A million pairs of feet, getting weak
We are all so tired of walking
But we can't find the way back home

Like fruitflies in the breeze, ill at ease
We try so hard to fight it
But we can't change the way the wind blows

Can't find a way back home
We can't change the way the wind blows
No, we can't find the way back home

And while we try to sleep, forgotten dreams
They beg of us to count them
So we back and forth with the sheep
Our cloudy coats, they gleam

How we bleat
Afraid to up and wander
Let the wolf get you while you're alone

Can't find a way back home
Can't find a way back home
No, we can't find a way back home

Raise me, hold me

Found you on a beach it was snowing

Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever

Some day I'll find my love

He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love

And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat

A su trabajo por una fuerte discucion
Con su familia

Se fue de su casa lleno de coraje
Ciego y salvaje
Fue creciendo su ira a toda
Velocidad
Y se fue sin decirle a nadie ni un adios
Pisandole fuerte al acelerador
Mientras maldecia
A su familia por no comprenderlo
Y se fue
Por la carretera sin control

Gabriel o Pensador,"A criminalidade toma conta da cidade
A sociedade põe a cupa nas autoridades

O cacique oficial viajou pro Pantanal
Porque aqui a violência tá demais

E lá encontrou um velho índio que usava um fio dental
E fumava um cachimbo da paz

O presidente deu um tapa no cachimbo e na hora
De voltar pra capital ficou com preguiça

Trocou seu paletó pelo fio dental e nomeou
O velho índio pra ministro da justiça

E o novo ministro chegando na cidade,
Achou aquela tribo violenta demais

Viu que todo cara pálida vivia atrás das grades
E chamou a TV e os jornais

E disse: ""Índio chegou trazendo novidade
Índio trouxe o cachimbo da paz

Maresia, sente a maresia
maresia, uuu   

Apaga a fumaça do revólver, da pistola
Manda a fumaça do cachimbo pra cachola

Acende, puxa, prende, passa
Índio quer cachimbo, índio quer fazer fumaça

Todo mundo experimenta o cachimbo da floresta
Dizem que é do bom
Dizem que não presta

Querem proibir, querem liberar
E a polêmica chegou até o congresso

Tudo isso deve ser pra evitar a concorrência
Porque não é Hollywood mas é o sucesso

O cachimbo da paz deixou o povo mais tranqüilo
Mas o fumo acabou porque só tinha oitenta quilos

E o povo aplaudiu quando o índio partiu pra selva
E prometeu voltar com uma tonelada

Só que quando ele voltou ""sujou""!!!
A polícia preparou uma cilada

""O cachimbo da paz foi proibido, entra na caçamba vagabundo!

Vamô pra DP! Ê êê! Índio tá fudido porque lá o pau
Vai comer!""

Apaga a fumaça do revólver, da pistola
Manda a fumaça do cachimbo pra cachola

Acende, puxa, prende, passa
Índio quer cachimbo, índio quer fazer fumaça

Na delegacia só tinha viciado e delinquente
Cada um com um vício e um caso diferente

Um cachaceiro esfaqueou o dono do bar porque ele
Não vendia pinga fiado

E um senhor bebeu uísque demais, acordou com um travestí
E assassinou o coitado

Um viciado no jogo apostou a mulher, perdeu a aposta
E ela foi sequestrada
Era tanta ocorrência, tanta violência que o índio
Não tava entendendo nada

Ele viu que o delegado fumava um charuto fedorento
E acendeu um ""da paz"" pra relaxar

Mas quando foi dar um tapinha
Levou um tapão violento e um chute naquele lugar

Foi mandado pro presídio e no caminho assistiu um
Acidente provocado por excesso de cerveja:

Uma jovem que bebeu demais atropelou
Um padre e os noivos na porta da igreja

E pro índio nada disso faz sentido
Com tantas drogas porque só o seu cachimbo é proibido?

Maresia, sente a maresia
maresia, uuu   

Apaga a fumaça do revólver, da pistola
Manda a fumaça do cachimbo pra cachola
Acende, puxa, prende, passa
Índio quer cachimbo, índio quer fazer fumaça

Na penitenciária o ""índio fora da lei""
Conheceu os criminosos de verdade

Entrando, saindo e voltando cada vez mais
Perigosos pra sociedade, aí, cumpádi, tá rolando
Um sorteio na prisão pra reduzir a super lotação

Todo mês alguns presos tem que ser executados
E o índio dessa vez foi um dos sorteados

E tentou acalmar os outros presos:
""Peraí, vamô Fumar um cachimbinho da paz

Eles começaram a rir e espancaram o velho índio
Até não poder mais e antes de morrer ele pensou:
""Essa tribo é atrasada demais   

Eles querem acabar com a violência,
mas a paz é contra a lei e a lei é contra a paz""
E o cachimbo do índio continuava proibido mas se você quer comprar é mais fácil que pão

Hoje em dia ele é vendido pelos mesmos bandidos que mataram O velho índio na prisão

Gabriel o Pensador,"Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come
Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come

É, não me distraí, não me distraí
Me deixa aproveitar a sensação um pouco mais
A sensação de esperança que invadiu o meu peito
Não me envergonha com esse velho preconceito

Não me atrapalha agora não, por favor
Não me apavora com as notícias do terror
O seu terror psicológico e as previsões sinistras
Dos seus mapas astrológicos

Não vão fazer o papai aqui fazer pipi na cama
Não sou do tipo que tem medo de sair da lama
Nós não somos covardes

E nunca é tarde pra cuidar de quem a gente ama
A gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe se amar
A gente sabe da vida

A gente sabe somar, e quer saborear a soma dividida
A gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe da vida
A gente sabe sonhar, e desse sonho a gente não duvida

Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come
Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come

E quem não mata a fome, a fome mata
Quem não mata a fome some
Quem não mata a fome, a fome come
(A fome não é só um nome)
E tem também a outra fome, fora do abdômen

Cara feia, eu vi na cara de um cara
Que matou um homem, por causa dessa outra fome
Fome de vingança, vingança do destino
E essa cara eu já vi na cara de um menino

E os meninos assassinos vão se renovando
E vão nascendo, vão morrendo e vão matando
É que Ellis pensam que o crime é o único caminho
Pra chegar em qualquer tipo de commando

Mas se os meninos forem mais malandros
Vão saber que ser trabalhador não é ser otário
Um bom exemplo vem da nossa presidência
Porque lá quem tá mandando é um operário

A gente sabe somar, e quer saborear a soma dividida
A gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe se amar, a gente sabe da vida
A gente sabe sonhar, e desse sonho a gente não duvida

Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come
Cara feia, pra mim é fome
E cara alegre é a cara de quem come

Não faça cara feia de barriga cheia
Não faça cara feia de barriga cheia
Não faça cara feia de barriga cheia
Nem meta a colher em cumbuca alheia

Quem deixa um pé atrás
Nunca chega na frente
Quem tem medo do futuro
Vira escravo do presente

Não me enche com essa fome de derrota
Nem me bota nesse time que defende o pessimismo
Agora eu sei, cansei da linha burra que separa, desune
E empurra todo mundo pro abismo

O caminho é mais pro alto
No mar e no sertão, na favela e no asfalto
Todo mundo sente fome, fome de futuro
Pra que pichar, se eu posso derrubar o muro?

Não é com tanque, nem com trator
Não é com ódio, nem com rancor
Não é com medo, nem com terror
Minha campanha também é paz e amor

Gabriel o Pensador,"Os filha da puta vivem arrumando desculpa
E motivos pra te pegar te usar e depois te desprezar
Te tomam tudo, a vida, a grana e a alma
E ainda querem que você tenha calma

Por isso eu vou falar
(Pode falar)
Vou contar
(Pode contar)

Sobre os filha da puta que só querem te roubar
Fundam uma igreja ora veja onde já se viu
Enriquecer com a fé alheia
(Puta-que-pariu)

E é inútil tentarmos abrir os olhos do povo
Pois se um abre os olhos mil olhos fecham de novo
E Ellis dizem que você está com o demônio
Mas o demônio habita no seu patrimônio

E Ellis farão o favor de tomar toda sua grana
Porque a grana pra Ellis é uma coisa profana
Só que aí o demônio vai parar com quem?
No bolso do pastor, e do bispo tamém

Filha da puta, filha da puta, filha da puta
Filha da puta, filha da puta, filha da puta

Filha da puta, escuta o que eu vou te dizer
Você está no poder agora mas um dia vai se fuder
Você está numa boa rindo a toa cheio de graça
Mas todos nós ainda vamos ver a sua desgraça

Você se esconde em Brasília essa ilha cercada de filha da puta
De político fajuto me escuta seu puto
Aprovando leis só para vocês e sua cambada
Arranjando obras superfaturadas

Ellis te exploram te chupam o sangue
Só pensam no lucro da sua gangue
Então escuta, pensa e responda a pergunta
Todo político é um filha da puta?

Filha da puta, filha da puta, filha da puta
Filha da puta, filha da puta, filha da puta

E tem outra espécie
De filha da puta que me emputece
É o pai desnaturado machão frustrado que se esquece
De que o tempo das cavernas já passou

E bate na família quando não devia nem bater com uma flor
Na mulher nas crianças mostrando toda a autoridade
De um homem primata no seu machismo covarde
Quando você vê na rua uma mulher com o olho roxo

Tenha certeza que ela é a mulher de um frouxo
Um Zé Ruela que com ela é agressivo, sem diálogo
Trata como égua porque é um cavalo
O autoritário da família, não tem autoridade além da força bruta
Bate no filho e na filha porque é um fi;ha da puta

How to do is rock and make heads roll
He do it to you 
He do it to me
He do it to the world like a color TV

And watch your better day become the night

Split down the middle like
Dirty records
So love the leppers eat the peppers raw
Suck the seeds in let your body fall
Look for the maker before the maker sees you grown 
Wings 
Let me tell you about them dirty things
A piece of coal is a diamond ring
Your soul is torn but your bird can sing

So your soul can know

Oh I'll never see the light but you were wrong

You show me where to get them bellyaches
Or I'll be eating marrow

Falling from the tip of my tongue

And me I was the only one oh she said:
Big sewers filled with little kids,
West side story be the story of bids that go 
High till they brake the sky.
They make bible stones seem old 
Now all that can save me
Is my own rabies

And I quiet down like stealth again
All that can save me
Is my own rabies
So I bite my own self
And I quiet down like stealth bombers

'Cause I am a ghost boy I don't 
Scare and I don't get no belly aches
And I'll be eating sparrows
Sitting on top of a tree
And as the days go by won't
You show me where to get them bellyaches
Or I'll here like pharaohs
Forever on my own",Ghostboy
Gabriel Ríos,"That's how it feels when she comes to you real
And your fingers grow wild like the mind of a child
Get in and get dreams, but you burst at the seams
And your dreams all get rough, cause you can't get enough

When it's gone, don't hold on
Let it go
When it's gone, don't hold on
Let it go

In this black coal diamond world 
Filled with brave little men
Don't get caught in the trend of living life at the end, no 
A true heart is not enough,
Cause you can't run with what you been stealing
Cause you'll be giving it up

When it's gone, don't hold on
Let it go
When it's gone, don't hold on
Let it go

And you will see that 
The stuff you are made of
And what you think is dying 
Is worlds living on their own
Oh but baby don't wake up
Cause I like wearing this make-up
Let me put it on

Alone in the dark
I can shine like a spark,
Forgetting the world like I am someone's lost ark
There was a hole in the girl
Where I could sit and pretend

When it's gone, don't hold on
Let it go
When it's gone, don't hold on
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go",Let It Go

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

I want to know, I want to know.
Do you feel how I feel?
I want to know, I want to know.

I won't pretend that I know what you're all about.
Why don't you share yourself, and you'll leave me in no doubt.
Reveal your inner-self, cast aside your mask.
Show me just who you are.
Is it really too much to ask?

Can it be I'm dreaming?
Now you're here with me;
I can't believe.
Tell me: am I dreaming?

It's the right time, we both know,
For you to be stepping back into my life.
We wasn't happy.
Couldn't make it the first time.
I'll always be thinking of...
I'll always be dreaming of...
Only you.

We did what we had to do.
We said what we had to say.
And with a last embrace,
We just turned and walked away.
We did what we had to do.
We said what we had to say.
Now that we're back again,
We won't make the same mistakes.

I know it was the right thing to do,
When we let each other go.
If we were hurting,
And we had nowhere else to go.
If we just carried on,
Let it go on, and on,
There'd be nothing else to build on.

We did what we had to do.
We said what we had to say.
And with a last embrace,
We just turned and walked away.
It was then I felt my heart breaking,
'Cause we let each other go.
For we couldn't see our future,
Or what it had to hold.
We did what we had to do.
We said what we had to say.
Now that we're back again,
We won't make the same mistakes.

This time we can make it last.

Does things to me

Can't help but notice
The things you do baby
I hate to say it
But I'm hooked on you

I want to get closer
Closer to you
I wanna feel your love
Come flowing through

I wanna take over
Take over your heart

Never apart

Gabrielle,"Thought I understood
All the things that you told me
You were going through
Tried to be there, and wanted to pull you through
And show you how much you're loved

Made a song and dance
Whenever I would ask you
Just what was wrong
You would say something like: ""nothing hon'""
All along telling me lies

Cared about me
Then you would care about
Care about us
If you cared about me
Then you would have cared about love

Yet still you strayed
Wasn't I good enough?
You were, oh, so sweet
I guess it was your sweetness
That blinded me

If you cared
You would be there for me
You wouldn't have left me feeling lonely

Don't need to hitch a ride

How can we carry on
And after what you've done to me
How did you think that I would be?
You had your chanch 
When I took you back
Now we're here again and your hurting me 

What would you do?
What would you say?
If you found me gone
If I walked away
What would you learn?
Would your heart be burned?
What would you do babe?
What would you say?
If I walked away

I'm losing all my patience
I have nothing left

Gabrielle,"Sky is white.
Trees are bare.
Been a while since you stood here.
You feel cold, so alone.
Yet the wind whispers 'hello' when it blows, when it blows.

Fallen angel with shattered dreams,
Trying to make some sense of all you've seen.
Let it go. Let it go. Troubled soul.
Let it go. Let it go.

Wounded spirit. Troubled soul.
Fallen angel. Let it all go.
Just believe and you will see all the good things your life can be.

And as dusk turns to dawn still you're battling your thoughts.
You feel lost, so alone.
And you wonder can you carry on.

How amazing your life would be if you held on, long enough to see.
Let it go. Let it go. Troubled soul.
Let it go. Let it go.

Wounded spirit. Troubled soul.
Fallen angel. Let it all go.
Just believe and you will see all the good things your life can be.

Fallen angel, you've made mistakes.
You can't keep living your life this way.

Let it go. Let it go. Troubled soul.
Let it go. Let it go.

Wounded spirit. Troubled soul.
Fallen angel. Let it all go.
Just believe and you will see all the good things your life can be.

She's lying in the dark.
She did it once before.
Her body's full of drugs.
She did it for a rush.
Don't it make you wonder just how many more?
We gotta do something; it's not right.

We're both guilty of mistakes
Though you rarely take the blame
Are you coming through
Sometimes I hate you
But it's not mistakes in life you make
It's the good you do along the way

I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new

Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Make me hate myself, and now I cry

Knew that time would make me sure
I needed space to heal
I had to change the way you make me feel

So don't tell me
You wanna work it out
No, don't tell me
You cannot live without, no

'Cause every little teardrop
Is long gone and stop
Don't tell me that you sorry now
'Cause I don't wanna hear it

You gave every single heartache
But still my heart wouldn't break
The promise is too late
To tell me that you're sorry

You, you have had your chances
But you threw them all away
Saying that you're sorry
Doesn't mean you get your own way

'Cause I'm fed up with excuses
And I won't fall for that

I'm no longer your girl, you're not my man?

'Cause you're sorry now, and it's now late
I guess you hope to find me off my face
Well, I'm happy now, didn't treat me right
You can beg and plead but I'm out your life, ha ha

The world is full of magic, can't you see 
I'm your guardian angel, trust in me 
So many times I've been watching you 
and now I fell in love with you! 

So many times I'm watching you 
and now I fell in love with you 
So many times... so many times... 

So many times I'm watching you 
and now I fell in love with you 
So many times... so many times... 
And I fell in love with you 

So many times, I'm watchin' you 
And I fell in love with you 

Do your heart, feel so lonely 
think about your sweetest dream 
close your eyes, and follow me 
and I'll take you to my destiny 

I'm thinking about you, all the time 
when I keep my love to you, that's the crime 
so many times I've been watching you 
and now I fell in love with you! 

So many times I'm watching you 
and now I fell in love with you 
So many times... so many times... 

So many times, I'm watchin' you 
And I fell in love with you",So Many Times [Radio Edit]
Gaël Faye,"Je pars, ma vie est trop maussade
Je pars j’ai laissé une feuille incrustée de mots sales
Je pars laissez-moi donc ma douleur
Je pars pour un monde fait de lumière et de couleurs
Je pars car le ciel est bas et gris
Les vieux n’ont plus d’sagesse, ils sont racistes et aigris
Je pars, je m’envole vers le rire des enfants
Je pars même s’ils m’en veulent j’ai trop souffert dans mes tourments
Je pars, j’ai déjà fait mes valises
Je pars car nos modes de vies d’ici me scandalisent
Je pars la vie m’transperce de part en part
Je pars car faut être fort et moi j’ai perdu mes remparts
Je pars, y’aura ni promesses ni nouvelles
Je pars, fallait du cran, j’ai activé la manivelle
Par un beau matin je pars je laisse le flambeau
Je trouverai mon Abyssinie, moi l’Arthur Rimbaud

Je pars, parti pour la vie
Je pars, viens avec moi si t’as envie
Je pars, pour la saison des pluies
Je pars, hier, demain et aujourd'hui
Je pars, parti pour la vie
Je pars, viens avec moi si t’as envie
Je pars, pour un rayon d’ombre
Viens retrouver colombe mon coeur mort sous les décombres

J’veux juste un chapeau de paille, une plage et un transat
Oublier les charters, les aéroports dans lesquels on transite
J’veux des nuits douces au ciel étoilé, scruter la galaxie
Ici y’a pas d’laxisme, on bosse jusqu’à la cataplexie
J’veux manger du riz au curry et des mangues juteuses
J’veux pas d’leur vache folle qui rit à la fièvre aphteuse
Et puis ce soleil qui tannerait ma peau luisante sous la pommade
Ici on m’appelle « Negro », y’a pas d’place pour nos peaux mates
J’veux qu’mes pommettes, mes zygomatiques s’échauffent toute l’année
L’ami ! Les choses qu’ils promettent? Être condamné à glaner
Sur sample de guitare sèche, j’veux des gens simples et des sourires
Ici c’est rare qu’on nous supporte, qu’on ouvre les portes et les serrures
J'veux vivre sur des rythmiques, des mélopées
Me libérer de mes chaînes, car la culture m'a menotté
J'veux que tu viennes allez, rentre dans mon monde
Viens retrouver colombe mon cœur mort sous les décombres

Je pars, parti pour la vie
Je pars, viens avec moi si t’as envie
Je pars, pour la saison des pluies

Je pars, pour un rayon d’ombre
Viens retrouver colombe mon coeur mort sous les décombres

Embrassez-moi, je suis pour l’amour et la paix
Le 28 août à DC j’ai fait le rêve de l’appel
La peine ma vrai nature, je vis avec
Comme l’orphelin du monde, l’enfant seul, le restavek
J’vis dans ces rues tristes, le matin hivernal
J’suis enfermé dans l’enfer et pour moi c’est infernal
Amenez la joie dans mes ténèbres, apocalypse de mes tourments
J’ai l’impression d’être au tournant que les personnes autour me mentent
Venez mourir! Comme les vagues de la plage
Venez donc lire, le vague à l’âme de mes pages
Les palmiers sont courbés comme des vieillards
Les bords de mer sont devenus de tristes dépotoirs
L’érosion a mis à nu les mornes à rhum
L’Abyssin a condamné tous les chemins qui mènent à Rome
Ma musique s’exprime comme une saudade
Les notes et les mots se mettent debout comme des soldats!

Gaël Faye,"Mon arrivée en France, y'a bien longtemps
Depuis que j'crois plus en l'ONU, depuis que j'crois plus en l'OTAN
Maintenant j'ai vingt ans et quelques poussières
Et j'repense à l'Afrique où nous étions encore hier
On a grandi là-bas au bord du lac Tanganyika
Et moi je supporte ici, tant que là-bas y'aura mes gars
Eh J-NO, Mucyo, Iris, Fabrice et les autres
Des potes comme vous j’vous assure j’en ai pas retrouvé d’autres
Et puis y’a eu Paris, maintenant j’l’appelle « Panam »
La pollution, les épiciers berbères et leurs mauvaises bananes
Ici c’est grecs, mac do, la pluie, le froid, les flaques d’eau
Métro boulot dodo, la place Vendôme et les clodos
Mais j’m’habitue, j’aime mes baskets et mon bitume
Et comme j’veux faire fortune, au mois d’août j’me fais des thunes
J’suis solitaire et des fois je sors la plume
J’suis pas rappeur, juste un virevolteur de mots pleins d’amertume

L’AFRANCE est l’asile, l’absence et l’exil
Souffrance mais par pudeur faut pas que je l’exhibe
Je vis loin des mes rêves, de mes espoirs, de mes espérances
C’est ça qui me tue d’être écartelé entre Afrique et France

Mon père chasse le croco, ma mère met du lait d’coco
Ici je suis franco-rwandais j’vais pas vous faire un topo
J’ai quitté le pays et sa situation sinistre
J’m’étais promis, ben qu’un jour je deviendrai ministre
Mais j’ai grandi, j’ai pas d’plan pour le Burundi
J’continue d’espérer, les frères c’est pas ce qu’on avait dit?
J’ai revu Buja, elle a plus le même visage
C’est devenu une ville sage et tous les jeunes veulent un visa
Des fois j’me demande si j’ai un devoir envers l’Afrique
J’pourrais fermer les yeux, une femme des gosses et garder mon fric
Problème existentiel de nos délires névrotiques
De ma vision romantique, j’veux faire naître un nouveau type
Car j’fais partie de cette diaspora de cette jeunesse
Qui a quitté le pays pour faire recette
Mais j’men rends compte, qu’on est trop con
Qu’on gâche nos vies et que l’Europe devient notre cocon

L’AFRANCE est l’asile, l’absence et l’exil
Souffrance mais par pudeur faut pas que je l’exhibe
Je vis loin des mes rêves, de mes espoirs, de mes espérances
C’est ça qui me tue d’être écartelé entre Afrique et France

Tu te rappelles nos grands-pères aimaient leur terre et leur bétail
Et nous les fils on se perd dans les guerres et les batailles
Ma mémoire se paralyse, et ma peine se cautérise
Des machettes qu’on aiguise, de tous nos morts dans nos églises
J’oublie pas que l’exil c’est comme une porte d’exit
Je crie mes origines car c’est comme ça que j’existe
Trop de larmes ont coulé, beaucoup de textes j’ai gribouillé
Maintenant je regarde le soleil sur le lac d’une plage de Kibuye
Petite sœur tu prends la ligne pour les milles collines
Embrasses bien les cousins, embrasses bien les cousines
Et puis embrasses aussi la grand-mère à Butare
Dis lui que chaque année que je passe loin d’elle me rend plus taré
Et si tu prends le bus Vénus pour Bujumbura
Fais gaffe à toi, aux embuscades à Bugarama
Embrasse papa qui est resté au pays
Dis lui qu’en France je ne grandis plus, dis lui que je vieillis

L’AFRANCE est l’asile, l’absence et l’exil

Y'a le name droping, les mails en copie
La France qui cotise, la famille qu’on se coltine
Les frères qui cantinent, les quelques centimes
La physique quantique, les prix qu’on estime
Les gens que l’on tue, les fêtes confettis
Les ordres de Poutine, le plutonium sushi
La guerre, le sida, Darfour et Biafra
Et puis dans tout ça l’opinion du quidam
Bistrot, troquet, la merde, le réel
Quand j’enlève la virgule la merde est réelle
Objectifs, chiffres, rafles, écoles
ADN, fichage, charters qui décollent
Ralliement, connivence, collusion, dissension
Hutu ou Tutsi, me pose jamais la question
Les amours, le cœur, les amis, les tourments
Et l’espoir d’une victoire des Dinkas du Soudan

When it throws rocks

Que cet été où que j’aille, on bouge à Buja

Moi je t’aime aussi de Bubanza jusqu’à Bururi

Et la Primus c’est la meilleure que tu trouves en Afrique
Et le dimanche Regina Mundi pour prier

Allô gars, viens boire un café local à l’OCAF à l’occaz
Remonter le moral, diaspora tous en choral

Y’a des grands bwana à Kiriri et des masikinis
Y’a du français, du kirundi, un peu de swahili
Tu peux acheter à l’unité Supermatch, Ambassy

Gaël Faye,"MC agrégé de flow, diplômé de style
J’ai le style hostile au stylo qu’on veut rendre docile
En un cil et son battement je te rends fossile

Là, faut s’y faire vu que c’est fort et que ça vocifère

Et ton flow MC bah j’te le circoncis

Je viens de loin tu te souviens ce que disais mon compadre
Y’a pas de répit dans mon combat, que des histoires de pierres tombales
Du Burundi au Rwanda, guerrier je danse le Douga
A la Douma c’est pas détails, c’est coup d’théâtre et vendetta
Attends-toi à des attentats c’est coup d’état pour coup d’éclat
Ecoutez bien si vous pensiez que tout est bien que tout est beau
Votre dédain déteint le ciel et je deviens corbeau
Esclave du paradis, paraît que c’est beau sous les tropiques
Des dominés sans dominants c’est un équilibre estropié
Trop près de mon trépas, mon pe-ra devient trépied
J’ai décrété que l’opprimé serait sujet, que je traiterais
Que je prêterais ma voix aux crève-la-faim et traîne-savates
Mais au train où ça va, faut les crever tous les porte-cravates
Car ce monde qu’ils nous réservent c’est de l’argent, c’est du pouvoir
Ne peuvent plus voir et ces messieurs nous emmènent tous vers un trou noir

Gaël Faye,"Un cimetière s’est formé entre NACO et moustiquaire
La névralgie du robinet c’est le bruit de ma rivière
Le vent danse dans les rideaux, le grelot de la tringle
Dehors grésille la radio de quelques voix que je distingue
Des oiseaux dans la volière, le kasuku fait du boucan
Si le frigo ne bourdonne guère c’est qu’il y a coupure de courant
Rayon de soleil en suspension, filaments de poussière dans l’air
Qui traversent le salon pour zébrer d’ombre et de lumière

A l’heure de la sieste, j’apprivoise le silence
Petit Prince d’ennui modeste entre mouton et somnolence
Dans la vieille maison de briques, de la Belgique sous les tropiques
A l’heure des choses statiques j’invente, je me fabrique
Petit garçon, genoux cagneux, il fait trop chaud sous mes cheveux
Nos jeux sont souvent poussiéreux sous un soleil de plomb teigneux
Les excursions chevaleresques, les fous rires, les pactes de sang
Copain ça compte, copain ça reste, copain c’est d’abord un mot d’enfant

Dans le ventre de la maison, les adultes en digestion
Et moi coincé dans mes questions, prisonnier d’une toile au plafond
Capharnaüm de la déco, les masques, les trophées, les geckos
Je joue au GI Joe dans le crâne d’un hippo
A l’intérieur il fait frais, le carrelage une mosaïque
Sur lequel mes voitures jouets dessinent des routes périphériques
Torpeur d’après-midi sous un ciel bleu paradis
Parade levée dans le taillis, 14 Juillet chez les fourmis

Dans mon jardin d’Eden y’a des serpents à tous les angles
Et faute de pomme Golden, je trahis Dieu avec des mangues
Toute l’année dans mon jardin je vis à ciel ouvert
Sous le Ficus je suis un nain, arbre temple, arbre univers
La citronnelle borde la rigole entourant la maison
La pluie s’abstient ou dégringole, les pizzas n’ont que deux saisons
Mais quand les trombes s’abattent, elles tambourinent le toit de tôle
Les bananiers deviennent frégates et l’eau cascade sur mes épaules

Une planche à voile sur le toit d’un combi Volkswagen
Des photos jaunies, le petit chien s’appelle Amstel
Pas de 4 heures, pas de goûter, pas de pâte à tartiner
Pas de chaîne, pas de télé, y’a que l’aquarium à regarder
Pas de parfum que l’on humecte, j’écris des lettres à une maman

Gaël Faye,"Fils du Hip Hop, il a grandi sous Reagan
Il sautait sur des matelas éventrés dans des terrains vagues
Lui, c’est le rap, un gamin de la rue
La musique sur la peau et le style d’une verrue
Il est né sous Jim Corbeau, surmontant les épreuves
Depuis que Betty Shabazz et Coretta Scott sont devenues veuves
Plus d’Etat, plus de social, le DJ scratch dans l’abîme
Quand son frère Graffiti bariole l’épiderme des villes
Langston Hughes est mort, Harlem Renaissance zéro
Ça break et ça beat box autour d’un baril brasero
Des B-Boys aux Block parties, apprendre à faire sans rien
Le rap a inventé une musique sans musicien
Sans solfège, naît dans le ghetto le petit frère mal aimé
Les leaders ne parlent plus, ils se mettent à rimer
« Put your hands up in the air! » personne ne sera blessé
Un Bic, un beat, la verve du verbe sur MPC
Puis ça fume des blunts, des zedou sur des SP12
Et ça pille les breaks de James Brown, d’Otis Redding
De Funkadelic, de George Clinton, d’Ohio Players
Le son sale, crasseux, poussiéreux provient de ses samplers
C’est les pleurs de la rue sur des crissements de disques
Break it down scratch! Emmerde la progression harmonique
De la bouche des égouts est sorti un mouvement
Qui s’invite dans les cocktails du bourgeois condescendant
Des Hood à Hollywood, du béton au bifton
L’industrie musicale resserre sa proie comme un python
Première tension, puis première contradiction
Choisir entre Révolution ou sociale ascension
Mais le rap a plus d’une rime sous le bomber
Schizophrène sur MTV ça fight the power
Les postillons recouvrent le monde, la mode devient mouvement
Une lame de fond au verbe acide acerbe et véhément
L’instinct de guerre, de cracher, de vivre libre
Insoumis en dehors des schémas et des normes établis
Y’a des morts, des oxymores, des coups de balles verbales
Des ruptures grammaticales sur des caisses claires et cymbales
Ca s’emballe, sans label ça devient plus hardcore
Le réel est sans appel dans le couloir de la mort
Quand le chômage augmente les rappeurs deviennent précis
Quand les médias nous mentent les MC’s font les récits
Chaque block, chaque quartier, chaque secteur possède ses rappeurs
Le système est un arbre et le rap est sécateur

Puis la langue affûtée s’est mise à baisser le futal
On lui a joué de la flûte, elle a kiffé le récital
Elle s’est mise des dents en or, des chaînes d’esclaves autour du cou
C’est normal que quand tu crèches dehors tu veuilles sortir du trou
La tête dans un keffieh, du cauchemar au rêve américain
Le rap boit du Moët dans une Bentley en chantant des refrains
En chantant des couplets de 8 mesures sur des sujets lissés
Ça fait dans la friperie, le téléphone, les produits dérivés
Les gens de la classe moyenne ignorant le ghetto
Ont fait le succès du peu-ra, ils veulent les gestes et puis l’argot
Ils veulent s’encanailler: la drogue, les flingues, les biatchs sur la table
S’en foutent de la culture et du message d’Afrika Bambaataa
Le rap a fait ses classes loin du Hip Hop
Renonce à l’éthique de Chuck D, veut la vie de Donald Trump
Le vilain petit canard s’est transformé en cocotte aux œufs d’or
Le bon vin, les dollars ont remplacé le bruit et les odeurs
Mais loin des cotations de ce système l’esprit reste vivace
Tant qu’y’a la merde dans le quartier, y’aura des 16 en dédicace
Donc ferme ta porte et tes fenêtres pour que le Rap ne rentre pas
Il fera une Block Party dans ton jardin pour que tu ne dormes pas!
Donc ferme ta porte et tes fenêtres pour que le Rap ne rentre pas
Il fera une Block Party dans ton jardin pour que tu ne dormes pas!
Ferme ta porte et tes fenêtres pour que le Rap ne rentre pas
Il fera une Block Party dans ton jardin pour que tu ne dormes pas!",Fils Du Hip-Hop
Gaël Faye,"J'ai vécu sur la grève, les yeux dans mes rêves
A écouter le vague à l'âme que les vents soulèvent
Je pensais m'être échoué à jamais dans l'estuaire
Quand cette femme m'a dit : ""viens, viens prendre la mer""
Alors nos mains d'amoureux ont sculpté une pirogue
Au début le ciel est bleu, tu pars et tu vogues
On a glissé sur une mer d'huile, un miroir onduleux
Et bientôt au fil de l'eau, le ciel devint nébuleux
Y'a la mer en furie, puis les tempêtes que l'on brave
Et de la poupe à la proue, on s'accroche, on en bave
L'équipage se renforce, apprend avec l'âge
Que l'océan est sauvage lorsqu'on quitte ses rivages
Puis un jour on s'amarre au dessus d'un champ de lumières
Les amants qui s'aimèrent d'un scintillement lunaire
Plongent ensemble dans l'azur aux ressacs éphémères
Et remontent à la surface une perle solaire

Oh, Isimbi, Isimbi
Oh, Isimbi, Isimbi
Oh, le noyau de mon fruit de vie
Isimbi, Isimbi

La plus belle perle du monde à m'en brûler les prunelles
Je le jure sur ma vie que la mienne sera pour elle
Six heures trente, six décembre, c'est un ange qui descend
Dans ma vie, dans cette chambre, je ne sais plus ce que je ressens
Un sentiment d'embrasement bien plus fort que l'amour
Je fus Dieu un instant, c'était peut-être pour toujours
C'est la chair de ma chair, le sang de mon sang
Et j'en perds mes repères à être père d'un enfant
Révolution accomplie! Mon Grand Soir le voici
Parce que l'on meurt tous un jour, je riposte par la vie
Isimbi, c'est son nom, ""la perle éternelle""
Ou ""la neige des volcans"" sur le toit de ma Terre mère
A la mère de ma fève, à ses talents d'orfèvres
La rosée de sa fleur est la perle de ma fièvre
Parce que l'on était ""elle et moi"", parce que l'on s'aimait à l'étroit

Petite perle nacrée, si le ciel me soustrait
Je serais toujours près, près de toi en secret
Petite perle, tu descends d'une lignée de poètes
D'idéalistes en tout genre, de chercheurs de conquêtes
Lève les yeux, une aïeule brille pour toi
Suzana comme un nom au reflet d'autrefois
IBUKA, souviens-toi, le prélude à ta vie
Suzana c'est le nom d'un immortel atavisme
Petite fille pardonne-nous pour ce monde dérisoire
Pour tes épaules bien trop frêles face au poids de l'Histoire
Petite princesse au royaume de mes mots
A tous les fleuves qui t'irriguent, à tes rivières indigo
A nos droits de douter, à nos rages d'exister
A nos chants de clarté que je t'offre en bouquet
Petite plante céleste aux yeux de rubis
Bienvenue ma princesse, bienvenue dans la vie

Quand elle passe dans ton monde ; tous les gars tombent
Ma femme c'est de la came, c'est de la coke en kilogrammes
Elle est au top du palmarès ; elle a fait péter vos diagrammes
A côté, les autres, elles ont des tronches de gorilles
Y'a les femmes et y'a la mienne ; allégorie hors-catégorie
C'est pas la peine d'essayer de la guer-dra
Elle en a rien à faire du vermicelle derrière ta guette-bra
Accro, je suis à cran, c'est la muse de mes écrits
Elle a transpercé l'écran ; c'est un diamant dans son écrin
Une femme, une vraie de vraie ; regarde comme elle est gaulée
J'aime pas la voir partir, mais j'adore la voir s'en aller
Je l'entoure de mes bras, ma beauté, ma seule princesse
Jusqu'au bout du monde je me battrai pour que jamais l'étreinte cesse
Regarde sa cambrure, ses seins qui foutent le faya
Je l'épouserai Baie de tous les Saints, Salvador de Bahia
De tous les dons du Ciel, c'est le cadeau du plus offrant
Ma femme elle est trop belle, regarde sa peau couleur safran
Ma femme elle déclenche les ambulances et leurs sirènes
Si le monde était beauté, tu vivrais sous son règne
Son parfum est une ivresse qui te rend saoul l'ami
Elle est classe comme une négresse et dangereuse comme un tsunami
Indépendante est ma femme, l'intelligence incarnée
C'est la reine de Saba, c'est Cléopâtre réincarnée
Ma femme c'est de la foudre, l'orage, les cataclysmes
C'est ta foi, ta religion, l'abjuration des hommes d'église
C'est la belle-fille, que je présente à ma Mama
J'en suis sûr que c'est la bonne, dans les artères coule le magma
Je lui ferai des gosses, des bambins, une floppée de mômes
Parce qu'il y'a la guerre sur la Terre, on va repeupler le monde
Ma femme j'en ferai des disques, des films et des bouquins
C'est la goutte de sang dans l'océan qui rend fous les requins
Je sais qu'elle traumatise donc tise ton verre ou termine ton spliff
C'est pas des révolvers dans ses yeux verts y'a des .22 Long Rifle
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, elle est simple, une beauté qui s'ignore
C'est une femme en or, à ses côtés, je deviens seigneur
Cette femme elle fout en l'air, c'est le requiem du rêve
Elixir du nectar des dieux, j'ai la cuillère aux lèvres
Elle est belle comme le pêché, une séquelle, un vrai scandale
Je suis le prêtre avec les clefs du temple, et je deviens vandale
Cette femme c'est pas de la lette-zou ou de la lollipop
C'est du pe-ra Brooklyn zoo, du Rock'n'roll et du Hip-hop
Je succombe à sa démarche, cette langueur qui se pavane
Avec les cheveux dans le soleil, elle danse, rue de la Havane
On a mis le cap vers cette plage du Cap-Vert
Au piano y'aura Ruben, au micro Ibrahim Ferrer
Au creux de son oreille, j'irai glisser ""ndagukunda""

Gaël Faye,"Depuis mes sources du Nil jusqu'en haut de la tour Eiffel
J'aurais tout fait jusqu'à m'en étouffer
J'aurais tout jeté, mes refrains, mes couplets, écoutez
Le studio je l'aurais fermé, le micro je l'aurais coupé, j'ai douté
J'avance sur des chemins cahoteux
Venez goûter mes vérités dans les bouquins de Jean-Paul Gouteux
Dégoûté d'avoir une vie non méritée
Regardez je suis brillant mais je reflète l'obscurité
Identité de porcelaine, j'ai fait ce morceau-là
Pour assembler le puzzle d'un humain morcelé
Jamais à ma place, des frontières j'effaçais
Mais frais comme Damas mon sentiment de race
Blanc et noir, quand le sang dans mes veines se détraque
Je suis debout aux confluents du fleuve et du lac
Mon métissage c'est pas l'avenir de l'humanité
Mon métissage, c'est de la boue en vérité

Quand deux fleuves se rencontrent
Ils n’en forment plus qu’un et par fusion nos cultures deviennent indistinctes
Elles s’imbriquent et s’encastrent pour ne former qu’un bloc d’humanité debout sur un socle

Un beau bordel chromosomique, demande à Benetton, mais laisse béton
On aura beau se mélanger on restera des cons
La race humaine un clébard marquant son territoire
Gueulant l'appartenance à son département, ni blanc ni noir
J'étais en recherche chromatique
Mais le métis n'a pas sa place dans un monde dichotomique
Donc c'est dit c'est dit je suis noir dans ce pays
C'est pas moi qui l'ai voulu je l'ai vu dans le regard d'autrui
C'est comme ça, laisse-les chanter nos mélanges de couleur
Laisse-les parler de diversité, de France black, blanc, beur
On serait tous métis, le reste c'est de la bêtise
Voilà que j'ironise sur ce que les artisans de la paix disent
J'ai pas de frontière, j'ai pas de race
Je suis chez moi partout sans être jamais à ma vraie place
Mon seul pays c'est moi, mon seul amour c'est toi
Toi l'autre différent mais au fond si proche de moi

Métissé, prisé ou méprisé, j'ai dû m'adapter
Ballotté entre deux cultures ça commence à dater
Adolescent, complexé toujours en quête d'identité
Y avait le blanc y avait le noir, j'étais celui qui hésitait
J'évitais de choisir à l'âge où l'on veut faire partie
Endossant la faute de tous les camps je devenais martyr
On m'a dit 50/50 mais j'y ai pas trouvé mon compte
Car le glacier fusionne à l'océan à la saison des fontes
Je soupire, ça transpire, la connerie, ça s'empire
Quand on m'appelle le sang-mêlé, sous-entendu, issu de sang pur
Je vois bien ces questions ne nous mènent à rien
L'humanité est colorée donc, soyons daltoniens
Je vous parle d'amour, vu qu'il expire dans un mouroir
Je suis mulâtre, ébène albâtre voulant abattre le miroir
Et comme l'Afrique est en instance de sang entre ciel et Terre
J'ai le cul entre deux chaises, j'ai décidé de m'asseoir par terre!

Remémorer ma vie naguère avant la guerre
Trimant pour me rappeler mes sensations sans rapatriement

Voyez mon existence avait bien commencé
J'aimerais recommencer depuis l'début, mais tu sais comment c'est
Et nous voilà perdus dans les rues de Saint-Denis

Des fosses communes et puis nos cauchemars incessants
Petit pays : te faire sourire sera ma rédemption
Je t'offrirai ma vie, à commencer par cette chanson
L'écriture m'a soigné quand je partais en vrille
Seulement laisse-moi pleurer quand arrivera ce maudit mois d'avril
Tu m'as appris le pardon pour que je fasse peau neuve

Un soir d'amertume, entre le suicide et le meurtre
J'ai gribouillé ces quelques phrases de la pointe neutre de mon feutre
J'ai passé l'âge des pamphlets quand on s'encanaille
J'connais qu'l'amour et la crainte que celui-ci s'en aille
J'ai rêvé trop longtemps d'silence et d'aurore boréale
À force d'être trop sage j'me suis pendu avec mon auréole
J'ai gribouillé des textes pour m'expliquer mes peines
Bujumbura, t'es ma luciole dans mon errance européenne
Je suis né y'a longtemps un mois d'août
Et depuis dans ma tête c'est tous les jours la saison des doutes
Je me navre et je cherche un havre de paix
Quand l'Afrique se transforme en cadavre
Les époques ça meurt comme les amours

Gaël Faye,"Il voulait quitter la routine, celle de son père
Qui étiole les rêves au large des paupières
Enfourcher son vélo, repartir à zéro
Petit gone de Lyon aux oripeaux d’évasion
Partir! Non pas pour voir de nouveaux lieux
Mais voyager, pour ouvrir de nouveaux yeux
Orpailleurs d’horizons, y’a que des hôtels mille étoiles
Pour les clochards célestes qui ne s’embarrassent pas d’un toit
Petit croissant au beurre, petit français qui flâne
Il lisait Kerouac et chantait Bob Dylan
Il est parti vivre à la dure
Découvrir l'humain, épouser la nature
Et de pays en pays, il pédale, il pédale
Et de guerre en maladie, il pédale, il pédale
C’est usé par la route d’un voyage de cinq ans
Qu’au bord de son doute il rencontre un piment

Elle était belle comme un piment, une robe du dimanche
Elle rêvait d’un charmant, d’un amour qui s’épanche
Elle vivait dans un quartier populaire
Elle avait fui son pays, les pogroms et la guerre
Et la terre des ancêtres était un vaste mouroir
Et ce pays d’accueil, un sombre miroir
Qui lui renvoyait cette image de paria
Une réfugiée HCR qui glisse aux parois
Et qui veut s’envoler, partir loin d’ici
Là où le ciel ne dit ni Hutu ni Tutsi
Et puis les murs de sa chambre au vert papier peint
Recouvert de poster de « Salut les Copains »
Etait son antre où elle rêvait d’être hippie
D’écouter du Jimi et de vivre à Paris
En attendant le bus sous un arbre en fleur
Son destin croise celui d’un croissant au beurre

Elle et il aux Sources du Nil
Un vent souffle l’idylle sur les branches d’un nid
D’un croissant beurré et d’un piment swahili
Qui s’étaient donc jurés de s’aimer pour la vie
Malgré toutes les routes crevées d’ornières
Dans le panache de poussières des saisons blanches et sèches
Malgré le doute et les pluies diluviennes
Malgré les torrents de boue qui s’écoulent dans la plaine
Le croissant, le piment ont le goût d’un enfant
Puis de un puis de deux, carpe diem d’un instant
Aucune écluse ne peut contenir les rêves
Que le cœur transporte et pour lesquels il crève

Les hommes sont bêtes, l'Afrique est belle, fais pas l'erreur de la haïr
Avec toi je voulais vieillir sur ces collines, dans cette maison
Mais l'horizon s'arrête ici, je suis venu chanter mon oraison
Il m'enlève le galbe de tes hanches, le suave de tes lèvres
Sans trêve, « Umugwaneza », lumière de tous mes rêves
Je dois quitter ce port, mon âme quitte son corps
Mais mon amour je resterai toujours à deux encablures de ton cœur
Je vais partir dans les minutes qui suivent

And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran

And then run like the devil from the excise man

Keep the smoke from rising, Barney


Now keep your eyes well peeled today

The tall, tall men, they're on their way

They're searching for the mountain tea

In the hills of Connemara


Gather up the pots and the old tin can

And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran

And then run like the devil from the excise man

Keep the smoke from rising, Barney


A gallon for the butcher and a quart for Tom

And a bottle for the poor old Father Tom

To help the poor old dear along

In the hills of Connemara


Gather up the pots and the old tin can

And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran

And then run like the devil from the excise man

Keep the smoke from rising, Barney


Now swing to the left, now swing to the right

Sure, the excise man can dance all night

He's drinkin 'up the tea 'til the broad daylight

In the hills of Connemara


Gather up the pots and the old tin can

And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran

And then run like the devil from the excise man

Keep the smoke from rising, Barney


Now, stand your ground, and don't you fall

The excise men, they're at the wall

Jesus Christ, they're drinkin' it all

In the hills of Connemara


Gather up the pots and the old tin can

And the mash, and the corn, the barley, and the bran

And then run like the devil from the excise man

Keep the smoke from rising, Barney

Gaelic Storm,"Fare thee well to Prince's Landing Stage.
Mersey River, fare thee well.
Well, I am bound for California, but I know that I'll return someday.

Chorus:
So fare thee well, my own true love. 
When I return united we will be.
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me, but my darling when I think of thee.

Oh, I have signed on the yankee sailin' ship.
Davy Crockett is her name. 
And Burgess is the captain of her, and they say that she's a floatin? shame.

Chorus
Oh, I have sailed with this Burgess once before, and I think that I know him quite well.
For if a man is a sailor, he can get along. If not, he's in a floating Hell

Gaelic Storm,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

I'll tell me ma when I go home,
The boys won't leave the girls alone.

She's the belle of Belfast City,
She is a courting. One. Two. Three

I can hear our bo'sun's whistle blowing,
So its one more kiss,

And one more song while the beer is flowing!

I'm riding the sea in my soul
In the dark and the deep she will rock me to sleep
Down below, where the black waters roll

And the sun lays it's kiss on the sand
I'll be drawn to the shore like so many times before
As I long to be far from the land

I can still taste your tears on the foam
But the lure of the tide that I'm feeling inside
Will not rest 'til my heart finds it's home

Well I'm a little beggarman and begging I have been
for three score or more on this little isle of green.
And I'm known from the Liffey from the basement to the zoo,
And I'm known by the name of old Johnny Dhu.

Of all the trades that's goin' the beggin' is the best,
For when a man is tired he can sit down and rest
He can beg for his dinner, he's nothing else to do
When he comes around the corner with his old rig-a-doo.

And I met a little flaxy-haired girl one day
'Well good morning' little flaxy-haired girl,' did I say,
'Well good mornin' little beggarman, how do you do,
with your rags and your bags and your old rig-a-doo.'
I'll buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a tie,
And a nice young lady I will fetch by and by.
I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make of her too.

I've got the sky,
I've got the road.
I've got the sky...
The world is my home.

I'm a little beggarman, I am a beggar man,
And I slept way down, in a barn at Caurabawn
A wet night came on and I slept 'till the dawn
With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
And the rats and the cats, they were playing peek-a-boo
When who should awaken but the woman of the house
With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""Boo!
Ah, don't be afraid ma'am it's only Johnny Dhu.""

And it's over the fields with my pack on my back
And over the fields with my great heavy sack
With the holes in my shoes and my toes peeping through
Singing skinny-me-rink a doodle o for old Johnny Dhu

When the fire's all raked and out goes the light

Gaelic Storm,"Lemme tell you a little story about a man named Johnny Tarr
He was a hard drinking son of a preacher, always at the bar
Lager from the tap or shots of Paddy from the shelf
He could open his throttle and throw backa bottl as quickas the devil himself ... Johnny Tarr!

Word got around that Johnny Tarr was no pretender,
From Clare to here they'd lock up the beer when Johnny went on a bender
Down at Dickey Mack's, the Rising Sun, or at the Swan
If he was drinking at seven by ten to eleven well all the booze woulb be gone! Johnny Tarr!

Even if you say it yourself, you wouldn't believe,
And I wouldn't trust a person like me, if I were you
I wasn't there, I swear I have an alibi
I heard it from a man who knows a fell who says it's true!

It was nine in the morning on a cold rainy night,
Johnny rolled into the Castle Bar, looking to get tight
He had money in his pocket, he had whiskey in his eye,
He said: Get up off your asses and set up the glasses, I'm drinking this place dry!

Now all the serious boozers, they were soon broken hearted
When Johnny finished off six and he was only getting started
Guzzling down the pints, knockin' em back like candy,
He was lookin' alright to be drinkin' all night, then Nora brought out the Brandy! Johnny Tarr!

Even if you say it yourself, you wouldn't believe,
And I wouldn't trust a person like me, if I were you
I wasn't there, I swear I have an alibi
I heard it from a man who knows a fell who says it's true!

Johnny drank the whole damn bottle, had another pint or two,
When it made no impression he started his session with Murphy's Millenium Brew
He was waiting for a pint when his face turned green
Jesus, Johnny fell down after only fifteen!

You could have heard a pin drop, then the crowd let out a roar
It took five cork women to lift Johnny off the floor!
The doctor looked him over and said you better call the hearse:
but it's not what you're thinkin' it wasn't the drinkin' this man died of thirst

Even if you say it yourself, you wouldn't believe,

Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie

Not far from Stephen's Green, where Miss Henry used to go sir
Her manners were so fine, she set my heart a-twitchin'
She invited me to a courtin' in the kitchen

I dressed me self quite gay and I frizzed and oiled me hair up
The captain had no wife, he had gone on fishin'
So we kicked up high life to hooley in the kitchen

With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie

She slipped up to her room, I says good Lord, oh lady
She came back down the stairs, wearin' nothin' but her nightie
With her arms around me waist, she slyly hinted marriage
When to the door in haste, came captain Kelly's carriage

When the captain came downstairs, do we see me situation
In spite of all me prayers, I was marched off to the station
For me they set no bail, but to get to the home I was itchin'
And I had to tell the tailor, for I came in to the kitchen

Well, I swore she did invite me, though she gave a flat denial
For assault, they did indict me and I was sent for trial
She swore I robbed the house in spite of all me screechin'
And I got six months hard, for me courtin' in the kitchen

The way you're twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And now there's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime stay and let me watch you break it down

I want a ticket to anywhere 
Maybe we can make a deal 
So maybe together we can get somewhere 
Anyplace is better 
Starting from zero got nothing to lose 
Maybe we'll make something 
But me myself I got nothing to prove 

You got a fast car 
And I got a plan to get us out of here 
I been working at the convenience store 
Managed to save just a little bit of money 
We won't have to drive too far 
Just 'cross the border and into the city 
You and I can both get jobs 
And finally see what it means to be living 

See, my old man's got a problem 
He lives with the bottle that's the way it is 
His body's too old for working 
His body's too young to look like his 
My mama went off and left him 
She wanted more from life than he could give 
I said somebody's got to take care of him 
So I quit school and that's what I did 

You got a fast car 
But is it fast enough so we can fly away 
We gotta make a decision 
We leave tonight or live and die this way 

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car 
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk 
City lights lay out before us 
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulders 
And I had a feeling that I belonged 
And I had a feeling I could be someone 
Be someone, be someone 

You got a fast car 
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves 
You still ain't got a job 
And I work in a market as a checkout girl 
I know things will get better 
You'll find work and I'll get promoted 
We'll move out of the shelter 
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulders 
And I had a feeling that I belonged 
And I had a feeling I could be someone, 
Be someone, be someone 

You got a fast car 
And I got a job that pays all our bills 
You stay out drinking late at the bar 
See more of your friends than you do of your kids 
I'd always hoped for better 
Thought maybe together you and me would find it 
So I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Gail Ann Dorsey,"Summer comes, and I remember a time
When I was young, and I was always changing my mind
I could be anyone I wanted, travel great travels
I had everything I needed
In a small room I had big ideas
And now I'm trying to hold on to those big ideas

Oh, I know... 
Those days are through, but I still think of you, 
Philadelphia

And all the music... you know, it was my protection
I didn't need no one, 'cause I found affection
In the six strings of an old guitar and my radio
I moved to the beat of the hot streets
Where the people were singing and dancing and waving
Their hands in the air
While my Mama, she shook her head, and she said ""Lord
Have mercy""
 
And once again... The good ol' days are gone; ain't it
Funny how we still carry on, Philadelphia

I had to leave; knew I had to look to other places
To try out my big ideas in front of all these faces
And hope that the lessons and beauty of being young
Someone with the imagination of a child
Could bring a smile to all these faces
From a small room, Room 222, I've seen it happen many
Times before
And I know, I know, I know, I know I'll see it happen
Again
If I can just keep... 

Remembering that those special things... and the big
Ideas 
And all the lovely, lovely music will always be a part

No more time to harvest wheat,
Busy housewives cease their labors,
In the courtroom no debate,
Work on earth is all suspended
As the King comes thro' the gate.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

Happy faces line the hallways,
Those whose lives have been redeemed,
Broken homes that He has mended,
Those from prison He has freed,
Little children and the aged
Hand in hand stand all aglow,
Who were crippled, broken, ruined,
Clad in garments white as snow.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

I can see the marching throng,
The flurry of God's trumpets
Spells the end of sin and wrong:
Regal robes are now unfolding,
Heaven's grandstand's all in place,
Heaven's choir now assembled,
Start to sing ""Amazing Grace!""

Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key

His cross stamped pardon on my very soul

That iron bars and heavy chains can never hold us captive
The Son has made us free and free indeed

Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key

Let Your sweet aroma fill my life
Rose of Sharon, show me
How to grow in beauty in God's sight

Fairest of ten thousand
Make me a reflection of Your light

Let Your love shine through me in the night

Lead me, Lord, I'll follow

Let Your word speak to me
Show me what I've never seen before

You can take what's wrong and make it right

Lord, I've seen a world that's dying
Wounded by the master of deceit
Groping in the darkness
Haunted by the years of past defeat

But then I see You standing near me, Lord
Shining with compassion in Your eyes
I pray, Jesus, shine down on me

In the lane, snow is glistening 
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight, 
Walking in a winter wonderland. 

Gone away is the bluebird 
Here to stay is a new bird 
He sings a love song, as we go along, 
Walking in a winter wonderland. 

In the meadow we can build a snowman 
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 
He'll say, are you married? 
We'll say, no man, 
But you can do the job 
When you're in town 
Later on, we'll conspire 
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made, 
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gaither Vocal Band,"Deep within the heart has always known that there was freedom
Somehow breathed into the very soul of life
The prisoner, the powerless, the slave have always known it
There's something that keeps reaching for the sky

And even life begins because a baby fights for freedom
And songs we love to sing have freedom's theme
Some have walked through fire and flood to find a place of freedom
And some faced hell itself for freedom's dream

Let freedom ring wherever minds know what it means to be in chains
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key
We can be free and we can sing, let freedom ring

God built freedom into every fiber of creation
And He meant for us to all be free and whole
When my Lord bought freedom with the blood of His redemption
His cross stamped pardon on my very soul

I'll sing it out with every breath, I'll let the whole world hear it
This hallelujah anthem of the free
That iron bars and heavy chains can never hold us captive
The Son has made us free and free indeed

Let freedom ring down through the ages from a hill called Calvary
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key
You can be free and you can sing let freedom ring
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key
You can be free and you can sing let freedom ring
You can be free and you can sing, let freedom ring, let freedom ring",Let Freedom Ring [DVD]

Gaither Vocal Band,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.

Heavens gates are open wide.

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude

With memories

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

Send back my love

Gal Costa,"Eu hoje acordei pensando 
Por que eu vivo chorando
Podendo lhe procurar
Se a lágrima é tão maldita
E a pessoa mais bonita
Cobre o rosto pra chorar
E refletindo um segundo
Resolvi pedir ao mundo
Que me fizesse um favor
Para que eu não mais chorasse
Que alguém me ajudasse
A encontrar meu amor
Maestros, músicos, cantores
Gente de todas as cores
Faça este favor pra mim
Quem souber cantar, que cante
Quem souber tocar, que toque
Flauta, trombone e clarim 
Quem puder gritar que grite
Quem tiver apito, apite
Faça esse mundo acordar
Para que onde ela esteja
Saiba que alguém rasteja
Pedindo para ela voltar",Um Favor

Abre fendas, cobre vales
Revolta as águas dos rios

Se perderá no caminho
Na pureza de um limão
Ou na solidão do espinho

And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are swearing to love forever,

And promising never, never to part.

'Til clouds came along to disperse
The joy we had tasted,

And now, when I hear people curse
The chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean.

Let the love that was once a fire
Remain an remember;
Let it sleep like a dead desire
I only remember

When they begin the beguine.

Make them play!

Where do they go? oh I don't know, don't know;
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes,

Oh, dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, oh my dindi.
Oh dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing dindi, happy dindi, when you're with me.

I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do;
I'd let you go away, if you take me with you.

Don't you know, dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river that
Can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.
Can't find the sea that would be me without you dindi.

And people hurry on so peacefully

While my eyes 
Go looking for flying saucers in the sky

Gal Costa,"Meu coração amanheceu pegando fogo
Fogo, fogo
Foi uma morena que passou perto de mim
E que me deixou assim
Morena boa que passa
Com sua graça infernal

Mexendo com nossa raça
Deixando a gente até mal
Meu coração amanheceu pegando fogo
Fogo, fogo
Foi uma morena que passou perto de mim
E que me deixou assim
Mande chamar o bombeiro

Pra esse fogo apagar
E se ele não vem ligeiro
Nem cinzas vai encontrar
Meu coração amanheceu pegando fogo
Fogo, fogo
Foi uma morena que passou perto de mim
E que me deixou assim",Pegando Fogo
Gal Costa,"Teco, teco, teco, teco, teco
Na bola de gude era o meu viver
Quando criança no meio da garotada
Com a sacola do lado
Só jogava p'rá valer
Não fazia roupa de boneca nem tão pouco convivia
Com as garotas do meu bairro que era natural
Subia em postes, soltava papagaio
Até meus quatorze anos era esse meu mal
Com a mania de garota folgazã

Em toda parte que passava
Encontrava um fã
Quando havia festa na capela do lugar
Era a primeira a ser chamada para ir cantar
Assim vivendo eu vi meu nome ser falado
Em todo canto, em todo lado
Até com quem nunca me viu
E hoje a minha grande alegria
É cantar com cortesia
Para o povo do Brasil",Teco Teco (The Sound of Marbles Colliding)
Gal Costa,"Tente passar pelo que estou passando
Tente apagar este teu novo engano
Tente me amar pois estou de amando
Baby, te amo, nem sei se te amo

Tente usar a roupa que eu estou usando
Tente esquecer em que ano estamos
Arranje algum sangue, escreva num pano
Pérola Negra, te amo, te amo

Rasgue a camisa, enxugue meu pranto
Como prova de amor mostre teu novo canto
Escreva num quadro em palavras gigantes
Pérola Negra, te amo, te amo

Tente entender tudo mais sobre o sexo
Peça meu livro querendo eu te empresto
Se inteire da coisa sem haver engano",Pérola Negra

Use a inteligência uma vez só
Quantos idiotas vivem só

Que eu te amo

Quantas vezes eu tentei falar
Que no mundo não há mais lugar
Pra quem toma decisões na vida
Sem pensar

Mas pense outra vez

Eu te amo

Gal Costa,"Lavagem do Bonfim, quinta-feira
Sai da Conceição da Praia a primeira
Talagada de batida na Praça Cairu
Levanta a pista ao alto o Lacerda
Mais parece um corredor que envereda
Uma pista de corrida a correr pro céu azul

Olha a vertigem, Virgem Maria!
Te segura, criatura, que o dia
Inda tá menino moço, o almoço inda tá cru
Segura bem na mão da menina
Poupa o coração, que é só na colina
Que o santo serve o caruru

Timbau, pandeiro, som de guitarra
Tanta roupa branca, tanta algazarra
Zona franca de folia, de fé, de devoção
Foto de lambe-lambe, alegria
Vai passar pelo moinho da Bahia
Mais de trinta graus de calor, amor e emoção

Lembra bem dos degraus da igreja
Guarda um pouco de suor pra que seja
Misturado às águas e às mágoas de lavar o chão
Faz tempo que passou da calçada
Segura os joelhos nessa chegada
Que o peito arde de paixão",Lavagem Do Bonfim

Eu tô te esperando
Vê se não vai demorar

Uma noite longa
Pra uma vida curta
Mas já não me importa

Você não está entendendo
Quase nada do que eu digo

Eu quero é dar o fora

Eu quero tocar fogo neste apartamento
Você não acredita

Te encontrar de qualquer jeito
Pra sentar e conversar
Depois andar de encontro ao vento
Eu preciso respirar
O mesmo are que te rodeia
E na pele quero ter
O mesmo sol que te bronzeia
Eu preciso te tocar
E outra vez te ver sorrindo
E voltar num sonho lindo
Já não dá mais pra viver
Um sentimento sem sentido
Eu precio descobrir
A emoção de estar contigo
Ver o sol amanhecer
Como um dia de domingo

Faz de conta que ainda é cedo
Tudo vai ficar por conta da emoção
Faz de conta que ainda é cedo
E deixar falar a voz do coração",Um Dia de Domingo
Gal Costa,"Eu quero a sorte de um amor tranquilo
Com sabor de fruta mordida
Nós na batida, no embalo da rede
Matando a sede na saliva
Ser teu pão, ser tua comida
Todo amor que houver nessa vida
E algum trocado pra dar garantia

E ser artista no nosso convívio
Pelo inferno e céu de todo dia
Pra poesia que a gente não vive
Transformar o tédio em melodia
Ser teu pão, ser tua comida
Todo amor que houver nessa vida
E algum veneno antimonotonia

E se eu achar a sua fonte escondida
Te alcance em cheio o mel e a ferida
E o corpo inteiro feito um furacão
Boca, nuca, mão, e a tua mente, não
Ser teu pão, ser tua comida
Todo amor que houver nessa vida
E algum remédio que me dê alegria",Anos Dourados

What magic words would capture you

Gal Costa,"Vai minha tristeza
E diz a ela 
Que sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece
Que ela regresse 
Por que eu não posso mais sofrer
Chega de saudade
A realidade
É que sem ela não há paz
Não há beleza
É só tristeza
E a melancolia 
Que não sai de mim
Não sai de mim, não sai

Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos 
Que eu darei na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços
Os abraços 
Hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim
Colado assim, calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos 
E carinhos sem ter fim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio
De você viver sem mim
Não quero mais esse negócio
De você viver sem mim",Chega de Saudade
Gal Costa,"Eu nunca sonhei com você
Nunca fui ao cinema
Não gosto de samba
Não vou a Ipanema
Não gosto de chuva
Nem gosto de sol

E quando eu lhe telefonei
Desliguei, foi engano
Seu nome eu não sei
Esqueci no piano
As bobagens de amor
Que eu iria dizer
É, Ligia, Ligia

Eu nunca quis tê-la ao meu lado
Num fim de semana
Um chope gelado
Em Copacabana
Andar pela praia até o Leblon
E quando eu me apaixonei
Não passou de ilusão

O seu nome rasguei
Fiz um samba-canção
Das mentiras de amor
Que aprendi com você
É, Ligia, Ligia
E quando você me envolver

Nos seus braços serenos
Eu vou me render
Mas seus olhos morenos
Me metem mais medo

Podia comprar-te um vestido
E mais um vidrinho de cheiro

Volta pra casa, fica comigo
Eu te perdoo com raiva e amor
Chega mais perto, moço bonito
Chega mais perto meu raio de sol
A minha casa é um escuro deserto
Mas com você ela é cheia de sol
Molha a tua boca na minha boca
A tua boca é meu doce é meu sal

Mas quem sou eu nesta vida tão louca?
Mais um palhaço no teu carnaval
Casa de sombra vida de monge
Quanta cachaça na minha dor
Volta pra casa, fica comigo
Vem que eu te espero tremendo de amor

Em noite sem lua, pulei a cancela
Cai do cavalo, perdi Gabriela
Oh lua de cera, oh lua singela
Lua feiticeira cadê Gabriela?

Gal Costa,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It’s still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

",As Time Goes By

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Galt MacDermot,"Aquarius, was born the night
The shining stars, needed brighter shining light
Aquarius, was my savior
It came along, like a blast from out of sight

When I was weak, you came along
Enlightened me, covered the sun
You seduced me, I can never ever run

'Cause I, can only lose
When I'm, Aquarius
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed, can hear me call?

Aquarius, is the stardust
It kills the faith, and the only one I trust
It calls your name, and you listen
It steals your soul, and your hunger and your lust

For life, and being free (it's killing me, it's killing me)
It's dragging you, it's killing me (it's killing me, it's killing me)
You seduced me, I can never ever run

Galt MacDermot,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Intro: see murder (talking) with Porsha singing. 
This is a story about my childhood years. 
For all my niggas. 
For my life as a ghetto child. 
. There's so much pain 

Verse 1: ???? 
I remember as a little kid. 
Growing up. Many of my friends didn't make it up to bricks. 
Punished for the shit that they did  it gets so hard to live. 
Mama cut the same tears  livin' in fears. 
Wondering if their son died or survived. 
But mama, I'm cutting the 45. 
I die, tell mama don't cry. 
Dry eyes, ‘cause how I live. I know to smile. 
A young misbehaved child, running in the streets wild. 
Try to make my money, pop. 
My eyes are getting slim. 
And my life is getting down, and I feeling like death is near. 
And I'm hoping that the heaven's here. 
I cry, ‘cause the Lord knows how m! any years I've tried. 
But this life's a lie. It ain't not a hope unless a nigga die. 
Lord why!!, Lord why!! 

Verse 2: ???? 
My childhood years was kinda rough because my pops weren't there. 
I was left to peer. Always pay but no one to share. 
These hard times, stressin' to sell nickels and dimes. 
Had to support my family, no one else was puttin' time. 
Reminiscing about on dead peers troughout the the years. 
No more tears, my childhood years with scrilla fifth. 
Who's the maycliff for all this fucking fight to stop a nigga. 
Just a price I have to pay, nigga. 
My childhood years 

Chorus repeated once: see-Murder (Porsha singing in the background) 
My childhood years, got my shit in tears. 
It's hella scary. 
I'm trapped, and I don't want to die in a cemetery. 
This ghetto ties got me livin' in pain. 
Lord knows I don't want to die in vain. 

Verse 3: see-Murder 
My childhood years was spend in cemeteries bearing my peers. 
Many tears, that I have shaded, for my niggas disappeared. 
In a bad year. Now with depressed in just memory. 
Drinking Hennessy. To dry away my misery. 
Trapped since birth, a ghetto child living in curse. 
It's getting worse, until I'm covered up in dirt. 
The pain it hurts. 
That be the reason why my blast first. 
‘Cause I refuse to be a victim in the black hears. 
Memories up with child runnin' wild. 
I couldn't smile, because my motherfuckin' life was foul. 
A troubled child, stressin' from his childhood years. 
Heavenly father. Could you please wipe away my tears. 

Verse 4: Reginelli 
I could remember way back, when a! nigga was sick. 
I just to watch my brother do some dangerous shit. 
Staying out all night, mama worrying sick. 
Wondering if he was dead or just play with a bitch. 
But when I saw this wild nigga came up like I did. 
When I eat dwellars, when the niggas start to slanging that shit. 
I tight up on my hustle. Start to paying the bills. 
Shading tills, ‘cause my brother got locked up for three years. 
After that a nigga start to grabbin' the mic. 
Write rap, on sheet of paper, making solider shit tight. 
Three years later, my brother came home from jail. 
Tellin' me he wrote rap, when he was strapped in a cell. 
A week later, we was some No limit soliders.

But you can tell a nigga been shading some tears. 
By the way I live.

Instead of yellin' out peace and niggas still ain't free
Who's to blame for my fuckin' broken family
Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me
But turn my father to a muthafuckin' dope fiend
And it's plain and see
The government they got plans for me
It's a penitentary
Preachers, they usually see another felony
I rather die wit' my glock n my hand
Then let them bastard ass judges lock me up again
I know I'm livin' a sin
But it's all that was given
N this world of breed
I take a hit of the weed
So all my niggas won't you breed wit' me
Keep your eyes open nigga, don't fall asleep
It's a clean sweep 'cause these cops got beef

chorus 2X

[Melichoir]
It's a clean sweep muthafuckas
Don't get caught n this game
These fuckin' laws premeditatin' wit' them pistols on name
I been cursed wit' what it was worth so I'm cockin' back my uzi
Fuck it, I rather bust before I let these bitches do me
A clean sweep 
Fuck you gettin' these blacks up out tha streets
Talkin' 'bout stop the violence when y'all steady pushin' heat
Our government is goin' sour
Everybody want the power
So watch your back my niggas, they down' to y'all every hour

[Reginelli]
Let it be know, Tuesdays and Thursdays a clean sweep
You gotta be careful not to get caught n tha city streets
The FEDz
The N.O.P.D's
want to lock every hustla up and throw away the keys
It's hard to stop hustlin' when you know you doin' bad
You want to hop n that fast lane, and spend you some cash
A few of my homies put n tha cell for life
And finally a second chance, so they can think twice
A nigga can't even watch or shoot dice for fun
Here come the police now, a nigga gotta run
Sometimes I fear I'm trapped n a white world
It's hard for a black person to make up a bundle sell
The government taxin', the police is hatin'
Everywhere that a nigga go, I feel it was satan
Maybe it's time for me to get off tha city streets
Before the law fuckin' go off, A CLEAN SWEEP

chours 4X

[Pheno]
It's a clean sweep 
For niggas like me that's totin' heat
I play the game for keeps
Til' I'm buried 6 feet
Crooked police
They usin' up my name n vein
Hate to see a nigga ballin' worldwide n this rap game
Who to blame
For them niggas disappear doin' 20 years
Wit' the president, open your eyes and ears
To this shit that's goin' on n my community
There's never unity
Until my niggas is free
The penitentary for the muthafuckas like me
That was swept off his feet n this white man's society
Pushin' dope's the only way to survive
Government put that shit here so we can live or die 
Killed to cry
I wonder why niggas stay high
Runnin' the streets, these muthafuckas fuckin' wit' me
Why must it be
You never want to put me n the clean sweep
They want to put me n the clean sweep

Lookin' for ways to keep from hustlin'
I wasn't born to be nothin'
And my muthafuckin' life is cursed
And I plan to see these streets for everything it was worth
And my momma lookin' at me like I was dead in a burst
Since the loss of my uncle,
My pain it got worse And it hurts to see my
Momm fallin' down in tears
And to me, my life ain't clear
Got me livin' in fear
Sheddin' tears, for my dead peers
Who's to blame for my muthafuckin' 
Pain that I'm feelin' inside

Well nigga don't cry keep your head up and roll wit' this pressure
Control this pain that you feelin' 'cause it's only to test ya
Drama, I've been in since I left the wooms of my momma
Still trynna cope wit situations left behind me
Will I ever find another way even though I pray
Judgement day ain't far away from what my momma say

Walk the streets wondering I'mma die or stay alive
I could recall bein' bad on the streets hustlin' for mine
I use to hustle wit' dimes
Now I'm hustlin' wit' rhymes
The FED's is watchin',
The police is crooked everywhere that a nigga go,
The law trynna book me
I grew up in the ghetto I'm sheddin' tears
And livin' in fear
Late at night, trynna sleep, shots rang out my ears
I'm present in this game, I feel the end is close
The other day I could've sworn I see a fuckin' ghost
It's hard to survive in the fuckin' N.O.
You never know when it's yo time to go

They got me livin' in a world that's full of despise
I can't cope wit' the authorities wit' this red in my eyes
So I proceed across the battlefield bustin' for glory
These demons preachin' for my soul, but I be damned if I'm buried
I got shit to live for I got dreams to forfill
If I die today or tomorrow, who gon' pick up the steel
Don't let mind deceive ya, you either kill or get killed
You muthafuckas ain't feelin' me, so it's best you get real
These fuckin' laws got a nigga stressin' but I'm a thug
Ain't no love on these streets for blacks wit' drawin' blood

Game,"Yeah, Fort Knocks, Aftermath, Compton to Jersey
What y'all fools know about perculatin on lo-los?
Mics and six-fo's nigga
Ha ha, no more hand claps, please nigga
Here we go - Just Blaze!

To all my niggas on the porch gettin they hair braided
Cornrowed by a L.A. bitch
And I can't forget, my niggas ridin the train, Yankee fitted
Snub nose under that Pelle shit
I love New York, but gangbangin that's L.A. shit
And I'm proud of it, spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are, you can turn it down, fuck it {*volume fades*}
{*volume rises*} I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangster, let the 40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than 'Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot, the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where you forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doin life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Then break up the streets of Compton
Spread my blood in the pavement

Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

Who I gotta talk to, who I gotta write
Get my Reebok deal done or I'm stayin in Air Nikes, aight?
I handle bars, you ain't gotta ride a bike
To beat Game in his skills, here go some trainin wheels
Let's roll, through the City of God, where niggas trained to kill
We'll chop you up a hundred times worse than the Haitians will
F'real, nah f'real I need a track homey
Dre we too close, ain't no turnin back homey
Deal with it, I'mma be here for ten years
Spittin like the ghost of Eric Wright and Big here
Let me paint this picture while you sit here
Thinkin in the back of your mind, this is the shit, yeah
I spit for niggas doin 25 on they fifth year
Ready to throw a nigga off the fifth tier
Them white boys in the Abercrombie & Fitch gear
And every nigga who ever helped me to get here

Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

It go one brick, two brick, the boy movin weight
Now three bricks, four bricks, I'm drivin upstate
Five bricks, six bricks, the nigga got cake
Not rap money, but money been wrapped since eighty-eight
Look at the world we live in, niggas steady hate
'til the Heckler and Koch, leave 'em chopped up like Freddie's face
Niggas catchin feelings cause I'm about millions
And out of all the newcomes out, my flow the illest
You a close second nigga, banana to a gorilla
Put us in the same cage, and I'mma have to peel him
The best of both worlds, rappin and drug dealin
Run and tell Lateef I came to burn down the village
The head honcho, starin out the third story window
Of my Beverly Hills condo
Two long-ass Heats, I call 'em Shaq and Alonzo
You niggas want me out of L.A., geah I know

Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

Game,"Yo Havoc, I'm too close to the edge on this one nigga
I ain't gon' jump though, I'mma keep it raw gutter
Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga

I got shit on my chest, I must confess
Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin I gotta teach my son

I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change

I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'mma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is

I don't need your love, no no no no

Cause, the, game, don't, change

I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nothing between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packing toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot
On my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war

Because these conjugal visits just ain't enough
I'm really looking forward to a future for us
Baby don't worry 'bout it
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you

Even took a second job
So they won't take the clause and put a lean on the
House
I know it's gonna be a while before you get out, ooh
Baby don't worry 'bout it (don't worry)
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you

And them dudes you ran with are foul
They been tryna get at me, ever since you been down
Even my girls are tellin me, I should end it all now
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be

All I can think about is that honey complexion
And the way your skin glow when you slippin on them Dior dresses
I know you wonderin why I got you a Smith 'n Wesson
Cause them niggas in the hood is the reason we stressin
I miss that gangsta love and that lil' affection
Them butter soft lips when you kissin my chest and
Mary I put nuttin above you
And behind that vest I got a heart ma gangstas need love too

Some think the worst of you
They portray you as a man, it's not that far from the truth
You were caught up in the game and now it's, caught up to you
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin on you

It used to be caramel skin tones, Sprewell rims on
Glass house, ass out, Jacob watch, gemstones
Bandanna, Nike Airs, tennis bracelet, wife hair
Black rag, do or die, .45 right here
Every time I was down, you was always right there
Whenever visitin hours came, I know my wife there
So pink diamonds right here, chain hang, ice there
The reason for my tattooed tear - I need you to hold me down

I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here whenever you call me babe)
I'll be waiting on you (ooh-oh)
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin on you

I'm locked up countin the days down
Tryna hold my head cause the penitentiary ain't no playground
I'm dyin in here and I don't know how you stay down
In the shootin range twice a week bustin that trey-pound
I would never ask you to wait around
But how do a white sandy beach in St. Tropez sound?
And no more outta town trips on that Greyhound
Just me hittin like a beat from Dr. Dre, out

I'll be waiting on you (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here, for you ba-by)
I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
Baby don't worry about it (don't worry babe)
I'mma be right here (I'ma be) waitin on you

I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here waitin for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (you know I will)
I'll be waiting on you (whenever you need me baby)
Baby don't worry about it (I'll be right here, I'll be right here)
I'mma be right here, waitin on you (don't you worry)

I'm lookin' for a future with you baby
Wanna see you real soon, real soon, real soon

Game,"A lot of people are advocated 
That the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer
That's only because you don't understand
Whats going to happen to you, 
You see its all just a game ladies and gentlemen
And the quality of your living depends entirely 
Upon your ability to play the game
And I play the game",Intro to the Documentary
Game,"[Verse 1: The Game]
June 30th, 11:07 I got that call
She 8 centimeters, my lil' man about to fall
Scuffing my Air Forces, running through the hospital hall
Deja Vu, like I been here before
I'm feeling reborn, like a Bed-Stuy brethren, my first born
Dre, I'm about to have a bad boy, family in the lobby
See my nigga Church, ""What Up,"" shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating
I swear to God every minute's starting to feel like a second
I seen Hell staring down the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to Heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it
Spread my wings, If only I could fly
Why fight to live homie?, If we only living to die

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

[Verse 2: The Game]
They say every time somebody die a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11:32, she screaming at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yelling for the doctor to come
All I could remember was Lamaze class, breathe baby
""One (one), two (two), three (three), four (four),"" I see the head
Doc busting through the door, he between the legs 
He see the head, it's my baby boy
11:46, the head out, she screaming, making crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's
Voices singing to me, sound like Teena Marie
I'm calling niggas on tour, ""Jayo tell ? I just cut the umbilical cord""
11:57, a soldier is born, and he's flesh of my flesh, young ? ?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: The Game]
I want to thank Dr. Dre and Nurse Theresa, for bringing my baby boy to life
You birthed a Caesar, And my baby Mama, Aliska
For pushing out a 10-pound, 4-ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose, ears, eyes, chin, just like your Daddy 
I die before you grow up and be just like your Daddy, or your Grandfather
Call Uncle Dre, tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm popping Cris with your Godfathers, Baron Davis and ""D-Mack"" Darius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71, with my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Aaron Wright, T'Yan and Lil' Pun
Lowriding, banging ""Ready to Die,"" track number 1
If I bust 5 times and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun, one

[Chorus: x2]","Like Father, Like Son"

I was in that Aftermath chain, you was in pearls
It was me against the world baby girl; you had dreams of stardom
The Prince of Compton meets the Queen of Harlem
First date at Mr. Chao's it was kosher, I wore culture
The fur, the Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada, Dolce
You're runnin circles in my living room, tearin up sofas
McLaren or Rover, fuck it ma let's tear up the highway
Let the Sprewells spin 'til the plates fall off
Then we can go one-on-one in Dre's house
Jeans painted with the waist cut out, you rock 'em the fly way
That lil' bit of Compton mixed with Bed-Stuy way
And girl, I'm not tryin to excite you, I'm tryin to wife you

The way you smile, the way you swingin them hips when you walk
The way you look, the way you ride when you workin them thighs
The way you lickin your lips when you look in my eyes
You down for me? I'm down for you
You go down on me, I'll go down on you
I wanna do all the things that your man won't do
I'm from the hood, so I know how to handle you
Keep you in pink rocks and G-Unit canvas shoes
Show you how to gangsta lean when the Lambo move
I'll take you to New York City, Atlanta too
Show you how to fly them birds and them hammers through
And you know

Let me tell you 'bout the birds and bees
How I stand on the block all day and flip birds and ki's
Your boyfriend don't like me, cause he don't get a fourth of my cheese
And you can take back the Porsche and his keys
Hop in the Range Rover, you ain't gotta force him to leave
I got a chrome four-four in my jeans
You got Gucci frames coverin the mark on your face
Cause he don't want you to leave, and I don't want you to stay
Sometimes I wanna snatch that nigga out his CLK
I know he treatin you the way K-Ci did Mary J
I wanna, ease your pain, kick off your Louis sandals
Let me, wipe your tears with my G-Unit bandana
You make me wanna peel you out them jeans when you rockin them

You wanna piece of me?
Ohh man, shit
The story of my life

If I could start from scratch, I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same four-fifth
Same G-wagon, same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same ""Dogg Food"" album bangin in my tape deck
Homey if I can make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I woulda told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I woulda cut off the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne
Dre said it's my turn, he call it Game time
23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole 'K, got shot one time
That was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
It's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holla back
I got a confession to make, it's called payback
If you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

I woulda told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe, you gotta watch where your birds lay
Woulda told V to stay sober
When niggas ""Beg for Mercy,"" that mean the beef is over
Told Meeks take the Porsche back, drive the Rover
Told Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I woulda changed a couple of lines when I wrote ""Soldier""
So I wouldn't have to live lookin over my shoulder
My life is like a Impala, ridin three-wheel motion
I been front to back, side to side
Level my six-four frame out, keep on rollin
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture this, The Source suckin Benzino's dick
Tryin to be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when that green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch, you couldn't change that

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that

Of Aftermath straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game bitch

Yeah mothafuckas
Compton's back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game let's go

Me and Marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But its hard when they hate us and think 'Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them
Shady one of the greatest like Biggie n' Pac was
We saw the throne was empty and decided to chase it
Me, him and 50 racin' this rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Thinkin what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA, NWA shit
The media is bullshit now we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired this black shit this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame
Bitch you're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face
Which- way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving in my face
Looking for answers, rap sensation Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted
The Mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting too much time
Me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't going

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

Low get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em' just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 mile, startin' to get home sick
I'mma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is anybody armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For tellin me its hot when its not and you got what you got
From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin Dre you got shot
With a Glock that don't phase me
I'm crazy why the fuck you think I'm rhyming with Shady ?
I don't care if the radio don't play me
I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks

So I'm gone bitch

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power",We Ain't
Game,"Uhh, uhh, gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, it's gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, shit I'm livin' gangsta gangsta shit
Yeah

[Chorus: x2]
I'm from Compton, Compton, Murderville
You heard these niggas is gangsters, and they kill
Rob and steal, my niggas will peel at will
For real they real, niggas goin' feel this steel

Walk with me through the ghetto where the packs get sold
And them niggas sellin' the work ain't half as old
as the fiends and the hippies, same ones smokin' since the 60's
Everybody yellin' gimme, gimme

Every nigga in the hood, one hand on his jimmy
Other hand grip the semi, come on walk with me
Every ten houses, one got 'caine for sale
And I give you a dope track like my name Phar-rell

And you can get that stainless steel
Walk in my Chuck Taylors for a day, if you think it ain't f'real
When I buy rocks homey baguettes on my ring
And only neighborhood watch is my Tecno Marine

Keep a (Mac) on the block, I ain't talkin 'bout Beans
QB in the hood and I'm far from Queens
The boys in the hood is always hard
So come through and get smoked like a Cuban cigar

[Chorus]

I'm from Compton, Compton, a block from hell
And you can come get a bird for eleven
And we ain't got a penny for the reverend, a dime for a witness
Only (Church's) in the hood sell chicken (ba-KAW)

Every nigga in the hood sell chickens move work like city buses
You fuckin' with the Hub City Hustler
The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home
So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone

Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone
And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up

In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggas to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin' about if y'all seen where..

[Chorus]

We drug dealin', but niggas is squealin' (fuck you rats)
What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood
Now is this under-stood?

I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin' the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood

Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggas ball, some niggas do what we do
And other niggas sing for Cash Money like TQ

The block will heat and sink you (hey dude)
Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude
Lose your life tryin' to get these jewels
I keep the 40 cal wrapped in chrome like R2-D2

[Chorus]",Compton Compton
