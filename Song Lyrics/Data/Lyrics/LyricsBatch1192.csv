Sunscreem,"(Release me)
I can't stand the way that you make me, I feel pressure
I can't stop the way that you place me, under pressure


The sound flew in the bare room, the ride's no longer spare
And time will always fall apart in a house where they don't care
We fantasized your life
And recognized the sins
But it's tit for tat, you take the rap
Now it's me that's gonna win

I can't stand the way that you make me, I feel pressure
I can't stop the way that you place me, under pressure

You've got chalk on the sidewalk, and the telephone always rings
I'd rip the cord out, pull the wire out, kick it on the shins
You paralysed the gold mine
And the trains are standing still
They pull you back and now you're trapped
As they move in for the kill
(For the kill) 

I can't stand the way that you make me, I feel pressure
I can't stop the way that you place me, under pressure
I can't stand the day that you wake me, I feel pressure
(Release me)
I can't stand the way that you break me, under pressure
(Release me)

Everytime I walk out in the sun the rain will come and really cry

Release me

We found you in the spare room with your eyes no longer there
The lamp flex led up to your heart like a divers cord for air
We electrolysed your mind
And analyzed your limbs
Escapist crap, I've had all that
Now it's me that's gonna win
(I'm gonna win) 

I can't stand the way that you make me, I feel pressure
I can't stop the way that you place me, under pressure
I can't stand the day that you wake me, I feel pressure
I can't stand the way that you break me, under pressure
(Release me)

I can't stand the way you disgrace me, I feel pressure
(Release me)
I can't stop the way that you hate me, I feel pressure
(Release me)

Everytime I walk out in the sun the rain will come and really cry

Now I can't be me at all
Now I can't be me at all
Now I can't be me at all",Pressure

Trip on this

On a hazy Sunday
When the world thinks it's alright
And mother hears the news say
""It's a crime, it's black and white""
Showing out is easy
I wouldn't want to be in her shoes
Well maybe you can see me
Don't run, move on, catch me if you can

Walk on the face of love, walk on
Well so long, I'm gonna trip you up

Oh yesterday was Friday
And you held your hand in mine
A law of spite and hearsay
Well we don't mind, they're wasting time
Even if you made me
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes
A diva if you paid me
To be some high class jackass licking from your hand

Walk on the face of love, walk on
Well so long, I'm gonna trip you up

Trip on this, even if you made me
Like a goody-goody two shoes
No time to be a lady
Well this is our space, our place, don't they understand?

Walk on the face of love, walk on
So long, I'm gonna trip you up
(trip you up) Walk on the face of love, walk on
So long, I'm gonna trip you up

Walk on",Walk On

Sunscreem,"I was looking for you
Now I'm looking at you

When I come home at night
I look into the hallway mirror
and I'm looking at you
I can't escape your face
I see reflections in the water,
and I'm looking at you

But still I try
to get by
and I know I'll die
Looking at you

There is a hollow in the bed
Where you lie, slept, I took a picture
Are you laughing at me?
I scratched your records, dear
and threw them in the nearest river
Are you laughing at me?

Still I try
to get by
and I know I'll die
looking at you

Now I hear laughter
and no more pain inside
But sometimes I wonder,
whose blind eye's gazing at you?

If fame and fortune come,
I'll be looking forward to the future
And I'll be waiting for you
Somewhere a dizzy blonde
is staring into her cold coffee,
and she's looking at you

Still I try
to get by
and I know I'll die
looking at you

Still I try
to put you out of mind
but I know I'll die
looking at you",Looking at You [Jimmy Gomez 6AM Dub]

How love will fall behind
These consequences
React on mind too

Thrown out

Sunset Sons,"My mother's afraid of the subway
It's a living bad dream
I hold her hand as the doors close
And she pales and stifles a scream
Ali's afraid of Ad-libbing
Of improvising at jams
She is not very happy right now
And spends all her money on grams
Ade is afraid of commitment
So Carla dumped him today
She is very disappointed
She was hoping he'd beg her to stay
Ayo he just wants a girlfriend
He's afraid of dying alone
He doesn't go out very much
Sits at home a lot getting stoned

You see fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peeps
There is usually one thing that keeps
Us off track
It is fear, It is fear, It is fear

Ella is worried about her weight
She won't eat in public anymore
She is fucking her ex again
When they've finished
She sleeps on the floor
Nate has a heart of gold
But give it away he will not
His mother abandoned him at ten
It's a pain he has never forgot
Mary's afraid of herself
Her sentences often cut half
She will never give her own opinion
She's afraid that people might laugh
And I am afraid of sharks
I will not swim out past my head
And sometimes I worry
My boyfriend will die
My first love is already dead

You see fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peeps
There is usually one thing that keeps
Us off track
It is fear, It is fear, It is fear

You see fear is only holding us back

Candy is having a baby
She fears she will be like her mom
Her friends say relax take a
Deep breath
And march to a different drum
Sachas afraid of her Marco
She think's that it's all her fault
But if he did what he does to a
Stranger
He'd be locked up and charged
With assault

Sunset Sons,"I win, you lose
It's only for us two
I win, you lose

I remember days when we were all alone
If you would ever leave me
I would call your phone
We would talk for days
And never leave my home
I think about it

Always found a reason to be strong apart
Always wondered if and when you'd break my heart
You would try and argue with me from the start
I can live without it

Come on and baby take my hand now
Remember when we used to say now
It's where it all began
It's where we always hide it

You're tired of being disregarded
You wonder why you're broken hearted
We've been here times before
We've been here since it started

Yeah

I win, you lose
It's only for us two
I win, you lose

Funny how we can leave things just the way they are
Having fun with you wasn't so bizarre
But we can never be more than an open scar

I think about it

Never took the time to ever wonder why
Could have been if we were caught that we'd be laughing or crying
But we would never learn because we both denied it
I can live without it

Come on and baby take my hand now
Remember when we used to say now
It's where it all began
It's where we always hide it

Sunshine & Bergey,"No surrender, still unhurt, we fly

Intense fiercing war, insult no tolerance 
Against one rule, to fit 'em all 
To blur my eyes already blind 
To keep my hands from moving free

The pulse of what we live, the hate we build inside 
Create my shield, to fight them all 
They see the things they can not be 
To understand they can't be free

No surrender, still unhurt, we fly

We learned the way how to be real 
What we say we live 
It keeps me sane to embrace our will 
And go against inhumanity

How I waited and prayed
That you would

If you love me
You'd work a real job
You wouldn't need all them cars

You wouldn't need all that ice on your arm
Anything to be with me
You would do it

With the light from the glittering stars

Where seldom is heard a discouraging word

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

Let me prove that it adores

Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

If you ever want to take it on the road 
You can't sit around 
Or the bad times are gonna get to you

It won't always be such stormy weather 
It may be a cliche but the sun is gonna shine

And you're never gonna see it through 

It don't matter where you've been 
It's where you're going to 
Yeah, and it won't do you no good 
Just livin' in the past

You get me on my feet 
You help me spread that heavy load 

Now that I realize 
Just where our friendship lies 
It will help me down that road 

You think you've seen my best 
But you ain't seen nothin' yet 
Since you, help me down that road 

When life is a bitter sweet 
You mix it up a treat 
Yeah, you're the best pick up I know 

If you don't satisfy 
Don't give me the evil eye

You never kiss and tell 
You just help me down that road

Then I don't feel so all alone 

When I can't get it right 
Just when the end's in sight

I'm stuck in back room, somewhere

Goin' to get out soon, I got places to go

I just need a break, someone to believe
but right now I'm just tryin' to survive
Livin' rough, shackin' up, hangin' tough, shapin' up

Get the picture, get the scene I paint fo ryou

Beat the sidewalk, hear the fast talk, everyday
I don't worry 'cause I know I'm on my way

The view from my window, ain't too good
Should be some mail for me soon from Hollywood
When the phone rings, could be big things, anytime
Operator is there somethin' wrong with this line

Rejections, I've had a few
Happens to the best, it ain't nothin' new
Still I keep on swingin' away
S'gonna be a breakthrough any day

Keep hanging in there, that's my philosophy
And soon I'll find my big chance, wait and see
Some make it fast, but they just come and go
Me, I'm built to last and that's one thing I know

Those straight life people, they don't understand
Yeah they just want it all laid out and planned
Me, I'm not like them, I do things my own way
I know I'm gonna break through any day

Life in the city, can get you down
There's amillion guys out there all snooping around
You gotta think you're the best, beat out all the rest
And fight your way up to the top of the town

Right now I'm just tryin' to survive

You gotta listen to me 
Getta hold of your life 
And you can have a new dream 
Forget the ups and the downs 
There's a new game in town 
For every turn in the road 
There's a new way to go 

I don't hear what you say 
Gonna find my own way 
You just try to persuade 
Everyone around you 

We'll make it easy for you 
Plane everything that you do 
Won't have to work very hard 
You'll make it big from the start 
Don't have to take it from me 
Here's a list you can see 
Every one of those names 
They found their fortune and fame 

Well it all sound so sweet 
So simple, so neat 
Ah but I can't believe 
Anything you tell me 

I know your life's a big mistake 
Let's go, this music you must face 

Listen to me please, get down upon your knees 
They'll never treat you like they did before 
I'll make your dreams come true 
Now all I need is you 
Please believe me and all this will be yours 

You'll have a penthouse in town 
You'll be the king with a crown 
Live on country estate 
You'll have a twenty foot gate 
Getting tanned at the pool 
You'll be making them drool 
Taking trip overseas 
Do anything that you please 

Well I feel so alone 
Where did I go so wrong? 
Do you know? Can you tell? 
Maybe can you help me 

I know, it's hard for you to take 
Let's go, this move you have to make 

Listen to me please, I'm down upon your knees 
They'll never treat you like they did before 
I'll make your dreams come true

Supertramp,"The situation's clear 
It's fine as long as you are here 
Of that I'm really sure 
I will live to love you more 

The say you drag me down 
They try to tell me your around 
Just to even up a score 
But I will live to love you more 

And the say I've been blind 
That you deceive me every time 
And soon our love will end 
But I will live to love you again 

So what if they can't see 
You know I'll love endlessly 
And this they can't ignore 
I will live to love you more 

I know they're only rumors 
Although they say the truth hurts 
I don't need to hear lies 
And fantasize you leaving me 

But when I think it all over 
And over and over 
I still want you around me 
You know you astound me 
I couldn't live without you 

If there's a price to pay 
It's worth it just to hear you say

My every thought is 
I will live to love you more",Live to Love You
Supertramp,"I went back my home town 
To the school and walked around 
And the way it felt 
It seemed just like yesterday 

From the cradle to the grave 
Some say we never change 
No matter how we try 
We try to rearrange 

Life father so like son 
It's as if wife we're both as one 
Just as if our fate was preordained 

In some countries far from here 
You know the one s we used to fear 
Are they waiting to return to 
Those old evil ways 

You can take a correspondence course 
Be single married or divorced 
You can psychoanalyze your brain 
But you know some things will never change 

And what will those people do 
When Russia starts anew 
They'll just stand in line 
All under a different name 

You can listen to those brainwash tapes 
Take a Jewish, Catholic, Buddhist faith 
But I'm sure it's gonna be in vain 
'cause you know some things will never change 

If their theories all come true 
Then there's nothin' we can do 
Where the future lies 
Well it's not to hard to tell 

But after all is said and done 
And if the world it lives as one 
You can bid those old taboo's

Yes a fond fare well 
A very long fare well",Some Things Never Change

Sooner or later I'm gonna get over her 

You know I can't go on like this 
It's just a matter time 
There'll come a day when I will wake up 
Without her on my mind 

Sooner or later it's gonna get better 
Sooner or later I'm gonna get over her 

They say that time will heal everything 
So I'm winding the clock 
And waiting for that glorious moment 
When my heartache will stop 

She let me go 
It took me by surprise

Where there's a will, there's a way 
That's what that'll say 

When the writing is on the wall 
And if you could fall 
When your best ain't good enough 
And life's tough 

When the lad of hope and dreams 
Isn't always what it seems 
Where there's a will, there's a way 
They always say 

You may be sorry, you may be sad, you may be blue 
You think you'll never see the sun come breaking through 
You struggle morning noon and night 
And you still I can't get it right

We gotta keep on, keepin' on

Through all your sorrows 
All your dreams, and all your joys 
In times of sadness, 
In time of grief 
And even times that you enjoy 
As your life you live it through 
You know it all depends on you 

And if where there's a will, there's a way 
You better get down and pray 
From the cradle to the grave 
You better say it every day 

When the crime's above the law 
When the plane's about to fall 
When the mighty oceans roar 
When tomorrow's at your door

Like two ships in the night in foggy weather,
Just a waitin' for fresh winds to blow.
Maybe we're losin' one another
I could be wrong I don't know 

You get the best, I get the rest 
You pass the test, I'm just a mess 
You got it made, I'm in the shade

Like two dopes in the boat, without a paddle 
Just a wonderin' why it don't go 
We could be losin' one another 
I could be wrong I don't know

I was up before the dawn
And I really have enjoyed my stay
But I must be moving on

Like a king without a castle
Like a queen without a throne
I'm an early morning lover
And I must be moving on

Now I believe in what you say
Is the undisputed truth
But I have to have things my own way
To keep me in my youth

Like a ship without an anchor
Like a slave without a chain
Just the thought of those sweet ladies
Sends a shiver through my veins

And I will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me
My troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger it's been nice
Hope you find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true

Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane
Will we ever meet again
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain

Sweet devotion (Goodbye, Mary)
It's not for me (Goodbye, Jane)
Just give me motion (Will we ever)
To set me free (Meet again?)

And some you just can't tell
And some they will and some they won't

And that'll never bother me
Say the devil is my saviour
But I don't pay no heed

And I will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me
My troubles will be few
