Sue Keller,"Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing, and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square
In the frosty air

what a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

giddy up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a mingle to a jinglin' beat
That's the jingle bell rock

(Jing rock, jing rock, yeah, jing rock, jing rock, jing rock, jing rock, jing rock, jing rock)

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock

Sue Keller,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee

Sue Keller,"Oh, hmm
Where are you Christmas
Why can't I find you
Why have you gone away
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me
Why can't I hear music play

My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too

Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go

Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh

If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time

Oh, I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away, oh
The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart with love

Where are you Christmas
Fill your heart with love","Where Are You, Christmas?"
Sue Matthews,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Sue Matthews,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay
Sue Matthews,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Sue Matthews,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast",I Fall in Love Too Easily
Sue Matthews,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.",I Want to Be Happy
Sue Matthews,"The sun comes up
I think about you
The coffee cup
I think about you
I want you so
It's like I'm losing my mind
The morning ends

I think about you
I talk to friends
I think about you
And do they know?
It's like I'm losing my mind
All afternoon, doing every
Little chore The thought of
You stays bright Sometimes
I stand in the middle of
The floor

Not going left, not going right
I dim the lights

And think about you
Spend sleepless nights
To think about you
You said you loved me
Or were you just being kind?
Or am I losing my mind?
I want you so

It's like I'm losing my mind
All afternoon, doing every
Little chore The thought of
You stays bright Sometimes

About you Spend sleepless
Nights to think about you You
Said you loved me

Or were you just being kind?
Or am I losing my mind?",Losing My Mind
Sue Matthews,"So often as I wait for sleep I find myself reciting
The words I've said or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting

The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning

I relived the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid along the roads I wandered

Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two

If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you",On My Way to You
Sue Medley,"Hey mister, mister, standin' on the comer
I see you got some cigarettes
You know I'll gladly pay you back sometime
Just as long as you don t mind the wait

Hey sister, sister, standin' on the comer
With your tight skirts and hair astray
Do you dream the same things I dream?
Oh and what's that I hear you say?

Well she said
Someday, I'll be ridin'
In a 57 Chevrolet
She'll have whitewalls
Headlights like diamonds
Someday
Someday

A long love letter is what she sent him
The ink and paper just made him cry
Well, his mighty jaw dropped when
He asked why she was leaving and
It was too much too much for one man's pride

Well I've been searching this whole world over
And I keep hoping for some things to come my way
When I find my four leaf clover
You'll see me come driving by in my big ole Chevrolet

Someday, I'll be ridin'
In a 57 Chevrolet
She'll have whitewalls
Headlights like diamonds
Someday

Sue Medley,"She don't know the difference
Between light and dark
She's watching the clock
Keeping time with her heart
She don't know much about anything
But she knows the pain that love can bring

I wish someone would tell her
That a sign will come
It'll flash in neon
Saying ""Walk, don't run""
Just a short walk over to the other side
Where the grass is greener and dreams never die

Just when you think your life is over
You're twenty-one and looking for
Your four-leaf clover
Luck has nothing to do with it
Take control and go right to it
Start it all over again

She's waiting on the doorstep
For the morning mail
Maybe a letter from a friend
Only time will tell
She counts each crack in the walk below
Like she counts the hours she waits by the phone
 
Just when you think your life is over
You're twenty-one and looking for
Your four-leaf clover
Luck has nothing to do with it
Take control and go right to it
Start it all over again

She don't know the difference

Luck has nothing to do with it
Take control and go right to it
Start it all over again

Just when you think your life is over
Just when you think it might be over
You gotta keep on looking, start it over
Just when you think it might be over
Ooooh yeah, start it over",Start It Over
Sue Medley,"You used to think that your life was in order
Knew how to get up and how to get ahead
Now these days you're living south of the border
Hiding out and sleeping in a different bed

But that's life
That's right

How many times did my friends always tell me
That man he just don't treat you right
Stays out all night til the wee little hours
Wake up girl, don't you see the light

That's life
That's right
That's life
That's life
That's life

My head starts hurtin'
When I turn out the lights

Can't seem to leave this crazy world to the night
No more tears, cause my well has run dry
Now I think it's time to leave this town
Now I think it's time I'm cornin' around

I used to think that my life was in order
I knew how to get up and how to get ahead
Now these days I'm living south of the border
Hangin' out and sleeping in my own bed

That's life
That's right

Sue Palmer,"I was just minding my business
Life was a beautiful song
Didn't have a care nor worry
Then you had to come along
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle, they bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
Maybe you think I'm all lies
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in
Them there eyes
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue

Sue Palmer,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunnyside of the Street
Sue Palmer,"I'm confessin' that I love you,
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,

I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin'

You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo [Live]
Sue Pasquale,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Sue Raney,"A blossom fell,From off a tree,
It settled softly on the lips you turned to me 
The gypsies say, and I know why 
A  falling blossom only touches lips that lie 

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon 
I thought you loved me 
You said you loved me 

We planned together to dream forever 
The dream has ended for true love died 
The night a blossom fell and touched two lips that lied.

Sue Raney,"I get the blues when it rains
Those blues I can't lose when it rains
Each little raindrop falling on my window pane
Always reminds me of the tears I've shed in vain

Now I sit and wait for that sun
To shine down on me just once again
It rained when I found you
It rained when I lost you
That's why I'm so blue when it rains

Sue Raney,"April showers, overhead offer me a chance
To protect her from the rain and cultivate romance
It's an opportunity, something to enjoy
Helter, skelter fly for shelter I'm a lucky boy
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
A lovely peaceful afternoon

There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain

Sue Raney,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee,

""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

In September in the rain

Am I too late to make amends?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Sue Raney,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Sue Raney,"Tell me where
Where is it written
What is it I was meant to be?
That I can't dare
It all began the day I found
That from my window I could only see
A piece of sky
I stepped outside and looked around
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high
The time had come
(Papa, can you hear me?)
To try my wings
(Papa, are you near me?)
And even thought it seemed at any moment I could fall
I felt the most
(Papa, can you see me?)
Amazing things
(Can you understand me?)
The things you can't imagine
If you've never flown at all
Though it's safer to stay on the ground
Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live - the more I learn
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know
Each step I take 
(Papa, I've a voice now!)
Each page I turn 
(Papa, I've a choice now!)
Each mile I travel only means
The more I have to go
What's wrong with wanting more?
If you can fly - then soar!
With all there is - why settle for
Just a piece of sky?
Papa, I can hear you
Papa, I can see you
Papa, I can feel you
Papa, watch me fly!",A Piece of Sky

You and the song are gone

It's a shame it rained today.""

I had to steal a little time baby
So I could spend it all on you
I parked the car down the street

Where you lay your pretty head
I'm gonna rub your tired shoulders

And I've called my next of kin

I like to lead when I dance
Your eyes do the speaking
They talk with each glance

I might take a (the) chance
And though you're the charmer - who could bend my armor
I like to lead when I dance
I like to steer the car - whenever I drive

And I'll open my heart and love again

It's raining inside
And it's raining tonight
And it's raining for me and for you

Is a life fucked by money
And a world of celebrity fools

(Simon) Are you somewhere in my soul?
(Simon) Are you nothing but a notion, oh?
(Simon) Where do we go?

Now planes write your name up in the sky
And flowers die for your suicide
Trains stopped in vain and the pain stopped for you

And we all believed in insulin
Perfume and soap and ventolin
But no one believed you
When you said you heart was blue

It's raining inside
And it's raining tonight
And it's raining for me and for you

When nothing makes sense
But the pounds and the pence
And the dollars and cents, oh we lose?

Sufjan Stevens,"""All good thoughts"" in spite of righteousness
is the kind of thoughts in spite of greatness.
Often now the State is advocation.
If we form a power of recognition.

Forget loss and perfect advocation.
If it drops or stays in convocation.
All we praise is all we want in commerce
All we praise is parties, foreign commerce.
Entertain ideas of great communion,
Shelter not materials in union
(All we praise is not the kind of commerce.
That's the right solution!)

""All good thoughts"" is not the act of doing
What we want but what we should be proving
(Properties?), ideas, a woman's pleasure
is empowered by love, a perfect measure!","All Good Naysayers, Speak Up! Or Forever Hold Your Peace!"

And fed, to restore.

Reprimand misgivings,
We won't grow.
We will not ever know.

Sufjan Stevens,"If I miss my chance, I didn't even try
I'm not one to regret Christmas in July
If my timing is bad, like a fish on a bike,
Would you let me pretend Christmas in July?

I'm not one to admit, I'm not one to fight,
Maybe I was wrong, but maybe I was right
Like when I went to school
Drinking coffee at night,
And I did what I did, now I do what I like

Open the champagne,
Party and dancin'
You'll know that sadness: very expensive
Do what you want to,
Don't even ask us
Wear it without sin,
Family Damascus

Maybe its the snow, in this winter night
And the winter coat,
The one you never liked 
But I'll take the sun and I'll take my kite,
Christmas on the beach, Christmas in July 
And I love my friends even if they fight Christmas in July 
Just to keep them quiet
And I love you too, I love you through the night
But now you're awake, Christmas isn't right

Don't take offenses, 
Come to your senses, 
Your confidences straddling fences

Repeat the sounding joy

And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness

In the car when your mother lost her temper

Forget about yourself and all your plans

Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What's right and wrong you cannot tell me

We're back from Bloomington we let the runners win
Far in the morning light we let the movies play

When my sister picks a fight with the Alexander boy
And my father locks the car by the store
Still we figure out the keys and follow him once more

Oh my God, we see it on the floor
The woman on the bed the ankle brace she wore
Stones and sled it could have been some other
The mind that knows itself has a mind to serve the other
And we run back scratching at the door, scratching at the door

If I'm hiding in the sleeves of my coat
When my father runs undressed, he's pointing at my throat
And my brother has a fit in the snow
And the traffic stops for miles, we take him by the elbow

Oh my God, the shuffling at the floor
(Oh my God)
A mind that knows itself is a mind that knows much more
(No one came to our side)
So we run back, scrambling for cover
(To carry us away from danger)
A mind that knows itself has a mind to kill the other

We take a swim, we take a swim
I never meant to escape the carpet and the trade
This land is yours, this land is mine

And when I make up my mind, I change it all the time
I take it back, I take it back

I count them out, I count them out

There was a car in the bay, by the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light, in the water that we made
I'm counting it out, I'm counting it out, I'm working it out
Inside, I'm counting it out from the floor

The ferry hatches Moline, Panola Beauty Queen
She takes a bow, she takes a bow
In Charles, we climb the hill and Danville window sill
I take it back, I take it back

My sister she counts the bars, the Macon county cars
She takes a bow, she takes a bow

This land is yours, this land is mine

My brother punches my ear, the injured ivory deer
I call my dad, I call my dad
We skip inside of the store, the Mason winter door

We can fix our own meals, we can wash our own hair

And I pulled the alarm, and I kicked up the salad bowls

After school we shoveled through the snow

That I was lazy and tired
You can work all your life as
I'm not afraid of you anymore

If I loved you a long time, I don't know
If I can't recall the last time you told me so

Here in this house in Pittsfield
The ghost of our grandmother works at the sewing machine post
Hiding the bills in the kitchen on the floor
And my sister lost her best friend in the Persian Gulf War
There was a flood in the bathroom last May
And you kicked at the pipes when it rattled oh the river it made

Stand there, tell me that I'm of no use
Things unspoken break us if we share
There's still time to wash the kitchen floor
On your knees, at the sink once more
You can remind me that I was tired
You can work late and give yourself up
Now that I'm older, wiser, and working less
I don't regret having left the place a mess

Sufjan Stevens,"Oh the weather outside is frightful 
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
And the lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh the fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still good-bying
But as long as you love me so

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, Christmas joys
Oh! Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?
Ho, ho, ho! Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't, who wouldn't go?

First comes the stocking of little Nell

One that will open and shut its eyes

Waiting for a miracle, waiting for a crowd

Anyone particular, any old cause
Hands on the counter, feet on the floor

Sufjan Stevens,"Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
You’re not the one to talk things through
You checked your texts while I masturbated
Manelich, I feel so used

Found myself on Spencer’s Butte
Traced your shadow with my shoe
Empty outline changed my view
Now all of me thinks less of you

On the sheet I see your horizon
All of me pressed onto you
But in this light you look like Poseidon
I’m just a ghost you walk right through

Saw myself on Spencer’s Butte (All of me wants all of you)
Landscape changed my point of view (All of me wants all of you)
Revelation may come true (All of me wants all of you)

My blue bucket of gold
Friend, why don’t you love me?
Once the myth has been told
The lens deforms it as lightning

Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life

Search for things to extol
Friend, the fables delight me

Lord, touch me with lightning

Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life",Blue Bucket of Gold
Sufjan Stevens,"Carrie and Lowell
Such a long time ago
Like a dead horse
Meadowlark drive your arrow

Season of hope (after the flood)
Valentine, spurn my sorrow
Head on the floorboards (covered in blood)
Drunk as a horsefly
Climb on the mattress pad
Twist my arm

Under the pear tree
Shadows and light conspiring
Covered bridge, I scream
Cottage Grove shade invite me

I will bow down (Dido’s lament)
Lord of the ancient waters
From the backyard (as far as she went)
Carrie surprised me
Erebus on my back
My lucky charm

Carried by stones
Fairyland all around us
Like a dead horse
Sign of your children’s fever

Carrie, come home (Thorazine’s friend)
Holding your hands with opal
Like a dead horse (Shall we ascend)
Flight of the mayfly
Ephemera on my back
She breaks my arm",Carrie & Lowell
Sufjan Stevens,"I’m drawn to the blood
The flight of a one-winged dove
How? How did this happen?
How? How did this happen?

The strength of his arm
My lover caught me off guard
How? Head of a rabbit
How? Head of a rabbit

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this?

With blood on my sleeve
Delilah, avenge my grief
How? God of Elijah
How? God of Elijah

As fire to the sun
Tell me what I have done
How? Heart of a dragon
How? Heart of a dragon

For my prayer has always been love

How did this happen?",Drawn to the Blood
Sufjan Stevens,"Light struck from the lemon tree
What if I’d never seen hysterical light from Eugene?
Lemon yogurt, remember I pulled at your shirt
I dropped the ashtray on the floor
I just wanted to be near you

Emerald Park, wonders never cease
The man who taught me to swim, he couldn't quite say my first name
Like a Father he led community water on my head
And he called me ""Subaru""
And now I want to be near you

Since I was old enough to speak I've said it with alarm
Some part of me was lost in your sleeve
Where you hid your cigarettes
No I’ll never forget
I just want to be near you

Still I pray to what I cannot see
In the sprinkler I mark the evidence known from the start
From the bed near your death, and all the machines that made a mess
Far away the falcon flew
Now I want to be near you

What’s left is only bittersweet
For the rest of my life, admitting the best is behind me
Now I’m drunk and afraid, wishing the world would go away
What’s the point of singing songs
If they’ll never even hear you?",Eugene
Sufjan Stevens,"The evil it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?

Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We’re all gonna die

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like Junior High
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I?
My fading supply

Did you get enough love, my little dove
Why do you cry?
And I’m sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles

The hospital asked should the body be cast
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

Shall we look at the moon, my little loon
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light

Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We’re all gonna die

Sufjan Stevens,"Are we to speak, first day of the week
Stumbling words at the bar
Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries
Long island kindness and wine
Beloved of John, I get it all wrong
I read you for some kind of poem
Covered in lines, the fossils I find
Have they no life of their own?

So can we pretend sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I am a man with a heart that offends
With its lonely and greedy demands
There’s only a shadow of me in a manner of speaking I'm dead

Such a waste, your beautiful face
Stumbling carpet arise
Go follow your gem, your white feathered friend
Icarus, point to the sun
If history speaks of two baby teeth
I’m painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord hear my prayer
I’ve wasted my throes on your head

So can we be friends, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I love you more than the world can contain
In its lonely and ramshackle head
There’s only a shadow of me in a manner of speaking I'm dead

I’m holding my breath
My tongue on your chest
What can be said of my heart?
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Where there remains but a mark
Beloved my John, so I’ll carry on
Counting my cards down to one
And when I am dead, come visit my bed
My fossil is bright in the sun

So can we contend, peacefully
Before my history ends?
Jesus I need you, be near me, come shield me
From fossils that fall on my head
There’s only a shadow of me in a manner of speaking I'm dead",John My Beloved
Sufjan Stevens,"Now that I fell into your arms
My only lover, give out to give in
I search for the council I lost

Drag me to hell in the valley of the damned
Like my mother, give wings to a stone
It's only the shadow of the cross

Ooh ooh

I slept on my back in the shade of the meadowlark
Like a champion, get drowned to get laid
I take one more hit when you depart

I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
Lonely vampire inhaling its fire
I'm chasing the dragon too far

Ooh ooh

There's blood on that blade, fuck me, I'm falling apart
My assassin like Casper the ghost
There's no shade in the shadow of the cross",No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross
Sufjan Stevens,"The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders, Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

Do I care if I survive this, bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises I wonder did you love me at all?

The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders, water stain writing the wall
Daniel’s message, blood of the moon on us all

Do I care if I despise this, nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises, how do I live with your ghost?

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow

The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God’s grace, nothing else left to impart

Do I care if I survive this, bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises, hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now, I wanna feel your touch

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow",The Only Thing
Sufjan Stevens,"I should have known better
To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies

I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy

When I was three, three maybe four
She left us at that video store
Be my rest, be my fantasy
Be my rest, be my fantasy

I’m light as a feather
I’m bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only wanna be a relief

No, I’m not a go-getter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I wanna believe

When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Be my rest, be my fantasy
Be my rest, be my fantasy

I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should have wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling

Don’t back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor’s greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination

Don’t back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
I’m a fool in the fetter
Rose of Aaron’s beard, where you can reach me

Don’t back down, nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor

I don't know how you buy yours but that's how I like mine
Think girls don't style, how ya figure
One arm's on my steering wheel, the other arm's around my nigga
This pocket's phat, don't get offended cause
Somebody makes it so somebody's gotta spend it
I take it from the boardroom to the boulevard
Troopin' all the players like I play cards
I pump up my Jeep and get hot
And once I put my tape in the slot my speakers hit the jackpot
Time time for some action, I got to be the main attraction
Blowin' up like Toni Braxton
Pick my girls up to check the party uptown
I leave my shorty home cause I'm tryina fuck around
At the sports bar, honeys everywhere are lookin' mink
What's up star, let's get a drink

What's up star, I'd like to get to know who you are
Let's have drinks at the bar
What's up star, I'd like to get to know who you are
And if I like what I see then the drinks is on me

I don't have to drop on ya 
So let's go get a drink on the low and kick in in the corner
To the bar start walkin' and I'ma hit you off

I hope to keep you interested, you should get with this kid
And if you lucky you could hit this
But don't get souped, it's just a conversation at the bar star
And if ya slip you get the scissor

Cuties everywhere I turn, when am I gonna learn
I be outta control, I see what I want and I roll
I get the digits quick from the honeys, they be fly and all that
But right now that's not where my head is at
Over and over again I step off quickly with my friends
To put this little love shit to a dead end
I got to stay on point, checkin' the honey with a tag
I got to bag my next chick
And there he is lookin' kosher, posin' like a poster
I won't bite come a little closer
I want to talk but it's loud shit
And it's gettin' kinda hot in this crowd shit
So step over to the bar, and let's kick that lingo
I like to mingle, honey are ya single

Come here momma
Momma don't cry
No we don't need my daddy no more
Old alcoholic insecure punk
What you hit my momma for?
Now I got so many personalities
It's a shame
And since pressure can bust a pipe
I'm relieving my brain
You ain't my daddy
You ain't my father
You're water, Walter
And my sister Laniesha
She really ain't your daughter
Now my momma got a real man
Me!
I remember how bad you treated that pretty lady
And what you thought was cupid
Turned out to be
A violent, itty-bitty, punk, drunk, punk
With a bow and arrow
Just like you, stupid!
And knowin everything I rap about is true
But the cold part about it is
I got half this shit from you
Now how in the hell
Did you figure you was gon cross
That pretty blue eyed-green eyed
Country voodoo creole female
Now you reaping what you sow
Cause I'm ??? you
And my heavenly father in heaven
Is watching you
Don't worry momma
We gon lay low
And stay low
As soon as I get out of jail

We sported golf hats and ???
Stayed down for the set
Ready to hoo-ride
Cause my life is a picnic
Just one big set-trip
Snitches and tricks to get with right
I went to sleep
To wake up to the same old thing

No job, just homies ready to gangbang
My momma tried her best to raise me right
But still I'm leaving with the homies
Hurtin her feelings
Bout to drive her crazy
She told me every time she hear the police
She was hoping it wasn't me in the street
Somewhere deceased
Now we struggle to live
But we living to die
I see my homies dying one by one
I want to cry
But if heaven's where your living at
That's the same damn place
Suga Free is gon be chilling at
I sold my soul for the good
Cause I don't want nobody
Going to my momma house
Telling her I died in the hood
So let me slide to the side
On my tippie toes
And thank my G's
Feel the breeze
And walk my girl on the beach
And have a little lunch
And make a little love
And kiss her body 
And appreciate the tingly bud
And to keep it real man
My freak Angelique
Just turned twenty
But when she was six man
Her daddy was her boyfriend

Know it
I'm out here with it

But we still share the same atmosphere
I love ya, I love ya man
Rest in peace dog
Rest

Chorus",Dip Da
Suga Free,"[Chorus: x2]
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennesey because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood

Slide, slide, slippety slide
Because I heard it was a party jumpin' on the Westside
Ride, Dogg, show me your eyes
So I'm a drink this Hennesey and give my head a real drive

Now the rat-tat-tat-tat strapped on my back-back
Nothin' jacked but the cracker playa hater talkin' smack
'Cause the party that I'm headed fo' is oh so deep
And it's a Tony Lang thang so I'm bound to creep

Now Suga Free don't dance, but I'd like to now
And my hoes can't go until my money is right
Now I'm about to get go after I G up from the feet up
And roll this weed up, like ?, speed up with the beat up

And roll. Baby hold that stearin wheel while I roll this indo
Better known as the magic wand, the bomb, the antidote
The twilight smoker, 'fore smoke
As I swerve by the curb on some herb gettin' smoked

Hittin' 16 switches is the life
While your girl send you to players anonymous, I perform like the Macs
I sell her dreams to her like a quiet storm
The only reason why they be worth pennies is to keep her ankle from her

As I tip top out the Cadillac
I see my homie DJ Quik and Tony Lang with that sticky green thang

?? up in a planatary temper high
Tryin' to prevent a player from gettin' his pie, so let me fly

[Chorus]

Sway, as I begin to hit the Chronic I see birds
I'm paranoid but I still want that herb
Somebody ??? cause my cotton mouth is back but I'm feelin' superb
I'm in la-la land and I'm tweaky

I'm in la-la land, but I see these girls freaky
I'm in la-la land, time to start creepin'
One two three, I emerge as a G
The Chronic got my membrane stuck

I'm Suga Free and I don't give a huff
And my eyes are oh so loaded
That I can barely focus in on my folks
Sway, it's reserve, as I tip-toe

Slip and slide to the flow where the ?heatho?
Really though, here we go ho
Foe everytime I look around I see hoes
So many different freaks to be chose

So what you sayin'? What you sayin'?
Spit that game and bust these hoes
?? caught me for a dog, how?
Got you niggas slippin' with this freak in, bow wow

That ? was to, her skirt got hooked, her man got shook
'Cause that's the way it's written down in a players book
To a bitch thinkin' just like blue
Don't let her bounce off me, so we can stick on you

Now if you got a sack of weed say ""Right, right""
Now hold it up and wave it from side to side
'Cause your party ain't a party if you ain't got weed
Woman cloud and contact smoke that I can book breath

Yeah I can feel my heart beat
It's Suga Free, come take this weed from me
And something's wrong, I think I'm sprung, off of that twee.. Suga Free
And I feel so high, my mouth is dry

But I want to fly in the sky and say goodbye as I rise
Seems.. As I take a deep breath from that boo-boo AKA the chronic
Not that boo-bop that you got
Separate mine from yours, fool, I want the pie

That every other bud head do
The certain general has just informed you and I
To inhale and exhale, to breathale my bale well

[Chorus: x4]

Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk...",Doe Doe and da Skunk

Fly for life, this life is mine, willin to die..

The Westside of Pomona is the city where it's happenin
City of sin, and I miss them days back on Jackland(?)
Still it was the state of mind don't think that we be playin
{?something in spanish?} no cuerte, you know what I'm sayin
The method of detectin niggaz all up in yo' game
can never be done, if you continue to remain
a victim in life, for the fact that love don't love nobody
I shoulda been this numb back in the days of O.G. Chotty(?)

Strange weeds in the garden, bird pickin up seed killed game
Here come a passion mark, jealous playa hat'n lame
And he's slippin like a bad transmission too
Givin bitches his money, now do that sound like you?
They say money don't ?? and it's hard to make
I think about it everytime I bump a bitch to break
You couldn't pay me no money to respect a bitch
Fall in love, get married, and watch her take half my shit
But you a gangsta - yeah you hard as fuck!
A straight killa to your homies but that pussy got you stuck
I got game - somethin you stuck on
I want some money but you want to get your fuck on, trick
Shoot a nigga cause he from the other side of the street
but scared to let yo' bitch go out, cause yo' game is weak
Now how your money want my honey?
So how your money want my hoe?
Cause youse a gangsta, liquor, sucker, fucker
Teaser, pleaser, slap her, tap her
in the back of her, the bed, the flow that's yo' hoe
On the couch, in her mouth, check it out, her gut
her butt, so rough, so tough, mmmmm
Bust a nut get up and pimp or shut the fuck up
Now what you gon' be nigga, 
part of the problem or part of the solution?
A paper institution, see the institution upon seducin
y'all know that nigga that be turf talkin that old ying-yang
Killin me with that buh-bullshit, don't be wantin a damn thang
Now correct me if I'm wrong; I love my money

Don't cost a dime to stay out of mine, not a dime..

Indica thai, makin me high, you want to try? (Yeah)

I heard a bitch say if you hit a bitch then youse a bitch yourself
I said, 
""Then call me Dwana bitch and I'll beat that bitch to death playa""
I see you got that nigga pussy-whipped, with that pussy grip
on that pussy trip, starin at your pussy lip
You say you got too much pride to hoe
Bitch if push come to shove, you'd be ready to go
Uh-oh, here come push and now go shove in the front and back
Tre' can-dy paint great with goldies on brand new dubs
Ready to kidnap that brain with that game
that I got from Tony Lang(?), Ernest Lang(?) and Jermaine
Black tone's my backbone when ass gone my jawbone will be gone
My knee-bone will be to my ankle bone
Ay Tony Lang(?) you better tell em
Get ready to tell this nigga a joke or somethin
man cause I'ma overwhelm him
Them jealous niggaz don't believe us
so I'ma wreck the microphone and (?) between the Devil and Jesus
And I, tip-toe, to Top Hat Liquor sto'
to buy some drank and zig-zags for this dank - see
the very same winos, beggin for change
Gettin drunk, tellin lies, just the same ol' thang
Now I'm rollin down ?? in the lane, by the curb
Pushin Fosgate Alpine woofers with reverb
My homey Lil' Man, Loco why, Crazy D
Lil' Shamu from Sin-town, Doo G Greg(?) and O.G. Down Down

One more dog and French bread
Return to the lab to reclaim my fame
And see my bitches take the corner
Nigga, I ain't nothin' changed
But I'ma handcuff yo' ass to the sound
And test drive niggas, that's how to touch
And bitches that's how to bat
I'm steppin' out the penn
Bailin' in a cloud of smoke
Nizi tizi, ?? ?I had to dive on 'em? loc
Now we gon' make or make 'em clap to this
Now grab yo' gat, smoke a sac
And drink some Cognac and jack to this
Both be on the lookout for PPD
Them black, them whites
Them disco lights and that 3rd strike
Cause I'll be damned if I go back to the penn
If I unlock my payroll, with a hoe, and do some time again
Back in the County with my hair gettin' thinner
Because I'm stressin' about my bitch and I wonder who's goin' in her
And I'm knowin' that the tramp ain't shit
But in the LA County Jail I'ma need that bitch
I'm on a roof, up in 95, huh, and I'm broke at that
I'm creepin' on niggas, sweepin'
That's for goin' with that money sac
And G's hittin' niggas up on from where they from
Ready to roll, bustas and marks up out of 95 huh
But then she in her nails gettin' smart and quiet
So put yo' hand on yo' shit
And get ready to scrap cause it's another riot
Now I'm scrappin' with my hair half braid
Because a nigga stole some candy from a ????
So me Ray Dogg, ?? and Trey Parcept
That nigga TC from EC and 8-Ball from HT
The red rags resent from tree tops, Tony Lang
With Nookie Baby John from Foo Town and Pat
Together we love some motherfucker stood ??? all at one time
They comin' together, some niggas yap
Crips and bloods on they way to the home
Because we took our phone
And motherfuckers and left they face swoll
Damn, now they feed a nigga juke balls
No action on the phones, no visitors
Man I can't wait to go home

Who's that baller, should I, I want to go home
I said a who, who's that baller, baby, I want to go home
Mama I ain't really happy here, I really really want to come home
If it wasn't for, you and my sister, I'd be straight all alone

Now I comes from Pomona
The city of G's in California
Where the sun rises the east
And sets the west (Tell the truth player)
Now I ain't tryin to be a hard ass brother
Cause I got game from my sister and my mother (Nah)
They told me the same thing that'll make you laugh
Will make you cry
And they was right on the money
Now I
Bang bang to the rhythm of Quik
Now put the dip in your hip 
And let your backbone slip
It took a real long time for me to get this break
And I'll be damned if I leave it for a sucka to take
Hey Suga Free, I got some whoop whoop
I'm finna get some whop whop
You know I sold my drop top
On Daytons with them knock-offs
Partner you can straight shake the spot
I see the envy and jealousy in your face
And bump what you got fool
Forgot to write me in the penn
Now I'm on parole in the wind
And your trying to fit in
y'all humpback J
E to the A
The L-O-you-S suckas make my day
Sucka
But I'm a cotton-pickin fool
I shoulda listened to Tony Lane
When he told me to shake a sucka like you
Shake-a-shake-a-shake
One sucka a day
Cause misery loves company (OK)
And a, Mr. Sucka For a Trick
a.k.a
Broke jealous trick 
With a itch
To never see me spittin
Here come that sucka with that smile
Talkin about
How my shit flow so dope
He played my tape and got cottonmouth
So I'm knowin bout your fake smile
Pat me on my back
With that he say-she say crap
Because I know something you don't
Like havin thousands
And a ???

Now I gets my checks in chunks
Blocks and stacks
Looking out for my homies
And family like a mack
So you can do or say whatever floats your boat
But I'ma tell you just like this
I'm far from broke
So while you talk about me 
You need to look at yourself
Who gave Peaches five hundred for ???
I had a life-long dream
To do just this
In and out of jail
And didn't nobody send me shhh
But I ain't mad witcha
I guess we do what we do
And God Bless Chris, Flower, Dante and little Clue
We gotta make it right
Cause Mr. Gilmore is laughing at us
Killing each other
Over nothing every night
So wake up and recognize
What you fail to see
Cause I'm a black man partner
It was hard for me
Trying to get a job
With a cross tattoo under my left eye
They never called me back in interviews
It was hi and bye

Would you like to know a secret?
(Would you want to, you really want to, know it)
Would you promise not to tell?
(I know you want to, you really want to, know it, I bet ya)
Would you like to know a secret?

Would you promise not to tell?
(Don't you want to, you really want to, baby, don't you want to, you really wanna)

And my homegirl Qiana
Bless her soul
Bought me some shoes
I took off them ???
Cause my sacks was through
And moms kicked me out the house
Cause I wasn't paying rent
I got mad for a minute
Now I gots good sense
And me and pops used to go at it
Like every other day
But I apologize 
For all the remarks I used to say
Cause ah
I gots my life where I want it
I met Stan Sheppard, Black Tone, DJ Quik
Now I'm jumping on it
And Black Tone used to buy me clothes
Pay for lawyers and court
So Black Tone's my folks
Unlike some other fools I know
We got a snitch walking round
But I ain't mad at cha
Just don't let me see you
I'ma clown
Cause you smiling in my face
And pat me all on my back
And hate my guts
But steady in the presence of a mack
And if it wasn't for Tony Lane, DJ Quik and Hi-see
Wouldn't none of y'all suckas give a damn about me

Tryna get whatcha on me, nothin' mo, nothin' less

'Cause in my black Lex, I rolls from county to county
City to city, lookin' for the dark honies, suckle brown red titties
And bitches, y'all can't play a technique for a trick
Because I speaks softly and carries a big ol' dick

And um, I like the bitches that ain't scared to use they hands
I like the bitches that'd get naked in the back of the van
Yeah, see, see, I paid ya like I'm major
You bitches steadily gettin' over them, niggas, that done paid ya

But then I just fire my Newport and look at ya stupid
And then shoot you with an arrow like dick 'cause I ain't Cupid
Now, learn to tip toe ?

Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run

Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run

I bet ya recognize me, I'm nasty as they come Mr. H I see
Tip Toe, but don't ya run, 'cause me and my dogs be chillin' in the tree
DJ Quik, Blac Tone and Suga Free
Now, tell me what ya want, baby, what ya need?

I slap meat to a freak and make the ho, nose bleed
'Cause bitches like you smoke up all the weed
And ain't givin up shit with yo nappy weed

See I a hoe, like you can shake my spot
Or suck my dick, till your taste of snot
Naw, it don't stop, we stays on top
And bust like a muthafuckin' fo, fo shot

Fuck what you got, I'ma ride and swerve
Intoxicated, man, I hate it when I scrapes the curb
Just slammed the do and the ho tried to work me
God damn ho, don't bitch, ya tryna work me

Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run

Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run

Hold on, here we come
Tip toe but don't ya run
Hold on, here we come

Pay attention
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Quik gave me a beat, now Pomona's on the set, now...

Get your money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!

Mama tries but there ain't no love like homie love, baby
I'm G'd up and I'm crazy
And there's a mellow ghetto breeze on my ass
Cause I'm, saggin', don't want to die so I'm taggin'
Now when I see my baby cryin'
I can't explain how it hits me
I'm tryin' papers while she fill it in
Ya see in order for me to win, I gotta lose sometimes, baby
I know I'm wrong but I'ma make it
Now I...

Never hit hit a woman, naha
But I slapped the shit out of a bitch, why you bullshittin'?!
If you think a little ahead, you gets a little ahead, little trick
But I ain't goin' against the grain, not me, not even a little bit
Bet she didn't tell you she used to be my ho, huh?
Yeah nigga, she sold that pussy for me, in Pomona
You better take some of this night time sticky icky head
'Fore she could realise I'm tryin' to get rich with Quik
Why you bullshittin'? ??
Suga Free is lovely and pretty as I can be
Perms simpler than Charlotte Spred, waves deep as Redonda Beach
Tellin' you to

Get your money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!
I get down, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!

Now what's the problem nigga?
Whu-what? Yo' lady won't suck your dick?
Cause for the very low low price of $100 you can use my bitch
And if you act now, man, I'll throw in a ho that'll buff your nad
She used to work down there at the Sperm Bank
See, she got f",Why U Bullshittin?
Suga Free,"[Verse 1]
Okay which way you want to go nigga
Left, right, up, down, come on man
Just find it on yourself, man come on now
Pimp's probably a bit too much
Pimps went dead with this year's shit here
Man pimp pimp pimp pimp, you got chewed up
Lisa had a problem
She never realized that all the dick she was suckin
In the hood, she could have made herself mountains
But it's my fault cause she a ho and didn't listen to a pimp
So she writin you in the pen over and over again
See I believe in servin a nigga his papers wHen I knock his ho
Like a pimp did me on Beach Blvd, know
I got knocked, gon get knocked, de-knocked, re-knocked
But I'ma knick-knock my motherfuckin self, I'm Suga Free, ha
I, P-I,	oh my, M-P, oh I, for life
Knock knock for winter (ha ha), me too
Like a are-2 twin magnetic pimp response
Plus yo ass sweatin me like a cheap suit

[Chorus]
Just when you thought the pimpin was in you
Ah ah, it's just on you (I can't warn you)
What's wrong? Kitty cat get her nosebleed?
It's red ribbon week? It's just on you (you can't win)
Fire engines, and ????
It's just on you (you can't win)
And just when you thought that $500 was for another abortion
Gotcha, it's just on you (I can't warn you)

[Verse 2]
Now I, can't, believe, how, y'all, niggaz
Still, don't, know, how, a ho, go
They make more, pay more
A doctor or a nurse or a vet
They say a pimp walked on water, and he never got wet
See sometime it feel like the pimpin be dead
But that's a temporary condition too
A quota peep that he could be a ho
But he called back (cool)
And I can't believe how some of y'all niggaz
Let the glory pass you by
But steady want to pick my brain about the game and ask why
And if it wasn't for tony
y'all motherfuckers'd still be ridin around Pomona Gospel
Spittin like bitches to my homies

[Chorus]
A strong wind 40 days and 40 nights
Suckers, it's just on you (you can't win)
When she disrespect you in front of your homeboys
You are the weakest link, cause it's just on you (you can't win)
Man I mean she gon be either a stand-up ho
or a fall-down bitch, man it's just on you (you can't win)
Now you know you're with a square when Red Cross won't give her coffee

[Verse 3]
God said he wasn't gon put no more meat that I could stand
Ho it mean after you leave me I cop and blow
And be the chain of a man (Amen)
Here's a story about a pimp that they ain't took out yet
But died 8 or 9 times and ain't found him yet
I tell your man I just be sittin back lookin (lookin)
Listenin (listenin), learnin (learnin)
Pimpin (pimpin), and I don't see no difference
Peep, wolf disguised as sheep
That's how I stalk my prey
Every single day, I don't know no other way
Born again! Pimp different, hear different, feel different
Look different, Walk different, talk different
And the tricks you fuckin never try to keep up with him
That's what they do
Don't even think you fuckin her better than him
I mean the joint bout-it man will knock you straight on your back
Just like you got the Holy Ghost, feelin good, go like that
And to inquirin minds that want to know
I got on Stains, fucked it up
Popped the pen, I left with my ho

[Chorus]
And outta all the pimpin goin on around you
It's just on you
I mean that a goddamn drop touched on you
See, it's just on you
Mean to tell me you mad at the pimpin cause
you don't see no difference? (it's just on you)
Just when you got a taste for steak in your mouth
She gave you bologna cause it's just on you
When she said all she did was kiss him
And you said okay that's when she knew it's just on you
Just when you thought that givin her all that dick
Was the shit nigga I couldn't warn you
Better get yo ass way from around here
I ain't playin (good morning)
Be good or be good at it
goddamnit, it's just on you
I'ma go in a worm but I'ma come out a butterfly motherfucker
It's just on you

You want to start all over again, make it work this time
But I don't want to end up feeling far away from fine

So frustrated with the way we were

Spend the night on me
I dont need no man
Got my kicks for free

I will ride still fired
On the beat down low
I don't need nobody
But my honeys when I go

Round baby round round
Spinning out on me
I dont need no man
Got my kicks for free

When you stare at my face
You're messing with my brain
If you try to convince me
Then you better think again

If you move to the music
The music's got to give
If it's too complicated
That's the way I wanna live

If you hate me I will show you
How to break me into something new
If you want me run away now
If you stop me then I'll hit the ground
Round we go, here we go

Explanations no you don't need one
Having a good time getting down to fun
And it's your time just tonight he'll be mine
Then he's gone yeah

People movin', bodies groovin'
Never ending players are changing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
All you need is a fierce sting

All my girls are here with me
Whiling out they've got their needs
Do you feel me? Do you feel me?
Do you feel me? Do you feel me?

Does it hurt when you see how I've done
Without you thought that I couldn't belong
Never thought that you could be so cruel
All you need is some friends won't be by yourself

Sugababes,"I live my life in chains
Got my hands in chains
And I can't sticks with the cards that I got
With a deal like this
I must insist a girls got more to do
Then be the way you think a woman should
I'm taking it into my hands 
In this mans land I can
Understand why I'm taking command
I've had enough of stuff
And now it's time to think about
Me, me yeah

And you can easily gamble your life away
Second after second
And day by day
You play the game or you walk away
It's a new turn on a blue day
And a cool deal of life for me
And it's all good

I know that the spades 
Are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs  
Are weapons of war
I know that diamonds
Mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

I've always played it safe nothings ever safe
Give me the courage to back my own convictions
Every decision I make
I pay it back and more
Now turn the cards and let them fall to me
I don't need to play on with the hand that they have given me
I give it back
'Cause it's not the way it has to be

And you can easily gamble your life away
Second after second
And day by day
You play the game or you walk away

Sugababes,"I'll make it through the rainy days
I'll be the one who stands up longer than the rest
When my landscape changes, rearranges
I'll be stronger than I've ever been
No more stillness, just sunrise
Everything's gonna be alright

I know that there's gonna be a change
Better find your way out of your fear
If you want to come with me then that's the gotta be

I'm all alone,
And finally,
I'm getting Stronger(stronger, stronger, stronger)
You've come to see(come to see0
Just what I can be
I'm getting Stronger",Stronger
