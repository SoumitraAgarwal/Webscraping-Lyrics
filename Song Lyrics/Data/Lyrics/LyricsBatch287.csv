Lyle Lovett,"Well, he knew what he was doin'
When he put eyes into my head
If he didn't want me to lookin' at them pretty little women
He'd'a left my ol' eyeballs dead

Isn't that so
Tell me, isn't that so
You got to go when your heart says go
Isn't that so

Well, he knew what he was doin'
When he made that magic vine
His own son got a reputation
For turnin' water into wine

Isn't that so
Tell me, isn't that so
You got to go when your heart says go
Isn't that so

Let that line of least resistance lead me on
Let the line of least resistance lead me on

Well, he know what he was doin'
When he divided the high from the low
You got to bury seed in the womb, my friend
If you want the little seed to grow

Now, isn't that so
Isn't that so
You got to go when your heart says go
Isn't that so

You got to go when your heart says go
Isn't that so
Let that line of least resistance lead me on
Let the line of least resistance lead me on
Let your heart, let your heart, your heart lead you on
Let your heart, let your heart lead you on",Isn't That So
Lyle Lovett,"Ah, you wanna get frisky,
Don't wanna pay the price
Fill it up with whiskey
And pack it down with ice

[Chorus]
Ah, roll her over
Give her Coca-Cola
Yes, a dish of ice cream
Lemon soda
Well, it takes soap and water,
Baby for to keep you clean.

My little baby,
She's nice and round
She can look up
Long as I can look down

Well the funniest gal
I've ever seen
You know, her top was purple
And her bottom was green

Well, my sugar baby,
She's the best ball in town
You just grab her by the shoulders
And you rock her up and down

Ah, now follow me, baby,
Turn your money green
I'll show you somethin'
Mr. Rockefeller never seen.

Ah, you wanna get frisky,
Don't wanna pay the price
Fill it up with whiskey
And pack it down with ice",Keep It Clean
Lyle Lovett,"Lord, keep us steadfast in thy Word;
Curb those who fein by craft and sword
Would wrest the kingdom from thy Son
And bring to nought all he has done.

Lord Jesus Christ, thy power make known,
For thou are Loud of Lords alone;
Defend thy ??? that we
May ever more sing praise to thee.

O Comforter of priceless worth,
Send peace and unity on earth;
Support us in our final strife
And lead us out of death to life.",Keep Us Steadfast
Lyle Lovett,"The sandman is calling
Your adlibs are falling
Like stars shooting out the sky
The dewdrops they glisten
As we lie here and listen
To sound of the night's lullaby

Sleep tight little darling
You'll rise in the morning
And heaven will keep you from harm
As you lie in your sweet mother's arms
As you lie in your sweet mother's arms

The twilight brings trouble
The moon ever struggles 
To shine like his brother the sun
The wind reassures him
With thunder and lightning
Darkness declares day is done

Good night little darling
We'll rise in the morning
And heaven will keep us from harm
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms

Sleep tight little darling
We'll rise in the morning
And heaven will keep us from harm
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms
As we lie in your sweet mother's arms",Night's Lullaby
Lyle Lovett,"One thing I like about that gal of mine
One thing I like about that gal of mine
One thing I like about that gal of mine
She treats me right and loves me all the time

Sometimes I'm broke and blue as I can be
Sometimes I'm broke and blue as I can be
Sometimes I'm broke and blue as I can be
But still my baby she looks after me

She walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
She walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
She walked in the rain till her feet got soaking wet
And this she said to every man she met

Mister change a dollar - gimme a lousy dime
Mister change a dollar - gimme a lousy dime
Mister change a dollar - gimme a lousy dime
So I can feed that hungry man of mine

That gal of mine shes one way all the time
That gal of mine shes one way all the time
That gal of mine shes one way all the time
She takes the blues away and satisfies my mind",One Way Gal
Lyle Lovett,"Please release me, let me go
For I don't love you anymore
To waste our lifes would be a sin
Release me and let me love again

I have found a new love, dear
And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Release me my darling, let me go

Please release me, let me go
I don't love you anymore
To live together is a sin
Release me and let me love again
Oh release me and let me love again",Release Me
Lyle Lovett,"What a pretty mystery you
You suddenly turned out to be
I've never held you gently
But I want to

Well, I'll watch your friends come through the door
And I slide my feet across the floor
There are things I might ask
I don't need to
Can't you tell I'm telling you
That I want to
Understand you, oh

Well, I'm sofa sitting, compromising
Thoughts on what I'm realizing
Ask me what I'm thinking

It's hard to say cause the way I'm reeling
It could be most anything
To do with you

Well, can't you tell I'm telling you
That I want to
Understand you, oh

Some things can remain unsaid, now
You don't have to share your bed with me
It's a gentle thing we're making

Got the time for stronger weather
Until we get to know us better
We'll remain suspended

Can't you tell I'm telling you
That I want to
Understand you, oh

Can't you tell I'm telling you
That I want to
Say I love you",Understand You
Lyle Lovett,"You bought you a six string Gibson
You bought you a great big house
You try to sing like Muddy Waters
And play like Lightnin' sounds

But since we blowed our harp
You feelin' mean and confused.
We got you chained to your earphones,
You just a white boy, lost in the blues.

You got your '44 Desoto
Great big horns that toots,
44 bad buttons on your every-day suit,
But now that we bent your strings
You been feelin' mean and confused
We got you chained to your earphones,
You just a white boy, lost in the blues.

Got you great big house on the hillside
Got you great big field of corn
Got you a  loving woman
And the bluuuues in your soul
And now that we started cooking
I been really mean and confused
We got you chained to my headphones
You're just a white boy, lost in the blues
We got you chained to my headphones
You're just a white boy, lost in the blues
We got you chained to my headphones
You're just a white boy, lost in the blues",White Boy Lost In the Blues
Lyle Lovett,"I'm going out on the highway
And listen to them big trucks wind
I'm going out on the highway
And listen to them big trucks wind
Oh, white freightliner, won't you steal away my mind

Well, New Mexico ain't bad, Lord
The people here, they treat you kind
Well, New Mexico ain't bad, Lord
The people here, they treat you kind
Oh, white freightliner, won't you steal away my mind

Well, it's bad news from Houston
Half my friends are dying

Till I get back to where I came
Till that white freightliner's gonna haul away my brain",White Freightliner Blues
Lyle Mays,"She's lost in coma
Where it's beautiful
Intoxicated from the deep sleepdeep sleep
Do you wonder what it's like

Living in a permanent imagination
Sleeping to escape reality

Lyle Mays,"Strike me down
Give me everything you've got
Strike me down
I'll be everything I'm not

Count the questions on one hand you don't ask me what I planned
Strike me down
Should have asked me what went wrong
Strike me down
Should have stayed away too long

Strike me down
Give it everything you've got
Chance me now I'll be everything I'm not
Hope's the child of what luck brings

Points the faith in higher things
Ask me now fire at everything at once
Strike me down
Take it anyway you want

Strike me down
Better left it all unknown
Strike me down
Should have left it all alone

Strike me down

Lyle Mays,"From this moment on
You for me, dear
Only two for tea, dear
From this moment on

From this happy day
No more blue songs
Only hoop-de-doo songs
From this moment on

You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight

We'll be ridin' high, babe

Lyle Ritz,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Lyle Ritz,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Lyle Ritz,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Lyle Ritz,"I want to go back to my little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii
I want to be with all the kanes and wahines that I knew long ago
I can hear old guitars a playing, on the beach at Hoonaunau
I can hear the Hawaiians saying ""Komomai no kaua ika hale welakahao""
It won't be long 'til my ship will be sailing back to Kona
A grand old place that's always fair to see
I'm just a little Hawaiian and a homeside Island boy
I want to go back to my fish and poi

Lyle Ritz,"Playmate come out and play with me
And bring your dollies three,
Climb up my apple tree,
Look down my rain barrel,
Slide down my cellar door,
And we'll be jolly friends forever more

She couldn't come out and play,
It was a sunny day
With tearful eye, she breathed a sigh
And I could hear her say,

I'm sorry, playmate,
I cannot play with you
My dollies have the flu,
Ain't got no rain barrel,
Ain't got no cellar door
But we'll be jolly friends, forever more",Playmates
Lyle Ritz,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Lyle Ritz,"Where's that careless chambermaid?
Where'd she put my razor blade?
She mislaid it, I'm afraid,
It's gotta be foun'!
Ask her when she cleaned my room
What she did with my perfume;
I just can't lose it,
I've gotta use it,
'Cause Lulu's back in town.

Gotta get my old tuxedo pressed,
Gotta sew a button on my vest,
'Cause tonight I've gotta look my best,

Gotta get a half a buck somewhere,
Gotta shine my shoes and slick my hair,
Gotta get myself a boutonniere,

Mister Otis regrets
That he won't be aroun'.
You can tell the mailman not to call,
I ain't comin' home until the fall,
And I might not get back home at all,

You can bet I've got it bad,
Best complaint I've ever had;
We'll be stepping out tonight,

Lyle Ritz,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Lyle Ritz,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Lyle Ritz,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Lyle Ritz,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Lyle Ritz,"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea

Lyle Ritz,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be

To stay old fashioned with me

Lyle Ritz,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

Lymie,"Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

Lyn Cantrelle,"Won't you play some simple melody
Like my mother sang to me
One with a good old-fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody

Musical demon, set your honey a-dreamin',
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune 
That is choppy you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Play for me
That good old-fashioned harmony

When I grow tired of you
Never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you (on you)

You say you fear I'll change my mind

It's not warm when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long

Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Lyn Collins,"In the hustle of the day, we're all inclined to miss 
Little things that mean so much 
A word, a smile, and a kiss 
When a woman loves a man, he's a hero in her eyes 
And a hero he can always be if he'll just realise 

She may be weary, women do get weary 
Wearing the same shabby dress 
And when she's weary, try a little tenderness 

She may be waiting, just anticipating 
Things she may never possess 
While she's without them, try a little tenderness 

It's not just sentimental, she has her grief and her care 
But a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear 

You won't regret it, women don't forget it 
Love is their whole happiness 
And it's all so easy, try a little tenderness",Try a Little Tenderness

Merrily merrily, life is just a dream-ah
First car, I ever had was a Beamer
First girl, I ever had was a screamer

Lyn Larsen,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening (Reprise)

In a dark and smokey room
A shade of webs that leads you to
A tattered stage that's worn and gray
Another gorl sweats for another day's wage

Oh under a silver moon
She leaves her thoughts behind
Yesterday's long gone cold
The hourglass of time
Lays heavy on her mind

Child, blessed with a smile
Shivers like a snake, the way she moves
Wild, oh so wild
Runnin' from her mind, but she always seems to lose

Under a silver moon, her eyes will never lie
She's on a trip so long
The hourglass of time lays heavy on her mind
And there ain't nothin' you can do

Dance, bitch, dance
'til there's nothing left to hide
Dance, bitch, dance
Your mother should have taught you right
So wipe your tears away

Yeah, nice an' easy now, do it

Under a silver moon, her eyes will never lie
She's on a trip so long
The hourglass of time lays heavy on her mind

Glitters like a dancing flame

Your one and only, took a trip to get undone
Well my high low mam, don't you give me the blues
Take me to the river where I can let it loose
All the lovin', ah like you never knew

Out back to where the dust grows old
Where the spirits fly so high
It was a cold dark night, and I swear we was feelin' right
As our bones took us down, straight to the light

I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love
I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love

All emotions, slip through my hands
Like an ocean movin', rollin' in on the sand
A sea of love, honey, where you been
My love's been knockin' buy you ain't in
Where's my lover

Out back to where the dust grows old
Where the spirits never die
That cold dark night, but I know we was feelin' right
As we roll through the hours, down into the light

I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love
I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love

Loves to push my mind to edge
Edge of an endless sea, oh
Where the skies are black, she'll follows me
Her evil eye won't let me be

Strange enchanted love
Icy hand and a velvet glove
What can you hold when your day is done
Count your tears and pray for sun

Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
As she sits on the face of the world

Like the daily bump and grind
What's your price
For a chance on the mainline
Checks desires..be last
Silent eyes of a checkered past

Is your love the test of time
Faded days that'll ease your mind
What can you do when you're near the end
Try so hard but you can't pretend

Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
As she sits on the face of the world

Strange enchanted love
Icy hand and a velvet glove
What can you hold when your day is done
Count your tears and pray for sun

Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
As it sits in the world
Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
She just sits on the face of the world.",Cold Is the Heart

I've been tryin'
Tryin' to show to you
The way I feel inside
It don't make no sense
To hide my feelings, no

No time for wastin'
Oh there's got to be a way

You throw my way

Don't hurt me, love me, babe
Don't take your time, girl
Don't be late

Dyin' to tell you how
You tear me up inside
Just a look from you
Could make or break me

Now, do you remember
Oh when you call my name
I got this...chance

For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river

All around us stars collide 
And there's poetry inside my head 
It seems I can hear some haunting theme 
Yet there's something in your scheme 
That's too real to be a dream instead! 
 
Hey!... let's do it again an' again! 
If you will count up to ten, 
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back 
Then... we'll do it again an' again! 
 
Don't stop until I say when 
'Cause your kisses are sweet 
An' I don't want the feelin' to end! 
 
The sound all around begins to pound 
An' I know we're homeward bound 
To a world we've often found before 
We climb into space an' out of time 
Then the bells begin to chime 
We're in rhythm and in rhyme, once more! 
 
Hey!... let's do it again an' again! 
If you will count up to ten, 
That'll give me a chance to get my breath back

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Lynn Anderson,"(If this is love the whole world is in trouble)
I've been thinking quite a lot about you and I we don't get along no matter how we try
Seems to me we're always fighting always hurtin'
People say that this is love but I'm not certain
If this is love the whole world is in trouble there must be more to love than I can see
If this is love the whole world will soon be rubbled
If this is love the whole world is in trouble

They say love is sometimes happy sometimes sad
We must learn to take the good times with the bad
But there haven't been too many good times in it
You and I can't get along through fifteen minutes
If this is love the whole world is in trouble it's not what I expected it to be
And just from what I seen I'm worried double
If this is love the whole world is in trouble
[ steel ]
(If this is love the whole world is in trouble)

I can really say which one of us is worst
We both tried so hard to have our last word first
When we know we're wrong nobody will admit it
If this is love I'll just as soon forget it
If this is love the whole world is in trouble I'm really just as worried as can be
If this is love the whole world will soon be rubbled
If this is love the whole world is in trouble if this is love the whole world is in trouble

You should have got it back again in person
But so afraid my tears will start you said your friend to do your part
You really should have broke my heart in person

You once appeared at my front door in person

Lynn Anderson,"If I kiss you will you go away
Like in the game my mother used to play
You're so much hurt I wish you wouldn't stay
If I kiss you will you go away

My mom would come when I get hurt at play
She'd kiss my hurt and it would go away
But now I'm grown and I don't know what to do
I've never known a bigger hurt than you

If I kiss you will you go away
Like in the game my mother used to play
You're so much hurt I wish you wouldn't stay
If I kiss you will you go away

I've seen her kiss makes sorrow disappear
A kiss can dry away the biggest tears
A kiss can make a heartache vanish to
I don't see why it wouldn't work on you

If I kiss you will you go away
Like in the game my mother used to play
You're so much hurt I wish you wouldn't stay
If I kiss you will you go away
If I kiss you will you go away

Lynn Anderson,"I remember it all very well lookin' back it was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a oneroom rundown shack on the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent to say the least we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had to buy me a satin dancin' dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair and she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into my satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hips
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good and starin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck and she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes when she started to speak
She looked at a pitful shack and then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
Your pa's run off and I'm real sick and the baby's gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said to thine owenself be true
And I shivered as I watched a rouch crawl across the toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin' askin' mama what do I do
Just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy and they'll be nice to you
Here's your one chance...
Lord forgive me for what I do but if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown
Well that was the last time I saw my ma the night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn and for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long till I knew exactly what my mama'd been talkin' about
I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
That I was gonna be a lady someday though I didn't know when or how
I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life with my head hung down in shame
I might have been born just plain white trash but Fancy was my name
Here's your one chance...
It wasn't long after a benevolent man took me off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea in a five room motel suite
I charmed a king a congressman and an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion in an elegant New York townhouse flat

How can I undo the things that we used to do?

Lynn Anderson,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud

All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am

Lynn Anderson,"Faithless love like a river flows
Raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
And the night blows in like the cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows

Faithless love where did I go wrong
Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong
Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you
Faithless love where did I go wrong

Well I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feeling comes and goes

Faithless love like a river flows
Like raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
Faithless love has found me
Thrown its chilly arms around me
Faithless love like a river flows",Faithless Love
Lynn Anderson,"The night was black, the roads were icy
Snow was fallin', drifts were high
And I was weary, from my driving
And I stopped to rest for a while
I sat down at a truck stop
I was thinking about my past
I've had a long streak of bad luck
But I'm praying its gone at last

Gone, gone at last, gone at last
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm prayin' it's gone at last
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I ain't dumb
I kicked around some
I don't fall too easily
But that boy looked so dejected
He just grabbed my sympathy
Sweet little soul now, whats your problem?
Tell me why you're so downcast
I've had a long streak of bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last

Gone, gone at last, gone at last
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm prayin' it's gone at last
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Once in a while from out of nowhere
When you don't expect it, and you're unprepared
Somebody will come and lift you higher
And your burdens will be shared
Yes I do believe, if I hadn't met you
I might still be sinking fast
Ive had a long streak of bad luck

Lynn Anderson,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman was a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know how he come to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around
Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying don't you cry I'll be back again some day

With the softest golden curls you've ever seen
And then one day he met this pretty lady and she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your mommy sad cause oh what big eyes she had
And she took his hand and led him far away

When the new day begins he goes down to the cotton gin
And he makes his time worthwhile till then and then he climbs back up again

My four-year-old said I want to divorce now where did she hears that
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play or the little songs they sing
Last night as I watched TV one rushed through the door
Mommy daddy's telling someone on the phone don't you call me here no more
Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play or the little songs they sing
I bet my daddy can whip your daddy but daddy's never home
And I think mommy is worried bout him cause she cried all night long

Lynn Anderson,"I heard he sang a good song I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for awhile
And there he was this young boy a stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers singing my life with his words

Killing me softly with his song killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each word out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers...
He sang as if he knew me in all my darkest pair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
But then he was there this stranger singing clear and strong

Lynn Anderson,"Lonely women make good lovers
They're all at mercy of a good lookin' smooth talkin' man
Lonely women make good lovers
So if you got a woman better treat her just as good as you can
Lots of times a lonely girl will go out on the town
With no thought of evil on her mind
She don't try to plant bad seeds but there's something every woman needs
And a friendly smile will tempt her every time
Lonely women make good lovers...
Once a woman's tasted love she can't live without it
She'll search for something warm when she gets cold
And if her lips are wet with wine when it comes to lovin' time
She'll trade her pride for something warm to hold

A rich old man and she won't have to worry she'll dress up all in lace and go in style
But late at night a big old house gets lonely I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving
She is headin' for the cheatin' side of town
You can't hide your lyin' eyes and your smile has been disguised
I thought by now you'd realize that there ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

With the little boy next door like so many times before

Cause I heard him name a game, and I hung my head in shame

I know it can't be fun

Lynn Anderson,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

Lynn Anderson,"Such a feelin's coming over me there is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes and I won't be surprised if it's a dream
Everything I want the world to be is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's teelin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me
There is only one wish on my mind when this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me

So my pride let me start feeling sorry for myself
I built the wall around my heart to give it security
Then your sweet love opened up a brand new life for me
Clouds of doubt were gone at last I saw the sunshine
Instead of crying now I feel like singing all the time
Yes at last I know how sweet the joys of love can be
And it all happened when your sweet love lifted me
Yes your sweet love lifted me you showed me how your sweet love could satisfy me
I was blinded but you made me see when your sweet love lifted me

I'd get hurt and the tear would well up in my eye
Then she hold me and tell me that big girls don't cry

Lynn Anderson,"There was a boy in Arkansas who wouldn't listen to his ma
When she told him that he should go to school
He'd sneak away in the afternoon take a little walk and pretty soon
You'd find him at the local auction barn
Well he'd stand and listened carefully then pretty soon he began to see
How the auctioneer could talk so rapidly
He said oh my it's do or die I've got to learn that auction cry
Gotta make my mark and be an auctioneer
A 15 dollar bid and now twenty now
Will you gimme twenty make it now twenty bi di di bom a twenty now
Will you gimme twenty who da ba bi bi da twenty dollar bid
I got twenty dollar bid and now twenty five now
Will you gimme twenty five make it now twenty five bi di di bom a twenty five now
Will you gimme twenty five who da ba bi bi da twenty five dollar bid
Well as time went on he did his best and all could see he didn't jest
He practiced calling bids both night and day
His pop would find him behind the barn just working up an awful storm
As he tried to imitate an auctioneer
His dad said son we just can't stand to have a mediocre man
Sellin' things at action using our name
We'll send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool
You can take your place among the best
A twenty five dollar bid and now thirty now
Will you gimme thirty make it now thirty bi di di bom a thirty now
Will you gimme thirty who da ba bi bi da thirty dollar bid
A thirty dollar bid and now thirty five now
Will you gimme thirty five make it now thirty five bi di di bom a thirty five now
Will you gimme thirty five who da ba bi bi da thirty five dollar bid
So from that boy who went to school there grew a man who played it cool
He came back home a full fledged auctioneer
And the the people came from miles around just to hear him make that rhytmic sound
That fill their hearts with such a happy cheer
His fame spread out from shore to shore but he had all he could do and more
Had to buy a plane to get around
Now he's the best in all the land let's pause to give that man a hand
He's the best of naughty auctioneers
I got thirty five dollar bid and now forty dollar forty
Will you gimme forty make it forty bi di di bom a forty dollar
Will you gimme forty who da ba bi bi da forty dollar bid
I got forty dollar bid and now forty five dollar forty five
Will you gimme forty five make it forty five bi di di bom a forty five dollar

Lynn Anderson,"Morning comes and Lord my mind is aching sunshine standing quietly at my door
Just like the dawn my heart is silently breaking
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor
Once again the whole town will be talking Lord I've seen the pity that's in their eyes
They could never understand it's his sorrow not another woman
And no matter what they say I know he tried
Baby's packed everything and he's left me he's left me
And I know he didn't mean to make me cry
It's not his heart Lord it's his mind he didn't mean to be unkind
Why he even woke me up to say goodbye
It's not his heart Lord it's his mind he didn't mean to be unkind
Why he even woke me up to say goodbye goodbye baby

Other girls have been in love with him
And the only chance you'll ever have is very slim
And you think your dreams would all come true if he were free
But he's not, and if we were, he'd still love me
He'd still love me because he remembers the little things I've done
Like ironing shirts and pressing suits when he had only one
And knowing this you're still expecting me to set him free
But I won't, and if I did, he'd still love me

Can't you feel sweet warmth when your hand touches mine?

Just to know that you're near makes life seem so sweet
Things that once were just dreams are now so complete
You took my grey skies, and you painted them blue
And I want you forever, so don't leave me ever 'cause I live to love you
Yes, I live to love you, and there's nobody who could ever ever take the place of you

Falling in love with somebody else
Ready to take that chance again

Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
 
Maybe it's a sign of weakness when I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?  Do we distort the facts?

Lynn Hilary,"The cold Atlantic swells
That gathered up a storm
A silent prayer to call
Her exiled children home
A western wind that wailed
Through ancient stone and rain
The holy ground laid barren
In a stranger's name

Oh, sullen night, oh, let them stay

Your heart was broken to see them go
But still your prayers, your faith held strong
A song that carried on the western shores
They heard your voice, a voice of hope

The poet's pen laid dry

The beauty left untold
A mother with a child
Left crying by the road
The harvest that had failed
The earth could give no more
The wretched who survived wait
At the poorhouse door

Oh, sullen night, oh, let us pray

Lynn Hilary,"We were born in the country where life's never tiring
Where people from cities, they drove down admiring
The mountains and rivers they always imagined
To never have substance at all

I once met an old man who told me a story
Of a great British empire living in glory
I sat down beside him and listened intently
But couldn't find meaning at all

On the road to glory
On the road, always without a prayer
On the road, the road to nowhere
God, I pray that there's somebody there

I pick up the papers and read the opinions
Of high-flying critics who scorn at the millions
Of ordinary people who live in the shadows
And search for a light in the dark

I'm traveling this road and I'm playing in places
To handfuls of people with hope in their faces
They're asking me questions and searching for meanings
In songs I can't give them at all

On the road, the road to glory
On the road, always without a prayer
On the road to nowhere
God, I pray that there's somebody there

Living in the city you know it ain't easy
The cars and the taxis are passing so quickly
I sometimes imagine there's nobody listening
To the songs that I'm singing at all

I'm sitting here singing this song by the river
Looking at towers and grey concrete buildings
I'm dreaming of Ireland and wet summer evenings
And wishing I was back home again

On the road, the road to glory
On the road, always without a prayer
On the road to nowhere

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Lynn Hope,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Years full of tears and regret;

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

And we spun like hurricanes
And I was yours and you were mine

Well I know it was love
'Cause love can set you wandering
Or keep you in a cage 
Or make you do most anything 
Oh and I know it was love
'Cause nothing else could touch us then
We were just like leaves
Tumbling inside the wind

And this love poured down like rain
And we lived out on the line
And we spun like hurricanes
And I was yours and you were mine 

Now you wonder where it's gone
Well looking back I think I know
We held it in our arms
But we got scared and let it go

We could have rode the rails
We could have taken any town
We could have danced along the bars
We could have burned the whole place down

And this love poured down like rain
And we lived out on the line
And we spun like hurricanes
And I was yours and you were mine 
And I was yours and you were mine
And I was yours and you were mine",I Know It Was Love
Lynn Miles,"I loved a cowboy
I loved his cowboy ways
I loved his sky-blue eyes
Those cold November days
He'd walk across the field
And I could see his breath
And I swear I heard his heart
Beating inside his chest

And those nights spent in two-horse towns
Pick-up trucks and country bars
Those nights were like blankets
Like movies
Like falling . . . like falling . . . stars 

Well I loved this cowboy
More than I should admit
More than I knew was right
But I got real used to it
I would go out ridin'
For two weeks at a time
And I knew the only lonely heart
Was never his, only mine 

And those nights spent in two-horse towns
Pick-up trucks and country bars
Those nights were like blankets
Like movies
Like falling . . . like falling . . . stars 

When I thought about it
Some loves are compromise
Some loves burn bright and fast and die
Some loves are all on one side
So I left this cowboy
I left on New Year's Day
It was my resolution
I just up and rode away

From those nights spent in two-horse towns
Pick-up trucks and country bars
Those nights were like blankets
Like movies
Like falling . . . like falling . . . stars ",I Loved a Cowboy

And land on the streets of this sleepy town
Well, I got out my mitts and I got out my hat
Ain't it funny how the season change just like that

Then I watched the neighbors' kids try to lick the flakes
All the passing cars stopped to check their brakes
And pretty soon we'll be singing Christmas songs
Like ""I wish I had a river that I could skate away on""

And then I watched the rooftops change from black to white
All the cats and dogs went home for the night
And the birds left town 'bout a month ago
Except for the ones that are built for snow

And then I watched the trees shiver by the light of the moon
And I didn't feel lonely but I know I will soon
And any day now I won't say one good thing
About the cold and the snow and I'll complain until spring

Lynn Miles,"Loneliness is an envelope you can seal yourself into 
And send off to a stranger in a )town across the sea
Loneliness is a tired old friend who carries your baggage 
Through airports and train stations for free
Loneliness wears a suit and tie on busy city streets
And makes you cry at parties filled with people that you know
Loneliness will take your hand and lead you to the shoreline 
On foggy days to find the undertow

It is the hurt that hurts the deepest
It is the ache that you can't cure
It is the desperation of the late night telephone call
It is the lover in the shadows
It is the one that got away
It is the cry of the southbound birds in the fall 

Loneliness will steal your soul on stormy windy hills
And hides behind red maple trees on autumn afternoons
Loneliness sits on the porch of the house you used to live in
It is the distant sound of thunder and trains and loons

It is the hurt that hurts the deepest
It is the ache that you can't cure
It is the desperation of the late night telephone call
It is the lover in the shadows
It is the one that got away
It is the cry of the southbound birds in the fall

On the first day that it rained

I'd never felt that kind of sting

All around my friends fled
All around I felt deception
At every word that people said
In the dark there was no vision
In the dark there was just pain
But nobody could get near me
'Cause it moved just like a train

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long lonesome fight

As I turned to it again
They reached out their arms to save me

Loving you is not in not in my control
But loving you I have a goal of what's left in my life
I will live and I would die for you",Loving You
Lynn Roberts,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song
Lynn Roberts,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You
Lynn Roberts,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream
Lynn Roberts,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too? 
Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;
 

",Who's Sorry Now?
Lynn Roberts,"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you 
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
 
A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,

Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone
Only one last solution
To put an end to war pollution

Love bomb, until the time when hate has gone
From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Go up in a cloud of love
Reaching for the Lord above

And understand is simply plant the seed 
And make the world a much better place
Let's all embrace the human race

From now on, we're gonna drop a love bomb
Love bomb is gonna fall on everyone
Only one last solution
To put an end to war pollution

You and me had better start to clean up the world
And in a while we could be making love
Instead of all the fighting and hate
Why should we wait? It's not too late
Love bomb!

I can tell pretty mama I been wastin' time 
'Cause you don't really love me 
You just love me for what I am 
But you best treat me right, woman 
Gonna lose your money man 

Well when I first met you baby, you was a red light girl 
But I tried to take you to better world 
But you would not listen 
Still you think I am a fool 
Well you had it made in the shade, baby 
Don't let that tree fall down on you 

Well I work the railroad each and every day

We don't want you around

Like a black cat do
And two bodies are layin' naked
A creeper think he got nothin' to lose
So he creeps into this house, yeah
And unlocks the door
And as a man's reaching for his trousers
Shoots him full of thirty-eight holes

Mr. Saturday night special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
Ain't good for nothin'
But put a man six feet in a hole

Big Jim's been drinkin' whiskey
And playin' poker on a losin' night
And pretty soon ol' Jim starts a thinkin'
Somebody been cheatin' and lyin'
So Big Jim commence to fightin'
I wouldn't tell you no lie
Big Jim done pulled his pistol
Shot his friend right between the eyes

Mr. Saturday night special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
Ain't good for nothin'
But put a man six feet in a hole

Oh, it's the Saturday night special, for twenty dollars you can buy yourself one too

Hand guns are made for killin'
They ain't no good for nothin' else
And if you like to drink your whiskey
You might even shoot yourself
So why don't we dump 'em people
To the bottom of the sea
Before some ol' fool come around here
Wanna shoot either you or me

Mr. Saturday night special
You got a barrel that's blue and cold
You ain't good for nothin'
But put a man six feet in a hole

Mr. the Saturday night special
And I'd like to tell you what you could do with it
And that's the end of the song",Saturday Night Special

I still see her dark eyes glowing

I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying

Before the rooster crowed
Searchin' for soda bottles
To get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner
Down to the country store
Cash 'em in, and give my money

Old Curt was a black man
With white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine
He did not have a care
He used to own an old Dobro
Used to play it 'cross his knee
I'd give old Curt my money
He'd play all day for me

Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well, I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues

He looked to be sixty
And maybe I was ten
Mama used to whoop me
But I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feet
Try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine

Well, I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues

On the day old Curtis died
Nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words
And they chunked him in the clay
Well, he lived a lifetime
Playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life
That's all he had to lose

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"I was cutting a rug
Down at a place called Jug
With a girl named Linda Lu
When in walked a man
With a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you know who

He said, ""Hey fat fellow
With the hair colored yellow
Watcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there
And I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you""

I said, ""Excuse""

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean
Big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me

Oh, wait a minute, Mister
I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me
But I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you

Oh, won't you give me three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
And you'll never see me no more, for sure

Well, the crowd cleared away
And I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son
Well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four

Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lu
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

Oh, won't you give me three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps
Gimme three steps, Mister
And you'll never see me no more

Show me the back door",Gimme Three Steps [Original Version][#]

They're gonna settle down
You don't see their faces
And they don't come around
Well I'm not that way
I got to move along

I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
You got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right

Seems so long I been out on my own
Travel light and I'm always alone
Guess I was born with a travelin' bone
When my times up, I'll hold my own
You won't find me in an old folks home

You got that right
Said you got that right
Well, you got that right
Sure got that right

I tried everything in my life
Things I like I try 'em twice
You got that right
You sure got that right

Travelin' around the world, just singing my song
I got to go, Lord I can't stay long
Here comes that ol' travelin' jones once again

I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"My baby came home late last night
I said girl I gotta talk to you
I've been drinkin' with the man next door
He said he's been singin' with you
Whoever's tellin' lies it's time to say bye-bye
You know my mama didn't raise no fool

[Chorus]
You're gonna walk out that door you'll never see me anymore
Tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna love ya' just one more time
I'd love to see what you've got
I don't care if it takes all night
Gonna make you remember for the rest of your life oh baby

We had a good thing a good thing goin'
But ain't been seein' eye to eye
You had a good thing but it's all over
Might as well wave and say goodbye

It's easy to see the guilt in your eyes
Girl I want you to tell me the truth
Was he worth the risk and all the trouble he's caused
Now it comes down to me and you
You thought I was blind when you were gone all the time
Playin' me for a fool

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"You got to lock your doors, keep the world out
We're closin' ourselves in
If you watch the news it'll scare you to death
To hell and back again
The only justice here's at the wrong end of a gun
Got the criminal makin' the laws got the good men on the run
I've seen enough

We don't own anything we've got we've givin' it all away
But that don't make no sense to me you know who's gonna pay
It's the man in the factory workin' twelve hours a day
The woman workin' in the restaurant with another kid on the way

[Chorus]
Isn't anything in this life sacred anymore
We can't lose what we've got it's worth fightin' for
I've seen enough, I've seen enough to make a grown man cry

A man's standin' by the road a sign in his hand
He don't want your charity he says I ain't no beggar man
All I need is a chance to get back on my feet
But we just pass him by well it could be you or me
I've seen enough
I ain't the kind to just sit back and watch the world go 'round
It's not too late to change let's turn this shit around

[Chorus]",I've Seen Enough
Lynyrd Skynyrd,"There's a rumor goin' 'round on the backside of town
Jake is out to get some revenge
Has fire in his eyes since his brother died
Shot down by a so-called friend

For a fifty dollar gram is what the neighbors say
Drugs had control of his life
Caught up on crack you're tryin' to think back
The devil had him hooked you could see it in his eyes
It's a killer

There's a cold house at the corner of the street
The kids come and go there at night
Jerry drove up in front of the house
Somebody pulled out a knife
Jerry freaked out and went for his gun
Shot him right between the eyes
All he ever wanted was a twenty dollar high
But now he's locked up for the rest of his life

[Chorus]
It's a killer there's no way out baby once your in
It's a killer steal from your family
Then you'll turn on your friends
It's a killer it can happen to you

So don't you never, never give in
It's a killer

The neighborhood I used to call home
These days it's lookin' like a war zone
Unemployment on the rise but the black market thrives
Money just keeps changin' hands
The laws are gettin' tough sometimes it's not enough
To satisfy supply and demand

Trouble breaks out there's fightin' in the streets
Bullets flyin' all around
An innocent child caught in the line of fire
All because there weren't enough drugs to go around

Were you sent down from heaven to show me the way

'cause I'll keep on tryin' to put it straight to you
You better give it straight to me
'cause most women seem to have a good time
Makin' a fool out of me
I'm keepin' my faith I've made up my mind
I've got nothin' left to lose just lay it on the line

I'm keepin' my faith yea I'll find the one
Who won't steal me blind who won't turn and run
I'm keepin' my faith I'm trustin' in you
So don't treat me like those other ones do
Ain't no gettin' 'round it tell me to my face
Do you think I'm a fool for keepin' my faith in you

I'll treat you right I'll do you better
I won't disappoint you I won't make you cry

She'd help us say our prayers every night
She was always there to help us through the hard times
We could count on her to make everything alright

Papa said there's somethin' I need to say tonight
Mama's been sick for a long time
Let's pray to god she can make it through the night

[Chorus]
Mama don't wanna say goodbye
She said wipe those tears from your eyes
Mama I don't wanna say goodbye
It was written in the heavens and the skies above
Son I gave you birth showed you all my love
I can't think of this life without you it's hard to try
Mama I'm afraid to say goodbye

Now kids I've been hangin' on a long time
I hate to leave this world before your grown
Remember everything that I've taught you
Remember all the good times when I'm gone

She whispered in my ear before she passed away

I hope your ready too

He drives around in a fancy car
Smokes those long Cuban cigars
He don't know how to play guitar
He can't sing but still the pretty girls think he's a star

We play music got families to feed
Ain't good with numbers and he knows we can't read
If we get a dollar you know he gets three
It ain't hard to figure out it's as simple as can be
Don't ask me ask the money man

These boys are livin' in a fantasy land
I just keep 'em on the road so they can pay the money man
I'll be long gone before they understand
My promises are strong like a road made out of sand

I wanna be your money man

Don't ask me ask the money man

You signed the dotted line I'm takin' all I can
Your money's lookin' good in my retirement plan
That's just the way it is when your playin' in a band

That's my money man down on his knees
He ain't prayin' but he damn sure ought to be
He's at a place where money doesn't grow on trees
And all his prison buddies doin' more than shoot the breeze
How does it feel no money man
Not too good
What did you do with my money man
Well I a, well a you know a,

You don't realize it 'till it's all behind

I knew she'd be good for a game
Dancin' out on the floor she was ready for more

I'll do it myself before somebody makes a fool out of me

'cause nothin' comes easy for a man like me
Everybody thinks the best things in life are free
If they would open their eyes it'd be so plain to see
That the best things in life don't come so easily

I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me
He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree
It would have been alright but he pushed me too far
If your lookin' for trouble step outside of this bar
If it comes down to fistin', mister that ain't nothin' new to me

You'll find in this life if there's somethin' that you believe
You got to get your hands dirty when it's somethin' that you really need

Talkin' 'bout how it used to be
When I was young I was a hell of a man
My father died when I was ten
I hit the road to find a job
Had to feed my family
Times were hard my hands are still scarred
From the life I've had to lead
I was born to run

Drove a tractor and trailer all my life
Six kids and a hell of a wife
Made lots of money it all slipped away
A large family that's the price you pay
I always dreamed never gave up
Son, even when times got tough
That's when I'd push it a little bit more
You should've heard that engine roar

[Chorus]
I was born to run
Can't slow down
No regrets, I've been blessed
Born to run
In time you'll see what the good lord's done for me
Born to run
I can't slow down
No regrets, I did my best
Born to run
In time you'll see
What the good lord's done, done for me

The old man, he passed away
And all he said never crossed my mind
Until I saw the price he paid
Was a lot like mine
I'm full and though it's miles away
Gotta hit the city right on time
And when I'm on I'll always sing little song of mine
I was born to run

As the rain pours off his hat

Gotta put it all behind him

Keeps to himself but everybody takes him wrong

Got a dream that will never die

They say he's always alone, he rides a horse with no name

Of all the men who tried and lost, all the ones he sent to hell

Too much money been spent upon the moon.
Well, until they make it right
I hope they never sleep at night
They better make some changes
And do it soon.

There ain't no place I ain't never gone

Well, there just ain't no place like home

Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young
Or a fish in a river swimming free?
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee?

And, Lord, I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
'Cause I can see the concrete slowly creepin'
Lord, take me and mine before that comes

Would you like to see a mountain stream a-flowin'?
Would you like to see a youngin' with his dog
Did you ever stop to think about, well, the air your breathin'?
Well, you better listen to my song

And, Lord, I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
Yes but I can see the concrete slowly creepin'
Lord, take me and mine before that comes

I'm not tryin' to put down no big cities
But the things they write about us is just a bore
Well, you can take a boy out of ol' dixieland
Lord but you'll never take ol' dixie from a boy

And, Lord, I can't make any changes

Once, I was a tumbleweed
Like a rolling stone, cold and all alone,
Livin' for the day my dream  would come

Never cared for school or any golden rules
Papa used to always say I was a useless fool
So I left my home to show 'em they was wrong
And headed out on the road, singin' my songs

Then one sunny day, the man, he looked my way
And everything that I dreamed of, it was real
Money, girls, and cars and big long cigars
And I caught the first plane home so Papa would see

When I went home to show 'em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones
Somebody tell me, please, was I right or wrong?
Lord, it's such a sad song

At first I got lost, then I got found
But the ones that I loved were in the ground
Papa, I only wish you could see me now
Take a listen Papa, I learned how to play my guitar, superstar
Play one for momma now

If there's any way that you can hear what I say
Papa, I never meant to do you wrong
All the money, girls, and cars,
And all the world's long cigars,
Papa, I just want you to know,
They couldn't take your place

When I went home to show 'em they was wrong,
All that I found was two tombstones

So lets take care of what we have
Before the good we know goes bad 
And the beauty fades and just slips away

The dirty air and the die-in' seas
Will this be the world we leave
To the wild and young 
And say just look at what we've done

And right before our eyes
Today's yesterday could be tomorrow's goodbye

Do you ever think about the future or the past
Do you ever wonder how long this world will last

So let's take care of what we have
Before the good we know goes bad 
And the beauty fades and just slips away

The dirty air and the die-in' seas
Will this be the world we leave
To the wild and young 
And say just look at what we've done

And right before our eyes
Now it's right before our eyes
Today's yesterday, will be tomorrow's goodbye",Tomorrow's Goodbye
Lynyrd Skynyrd,"There've been times when I
Have stumbled over my mistakes
And there've been times when I
Have fallen flat on my face
But you tell me there's never been
A day like that for you
Then I'll stop and listen
To what you think I should do

Now I can take this pressure
That you think you're handing down
But take off the robe
And put the gavel down
Cause nothing changes in this life
But everything, my friend
Don't go cryin' 'bout today
Because of what has been

Opportunity is for the taking
Look inside yourself, you'll see
Then go clean up your own backyard, 
Leave my yard to me

Now, if the cup had
Really not been meant to pass to me
Surely I would not presume to drink
But there they are
And they're reaching out for me
What else would you have me to think

Opportunity is for the taking
Look inside yourself, you'll see
Then go clean up your own backyard, 
Leave my yard to me

Have stumbled over my mistakes

It seems to bring us near
I wish Christmas was every day
There's somethin' about those lights
On that tree at night

Under the mistletoe
A laugh like little children
Makin' angels in the snow

That this very special time of year
It seems to set your heart a glow

On this starry night

Go home and light a fire

Wrap me up, take me away

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"Alas my love you do me wrong
To cast me out discourteously
When I have loved you so so long
Delighting in your company

Your gown was of the grassy green
Your sleeves of satin were hanging by
Which made you be a harvest queen
Yet you would not love me

Green sleeves was my all my joy
Green sleeves was my delight
Green sleeves was my heart of gold
And who but my lady green sleeves

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

Through the tall grass growing in the old bayou
The old bayou

There's a dark haired woman that looks so fine
Wearing hand me down clothes, drinking homemade wine
No one ever knew who her daddy was
The people down here say it's all because
She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake
The keeper of souls down on Vodoo Lake

There's a city boy across the county line
Came looking for the legend of the girl so fine
Well the stories that he heard, well they had to be lies
But he found out different when he looked inher eyes
Well he tried to run away but she had control
He's findin' out now what everybody knows
He knew it was over when she started to shake
Now there's one more soul down on Voodoo Lake

There's an eerie silence at the break of dawn
A chill in the air, something wrong
When a shadow crosses the ground
Those long lost souls never make a sound
You'd think by now they'd realize
She'll never break her bayou ties

She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake
The keeper of souls down on Voodoo Lake

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"Well I used to wake the morning before the rooster crowed
Searching for soda bottles to get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner, down to the country store
Cash 'em in and give my money to a man named Curtis Loew

Old Curt was a black man with white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
He used to own an old Dobro, used to play it across his knee
I'd give old Curt my money, he'd play all day for me

Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinking money, tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless, them people are the fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues

He looked to be sixty, and maybe I was ten
Mama used to whip me but I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feets, try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two then take another drink of wine

Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinking money, tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless, them people are the fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues
Yes sir

On the day old Curtis died, nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words, and they chunked him in the clay
But he lived a lifetime playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life, that's all he had to lose

Play me a song Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here so everyone would know
People said he was useless, them people all are fools
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker to ever play the blues",The Ballad of Curtis Lowe

There's always been the hand of God restin' right there on your shoulder

Look to the sky, the answer is clear
Are you gonna, live life for all it's worth
Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth
If you live it right, there's nothing to fear
'Cause you'll find Heaven right here

Saw a man the other day, had it made in every way
Till his greed brought him down
He was blinded by the city lights, now he shivers in the cold tonight
Who will save the lifeguard when he's about to drown

Will it be Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you
Look to the sky, the answer is clear
Are you gonna, live life for all it's worth
Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth

You know your gonna feel the pain
You're gonna lose, if you want to win the game
And every time your heart is breakin'
And every time your faith is shaken
Remember what mama said that day

Hope when my time has come
I've left enough to build upon
Ain't no one gonna say, ""I didn't try""
Here's why

Look to the sky, the answer is clear

I didn't get up 'til the sun went down
When your backs against the wall you better get tough

Good lookin' women backwoods and moonshine
Learned more about life on the streets than in school
Sweet Mama didn't raise no fool (No she didn't)

Hahahaha...
Ooooohhh...

Some folks cheat and some folks lie
I can judge a man by the look in his eyes
So don't hand me Jack and try to call it Cola

Learned more about life on the streets than in school

Where I come from its bix and gravy not champagne, caviar
Got pickup trucks ain't no mercedes, that's who we are,

But I get up every mornin' and thank the man above
Oh, my life is good (lemme tell ya how good)

I can slow drive down an old dirt road that's how I like it
I can turn my music way up loud, ain't nothin better than the sound of a crowd, 
American flag it makes me proud, that's how I like it

Listen now, ain't no cell phone towers, you won't catch me online, 
Workin with my hands for hours, that's how I spend my time,

Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say.

It will help you some sunny day.

Troubles will come and they will pass.
Go find a woman and you'll find love,
And don't forget son,
There is someone up above.

Be something you love and understand.
Be a simple kind of man.
Won't you do this for me son,
If you can?

All that you need is in your soul,
And you can do this if you try.
All that I want for you my son,
Is to be satisfied.

Can I stay here long

He said Mr. Hobo you got to go now

We don't want you around

See I'm trying to build a respectable town

And we don't need a hobo like you around

 

So I left that town, Lord with my guitar in my hand

Still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man

See I'm trying to learn about the old music from ridin' the train

I'm a hobo I know, but thta's the price I pay

Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way

Catch me another train and this is what I'll say

I'm goin' to ride this train Lord until I find out

What Jimmie Rogers and the Hag was all about

See I play this rock n roll and I think that's fine

Once, I was a tumbleweed.
Like a rolling stone, cold and all alone,
Livin' for the day my dream  would come.
I never cared for school or any golden rule.
Papa used to always say I was a useless fool.
So I left my home to show 'em they was wrong
And headed out on the road singin' my songs.
Then one sunny day, the man, he looked my way
And everything that I dreamed of, it was real.
Money, girls, and cars; big long cigars.
And I caught the first plane home so Papa would see.
When I went home to show 'em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones.
Somebody tell me, please, was I right or wrong?
Lord, it's such a sad song.
First I got lost, then I got found
But the ones that I loved were in the ground.
Papa, I only wish you could see me now.
Take a listen Papa:

If there's any way that you can hear what I say:
Papa, I never meant to do you wrong.
All the money, girls, and cars,
And all the world's long cigars,
Papa, I just want you to know,
They couldn't take your place.

With a gun in his hand

With the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there
And I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you""
I said, ""Excuse me""

I was shaking like a leaf on a tree

And I know you don't owe me
But I wish you'd let me
Ask one favor from you""

And I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor

And that's the break I was looking for

Searching for soda bottles to get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner, down to the country store
Cash 'em in and give my money to a man named curtis loew

Old curt was a black man with white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro, used to play it across his knee
I'd give old curt my money, he'd play all day for me

Play me a song curtis loew, curtis loew
I got your drinking money, tune up your dobro

'Cause curtis loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues

He looked to be sixty, and maybe I was ten
Mama used to whip me but I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feets, try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine.

[Chorus]

Yes sir
On the day old curtis died, nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words, and they chunked him in the clay
But he lived a lifetime playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life, that's all he had to lose

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"This is a story 'bout livin'
A tale of a long hard road
Ain't a whole lot of misgivin's
Of the things that I thought I sowed
My daddy was a real hard worker
He said son there will come a day
Talk ain't always cheap
And here's what daddy had to say
With these hands I've made my livin'
With these hands I've held a child
With these hands I've climbed a mountain
Sometimes we forget
We ain't much different at all

He likes grits, you like the apple
There ain't nothin' wrong with that
He says why'all, you say you'se
It all depends on where you're at

And its always good for the soul
From New York City out to California
You know its only rock and roll

With these hands we come together
With these hands we can change the world
With these hands I play my music
Sometimes we forget
We ain't much different at all

Oh, not at all
So what I'm trying to tell you
Is that I'm only one son of the South
Its gonna take more than you me and you
To work this whole thing out

Lynyrd Skynyrd,"Floyd was a trapper way back in the holler
Made moonshine so he could make a dollar

Floyd never hurt no one in his life
But they never came back this way
No, they never came back this way

Aye, aye, aye, aye hear the hound dogs moan
Aye, aye, aye, aye now that Floyd is long gone
And the creeper was a creepin' and the souls they were hollerin' singin'
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

The G-men came out to track him down
But the swamp was too deep, even one of them drowned
They sent in the hellhounds but they turned around singing
How how how how how

And the people say
Aye, aye, aye, aye hear the hound dogs moan
Aye, aye, aye, aye now that Floyd is long gone
And the creeper was a creepin' and the souls they were hollerin' singin'

Well it was 3 AM and she was cryin' and her eyes were all red
When that music video came on and she sat up in her bed
She grabbed that whiskey bottle
Poured one last shot
And threw that empty glass at the TV and screamed

Unsing them lines about those happy times

I know what I'd do

Lyrics Born,"Woke up in the middle of the night cold sweating
Ass stinging no breath legs clinging to the bedside

Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right

This situation's gotten out of control
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Listen

Got burnt by women poor dirts? In Venice
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

Close relations past friendships don't last
No benefits plan, wrote a letter to my senator

We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

This situation's gotten out of control (hey he hey)

Lyrics Born,"This is hard for me to write it's difficult to express this
Its heavy on my shoulders and the weight gets relentless
The story of brothers and a beautiful friendship
And how relations get strained with pressure and tension
Who's wrong, correct, so, so, subjective
You look back its hard 'cause the mind gets adventurous
Dates get mixed up facts disconnected
The only thing you remember is the feeling that you're left with
It started as a blessing

Now you could write this off as luck or one of life's coincidences
But at some point you think god damn what are the chances
People with similar interests and influences
Coming together at that moment to form a kinship
It's like you knew that you was brothers before your conception
Even if you're not a spiritual person I admit shit
At that point I wasn't but at some point it sets in
It be foolish to dismiss this as coincidence
Now this shit is different, somewhere this is written
Be part of a mission, this shit is predestined
Closer than close like flesh is to tendon
Share my 50 cent bag of chips with my freshman
Half a half a gas station sandwich no question
Talking shit to me well then talking shit to him then
Family is sacred it must be protected
Family is sacred and it must be protected

Over time I don't know what happens something got infected
People grow in different ways at different rates I guess
It ridiculous, little shit it suddenly gets big shit
Lapses in communication, glitches in the system
He said that she said what nobody said shit
But you'll never know 'cause everyone's passive aggressive
I sit down smoke pow wow how everyone said shit
People cease to make the effort to get to the essence
Peep this shit out though this shit is really twisted
Funny thing is that you and I do it every minute
We take it in rhetoric every time somebody says shit
Against us stock piling every little incident
What's stupid is all the bullshit that's circulating
Could be fixed in an instant with simple conversation
But you know how pride is
A bitch with her fist clenched
That mixed with the fat drama gets addictive
Wounds need dressing and they don't receive attention
It snowballs and festers and creates resentment
People demonise each other brave discontent
But nobody could've been prepared for the next step
The nature of the predator is calculated pensive
Waiting in the brush patiently revving they engines
Despite the colour that they got all they see is crimson
Waiting for they prey to become desperate defenceless
Outside is always over just beyond the fences
Today the gate is open though today they make an entrance
Friendly at first laughs jokes like we best friends
Slowly though you start to see they become hidden agendas
Nine to five one day insecure self perceptions
Shines a spotlight on all those paranoid self perceptions
Things begin to heat up everyone's already stretched thin
How could you be well how could you be so deceptive
Any second now someone will snap like a bread stick
And what once was simply dissolves like a breath mint
Just like that you start to ask yourself questions
Is this really worth all the emotion and depressment
Do the benefits and perks outweigh the pressure
Let me step back give this relationship assessment",Before And After

You can't even hold the microphone without it feedbacking
Since the days of speed rapping I've been snapping cats spinal bones
(em)barras them in front of women take their little titles home
Bear in mind I come from an era in time
Where you actually had to have lyrics that rhyme
Let my baritone grind your insides, paralyse your cerebellum
Throw with your reality out of a nine mit?
Flip shit, on some pimp shit, on some rock shit
Some rap rock testosterone rip shit
Look inside every magazine you read about me
Got an excerpt, your sissy ass crew's afraid to say the fucking f-word
Tired of playing games, I don't know the password
How's about this open up the damn cash drawer
Throw the keys on the dashboard
Let the real players play this shit
Yah can fucking wretch up?

[Chorus]
Pack up get started walking
Fall back now on your losses
You can't accomplish
But you won't defeat no contest baby

Forfeit don't rock the call pit???
Chalk this up as a conquest
Some things is sacred
I don't play with my stage or my audience

Smooth talking charismatic ass ill
Talk you lady outta bra
Honda hatchback hand held y'all starved
And I'm dangling a shrimp by the fan tail
Whole audience about to fall over the handrail
I can't tell is that rapping?
Dude sound like a fucking parrot just crash landed
Man this shit is ass backwards these days real crazy
I can count on one hand cats that's truly creative
And the rest is all get along go along guys
Happy not to get involved just along for the ride
No vision, no drive, spirit or wherewithal
You can get mad and stay mad at that I don't care at all
Huge parafoils keep em cool under a parasol
Paragon of my era like sarah born?
How many different kinda tracks have y'all heard me on
Exactly and I served them all

[Chorus]

I spent ten years in these god forsaken rap trenches
With small daily victories this shits a game of inches
I sustained minor injuries scuffles with the missus
For the chance to make history I don't regret it for a minute
Seeing cats drop a small fortune on plush ride blau?
Couple years later fools is upside down
Tell me what the fuck did you get in this game for
It's like a whole world of squirrels only one acorn
I don't usually like to take it back
But  realistically if this was a different era
y'all would fail miserably
Ghetto team I'm going in, take me down fifty feet
I never let this industry put me in the guillotine
Rapelle down the skyscraper kicking in the plexiglass
Plastique on the safe boom blown to Leningrad
Stuff the cash and the formula in the fifty bag
Slide down the rope, twenty stories hail a taxi cab

[Chorus]",Pack Up
Lyrics Born,"Stop complaining
Stop complaining

Now many songs do you figure that I've written
Since I originally started making records in this business
Back beginning in college, and it's been a menace since then
But the principal challenge, it ain't really that different
It's about me not repeating myself at all
Or at least repeating myself the least amount, I suppose
The reason being is that we need some songs
That lead us off the beaten path between my rhymes
But listen though, it's difficult now a-days
To really go against the grain, get you some accolades
Especially with these frigid, finicky, fickle-ass motherfuckers
Think they finally figured you out, the fake-ass fuckers

Stop complaining (I know, it's just that certain shit pisses me off)
Stop complaining (What am I gonna do? I mean)

Man, fuck that shit, I pay my taxes when I'm asked to
I'm not enthusiastic about it, but shit I make it happen
Yeah,  it's last minute, but goddammit they cash it
""This is fiscal harassment! They keep touching my assets!""
Now I imagine I might be feeling different about it
If it was given outright, witnessing it helping somebody
But it just so happens in life, the school district's too crowded
There ain't no teachers in sight, that's why the kids are so rowdy
I just imagine some asshole with glasses on up at the capital
One of a thousand pawns packed in an office, cramped up like animals
Pictures of his sister, his mixture Lhasa Apso poodle
His 2.6 kids and the missus thumb-tacked to his cubicle
So damned detached from the average man's planet he can't fathom
That he can ever be anything other than stats, fat and taxable
He's getting his usual, ritual 2 o'clock cup of noodles on
Fucking you with your W-2, with his John Denver music on

""Hey..um.oooh, I love this one. Hey Lil? Can you get me the file on.?""
""Blah blah blah blah blah?""
""Yeah..he's making too much money""

Stop complaining (I know, Ladies.it's just)
Stop complaining (I'm trying, I'm really trying)
Stop complaining (Yeah I know, lets give it. )
Stop complaining (I wonder what do they say about me?)

Is he a role model we can all follow full throttle
So we don't bother having to create our own model
That we go by? A fall guy I can hold accountable?
'cause I don't want to hold the bottle for my own child
Is it really my place to raise little Billy
when Hilly and William should be building with him in the living room
Instead of bailing on him, and alienating him, and basically failing him
Sending him sailing on a mission to oblivion?
Then, inevitably on his day in court and Billy ain't to blame
The bailiff asks him to raise his arm and say his name in court
Of course his parents ain't in court, they play it off
Saying it ain't his fault
Blame it on Asian Born, or his favorite artist
Beg your pardon?
Now, I do admit that in the music business
people do and say some really stupid shit
Kids are zooming in and using what we do and say
I can see how you can say ""do not abuse your influence""
But to all the Hillaries and the Williams of the new millennium
If you really aren't feeling like living with the children will be a fulfilling experience
Or something you envision yourself willingly
and unconditionally committed to from the beginning
Maybe you shouldn't be bumping bellies from the giddyup anyway, dummy

Stop complaining (Well, for now)
Stop complaining (Man, YOU stop complaining)
Stop complaining
Stop complaining (Whatever)",Stop Complaining
Lyrics Born,"[Intro]
His name is (Lyrics Born)
And he is, as they say, wild and crazy
As a composer, arranger, and producer
He's exploring it all
From the furthest reaches of musical outer space
To the most down to earth funk
And he sounds, well, he sounds exactly like this

[Verse 1]
Nobody 'members those
Rap City episodes from twenty years ago
When you were the guest host
Past history, let it go
Get off on a medical
Pack a duffle bag with all your wrinkled clothes and pedal home
Get a little dictaphone and sit alone
In the middle of the room and let it flow
Wouldn't it be better
If you went and chose a new career path
Like a shepherd or a flight attendant on an aircraft?
You're pitiful, a pollywog
Tiny fishy in a smaller pond
Holding barbie dolls and leftover beads from the Mardi Gras
Actin hella hard but that's just poppycock
'Cause inside you're hella soft like a Jolly Rancher lollypop
I'll give you cauliflower ears stupid
You're weird
Feelin blue
On a stool somewhere, two-fisting beers
At a Hofbrau
Moaning like a hot cow
Cryin on the shoulder of some old man you met just now

[Chorus]
I'm smarter than you
I'm harder than you
I'm better than you
I'm just raw

I'm hotter than you
More popular than you
More clever than you
And goshdarn it, people like me

I'm smarter than you
I'm harder than you
I'm better than you
I'm just raw

I'm hotter than you
More popular than you
More clever than you
And goshdarn it, people like me

[Verse 2]
Look I'm sorry, mate
This is awkward, k?
Little hard to say
So I'll just say it
Me and your mommy date
She's awfully great
She's a soft seatmate
She calls me late
Always wants to meet
On her coffee breaks
She bought me seats
To Bonnie Raitt
Now there's no concrete date
But she bought the ring
It's Marjorie May
And my stockings stink
From my foot up in your ass
'Cause you drive me absolutely batty
See I'm crabby when you get around me
Tell me who's your daddy
Call me Mister McAffee, your poop-deck pappy
Shut your trap and get back in the backseat of the Camry
Don't sass me or I'll backhand you
Smack you with an axe-handle
Burn you with a wax candle
Slap you with a sandle
I'm trying to watch the rap channel
Can't you tell we laugh about you?
Call yourself a rapper but I gives a rat's ass about you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why do I even bother with these Hoff-brand cats
Y'all are wombats man
I'm bout to blow this pop stand
Lyrically y'all don't compare to me in any contest
Like a stealth bomber up against a Hyundai Accent
Tall-can to a shot glass
Bong-hit to a contact
Gary Coleman versus Big Boss Man
The Loch Ness Monster up against a crawdad
Talking Sly Stallone in Rocky versus Sly Stallone in Copland
Judge Judy versus Johnny Cohcran
Oh man
Nell Carter versus Karen Carpenter topless
Better yet, Broadband
Compared to a long ass
Piece of string connecting two pop cans
It's all bad
Don't quit your job at all believe me you'll be so glad back
Hold on with both hands
It's sucks washing sauce pans
I know there's an off chance that one day hip-hop heads
Will maybe feel rappers in the top-ten that crossdress

[Chorus]

Lyrics of Two,"I fell for the promises that you made 
Sugar coated compliments that you paid
But while you told me that you were working late
She got the nights on the town, the gifts, the dates
I was too busy dreaming while the red flags were screaming
Now I don’t need your streaming ,scheming, and all your excuses

(Yeah, yeah)You said it was an accident
(No no) You didn’t mean for it to happen
Sitting in traffic or your phone was dead, 
Over at your buddy’s or the lights were all red 
And oh yeah, you said she was just a friend
Yeah breaking my heart was no accident

No longer wondering where you are at
I don’t care anymore, so what you think about that
Now I see straight through your disguise
You’re gone and I’ve moved on with my life
I’m not too busy dreaming while the red flags were screaming
Now I don’t need your streaming ,scheming, and all your excuses

Sitting in traffic or your phone was dead,

And oh yeah, you said she was just a friend
Yeah breaking my heart was no accident

It won’t be long before she will realize
That being with you is just a waste of time
And as you look into her eyes and tell her your lies
I’ll be out on the town with my new guy
She’ll be at home dreaming while the red flags are screaming
And hearing your streaming, scheming and all your excuses

(Yeah, yeah) You said it was an accident
(No no) You didn’t mean for it to happen

Lyrics of Two,"You may tell me that you love me but sometimes you act like you don’t
You always make it seem like you are busy when you’re just at home… all alone
Baby if something’s on your mind then let’s just clear the air
I don’t like to fight, but if we do at least I’ll know that you care

Mind games, mind games, mind games
Hot one minute and cold the other
Mind games, mind games, mind games
You say one thing but do another
Now for all your moves I’m about to call your bluff
Because I’m feeling like I’ve had enough
Of your mind games, mind games, mind games
Mind games, mind games, mind games, mind games

Why do you care so much about who calls first
Not even making the effort only makes matters worse
We’ve had some moments but they seem so long ago
Now instead of going all in, you’ve just decided to fold

I bet if I turned the tables it’ll be the last thing you’d expect
Stop returning your calls and ignore all your texts
Say I’m busy every time you want to hang out with me
Then you’ll see just how much fun that can be

Lyrics of Two,"Life, it has so many changes 
Streets, they have so many strangers 
Hearts, they have so many dangers , when in love
Mysteries of life I ponder
Here on earth with all its wonder

Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
So many memories in life to hold 
So many mysteries left to get old
So many miseries that we behold
As the mysteries in life all unfold
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh

Love, is the biggest mystery
Immune, to it we will never be
Free, for all it will always be
Time, is what we can not capture
Even if we are in a rapture

Stars in the night, with lights lit so bright
Nights full of fun, with days under the sun
Seas far and wide, with sand on their side

Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
So many memories in life to hold 
So many mysteries left to get old
So many miseries that we behold

Now it’s time for you to start the show 
The lights are bright and the crowd is loud 
Time to show the world what you’re all about

And there’s no competition when you got the game to

Close the show and take the win

You know your strength it isn’t just a line 
And the stage is where you continue to shine 
So when those who hate try to bring you down 
You’ll make your break and turn it around 
And fight for the things worth fighting for 
Like the glory of the crowd wanting more so

Shut it down shut it down

Lyrics of Two,"I’ve got years of living, scratched on my guitar 
Ran away from my life, to be a rock star
My hopes they all moved, too fast for me to catch
But on this street of stars, they have met their match
And packed in my suitcase, dreams are getting old
I’ve been up and down town, on this broken road

Under the spotlight, of the streetlights
That wait for me to shine 
Over the moonlight, it feels so right
I’m poetry in motion
It’s part of my devotion
I play with all emotion 
Under the spotlight, of the streetlights

So make a wish and throw, a dime in my hat
You’ll hear songs a new way, from this here cool cat
My heart and my music, I wear on my sleeve
I have crowds gathering, like you won’t believe
My skin’s gotten thicker, my hair may recede
My guitar and music, they’re all that I need

Running after my own dreams
Tripping over my own feet
Held on to my self esteem
Walking to my own loud beat
So stand tall or take a seat

Under the spotlight, of the streetlights
That wait for me to shine 
Over the moonlight, it feels so right
I’m poetry in motion
It’s part of my devotion
I play with all emotion 
Under the spotlight, of the streetlights",Streetlights Are Spotlights
Lyrics of Two,"Lived and learned live learned play with fire get burned
Lived and learned live and learned miss your chance miss your turn
Tried to see try to see why people always lie
Tried to see try to see what really makes you cry

That’s how, that’s how life goes
Got to roll with the blows
Having fun with my bros
With no soul that is close

Rise and fall, rise and fall, and soon you’re standing tall
Rise and fall, rise and fall, with never having crawled
Say your part, say your part with fire in your heart
Say your part, say your part with your words like a dart

That’s how, that’s how life goes
Got to roll with the blows
Having fun with my bros
With no soul that is close

Do or die, do or die have to give it a try
Do or die, do or die with never having lied
Make or break make or break so never hesitate

Lyrics of Two,"Time is always new, for dreams to come true
Destiny is yours, to do what you do 
Change is different, but only for awhile
Free will it always, brings in a whole new style
Competition makes, the fight all worth your while
That’s even after, running an extra mile

You grow up, you grow old
Life it can seems so cold 
You shine bright, in the night 
Like a star, lit so bright
It’s your story right now
Say it loud, say it proud
It’s your glory right now
So stand up, take a bow

Raining emotions, may start flooding your heart
Your ego your soul, may feel so far apart
It’s never the end, but just a brand new start
Taking the short road, isn’t always so smart
Dream up destiny, and it will come alive
Happiness will come, soon after the long strife

You grow up, you grow old
Life it can seems so cold 
You shine bright, in the night

Say it loud, say it proud
It’s your glory right now
So stand up, take a bow",Your Story
Lyrics of Two,"Who’d think our road would be so long when we started this ride together
Facing every storm by standing strong for worse or for better
Making memories with every passing day that will last us a lifetime
And even in the darkest of days your love makes me shine
Now under the summer moons sky lost in the sparkle in your eyes
So many things I want to say to you but no words would ever do 
Here in this moment

I just want to love you
Hold you in my arms and shut the world out
Don’t need any words when feelings speak so loud
I have a million ways to say how I feel for you
But sometimes words they just won’t do
I just want to love you, I just want to love you

Said good bye to my lonely days when you walked in to my life
Promise to give you all the love it takes to keep you by my side
Tender moments with you are more precious than words can say
I want to let this perfect night take us away

I just want to love you
Hold you in my arms and shut the world out
Don’t need any words when feelings speak so loud
I have a million ways to say how I feel for you
Not a single word can say what love can do
I just want to love you, I just want to love you

I just want to love you
Hold you in my arms and shut the world out
Don’t need any words when feelings speak so loud
With a million ways that I can say how i feel you
I don’t want to say a single word I just want to love you",I Just Want To Love You
Lyrics of Two,"Over the city, under the Hollywood sign
City lights are flickering, like a million fireflies 
He turns up the radio and says to me 
Remember this old melody?
Hot Cali sunshine, radiating late June
Driving up the coastline, top down, me and you
Seashells, sand angels, taking in the sunset
Baby I’m dreaming of when we first met

California loving smooth as the ocean tide
Carefree soaking up your love like sunshine
Crazy for ya feeling like a song with no rhyme
I’m falling for you like sun in the springtime
I’m so glad I found my California loving

Then we hiked up the Canyon on a warm starry night 
Spent the whole time dancing under the moon light
With the beat of the city underneath our feet 
And the feelings in our heart that still repeat
Hot Cali sunshine, radiating late June
Driving up the coastline, top down, me and you
Seashells, sand angels, taking in the sunset
Baby I’m dreaming of when we first met

California loving smooth as the ocean tide
Carefree soaking up your love like sunshine
Crazy for ya feeling like a song with no rhyme
I’m falling for you like sun in the springtime
I’m so glad I found my California loving

Nothing has changed your still by my side
Taking in the moments under Hollywood lights
Fireflies, moonlight, dancing until midnight
Baby I’m so happy you’re mine, baby I’m so happy you’re mine

Carefree soaking up your love like sunshine
Crazy for ya feeling like a song with no rhyme
I’m falling for you like sun in the springtime
I’m so glad I found my California loving",California Loving
Lyricson,"BLESS THE YOUTHS		
 
Rastafari bless the youths as long as they live
Keep them on the right track far from envy and greed
Teach them how to help each other so they could achieve
Hail up the Most High he shall bless your seeds 	
 
Jah you blessed me all my life
Provide your care for my kids and wife
Always showed me wrong from right
Set my feet on higher heights
I’ve got to give thanks all my days
‘Cause Jah you helped me ease the pain
Through these trouble times I face
Jah you wash my tears away
 
CHORUS (Bis)

Never surrender, never retreat
Even when the road gets steep
Always keep your goals in sight and some day you shall achieve
Though some try to keep you down through they don’t want to see you reach
Remember Jah is by your side so you shall never get defeat
The system keeps pressuring the poor man and the meek 
So much hungry belly pickneys, so much homeless in the streets
Though we try our best it’s so hard to make ends meet
Still we got to stand strong can’t afford to be weak
(Bridge)
I know that things and time shall change
So never lose confidence within yourself

CHORUS (Bis)

Why dutty Babylon want see the ghetto youths stalling
Nothing could stop the ghetto youths from rising
They try to hold us down make us turn to crime and violence 
But we’re not going to stray because the Most High give us guidance
I tell the ghetto youths to live up right
Stop with the war all of the fuss and fight
Cause this a time when we all should unite and give Babylon a surprise
(Bridge)
 
CHORUS (Bis)",Bless the Youths
Lyricson,"LOVE IS THE ANSWER		
 
Well no matter you troubles, keep a smile on your face Yes
And as you rise up give the Most High the praise Yes
King Rastafari burns the follies and craze Yes
Well love and righteousness we all should embrace yes
Well honor your mother honor your father Jah’ll give you length of days
Honor your brother, honor your sister and you’ll never stray
And give thanks and praise to the Most High Jah for the things he create
Only the clean and righteous heart could pass Zion gate
 
Love is the answer. Love is the way.
Love makes us stronger so show love I say.
Love is the answer. Love is the way.
Love makes us stronger so show love always.
 
We say we’re tired of the bloodshed and crime everywhere.
 All this violence and crime is really getting nowhere.
 Why the leaders spend so much over bombs and nuclear
 The people want some peace of mind tired of living in fear.
Love it’s what it’s all about keep it in your heart, never let it part. 
Love keeps you solid as a rock, shinning through the dark
Spread it all about.
Love is worth much more than silver and gold
Keep it in your heart and your soul.
 
Love is the answer. Love is the way.
Love makes us stronger so show love I say.
Love is the answer. Love is the way.
Love makes us stronger so show love always.

Love is what we want so throw down your arms and bombs (Bis)

Love makes us stronger so show love I say.
Love is the answer. Love is the way.
Love makes us stronger so show love always.",Love is the Answer
Lyricson,"PROVIDER AND GUIDE		

Oh Jah you lift me up whenever I fall
Hear my prayer whenever I call 
I’ll forever give praises to your name
And in my times of need you are always there
Filling my heart with your love and care
This love I have for Jah will never change
Rastafari give I strength to overcome the heathen and the wicked men plan 
Eternal praises I will give for the joy he brings Jah love shall never ends 
Father thank you for the days that you made my grey turn blue 
Took away the stress and pain how could I ever be untrue

Jah’s my Provider and Guide
Give thanks for showing me wrong from right
And clearing out the dangers in my life
Keeping me safe from war and strife (Bis)

I’ve been through so many ups and downs still you set my feet on a solid ground
And when I was lost you helped me overcome removed my troubles and my frowns 
I’ll forever be grateful for all the blessings in my life 
I’ll forever be thankful for Jah you’re always on my side 
Showing me wrong from right 
Keeping my path so bright 
How could I ever deny the powers of the Most High

Jah’s my Provider and Guide
Give thanks for showing me wrong from right
And clearing out the dangers in my life
Keeping me safe from war and strife (Bis)

And we don’t care what they do or say
Hail the Most High whether night or day
King Rastafari leads my way I know I’ll never go astray

Jah’s my Provider and Guide
Give thanks for showing me wrong from right
And clearing out the dangers in my life
Keeping me safe from war and strife (Bis)",Provider & Guide
Lyricson,"RISE		

We shall rise no matter the traps set along the way I know we’ll meet a brighter day
We shall rise step towards your goals don’t you be afraid
I know that Jah will lead your way

Sometimes you feel like hope is gone and there is nowhere to turn
Life is no bed a rose a lesson you must learn
But don’t you ever give up you should always stand firm
‘Cause in the end I know that the tables will turn

We shall rise no matter the traps set along the way I know we’ll meet a brighter day
We shall rise step towards your goals don’t you be afraid
I know that Jah will lead your way

Some will try to push your back against the wall
But put your trust in Jah he will make you stand tall
Some will try their best just to get you down
But the Father above set your feet on a higher ground

We shall rise no matter the traps set along the way I know we’ll meet a brighter day
We shall rise step towards your goals don’t you be afraid
I know that Jah will lead your way

Stop with the crime and the violence
Say we’re tired of all this nonsense
Time for us to elevate our conscience
And to spread some love all over this land

We shall rise no matter the traps set along the way I know we’ll meet a brighter day
We shall rise step towards your goals don’t you be afraid
I know that Jah will lead your way",Rise
Lyricson,"CHORUS :
Upright, upright stop with all the fuss and fight
Upright, upright … Upright upright
This is a time for us to all unite
That’s the way we shall survive.

Because all we have is one life to live
So make sure to always live positive
Cause all the wrong you do will surely come back at you
I say you’ve got to be faithful and true.

CHORUS

Do on to others as you would have them do on to you
Respect is the key if you want to get through
Never grudge your brother man for what he’s got
Clean up your mind and clean up your heart

CHORUS

Remember the meek shall inherit the earth
Don’t cherish luxury got to know what life’s really worth
Respect and honor you should always put first
Spread love around love will make you stand firm

CHORUS",Upright
Lyricson,"WISE UP		

Ghetto youths, wise up and uplift yourself
Time for us to live upright and stop kill ourselves
Ghetto youths, wise up and uplift yourself 
Don t stoop low for material wealth
Ghetto youths, wise up and uplift yourself
I say good over evil life over death
Ghetto youths, wise and uplift yourself
In this time I say to stop fight yourself

Because we’ve got so much works to do and so much seeds to plant
Only way to achieve it is to do it hand in hand
See the ghetto people them they have been suffering for too long
They say they’re tired of the pressure they want better days to come
It’s not easy to bare the life down in the slum
When you don’t even know when your next meal is going to come
When gunshots echo in the air like drums
Bills and Taxes increase and you have no income
Still you got to keep the faith yes you got to hold on
Never worry yourself just keep the faith and be strong
The love of Rastafari guides and keeps you all along
Jah protect us through the cold and through the storm

CHORUS

I’m done telling the ghetto youths that unity is strength
So let’s come together burn the crime and violence
Elevate your mind free up your conscience
Give thanks to Rastafari for his care and guidance
And never let the system come treat you like a fool
They will use and abuse you then will kick you like mule
And never let no one take you for no footstool
Just live your life clean and follow the golden rule
The Most High keep me safe from those who try to get me down
And he set my feet upon a solid ground
Jah Jah, keep me safe from those vipers around
That’s why I give thanks and praises to the Man who wears the Crown

CHORUS

Because we’ve got so much works to do and so much seeds to plant
Only way to achieve it is to do it hand in hand
See the ghetto people them they have been suffering for too long
They say they’re tired of the pressure they want better days to come
It’s not easy to bare the life down in the slum
When you don’t even know when your next meal is going to come
When gunshots echo in the air like drums

Still you got to keep the faith yes you got to hold on
Never worry yourself just keep the faith and be strong

Lys Gauty,"DIS-MOI POURQUOI

Les gens autour de moi sont gais
Le soleil brille, on chante partout
Et pourtant j’ai envie de pleurer
De partir, sans savoir où

Dis-moi pourquoi les plus beaux jours
Sans toi sont tristes
Pourquoi sans toi mon cœur n’a plus aucune joie
Dis moi pourquoi tout devient noir, plus rien n’existe
Pourquoi sans toi la vie n’a plus d’attrait pour moi !
Aucun sourire, aucun ami
Aucun espoir de bonheur 
Quand tu me quittes j’ai peur
Tout me chagrine et tout m’ennuie…
Dis-moi pourquoi les plus beaux jours sans toi sont tristes
Pourquoi sans toi la vie n’a plus d’attrait pour moi !

Il faut que j’entende ta voix
Que je sente ton bras près du mien
Car sinon mon beau rêve s’en va
Et plus rien ne me retient.

Dis-moi pourquoi les plus beaux jours
Sans toi sont tristes
Pourquoi sans toi mon cœur n’a plus aucune joie
Dis moi pourquoi tout devient noir, plus rien n’existe
Pourquoi sans toi la vie n’a plus d’attrait pour moi !
Aucun sourire, aucun ami

Lytle & Flourno,"I don't feel the suns comin' out today
Its staying in, its gonna find another way.
As I sit here in this misery, I don't
Think I'll ever see the sun from here.

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and say, and they'll say,
Hey look at him! I'll never live that way.
But that's okay
They're just afraid to change.

When you feel your life ain't worth living 
You've got to stand up and
Take a look around you then a look way up to the sky.
And when your deepest thoughts are broken, 
Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.

And as we all play parts of tomorrow,
Some ways will work and other ways we'll play.
But I know we all can't stay here forever, 
So I want to write my words on the face of today.
And then they'll paint it

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and they'll say, 
Hey look at him and where he is these days.
When life is hard, you have to change.",Changes
Lytle & Flourno,"Dear, it seems years since we parted,
Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.
 
It's strange how life deals you sorrow,
Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,

Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him, she love him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)

He bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

M,"Just a small town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life in the real time world
No one sees her at all they all say she's crazy

Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She had danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac at the show, and she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice blue line of insanity is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery, touch it but can't hold it
You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by it's a push shove world
But there's always a chance if the hunger stays the night

And she's dancing like she's never danced before

We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour and they want to tell you a little story
about where they come from

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

You love to hear the story again and again 
of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom
A brother whose known for his rap
Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
These brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door
Get frisked
Just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town
Then you couldn't fight and win
But everytime they had a jam
They couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there
And the parks they had to cease cause you was in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Why don't you wise up
Show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit you're ass had better run
Cause you're in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Dimples be the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was sucker dj's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me 
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn 
Out
By any place any part of the world
And while i'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
When she's in

The Bridge(scratched) (8X)
Queensbridge

Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you're made
Don't ever listen to what ? say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
Their trying to live your destiny
By the time you think about it your grown
And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pullin ya back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause their not wit it
You're talking about school
Their talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time just fly
Cause you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal cause i'm reaching for mine
And i'm from

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)

Keep on rockin 
The bridge
Will keep rockin
If the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep rockin
If the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
Till the beat stop rockin

Till the bridge stop rockin
The kids will keep-a rockin
When the bridge stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
If the kids stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
Till the beat stop rockin

I won't laugh about you anymore.

We will walk hand in hand
I`ll go to South Africa and be called woman

Used to be a time when a rhyme couldn't fly if it wasn't fly
Now, you gotta pray a man doesn't die
A dis record is a dangerous thing
Nowadays, not to say your instincts ain't to trust but fame
It ain't to be gotten dick ridin
That's basically what you be on
When you spend breath to scorn
Let the wack dudes be the wack dudes
Cuz the wack dudes can't touch dudes with the real aptitude
Rhyme victory raps that patience is the author of
The wack dudes burn fast like sparklers
So they be out your way in no time
And you be still gettin dap while them suckers see no shine
It's for the best with no blood on your hands
Hence, the hands-free hurt you virtue

Well, the cars are like water and the road is like a stream
Rolling down through the city, flowing out into the sea
Going nowhere like me, going nowhere like me

All tangled up in dandelion hair and polka dots
And a picture book mind full of dreams and designs
And visions of faraway places

Yeah, she drew underwater worlds and cities in the stars
In the Asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars
In felt tips and crayons her little works of art
All promised a future of greatness

She caught the sunlight in her eye
Underneath the winter sky
""I'll paint the world until I die"", she said
""One day I'll spread my wings and fly high like a snowbird""

Yes, I will

Her daddy died when she was only ten
But all she cried came out in ink and in pen
She drew charcoal streets leading down to dead ends
Where heads hung low in sorrow

But she was left a small fortune at the reading of the will
About enough for a life and then another life still
And with her mother in a haze of vodka and pills
Snowbird had just dreamed of tomorrow

She caught the sunlight in her eye
Underneath the winter sky
""I'll paint the world until I die"", she said
""One day I'll spread my wings and fly high like a snowbird""

Yes, I will
That's right

Years went by and she hit eighteen
And left home for the art-school scene
To paint the people of the shadows and the faces unseen
For her hero was now Egon Schiele

But she did a couple of little canvases and bad super 8
And a conceptual piece that was thirty years too late
It was all she could fit between the dinner and the dates
With dreamers and drummers and dealers

She caught the sunlight in her eye
Underneath the winter sky
""I'll paint the world until I die"", and she said
""One day I'll spread my wings and fly high like a snowbird""

Yes, I will

Well, who's that girl in the little black dress?
Her head held high like a real princess
A glimmering, shimmering, coked up mess
A fashion trash, art school failure

Yeah, her fingernails are all there's left to paint in her world
She dishes out the dirt with the party powder girls
Who think love comes in diamonds and wisdom in pearls
And art is just paraphernalia

She's lost the sunlight from her eye
There's only a mirror ball left in her sky
""I'll do what I want till the day that I die

Enchanté moi c'est M.P Ma mission le R&B          

Rapide comme l'éclair je fuse et j'évite tous les gens haineux 
Rapide ça c'est claire tout juste 20 piges et j'en ai plein les yeux 
Dans ma team y'a qu'des jokers les as sont rentrés chez eux 
On veut tous marquer les esprits J'viens faire marquer le R&B             

Refrain : 
De retour attention au boum 
J'viens faire jumper la foule 
Frappe fort dans toutes les soirées 
C'est ma voix tu la connais 
J'ai amené le son qui goum 
Celui qui fait jumper la foule 
J'veux voir toutes les mains levées 
Quand je chante dalap dalap da                

Ils ont l'air abasourdis 
On m'regarde comme E.T 
Fallait pas m'sous estimer 
J'sui spas là pour figurer 
Ca danse au rythme de ma voix 
J'fais même bouger les mamas 
Mademoiselle veut l'autographe 
Ces messieurs veulent ma place                   

Rapide comme l'éclair je fuse et j'évite tous les gens haineux 
Rapide ça c'est claire tout juste 20 piges et j'en ai plein les yeux 
Dans ma team y'a qu'des jokers les as sont rentrés chez eux

Tyron : Et retiens mon name my man Tyron dégaine 
Phénomène que t'aime et cogne le game 
Nouveau rap, tape, décape vient claquer les bacs bacs 
Et matte les booty claps et claps pour le come back 
Fat comme biggie je bouzille le bizz 
Reste black comme diddy et je me fous de c'qu'ils disent             

Hein mais qui a dit qu'M.P était dye un album et puis bye bye 
Bouncer les bads guy et n'écoute pas si t'es pas de taille

Brûlant la chaleur
En fusion
Sous ta peau (yeah)

Tu sais que je t'ai cherchée
Au crépuscule sur cette plage dorée
Tu es désirée de tous
Sur cette île moi seul peut te combler
Everybody jump up come on

Elle me contrôle et rythme mes pas
Si elle me frôle
Oh non je ne réponds réponds réponds plus de moi

Sur la dance hall, écoute ma voix
Si tu me frôles
Alors je ne réponds réponds réponds plus de moi

L'un sur l'autre
Cherchant la fraîcheur
A l'ombre du ghetto

Tu sais que tout a changé... baby
Ton corps en nage trouble les alizés
Le désir aux alentours
Sur cette île tout l'monde est envoûté
Everybody jump up come on

Elle me contrôle et rythme mes pas
Si elle me frôle
Oh non je ne réponds réponds réponds plus de moi

Sur la dance hall écoute ma voix
Si tu me frôles
Alors je ne réponds réponds réponds plus de moi

...Elle en rend plus d'un dingue
J'sais que pour elle beaucoup iraient claquer d'la maille
Faut qu't'y ailles avant qu'elle parte, baby boy...
Bien qu'on sait qu'tu la connais qu't'as ses failles
Fais l'travail je sais que t'es fort, t'es de taille et
Prépare-toi mentalement pour les retrouvailles
Dis bye bye au stress... allez viens on s'flexe
Sous le soleil on fêtera vos fiançailles.

M. Pokora,"Je me rappelle le jour
Où je t'ai vu mon amour
Au détour d'une ruelle
Qui aurait pu imaginer
Que le destin
Fougueux comme je l'étais
Aurait pu nous rapprocher

Tu m'es apparue si belle
À mes yeux comme une étincelle
Qui me donne un nouvel avenir
Tant de plaisir
Je t'aime au-delà de toutes mes limites

Tu es ma n°1 baby
Je te suis jusqu'au bout
Amant ou bien ami
Tu seras la seule, je l'avoue

Je me vois
Marchant sur nos plaines
Pas sans toi
Je te voudrais mienne
Crois en moi
Et que ces mots soient gravés dans de la pierre
Oh promets-moi
Je me vois
Comme dans un poème
Pas sans toi
Vivre dans la bohème
Crois en moi
Et que ces mots soient gravés dans de la pierre
Oh promets-moi

Je ne dirai plus les mots
Qui touchaient avant
J'en ai bien dit trop
J'ai fait du mal et perdu trop de temps
Aujourd'hui, j'ai tant de regrets
Tromper celles qui m'aimaient
Blessées de mots cruels
Ignorer leurs ""stop""
Pour tout le mal que j'ai bien pu te faire
Je demande pardon
Crois moi que j'en ai souffert autrefois

Tu es ma n°1 baby
Je te suis jusqu'au bout
Amant ou bien ami
Tu seras la seule, je l'avoue

Donne-moi une dernière

Je finirai ce que j'ai commencé et je baisserai pas les bras

M. Pokora,"On se retourne vers dieu quand sa tourne mal
Quand le ciel s'écroule sur nos petites étoiles
On se sent si seul quand le train déraille
De la pluie dans mes yeux quand l'espoir détale
Quand je voie maman perdre ses pédales
On s'en remet à dieu sur son lit d'hôpital
Je perds l'équilibre sur mon triste manège
Sous le soleil d'été je voie tomber la neige
On ne se moque plus de dieu quand les pelles nous assiège

Il y a des jours comme ça où rien ne va
Enfermé dans ton mal-être
Quand les anges pleurent au bord de ta fenêtre
Il y a des jours comme ça où rien ne va
A se torturer la tête
Si l'espoir meurt, pourra-t-il renaître?
Regarde-moi brûler, quand s'éteint la lumière
Écoute-moi crier aux portes de l'enfer
Regarde-moi tomber sans plus personne derrière
Redevenir poussière

On s'en remet à dieu quand la roue a tourné
Les amies t'oublient comme une chanson d'été
L'amour lui aussi s'endort sur ses regrets
On se retourne vers dieu quand on descend l'échelle
Car l'argent c'est bien mais ce n'est pas éternel
On ne fera pas long feu si on ne vole qu'avec une aile

Il y a des jours comme ça où rien ne va
Enfermé dans ton mal-être
Quand les anges pleurent au bord de ta fenêtre
Il y a des jours comme ça où rien ne va
A se torturer la tête
Si l'espoir meurt, pourra-t-il renaître?
Regarde-moi brûler, quand s'éteint la lumière
Écoute-moi crier aux portes de l'enfer
Regarde-moi tomber sans plus personne derrière

C'est la lumière ou le noir
L'amour ou la gloire
La défaite, la victoire
Soit tu gagne soit tu foire

Et si je te demandais sur une vie quels sont tes dispos

Je rêvais d'une maison je l'ai trouvé dans tes bras,
Ce qui reste des saisons, je veux le passer avec toi.

(My boo) Juste un je t'aime et pour toi j'gravirai l'Everest

Accroche-toi, me lâche pas et si je tombe relève-moi
Je veux t'aimer, grandir et avancer avec toi

M. Pokora,"J’ai soutenu t’avoir aimé comme bon te semble
J’ai combattu chaque minute de ton silence
La distance menace le temps qui courre devant nous
Si tu tiens tes promesses, c’est pour mieux faire demi-tour

Si l’on mettait nos vies entre parenthèses
Avant que l’on oublie de s’aimer comme on l’espère
Si je mettais ma vie entre parenthèses
Si l’on vit nos défis, seras-tu toujours la même

J’ai toujours voulu nous voir avancer à contre sens
On avait que le revers de l’indifférence
Des dizaines de cœurs solitaires aux alentours

Mais la peur nous pousse encore à faire un détour

Si l’on mettait nos vies entre parenthèses
Avant que l’on oublie de s’aimer comme on l’espère
Si je mettais ma vie entre parenthèses
Si l’on vit nos défis, seras-tu toujours la même

Le cœur a ses envies la raison nous achève
J’ai revu cette faille sous ton cœur de pierre

Si l’on mettait nos vies entre parenthèses
Avant que l’on oublie de s’aimer comme on l’espère
Si je mettais ma vie entre parenthèses
Si l’on vit nos défis, seras-tu toujours la même",Entre parenthèses

M. Pokora,"Maman chante en solo
Maman danse la valse toute seule
Ses rêves d'enfant à l'eau
Personne ne rêve d'être seule
Elle a l'amour en prison
Elle n'a pas le temps pour le printemps
Garde son bonheur en détention
Mes sourires font les siens en attendant
Papa si tu savais
Comme elle manque de souffle
Allô le monde si vous saviez, si vous saviez

Petit à petit, Maman fait son nid
Papa est parti se refaire une vie pas trop loin d'ici
Petit à petit, Maman te l'a dit
Tu feras ta vie, tu feras mieux que lui

Papa danse le tango le dos cassé
Et la foule vient de monter le niveau
Souffrir oui, mais un peu de dignité
Il a le cœur en prison
Il n'a pas le temps pour le printemps

Autant acheter du rêve aux enfants

Maman chante en solo, Papa chante en solo
Et moi je leur fais les chœurs un week-end sur deux
J'ai changé de rythme, de vie, de tempo
J'ai cherché mes pas entre sa valse et son tango
On est passé du printemps aux intempéries
J'ai essayé de comprendre, on m'a dit : ""c'est la vie""
Du mal à l'accepter donc je passe toutes mes nuits
A jouer au puzzle avec les photos de famille
J'ai le sourire en détention
Il n'y a que leur réconciliation pour payer la caution
Leur problème d'adulte, j'te jure, est une sale infection
Une épidémie que connaît ma cours de récréation
Ne me demande pas de choisir
Je les aime d'un amour indivisible
Qu'ils se fassent la guerre ou pas
Je sais que ces deux soldats ont mon bonheur pour cible

Comme je manque de souffle
Allô le monde si vous saviez si vous saviez
Maman si tu savais
De son manque, je souffre

Semblant de se suivre.

And the moon'll hide its light

Sing the saddest kind o' song

From Memphis to St. Joe,

An' heard me some big talk,

Afraid to do the things
That I knew I had to do

I said it once, and I ain't gonna say it twice

So come on preach

You was warned before you came
So I ain't to blame for your ass being torn out the frame
I get nuts off whenever beef occur
All I'm askin ya, is, are you ready for the massacre?
If you want it, then you can get it, homes
What you fail to realize, is, Danzenie is not alone
Come with your boys and roll with force
No need for your vest, cause I ain't in it for your chestboard
Tell my peoples that's real: Get your steel
Nigga slipped up, so grip up and meet me on the hill
Lil' Fame (Whatever) Ruff is with it
Shaq, call for Bang and tell him to bring the thang-thang
Danzenie will never have it, that's why I keep my automatic
In case I run into some static
Search all night, lookin for the gun fight
Troopin from dust to dawn, ready to get it on
Creep through the town, checkin out the scene
Index finger on the trigger of my serve machine
So don't ever harass me, or put nothin past me
Cause you'll be the next when I blast, gee

To set it off and let the dogs loose
Put up your shit and we can rumble
But if I'm in double trouble
Then I'ma bust a nigga like a bubble
See, the niggas that I roll with, they don't run

I'm willin to die for my respect
If I have to I will let
So I walk with a fifth and I pray to a fuckin tec
In '93 I calmed down
But now these so-called gangsta-ass niggas got gased
Herbs are not ready, derelicts are petty
Nigga, I be your worst nightmare like I was Freddy
Niggas be actin sweet, claimin they packin heat
Get a rugged peek and wanna talk about the street
You niggas ain't livin trife
And rappers that's claimin that they underground
I put they ass under ground for life
Wait, I'mma set that ass straight
Herbs only perpetrate
But look, my burner don't discriminate
All race, creed, shape, breed
Anytime's fine with me
You fuckin f.a.g

(Front, I make it a thrill to kill)
(Straight up and down, act like you want a confrontation)

Here it is for you niggas that chastise the game
It's M.O.P., nigga, recognize the name
I'm beatin down punks and breakin down chumps
When he stroll I hit him with the old brown pump
Because we're goin all out, word to Miz
You niggas gotta get it like Jason got his
Nigga, your whole shit'll be rearranged
Because I'mma give em a buck fifty and let em keep the change
Another nigga smoked, oh Lord
Because he just finished watchin 'Menace', he musta thougth he was O-Dog
Ass out for the last nigga that wanted drama
Because I smoked him with the 9mm lama
You fake thugs ain't bustin slugs, please
A muthafucka like you deserve 12 to your mug piece
So all you niggas start makin tracks
Because there's too many phoney baloney muthafuckas fakin jacks
I go to work for my joint, muthafucka, you know me
It's the one and only, and M.O.P
Gunsmoke when I defeat a man
Because I smoke muthafuckaas like the 9mm man

Plow! You bitch-ass nigga, you better walk
Only with my muthafuckin burner will I talk
See, I'm from the Marks, and that makes me a marksman
Wanna know tonight? My fifth be talkin
Fake gangstas drive by and try to hit me with a clip full
What kinda shit is he tryin to pull?
All you bitch-ass niggas got to be jacked
Tryin to get wreck, squeezin out nothin when bustin your tec
I'm Billy Danz, overseer of the underground
Hillfigure, yo, bitch nigga, I get down
What I be on is the untold truth of a livin hell
So one of you bitch niggas is comin up out of his shell
M.O.P. goin out till the end
This is how we separate the boys from the men
Real niggas that's ill niggas that kill niggas
The beaver that sneak with his finger on the trigger
Fake gangstas got mad war stories to tell
About how many muthafuckas they blew up in jail
They said their camp was mad deep and they had crazy pull
That little bitch, but now he snitched like Sammy the Bull",F.A.G. (Fake Ass Gangsta)

Little shorties thirteen years old, tryin' to leave a nigga cold

Foes'll hear the words from the reverend
And caught hell fuckin' with fame
So now they ass gotta go to heaven
I fear no man and I ain't Omar Epps

But I'm lettin' motherfuckers know the program
Too many motherfuckers died on the street
That's why I tell motherfuckers to back up and play me feet
Just the other day I put my man in the ground, so now
I walk around with the motherfuckin' trey pound
Just for my enemies so I can blow they chest in

'Cause Smith and Wesson's will have your whole family stressin'
Another basket, casket closin'
They put away the guns, then here come the motherfuckin' Roses
Tags are promptly placed on your toes
You're just another nigga dead, gotta go, gotta go
The game is called survival when you play it to the end
Before you go out in a blaze, may the best man win

Dese are the niggaz that I'm movin' with G
To you snake ass, two faced ass niggaz
You gon' make me grip and squeeze my shit
Lifestyles of a ghetto child

Gun over rose, choose your weapon or pick your pose
One or the other nigga, no doubt
You know the way the motherfuckin' story turns out
Only your life or you're chancin'

Me, I got a record like my man Charles Manson
Bill puttin' niggaz on chill, you know the deal
Quicker than a motherfuckin' hit man will
(Another motherfuckin' Cadillac)

Yeah, another motherfucker's family dressed in black
Whatever must be must be
Me I try to keep my shit a little low key
See, 'cause you don't know how it feels

Everytime a nigga get killed they try to link that shit to Bill
Mostly because I never of
(Kid they tryin' to herb ya)
I ain't doin' time for no fuckin' murder

Mad brothers done died on the street
I know it's crazy motherfuckers that barely sleep
The color red from a hot hollow piece of lead
Salute the world and then nod your head

Cross examination, first thing jumped up and broke no joke 

Stepped over the judges crown 

Stepped on the D.A.s ground 

Looked at the snitch with a frown 

Went to the jury and got down 

Seventy-two hours later Creeping on some playing no more shit 

Toting the same glock Mr. Gonzalez got knocked off wit 

As I...

Brownsville's the place where crews seem the livest
Cops get knocked down, body counts only risin'
Them streets look full to ya, villains look poor to ya
Them niggas'll slaughter ya

For your goose Nautica, you got jewels?
Stash 'em, son, 'cause there's a thousand niggas broke
And we all got guns
And you know what that means

Niggas be open like they smokin' caffeine
Lookin' to do a quick stick, move and swift
With your [Incomprehensible] on your hip, ready to flip
Whenever you empty your grip, dip

And get the fuck up out of Dodge
That's if you know, what's up, kid?
Niggas is gettin' Mandela time
Plus the crackers is corrupted

But then you got them clockers down at 73rd
That was drug associated since the 70's, word
It's kinda skeptic
Livin' these crazy ways unprotected

Every day is a jam
So expect the unexpected, crime time
1-718, Brownsville, Brooklyn
The housin' property be gettin' token

So we're intended
Be under pressure, gettin' blackmailed
Villains usin' their dealings
Makin' killings of crack sales

The theme song of murder, nobody's kiddin'
These fools are forbidden, automatics just be spittin'
And devastatin' and profound, you get lumped up
Soon as you jump up or get gunned down in Brownsville

Brownsville, Brownsville
Brownsville, Brownsville
Brownsville, Brownsville
Brownsville, Brownsville

Young punks got guns, now that's a damn shame
Everybody claim they represent and do they thing
[Incomprehensible] totin' in cases, hard to believe
The firin' squad'll throw your whole borough under siege

Beyond twin chrome and farmers
Nigga, it's Billy Danze
And when I'm double clutchin' my hands
Them fuckers won't jam

So my man, if your seekin' an advance to your grave
It's the land of the 'Drama Lord'
And the home of the fuckin' brave
It's hard to trust us 'cause it's mad ruckus

We toe tax with mufflers for small time hustlers
It's blue steel concealed under my sweater
To calm down whoever, Duke, I move clever
I must keep it steppin' hops when shit be gettin' hot

I step and bop while I stroll with my weapon cocked
The hill that's real, we kill at will
Clack-clack, clack-clack, clack-clack
Mad guns in your grill in the 'Ville

Brownsville, Brownsville
Brownsville, Brownsville
Brownsville, Brownsville
Brownsville, Brownsville

Brownsville, yeah, killings here only bring retaliation
No cryin', see dying's an everyday thing, swing
25 niggas down by my battlegrounds
I'll move in with 8 thugs that love bustin' rounds

You know the deal
In my streets your heater be ready to blaze
Keep cash in your stash in case you gotta be Swayze
For twistin' a nigga cap back

That's that work of M.O.P., who we be? Firing squad of 11233
Clack-clack, whole clips in your back
That's thug style, turnin' a small section of Brooklyn
Into the O.K. Corral

Now, news flash, razorfied lead, one grazed Ted
Two paralyzed, three dead
Gunmen fled the scenery
With heavy automatic machinery

Niggas ain't got nothing to lose
And yo it seems to be I'll nigga
Kill or be killed in the 'Ville, nigga
All up and down Mother Gaston, they blastin' steel

Blow your stacks and chips in A.C.'s with rims
We be livin' good with a Mac and black Tims
Keep this in mind and they might not find you in the river
With the next guy that fly shit that Brownsville deliver, nigga

Now, guess who's, back in the place, ""kid I missed M.O.P""
Hey I'm sorry you had to wait, G.
In '93 you barely heard us in the crowd.
So we eject from select, and now our shit is bumpin' loud.
Firing Squad, back on the case.
To school ya, turnin' more boys to men than the great Luke Dubra.

Yes, some say my rap's about to crack the afterburn.
From out the first, send the whole entire earth into a blackout.
Here's the facts about my M.O.P. click.
We get down, roll in deep waters, we drown niggas, leave 'em sensin'.
Yo let it be known, we own the walks.
Up on the hill we own the thrones, we own the parks.
For real, we own the loan sharks.
Niggas practice what they preach, and back with what they reach wit'.
The ill part is on the mic, I be kickin' the freak shit.
Set it, violators get beheaded, rumors we dead it.
Amazing how we plays, close the show, and roll the credits.
It's over, straight from Saratoga, said these niggas better recognize.
We exercise, our lyric, something deadly.

(Take it to the streets) Watch niggas collapse.
Perhaps, we could bust raps or bust caps.
This is, ghetto how we in it, and if it's beef.
You tell me and Billy, will go to war like it's Valiance.
Once I catch ya, I'm guaranteed I got ya.
Duke, I bet ya, you leave this piece on a stretcher.
Ain't nothing to kid about.
I put one in your wig and bounce.
Leave the rest for the all time see to figure out.
Now, who's that nigga that's tryin' to take my spot?
New jacks in rap must pay dues before they rock.
Yo, I run shit like Mr. Hoppa, because I pop up.
And I rip raps like crackheads strip copper.
Partner, it's bug, fake thugs gon' get no love.
You could easily get got by hot sinking slugs.
Nigga what, I take your pride and slide,
And turn you rap cipher, into a motherfucking homicide.

Young bitches with attitudes pushing baby strollers

Deceased or in jail for splittin' niggas cabbages

The characters that's left still the same fellas
They still slingin' heavy metal, ain't nothing but the ghetto
But it's like that, ain't that right, black?
When my enemies strike, it's only right that I strike back

Here in Crooklyn, it's trife
Criminals out to take everything from your jewels to your life
One way to survive on these streets, you choose it
Rip up, load your clip up, slip up and you lose it

Cops roll up on you, son, got bodies on your gun
Caught up in some shit that your mom's always warned you from
See she won't understand that it's in the environment
That's why these trigga happy niggas keep firing

I ain't just fall into no grave
If I gotta get bodied, it gotta be goin' out in a blaze
I'm fazed, whether it's him or me goin' down

Yo, c'mon nigga, wake up, c'mon

It took me twenty-four years to figure out
What makes this world go round
It?s not man holding ground with dope sound
We gots to ask

Why do you feel that a meal can make you ill
When you know that broke bill can still
See right through your plastic ass
Before crack was a sport and we had thoughts of getting busy

Before death left and fame had his way
The town Brownsville, the place, the ill
Follow the trail of fresh blood drips
You'll end up on my bricks

The marks, home of the warrior thrown home
Our true thugs that's dead and gone
In the hills most effective chrome
Return to these graves

Showin' youngsters what I'm facin'
'Cause we had trouble
We been strugglin' since single shot gauges
That's straight ghetto bad luck

But, I done passed up more shit
Than you may ever touch
What, we on sacred grounds
Without the guidance of our fathers

All we know is how to double clutch revolvers
Me and my own staff flaunt a different path
I'm tryin' to dip shit minus in your highness

Go head nigga
A whole lot changed since my brother left
(I can feel you, baby)
And since my mother?s death
(I can feel you, baby)

But as time past, I could see my life flash
Leavin' the body and there's no breath
(I can feel ya)
I chose not to let my Biretta swing

'Cause I'm a veteran
And I'm livin' for the better things
It?s cold-hearted be
Check the majority of blacks
They slingin' crack, livin' in poverty

What you gotta do is live what your life give
And make the best of it

'Cause you could easily fall victim to these streets
And death?s most definite

The mothers that cried
The brothers that tried
All we do is

I've always been afraid to die
(So when worst come to worst)
I'll back my shit out first
I'll feel better in an Elderado, than in a hearse

When it's time to roll you know where them thugs at
(First Family)
You know where my love's at
Give up to my peers who survived through the Blood
Sweat and Tears, here to a hundred years

We won't change or switch or aim or pitch
We dedicated to dominating the same shit
Holla-holler, I know what I may have to do
(You know my motto)
Walk past and slash your crew

If I'm after you, it's on
Keep your head up 'cause I won't let up till your ass is gone
(Come on)
So now you remember me
It's the hell-raising, gun-blazing, BD

We happen to be them, live niggaz
(Don't try)
Niggaz, do or die niggaz
Fizzy Womack, y'all true hillfigga
One that'll put the drop on ya quicker, nigga

Can I hear silence? For the peops that's deceased
Rest in peace, ya', still with me
(Ya')
And I still keep old feel with me
I'm dedicated to the game

Whether it's the streets or this rap thing
I'm gon' maintain a Brooklyn 'Fugitive'
I'm the judge, jury and the executioner
(What? What?)

I'm used to the automatic machines
(The heavy calibre)
And the bloody crime scenes
You know my name, I've been trained to flip
From the environment where they be firing whole clips

So tell your man stop flinchin'
Stand at attention and prepare for the lynchin'
(Firing Squad)
With the same tale
(The last of the best)
And we saved the best for last

Verse one: Lil' Fame

What the rawdog feelin?
An author like, Terry McMillan
The cat that, maniac
My fam dark as death in less than a minute
(The world stop spinnin)
The Rapid FIRING SQUAD
Keep on mix fire and (hard to kill)
Loud wires and bombs, firing arms
Look, we all for it
Its the dutch burning herbalice
Gallon drinkin alcoholics
Walk through your toughest pack of goons with my chain out
Kept it real ever since the first jam came out
FIRST FAMILY turned this whole rap game out
Sheisty individuals, tryin to wipe my name out
But they don't fuck around cause they know I back that thing out
And try to mark em off when the gun shots ring out
And in the myst of black, kid I'mma try to wipe they name out
And keep on dubbin till I break a fucking spring out

Chorus

Verse two: Billy Danze

You motherfuckas better raise up (they already did)
WHO THAT? The '87 stick up kids (we're back!)
I'm hopin that your focused on the side
Cause frontin on me and my, mad niggas die
Is this hiphop? Hell no, this is war
I've been trying to tell you that since ? rocked some hardcore
You don't listen. See, gee
I'm on a mission. Look, be
They gonna find your ass missing
Ever since me and Fame came, we maintained
A strange, but a strong game
(That can't change!)
The real ghetto bad shit for blastin, subtractin
Those that ain't matchin my fashion I'm mashin
(Retality's real) Fatality's ill
When your stash in my path then your stash is a raw deal
(Clap, clap) Get your gat
(Buckabuckabubububububububuckabucka) blow, blow, get the fuck back

Chorus

Verse Three:

Lil' Fame: FACE MINE Cause I'm here
Dog its' all clear
Rap jewels put it on my baseline from a snare
Then the wanna doubt The Kid
Who analyze this whole fucking shit?
Trying to make somethin out of it
Explode quicker than landmines
M.O.P. tapes make earthquakes and cause landslides
Bump this in your Lex coupe
Or your Lex hoop
Danze, finish em, twenty-one gun salute

Billy Danze: How many niggas runnin with me? *pause* (this few)
A hundred niggas gunnin with me *pause* (to shoot)
Firing Squad, draw blood on the enemy
At point-blank range, deliverin the penalty

Slangin out hollow slugs

What's mine's I love and I fight push to shove
""Hand to hand"" but you can't stop the love
You push to impress and I leave you with less
It's real love for the mics that I bless no quest

What's mine's I love and I fight push to shove
""Hand to hand"" but you can't stop the love
You push to impress and I leave you with less
It's real love for the mics that I bless no quest

Can't stop the love! I know you sayin' I'ma young nigga
Don't get it fucked up 'cause I move with them thug niggas
From old ? to life we straight sparkin' light
Bring light to the darkest nights
(M) Blast (O) Blast, P in your area
Make a move and them cats might bury ya
Now that your trapped and your fuckin' with thugs
Let me tell your punk ass what I love
I love to see motherfuckers, that show no love
And start speakin' out like a bitch when you catch 'em in the club
I love, when a slug cat shut down
And then try to post up when they damn near cut his ass down
I love, trying to reach all parts of the map
On a Ninja, with a big Buddha bitch on a back
I love, cats that rap and still drip checks
Like your man Lil' Fame, Bill Danze and triple X

What's mine's I love and I fight push to shove
""Hand to hand"" but you can't stop the love
You push to impress and I leave you with less
It's real love for the mics that I bless no quest

Ey yo, you know what I love (What's that?)
It's when motherfuckers assume
That they ass can't get popped at 12 o'clock in the afternoon
I got the balls to come through your walls, like (Boom!)
Have an orgasm every time I clear the fuckin' room
(Niggas is gone) Nah, not just yet
I need to see you son of a bitches sweat
(I love) What I got, son, my shit is prop', son
With Prem' in the drivin' seat and Freddie Foxxx ridin' shotgun
(Stop son!) Here is the ultimate
Somethin' I love is when thugs be bumpin' my shit
(I love) Niggas with heat, (I love) niggas that's deep
Niggas that regulate the streets (sho' 'nough)
Mic blessin, Smith and Wessun caressin
(First Family) With the Desert Storm impression
The lesson: I advise if your not ready to ride
On the homicide side, nigga slide

What's mine's I love and I fight push to shove
""Hand to hand"" but you can't stop the love
You push to impress and I leave you with less
It's real love for the mics that I bless no quest

I love beats that are hardcore, dirty and raw
I love takin' niggas burners when they scared to draw
I love plottin' on my enemies, I love to attack
I love beatin' niggas down when they rhymes is whack
I love seeing emcees struggle to make
Themselves something that us real niggas love to hate
It's too late, I love my Ninas and I love my ""fours""
Blowin' holes through the project doors in ""knive wars"", nigga
I love the feeling, and the rush that I get
From ""Sam"" run the Rolex watch with the diamond begets
I love, how my life was intact without a deal
How I kept the newest chromes on my automobile
I love the fact that rappers make the dough, without a flow
Soft niggas, that I stain, like piss in the snow
I love the fact that I survived through the roughest of times
And break the mic when I want, with the roughest of rhymes
It's a luxury to see me emcee
It's so hard, this lyrical brutality, feed's a nigga's mentality
I love, when you niggas claim to be great
Knowin' your mob ain't never lettin shit, what the fuck is this?
Niggas bustin' shots on New York, I get my vest on
Twenty rhyme clips in my mic, I get my bless on
Loan soldier standin' on the front line, I fear none
Excuses that you give me for your lyrics, I hear none
You niggs ain't no real emcee's
You Sam Goody ass niggas can't write without suckin' down trees
So I love, laughin' at you niggas, while you clappin' at me
I split your head shot from your man, while he's slappin' at me
I feel the hits from your rounds
Your hollow points make a nigga wobble, but I won't fall down

Yeah, you motherfuckers see it, come on!
