Engelbert Humperdinck,"It was late in the early spring, when we picked out the rings
We said 'I do' and took off on our honeymoon
The seashore sure was nice, we made love day and night
We were so much in love, we never got out of the room

Then spring time turned to fall and I was proud and walkin' tall
She was happy but mad 'cause she couldn't fit into her dress
I spent all of my afternoons fixin' up our extra room
For a boy named Bill or a little girl named Tess

And it was late on a winter night, we were sittin' by the fiery light
And she said to me, ""Hun, I think it's time to go""
Oh, I was a nervous wreck, I almost broke my neck
Tryin' to back up the car and hurry through the snow

But I got her there just in time and they dressed us both in white
And I held her hand while they wheeled her into the room
And there right before my eyes the miracle of life
Came cryin' at me and I'd never felt so good

Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me
I never knew that my life was so empty and so incomplete
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me
She looks like her mama but she's smilin' just like me

Ooh, what a wonderful woman I'm lovin'
I'm holding her tender and she's given me everythin'
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me
She looks like her mama but she's smilin' just like me

Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me
I never knew that my life was so empty and so incomplete
Ooh, what a beautiful baby she gave me",Beautiful Baby
Engelbert Humperdinck,"Sometimes at night I don't know why
I get the feeling that I wanna say goodbye
I can see me packin' up a bag and walkin' out the door
I'm goin' back to live the life I used to live before

Out on my own, all by myself
Not takin' care of me or anybody else
But how could I ever word it in the note I'd have write?
Oh, I don't know how to say goodbye

I lie in bed and I'm wide awake
Next to the one whose heart I'd hate to have to break
Then I look into her pretty eyes that don't deserve to cry
And I don't know how to say goodbye

Each time I hold her it's love all over
And in my heart it's understood
I'll never learn how to live without her
And I'd be crazy if I could

She's good to me and I believe
She let me go with it meant happiness for me
Maybe that's the reason why I find my tongue is tied
And I don't know how to say goodbye

Each time I hold her it's love all over
And in my heart it's understood
I'll never learn how to live without her
And I'd be crazy if I could

I love her so I wanna tell her now
I think I'll wake her with a kiss and show her how
And I know she'll whisper in my ear a million reasons why
I don't know how to say goodbye

And when she's layin' in my arms I cannot tell a lie
I don't know how to say goodbye

I don't know how to say goodbye
I don't know how to say goodbye",I Don't Know How to Say Goodbye
Engelbert Humperdinck,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Cause I needed you so desperately.
We were too blind to see, but then,
Most of all, I do love you",Still [Live]
Engelbert Humperdinck,"The moon is on the rise it stares at me tonight
I'm reminded of the arms that held me tight
Last time I held you it ended all too soon
We were lying underneath a yellow moon

There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky
Oh, I wonder if you're watching it too
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky
Wherever you are, it's watching over you
Oh, shine on, shine on yellow moon

Sometimes we sit and talk me and that old moon
I ask him, are you happy or if you're blue
I start to reminisce to a summer night in June
We fell in love under a yellow moon

There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky
Oh, I wonder if you're watching it too
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky
Wherever you are, it's watching over you
Oh, shine on, shine on yellow moon

Yellow moon, oh, yellow moon",Yellow Moon
Engelbert Humperdinck,"I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silv'ry sea

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whisp'ring
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whisp'ring
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me",The Great Divide
Engelbert Humperdinck,"You must remember this
A kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh.
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by.

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you.""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by.

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date.
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate.
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny.

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die.
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by.

Engelbert Humperdinck,"Dozens of girls would storm up
I had to lock my door
Somehow I couldn't warm up
To one before

What was it that controlled me
What kept my love life lean
My intuition told me
You'd come on the scene

Lady listen to the rhythm of my heartbeat
And you'll get just what I mean

Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you my heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me

I love all the many charms about you
Above all I want my arms about
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa come to papa do

My sweet embraceable you",Embraceable You
Engelbert Humperdinck,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware, my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love; this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Engelbert Humperdinck,"The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love",The Very Thought of You
Engelbert Humperdinck,"Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue.

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around.
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.

Engelbert Humperdinck,"No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, baby of my heart",I Just Called to Say I Love You
Engelbert Humperdinck,"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it!
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playin' around, boy, that's just fine

Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it!
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you!",I'm So Excited
Engelbert Humperdinck,"This is a lovely way to spend an evening.
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening,
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you

A casual stroll through a garden. a kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you

Some like a night at the movies, some like a dance or a
Show
Some are content with an evening spent home by the radio
Some like to live for the moment, some like to just
Reminisce
But whenever I have an evening to spend. just give me one

Engelbert Humperdinck,"Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer
Those days of soda and pretzels and beer
Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer
Dust off the sun and moon and sing a song of cheer

Just fill your basket full of sandwiches and weenies
Then lock the house up, now you're set
And on the beach you'll see the girls in their bikinis
As cute as ever but they never get 'em wet

Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer
Those days of soda and pretzels and beer
Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer
You'll wish that summer could always be here

Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer
Those days of soda and pretzels and beer
Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer
Dust off the sun and moon and sing a song of cheer

Don't hafta tell a girl and fella about a drive-in
Or some romantic moon it seems
Right from the moment that those lovers start arrivin'
You'll see more kissin' in the cars than on the screen

Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;

So cry no more on the shore of dreams
Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more

Close your eyes and dream and you can be with me
Neath the waves through the caves of ours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out. let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

Once a story's told it can't help but grow old
Roses do, lovers too
So cast your seasons to the wind
And hold me dear, oh, hold me dear

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out. let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right

Engelbert Humperdinck,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through, God her love is true.

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me

For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Quando eu abro a janela
Quando eu abro o jornal
Eu vejo a cara dela:
A Terceira Guerra Mundial
Jogam bombas em Nova Iorque
Jogam bombas em Moscou
Como se jogassem beijos pra torcida
Depois de marcar um gol
Falam tanto sobre guerra e paz
Mas tanto faz falar ou não
Todas as bombas e os generais
São restos mortais da civilização
Rebeldes sem rebeldia
Viciados em anestesia
Fantasmas sem fantasia
Gripados na guerra fria
Pão e circo, que pé no saco
Quem não fica frio, fica fraco
Procuro entender qualé a desses caras
Procuro um cigarro no bolso do casaco
Em todo lugar, um pedaço do fim
Um furo de bala, um muro de berlim
Muito sangue sai da tela do ""drive-in""

Nós só precisamos ir
Não queremos ter o que não temos
Nós só queremos viver

É sobretudo a lei

Quando eu vivia e morria na cidade
Eu não tinha nada, nada a temer
Mas eu tinha medo, medo dessa estrada
Olhe só, veja você
Quando eu vivia e morria na cidade
Eu tinha de tudo, tudo ao meu redor
Mas tudo que eu sentia era que algo me faltava

Não queremos aprender o que sabemos

Já era tarde era quase dia

Num precipício, era o meu corpo que caía
Ontem a noite, a noite tava fria
Tudo queimava, nada aquecia

Parecia que era minha aquela solidão
Ontem à noite eu conheci uma guria
Que eu já conhecia de outros carnavais
Com outras fantasias
Ela apareceu, parecia tão sozinha

No início era um precipício

Depois virou um vício
Foi tão difícil acordar no outro dia
Ela apareceu, parecia tão sozinho

Agora me arrependo, roendo as unhas
Frágeis testemunhas
De um crime sem perdão

Mas eu que falei sem pensar
Coração na mão, como refrão de um bolero
Eu fui sincero
Como não se pode ser

Um erro assim tão vulgar
Nos persegue a noite inteira
E, quando acaba a bebedeira,
Ele consegue nos achar

Num bar
Com um vinho barato
Um cigarro no cinzeiro,
E uma cara embriagada no espelho do banheiro

Ana, teus lábios são labirintos, Ana
Que atraem os meus instintos mais sacanas
O teu olhar sempre distante sempre me engana

And here I stand a soldier in the rain.

They say love knows no distance but the lonely never ends
And all along the dreams that possessed my heart never were to plain
And here I stand a soldier in the rain

I remember years ago? I had so many plans
And now I watch the river flow ? time has brought me here
With empty hands

Ahorita ando como hueso 
Me gusta vivir la vida 
Porque no somos eternos

Mexicali, el calorcito 
Culiacán es muy bonito 
Y por donde quiera que andan 
Se la pasan de parranda 
También haya por Tijuana 
En las noches pura

Banda, Loquera, y Pisteada 
La moda de la plebada 
Pasan las cuatro por cuatro 
En la arena levantando 
Bien alegre, bote en mano
Las edecanes bailando 
Suena Enigma y los corridos

Carros y adrenalina

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Sends me shivers

Stairways I climb to the heights

Feelin' better to know I'm better 
I've finally given up, on all of the things you say
You didn't love me cause if you loved me,
I'd never walk away
I'd never walk away, Yeah (repeat 2x)

...I'd never walk away

(Instrumental, fades out)
",I'd Never Walk Away
Ennis Sisters,"

I pick up what's left of my broken heart

I pack it all back in the trunk of my car

and follow the white line,

til I'm feelin fine again

I let the rain drown my sorrows tonight

but when I wake up, I let the light

try to convince me,

I'm back on my feet again


It's not about you

I'm finally walkin

I'm singin inside

I can't hear ya talkin

and you can't believe it's true

It's not about you


I do what I can not to turn back now

I've come this far and I know somehow

so I'll keep on lookin til I find me again


It's not about you

I'm finally walkin

I'm singin inside

I can't hear ya talkin

and you can't believe it's true

It's not about you


I'm gonna drive all night

sort through this thing til I make it right

you can't believe it,

can't even believe it's true

it's not about you

it's not about you


It's not about you

I'm finally walkin

I'm singin inside

I can't hear ya talkin

and you can't believe it's true

It's not about you

I'm finally walkin

I'm singin inside

I can't hear ya talkin

and you can't believe it's true

It's not about you

I'm finally walkin

I'm singin inside

I can't hear ya talkin

and you can't believe it's true

It's not about you


It's not about you

and you can't believe it's true

Ennis Sisters,"Every lover knows this song too well
Finding out who's love they need
Some can sing it and some can tell
Others just can't find the key.

There is a magic that lasts through time
Some fall under it's spell
I hope that someday the future is kind
So I can finally tell 

Somebody, somewhere, that they mean the world to me
I hope that somebody somewhere, can set this heart free
I know that somebody somewhere can show me the way
Love can be- I know that somebody somewhere is waiting for me.

If I could have any wish on a star
In a world where that dreams do come true
My wish would find you wherever you are
So I can finally say to

Somebody, somewhere, that they mean the world to me
I hope that somebody somewhere, can set this heart free
I know that somebody somewhere can show me the way
Love can be- I know that somebody somewhere is waiting for me. 

I know that somebody somewhere can show me the way
Love can be- I know that somebody somewhere is waiting for me.

And sometimes the blues just get a hold of you

You know you can get there easily, 
Just like a sailboat sailin' on the sea.

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,
And most times you choose between the two
Wonderin', wonderin' if you have made it.
But I'll have some kids and make my plans,
And I'll watch the seasons running away
And I'll build me a life in the open, a life in the country.

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

Sees the sun going down

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

Enric Madriguera,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye

Enrico Bracco,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

C'est la trêve
Et les voitures font de la route un train

Et l'on pêche
Si les forêts ne sont que des buissons

Laissent le pain sur la planche
Pour une chemise blanche

Qui m'éloignais du quai

Ne vivent que par deux

Qu'il soit un démon
Qu'il soit noir ou blanc,
Il a le cœur pur
Il est toute innocence
Qu'il soit né d'amour
Ou par accident
Malheur à celui qui blesse un enfant

Il n'a pas de père et il n'a pas de mère,
C'est le plus frondeur de tout l'orphelinat
On cite en exemple son sale caractère
Et on le punit car on ne l'aime pas

Qu'il soit un démon
Qu'il soit noir ou blanc,
Il a le cœur pur
Il est toute innocence
Qu'il soit né d'amour
Ou par accident
Malheur à celui qui blesse un enfant

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Il vole au marché un gâteau, une orange,
Et on le poursuit, il faut le rattraper
On donne l'alerte on arrête un ange
Et pour se défendre il se met à pleurer

Qu'il soit un démon
Qu'il soit noir ou blanc,
Il a le cœur pur
Il est toute innocence
Qu'il soit né d'amour
Ou par accident
Malheur à celui qui blesse un enfant

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Il est émigré d'un pays de misère
Et dans une école il apprend à parler
Son accent fait rire il ne peut rien faire
Sans qu'on lui reproche d'être un étranger

Qu'il soit un démon
Qu'il soit noir ou blanc,
Il a le cœur pur
Il est toute innocence
Qu'il soit né d'amour
Ou par accident

Enrico Macias,"Noël à Jérusalem
Près d'un mur que l'on croyait perdu
Un homme à genoux est là, il pleure à côté de moi
Et lève les yeux en remerciant le ciel

Noël à Jérusalem
Les pieds nus aux portes des mosquées
Ils sont des milliers qui viennent pour y déposer leurs peines
Le visage à terre jusqu'à la nuit tombée

Ces mains qui prient au même instant ici
N'ont-elles pas la même ferveur
Les hommes auraient-ils oubliés aussi
Que c'est Dieu qui fait battre leur coeur

Noël à Jérusalem
C'est aussi l'enfant de Bethléem
Et le pèlerin guidé par l'étoile du berger
Cherche la maison de sa nativité

Noël à Jérusalem
C'est le monde au pied de l'éternel
Qui vient implorer son nom et lui demander pardon
De s'être égaré loin des chemins du ciel

Pourtant il suffirait de voir un jour
S'élever dans une prière
Le c?ur de trois hommes éperdus d'amour
Pour changer la face de la terre

Noël à Jérusalem
Près d'un mur que l'on a retrouvé
Un homme à genoux m'a dit : Tout est changé dans ma vie
Car Jérusalem est de nouveau sur terre

La première ville bénie
À qui le Seigneur a dit
Je ferai ici mon plus merveilleux Noël
À Jérusalem",Noël a Jérusalem
Enrico Macias,"Dès le dimanche matin on est bien
C'est la trêve

Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame

Who tell you fate supplies a mate

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

Parole che restano con noi
E non andiamo via 
Ma nascondiamo del dolore 
Che scivola, lo sentiremo poi
Abbiamo troppa fantasia, e se diciamo una bugia 
È una mancata verità che prima o poi succederà 
Cambia il vento ma noi no

Con le nostre notti bianche 
Ma non saremo stanche neanche quando 
Ti diremo ancora un altro sì

Silenzi, che familiarità
E lasciano una scia le frasi da bambine 
Che tornano, ma chi le ascolterà
E dalle macchine per noi 
I complimenti del playboy 

Ma non li sentiamo più 
Se c'è chi non ce li fa più 
Cambia il vento ma noi no 
E se ci confondiamo un po' 
È per la voglia di capire chi non riesce più a parlare 
Ancora con noi
 
Siamo così, dolcemente complicate 
Sempre più emozionate, delicate 
Ma potrai trovarci ancora qui 
Nelle sere tempestose 
Portaci delle rose 
Nuove cose

Esce con la faccia incontro al vento

E verso un'altra via d'uscita
Corre con il cellulare spento 
E testardamente spera
Di trovarsi ancora tutta intera

E non vede niente

Dentro sè

Nelle stanze sconosciute
Chiede indietro un pò di sentimento
Angoli di tenerezza
Dentro a una carezza quasi vera

Ma lentamente
Un taglio di luce annuncia un'altra estate

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

When I say that I'm okay, well, they look at me kinda strange
""Surely, you're not happy now, you no longer play the game""

People say I'm lazy, dreaming my life away
Well, they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me
When I tell them that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall
""Don't you miss the big time, boy. You're no longer on the ball""

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

Ahhh, people ask me questions, lost in confusion
Well, I tell them there's no problem, only solutions
Well, they shake their heads and they look at me as if I've lost my mind
I tell them there's no hurry, I'm just sitting here doing time

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go",Watching the Wheels
Enrique Bunbury,"Permite que te invite ala despedida 
No importa que no merezca mas tu atención

Así me enseñaron a que la hiciera yo

Permite que te dedique la ultima linea 
No importa que te disguste esta canción 
Así mi conciencia quedara mas tranquila 
Así en esta banda decimos adiós

Y al final 
Te atare con todas mis fuerzas 
Mis brazos serán cuerdas al bailar este bals 
Y al final 
Quiero verte de nuevo contenta 
Sigue dando vueltas si aguantas de pie

Permite que te explique, que no tengo prisa 
No importa que tengas algo mejor que hacer 
Así nos podemos quedar toda la vida 
Así si me dejas no te dejare de querer

El tiempo no es un doctor 
Mala racha, mala estampa

Con anestesia no hay dolor 
Póngame la inyección 

El tiempo solo te sana 
Lo que no importa ya 
Los años nos hacen mejores o ¿no? 
Si puedes encajar 
Los golpes como un hombre 
Un sparring profesional
La vida es póquer 
Y las cartas no las vas a elegir 
Los ases en la manga no te va a servir

Ni el murmullo del ron
Que podemos hacer tanto amor

Un desayuno con tamales

Que vuelve al mar, sea como sea
Suplicando por algún tipo de relación digna de llamarse humana
Que lleve la pena y la quebrada en el bolsillo del corazón

Una de esas malas compañías, factoría de melancolía
Que no vienen a ver si pueden, sino porque pueden vienen
Una indígena alienígena, que solamente bebe justicia poética

Un beso en la boca de la botella de flor de caña -gran reserva-
Sobre una mesa repleta de vasos vacíos y limones exprimidos

Para sentirte acompañado cuando sientes vencido
Una canción triste para cuando estas solo
Cuando no sabes el modo de salir adelante

Has tenido el mundo a tus pies
El aroma de la gloria es buena compañía
Pero poco duradera, lo que sube baja
Y si permanece intacta
Pierdes las llaves de la mansión, alguien ocupo tu salón
Y se acuesta con tu mujer
Lo peor es que disfruta más que en tu luna de miel
Se bañan en tu piscina se comen tu comida
Y tiran el piano blanco por el balcón

Para sentirte acompañado cuando te sientes vencido

O un mesías, tú pronosticabas lo que iba a suceder
Un fallo lo tiene cualquiera, cualquiera menos tú
Tenías el touch, y el don especial, tocado por la mano de Dios
¿qué es lo que pasó?, ¿quién se ofendió?

Siempre con las mismas penas
Con las heridas abiertas
Que siguen sin cicatrizar

Por desiertos, por la selva
Surcando los anchos mares
Hacia ningún lugar

Canto por que me canso
De dar explicaciones
No tengo soluciones
Para que tanto preguntar

Salto de cama en cama
De boca a boca
De falda en falda
No vuelvo por donde vine
Nunca miro hacia atrás

Y no hay mejor ni peor
Pues con la gente que tropiezo
Sufren del mismo dolor
Están igual, el mismo dolor

No hay mejor ni peor
Si estas quieto o en movimiento
Sufres el mismo dolor
Estas igual, el mismo dolor

Canto por que me harto
De lugares concurridos
De esquemas aburridos
Para condecir ser unidad

Parto de aquí a otro lado
Crías cuervos
Y te comen los ojos luego
Canto por que me levanto
Siempre con las mismas penas

Y no hay mejor ni peor

Enrique Bunbury,"En la pulpería de lucita 
Paso las tardes enteras viendo como se pone el sol por el malecón 
No hay tristeza mayor
Que verla perder la cabeza 
Con el gringo que se tropieza 
Por un cuartito de ron

En la pulpería de lucita
Siempre la misma mesa, me espera después de comer
Una y otra vez, y siempre quiere saber,qué escribo en esa libreta
Qué pequeña que tengo la letra, y porqué no la dejo ver

Si es una canción para lucita
Espérame en la playa en san juan del sur
Es una canción para lucita
Para recordar aquellas veladas echando a patadas 
A los que no sabían beber

En la pulpería de lucita
Frente a la laguna de masaya, tengo una taza de café con mi nombre al revés
Y si mira a través del espejo en la barra, el reflejo le manda, en mensaje cifrado
El beso que demanda y que nunca me va a devolver

Es una canción para lucita espérame en la playa en san juan del sur
Es una canción para lucita para recordar aquellas veladas 
Echando a patadas a los que no sabían beber

Enrique Bunbury,"No me llames cariño, no necesito caridad
Ya no somos unos críos, ya está todo dicho
Que cada uno siga su camino
Cada uno en su lugar

Cuando buscaba tu boca, el viento se llevaba mis besos
Se estrellaban contra una roca de obsidiana pura
Dejándome el alma rota, llenándome de amargura

Cuando buscaba tus manos, quedaba solo en la pista
Me apartabas de tu lado, el baile era con otro
Como si fuera un extraño
Ahora no te conozco

No me llames cariño, no necesito caridad
Ya no somos unos críos, ya está todo dicho
Que cada uno siga su camino
Cada uno en su lugar

Cuando buscaba consuelo, tú no me escuchabas
Nunca era el momento para mis depresiones
Demasiados lamentos, demasiadas discusiones

No me llames cariño, no necesito caridad

Que cada uno siga su camino

Enrique Bunbury,"Mañana parto de nuevo a managua
Tengo cita en la librería parnaso
Quedé con unas cuantas muchachas
Que trabajan en un night club

Soy buen bailarín con unos tragos
Demasiado torpe si me paso

Su belleza les permite ser castigadoras
Yo no me pienso negar
Ellas serán las que dispongan
Y yo, no me pienso negar

O como la marea, vienen y van

Nadie sabe lo que sabes,
Y tampoco entregarían lo que vale mi rescate.

Ni avales, ni talonarios,
No hay en este mundo, aunque parezca absurdo,
Ni en planetas por descubrir, lo que aquí te pido.
Y no te obligo a nada que no quieras.
Las fuerzas me fallan, mis piernas no responden
Te conocen, pero no llegan a ti.

Decidí por eso mismo, un mecanismo de defensa.
Presa como está mi alma, con la calma suficiente,
Ser más fuerte, y enfrentarme cuanto antes a la verdad,
Sin dudar un segundo, lo asumo,
Sólo tú puedes pagar el rescate.

Devuélveme el amor que me arrebataste,
O entrégaselo, lo mismo me da, al abajo firmante
Pues no hay en este mundo, aunque parezca absurdo,

Resbala en tu piel y a la vez 
Se ilumina un cartel ofreciéndote 
Libertad y Sordidez, 
Todo a un precio que un hombre moderno 
Ha de ser capaz de pagar 
Una vez que la noche echa a andar. 
¿No lo ves? Tu carne es más pálida. 
¿No lo ves? Tu alma es más gris.

De la pérfida enana marrón. 
Mira que tú fuiste el rey, 
Con tu cetro en la mano 
Y los ojos clavados en gente 
Que sabes que no llegarás a conocer 
Ni aunque vivas mil años 
Y el cielo se postre a tus pies, 
Pero su mirada no se despega de tu pantalón. 
Y echas a andar por la ciudad 
Y atraviesas un nuevo canal. 
Huyes del rojo y azul del neón, 
Vas en busca de algo que huela distinto al amor.

Nunca hago prisioneros, aunque los delincuentes modernos 
Estén autorizados

Y sacudir el aire de los pañuelos de celofán 
Y decir adiós a los que se van 
Extrañas lealtades compartiendo intimidades

Y querías ser libre pero que no te pasara nada 
Siento una simpatía natural y espontanea 
Hacia las cosas extraordinarias 
Y he debido estar en este lugar sin darme cuenta

Los nacionalismos que miedo me dan.

Ni patria ni bandera
Ni raza ni condición
Ni limites ni fronteras
Extranjero soy!

Enrique Bunbury,"Soy la tormenta de arena 
Soy la rubia y la morena 
La que te deja tirado 
La que te tiñe las venas 

La buena muerte, el gusano verde 
El amuleto de tu mala suerte 
El látigo de seda, el palo en la rueda 
La soga que te oprime donde tú quieras 

Si superas este invierno, si te quedas junto a mí
Entre el cielo y el infierno, ya no podrás distinguir 
Si las noches son tan largas y me quieres despertar 
Uhh da igual

Riega tu huerto con polvo de aspirina 
El fondo del túnel es solo tu mirar 
No te disculpes, fuego sin nombre 
No te enamores, litio de azufre

Lubrica con tu sangre el tiempo que te queda 
Los miedos, la vergüenza de la buena 
Dame todo eso que tenías para mí
Puede que pueda pasar la prueba 

Si supieras lo que siento, ya no querrías venir 
Yo te ofrezco lo que tengo y es muy fácil elegir 
Si los días son tan cortos y no quieres descansar 
Uhh, da igual

Y en esta cama de hotel, mirando pasar 
Las luces que bañan toda esta ciudad 
Voy a empezar a llorar, dejarme llevar 
Esta situación tan química 

Horas, minutos, segundos 
Me hago un cigarro
Horas, minutos, segundos 
Me hago un cigarro

Voy a empezar a cantar, o voy a llorar 
Me voy a correr, ¡da igual! 
Voy a empezar a cantar, o voy a llorar 
Me voy a correr, ¡da igual! 
Me voy a empezar a correr, no voy a llorar 
ME voy a cantar, ¡da igual!

Si te quedas junto a mí

Enrique Bunbury,"He pecado, he pecado
Mira no te acerques a mi lado
Amé con las fuerzas de mi corazón
Y eso hoy día hace daño
He fallado, he fallado
Te di todo y no pedí ni el cambio
Amé sin pena y sin condición
Como me lo han enseñado

Y traigo pedazos de mi corazón
Traigo pedazos de mi corazón, en las manos
Y vengo a matar y a dejar tu recuerdo
Vengo a matar y a dejar tu recuerdo, en el piano
Pero vive tu imagen, revive y se sube a mis brazos
Llega ardiendo a mi garganta
Y me hace gritarle a los cielos que no me arrepiento
Que no me arrepiento y que vuelvo a tus brazos
Mi dulce pecado
He pecado, he pecado
Por desearte más que demasiado
Te amé sin medida, te amé sin control
Y eso, niña, hoy lo pago
He tratado, he tratado
De quererte menos y he fallado
No supe de reglas, te amé más que a Dios
Y eso sí, eso sí que es pecado

Mi dulce pecado
Oye, sigo contigo hasta el fin, mi dulce pecado
Pero esta vez no quedaré así tan crónico
Catapultiao como un pañuelo catatónico
Yo sé muy bien que muchas veces fuiste otra
Pero lo que te doy no lo mereces y te toca
Yo sé que muchos pagarían por besar tu boca
Pero esa dicha marcar, mira niña no me toca
Como un puñal tu recuerdo en mi sombra
Por esto adiós pecado, mira, mira no me toca
Como Adán y Eva, Eva, Eva
Así se eleva mi pecado
No sé cómo llamarte, si princesa roja o niña, niña
No quiero volver a comer de aquella manzana podrida
Igual lo que me digas no importa
Si tú eres quien domina
Y transporta la sangre de mis venas a este humilde corazón
Cerrando sus grietas, como Romeo y Julieta
Así camina este bolero son
Míralo, míralo te digo
Que vuelve, vuelve, a mis brazos
Condenado, condenado

Rompí tu corazón
Y ahora tu mundo esta burlándose de mi.

De volver a los infiernos
Miedo a que me tengas miedo
A tenerte que olvidar.

De quererte sin quererlo
De encontrarte de repente
De no verte nunca más.

Enrique Chia,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Enrique Chia,"No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you

How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I sit alone and cry,
Twilight time 'til dawn,
Memories linger on,
Since we said goodbye.

Throughout that sleepless night,
No matter what I do,
You're always on my mind,
And though you're gone I find,
I'm still in love with you. 

Shadows fall, and I recall,
The love that you once had for me.
Miss you so, when lights are low,
I think of things that use to be. 

You're always in my heart,
Although you're out of sight,
Lonely teardrops burn,
As I toss and turn,
Another sleepless night.

Quiero morir para unirme a ti
No puedo más soportar esta pena tan onda
Al escuchar en mi soledad
Tu voz, tu voz
Tu voz, tu voz

Enrique Guzmán,"Saturday night and I just got paid
I'm a fool about my money, don't try to save.
My heart says ""go go, have a time""
Saturday night and I'm feelin' fine.

[Chorus]
I'm gonna rock it up, 
Rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it
And ball tonight.

Well almost 'bout ten I'll be flying high
I'll rock on out unto the sky
I don't care if I spend my dough
Tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul

Si pudiera bajarte una estrella del cielo
Lo haría sin pensarlo dos veces
Porque te quiero, ay
Hasta un lucero

Y si tuviera el naufragio de un sentimiento
Seria un velero en la isla
De tus deseos, de tus deseos

Pero por dentro entiendo que no puedo
Y a veces me pierdo

Cuando me enamoro
A veces desespero
Cuando me enamoro
Cuando menos me lo espero, me enamoro
Se detiene el tiempo
Me viene el alma al cuerpo
Sonrío, cuando me enamoro

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Si la luna seria tu premio
Yo juraría hacer cualquier cosa
Por ser su dueño, ay
Por ser su dueño

Y si en tus sueños escuchas el llanto
De mis lamentos
En tus sueños no sigas dormida,
Que es verdadero, ay
No es un sueño, no

Me alegro que a veces al final
No encuentres su momento, oh no

Cuando me enamoro
A veces desespero
Cuando me enamoro
Cuando menos me lo espero, me enamoro
Se detiene el tiempo
Me viene el alma al cuerpo

But you can't escape my love

Here's how it goes
You and me
Up and down
But maybe this time
We'll get it right
Worth the fight
'Cause love isn't something you can shake

When it breaks all it takes is some trying

I'm not going to make you stay
But soon you'll be finding

You can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

So if you go
You should know
It's hard to just forget the past
So fast

It was good
It was bad,
But it was real
And that's all you have
In the end our love mattered

If you feel like leaving
I'm not going to make you stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run, you can run
You can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can hide
But you can't escape my love

Dance floor chillin' while I hold two cups
Can't stop spilling, cause I'm drunk as fuck
And my song comes on, and the club goes nuts
Yeah, every province I go, city I sleep, it's best that ya'll know
Running around, and doing all these shows
Round the whole globe, I come, and you go girl
And you need to think of it
Just arrive for the night, baby live a bit
With a place to hit, and your pants to zip
We can make this thing a party, are you into it

In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few
Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you

Amar es cuando s'lo piensas en d'nde estar'. Amar es como un milagro dif'cil de explicar.
Amar es cuando la proteges de la lluvia y el viento.
Amar es cuando t' la abrazas y te olvidas del tiempo...
Amar es cuando t' la ves y te pones nervioso. Amar es cuando te das cuenta de tus sentimientos.
Por amarte robar'a una estrella y te la regalar'a, por amarte cruzar'a los mares s'lo por abrazarte.
Por amarte juntar'a la lluvia con el fuego, yo por amarte dar'a mi vida s'lo por besarte.
Amar es cuando escribes su nombre por todo el cielo.
Amar es cuando s'lo sue'as con llev'rtela lejos.

No es un viene y va
Amar solo te pasa una vez
Pero de verdad
Amar es cuando solo piensas
En donde estara
Amar es como un milagro
Dificil de explicar

Amar es cuando la proteges
De la lluvia y el viento
Amar es cuando tu la abrazas
Y te olvidas del tiempo
Amar es cuando tu la ves
Y te pones nervioso
Amar es cuando te das cuenta
De tus sentimientos

Por amarte robaria una estrella
Y te la regalaria
Por amarte cruzaria los mares
Solo por abrazarte
Por amarte juntaria la lluvia
Con el fuego
Por amarte daria la vida
Solo por besarte

Amar es cuando escribes su nombre
Por todo el cielo
Amar es cuando solo suenas
Con llevartela lejos

Amar es cuando tu la ves
Y se queda en tus ojos
Amar es cuando tu te das cuenta
Ella lo es todo

Por amarte daria la vida

Enrique Iglesias,"I've kissed the moon a million times
Danced with angels in the sky 
I've seen snowfall in the summertime
Felt the healing of the powers above

I've seen the world from the highest mountain
Tasted love from the purest fountain 
I've seen lips that spark desire
Felt the butterflies a hundred times

I've even seen miracles 
I've felt the pain disappear
But still haven't seen anything
That amazes me quite like you do

You bring me up when I'm feeling down 
You touch me deep you touch me right 
You do the things I've never done 
You make me wicked you make me wild 
'Cause baby, you're my number one

Jenny's getting dressed up
In my room
Puts on her skirt and
She's looking good
Six am and she's leaving soon
Says what a crazy night
I had a real good time
But her kiss tells me
It's goodbye
Just like nothing
Happened last night
But if I had one chance
I'd do it all over again

One night stand
I don't think she's coming
Back for more
She was only looking
For a  one night stand
I don't think she's coming
Back for more
No no

Now I'm left up
In my lonely room
She left her underwear
And her perfume
I never thought
That it could be this good
And I still feel her lips
Up on my fingertips
I'm trying hard
Not to feel rejected
Maybe the phone line's disconnected
But if I had one chance
I'd do it all over again

One night stand
I don't think she's coming
Back for more
She was only looking
For a one night stand
I don't think she's coming
Back for more

But I'd do it
All over again for sure, oh yeah

Do I have the right to ask you
Will you be coming back again?

They say time can heal the pain
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And I guess I'm just a fool
I keep holding on to you

I told you once you were the one
You know that I die for you
Oh, though it hurts to see you go
Oh, this time you should know
I won't try to stop you

Don't you forget about me baby
Don't you forget about me now
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go

So you try to fake a smile
You don't wanna break my heart
I can see that you're afraid
But baby it's to late
'Cause I'm already dying

Don't you forget about me baby
Don't you forget about me now
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go

Don't you forget about me baby
Don't you forget about me now
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go

Why did I let you

Don't you forget about me baby
Don't you forget about me now

Enrique Iglesias,"I don't know why 
You want to follow me tonight 
When in the rest of the world 
With whom I've crossed and I've quarreled 

Laisse-toi tomber
Pour mieux renaître et être aimé
Tu cherches l'histoire à sauver
Sans plus chercher à t'excuser

Beneath the silver moon

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely

Quand ton cœur éclate
Laisse le destin l'emporter

Ose le meilleur
Et lève-toi sans avoir peur

We're all bloodless and blind
And longing for a life

Beyond the silver moon

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely

Quand ton coeur éclate
Laisse le destin l'emporter
I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
A toi d'exister
Seul, face à la nuit

So far away
A tout jamais

I've trashed myself
I've lost my way
I've got to get to you

Je serai là pour nous

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely

Quand ton coeur éclate
Laisse le destin l'emporter

Enrique Iglesias,"Away, away
Oh
Away, away

(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I)

This feels like the coldest day in a hurricane
Looking through a glass window
And you're screaming to the top of your lungs
And the bell's done rung
And the crowd can't hear you
And all that I can see is a building burning
(I just gotta rescue my baby)
But you don't even recognize me

And even though the feeling's been gone, I just wanna be here
Would you pick up the little pieces of remains
I'm going down, the plane is smoking
And the only one who can save me is you, but you want to

Throw me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I gotta know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I gotta know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away

You used to ask why was I so skeptic (of love)
Girl, 'cause it changes
And it ain't got to be no real reason
You start to live the dream and before you know
There's a door that opens, and the moment you walk in, it close
(Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help)
Ooh, love, oh, love, oh, love, oh, love
Just ain't what it used to be

I confronted my fears with open arms
Although you said you will never give up on us
But now you blow me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I gotta know
I gotta know why you wanna blow me away
Away, away, away
Oh, why?
I wanna know why you wanna blow me away

Perfect we said we'd never be
So why is this happening to me?
No way, no way (No way)
No way, no way (No way)
No way, no way (Way)
No way, no way (No way, no way)
No way, no way (No way)
No way, no way (No way)

Would you dance if I asked you to dance?
Would you run and never look back?
Would you cry if you saw me crying?
And would you save my soul tonight?

Would you tremble if I touched your lips?
Would you laugh? Oh, please tell me this
Now would you die for the one you love?
Hold me in your arms tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Would you swear that you'll always be mine?
Or would you lie? Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Oh, I just want to hold you
I just want to hold you, oh yeah
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?

Saber que nuestro amor
Nos acabado,

Oh, hey
Dime si es verdad, o es solo idea mía
Di que no es locura ni obsesión
Que no es capricho, simplemente
Dile que lo sientes y que yo
Nunca he dejado de quererte

I know that you are not alone
But you steal my heart away

You're acting like you're on your own
But I saw you standing with a girl
Stop tryn' to steal my heart away,
Stop tryn' to steal my heart away

Maybe it's the way you move
You got me dreaming like a fool
That I could steal your heart away
I could steal your heart away

No matter what it is you think

And give my heart away
Stop tryin' steal my heart away

One day at a time

Saw you in the club
You were dancing with somebody
So close so tight
You were killing me so slowly
My friends were telling me what you're doing
Can drive a man so crazy
Trying to live my life
It's been 6 months since you left me

So I oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day, one day, one day
One day at a time
One day, one day, one day
One day at a time

I am not the jealous heart
But you stole my heart baby
Dancing with that guy
Made it so hard for me to watch baby
I just been around running in circle
I'm going through it in my mind baby
Had to suck up the tears from my night strolls
To stop from crying out loud baby

Oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
Can't stop thinking about you baby
Oh I oh I
I keep thinking about you baby
I try I try
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know, and I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

First thing I gotta do is try to face it (try to face it)
But your voice keeps playing in my ear (playing in my ear)
It just makes me crazy trying to fake it (trying to fake it)
The true event's so bad, it's not what I wanna hear
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

Said I gotta let you go

The concrete skies are rushing by me
And this road is getting old

I don't wanna wait until it's gone
I can't wait until tomorrow

Made me think of everything we used to do

And now I can't, even I say ""I miss you"", no

My mind is running wild tryin' hard not to fall
You told me that you love me but say I'm just a friend
My heart is broken up into pieces
'Cause I know I'll never free my soul
It's trapped between true love and being alone
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

Why oh why tell me why not me
Why oh why we were meant to be
Baby I know I could be all you need
Why oh why oh why

I wanna love you
If you only knew how much I love you
So why not me

The day after tomorrow I'll still be around
To catch you when you fall and ever let you down
You say that we're forever our love will never end
I've tried to come up but it's drowning me to know
You'll never feel my soul

It's trapped between true love and being alone
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor

Hold me down if my whole world went crazy
That' s what she spoke
Just what she said
Now that's a joke
That talk is dead
Know I got to get over the love I had
The door I keep it open just in case she come back
Can't deal with the emotions to the point I'm sad
And I know my hearts broken but I've got so attached
Baby come back I won't get no sleep
She more than I want and all that I need
Locked up my heart and threw away the key so
And when my baby come back I'm crossing my T's dotting my I's
And now I can't eat
Out of my mind
And that's how it's gonna be so, so

There goes my baby

Enrique Iglesias,"You, you are so beautiful

It used to be, you and me
Love like no other
Our world around, could fall apart
But we had each other
Saw you walking, you were smiling
And it hit me like the first time
Feels like yesterday, has come and gone
But nothing's changed, when I look at you

You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful
You're my eyes
I just want you to know
That after all this time
You're still the one

Still hurts sometimes
Love on the line
But we said forever, yeah
Sailing on, through the storms
But we had together
And now I
I just want you to know
That after all this time
You're still the one

You, you are so beautiful

Enrique Iglesias,"Only a woman can take away your cold hard chill
Break your heart and make you love her still
Leave you thirsty when you've had your fill

Only a woman can sit you high up on a throne
Make you feel so damn alone
Leave you begging baby come back home

And it's only till she's gone
Could you see that you were wrong

'Cause the seasons change and people come and go
But when love is fate best hold that woman close
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door
'Cause that's your woman
That's all I know

Only a woman can make you fly so high you wanna touch the sun
When your wings melt and you come undone
Catches you when you fall, she's the only one

She steals your heart just like a thief
Makes you lay roses at your feet
But you know to kiss the rose, the thorns will make you bleed

And it's only till she's gone
Could you see that you were wrong

'Cause the seasons change and people come and go
But when love is fate best hold that woman close
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door
'Cause that's your woman
That's all I know

You thank God you found her
can't live your life without her
And every little thing about her is all you need
All you need

'Cause the seasons change and people come and go
But when love is fate best hold that woman close
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door
'Cause that's your woman
That's all I know, only a woman
Only a woman",Only a Woman

I fell, flew and walked
It was dark and I saw

The houses are abandoned, and the sky is red
The ship is leaving for the sea.

Fanga og låst I ei sorg ingen skjøner
Gleden forsvann langt, langt der ute.
Ei brennande lyst, en ingen håp.
Ho lengtar heim, men finn ingen veg.
Ein sorgfull lagnad gøymt bak eit smil.
Mardol do fagre for fred do blei ofra
Do solgte din lekam, men fann ingen trøyst.
Det som glimrar gjer ikkje fred for deg
Gern do ga deg hen, og slokka mangt
Eit begjær. Men, framleis drypp
Det om natta gull frå dine auge.
Frøya, od skal do finna når alt er forbi
Då skal do bli sluppen fri.
Inntil den dag finn do inga trøyst.
Sjøl ikkje I glitrande Brisinghamen.
English translate: Brisinghamen
In solitude she cries, the most beautiful of them all
Captured and locked in a sorrow no one can conceive
Joy vanished far out there
Burning desire, but no hope
She longs for home, bu tcan not find a way
A dismal destiny hidden behind a smile
Mardol, you glorious, sacrificed for peace you were
You sold your flesh, but found no comfort
That which glitters does not bring you peace
Gern you devoted yourself
And consumed many desire.
But, still in the night,
Gold is dripping from your eyes.
Frõya, Od you shall find when everything ends
Then you shall be set free
Until that day you shall find no comfort
Not even in the shining Brisinghamen

Activate the aggression that exposes the
Hidden,
Denying the existance pf praying to
Illusions
Seek gnosis in the forbidden
Drink from the wates of knowledge
And see what lies you breathe

Absorb the vital spark of deities false
And ressurect the true gods
To whom strength and wisdom is the key
And not the lectures of folly
Annoint your sould with pleasure
Apposed to mummifications through impotence

The truth is unconscious, asleep
Waiting to be summoned, to be worshipped
A neglected phallos, banished from thought
A weapon overseen by the creator
But cherished by those of the path
Unlock the beast
Transform

Can you feel the Hellfire's beat raging under your feets?

Transform into someone else
Are you of the kind
Who's got a face on each side
A split personality
Whose only truth is lie
You might have been - where I've been
You might have seen - just what I've seen
But you didn't go where I went
You were just put off the scent
What would it take for you to realize
That you're following a fool
You think you're a part of something
But you are merely a tool

No black magician telling me to get my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door and my mind has been released

Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life with no people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And I can't seem to eliminate them

People riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe

So believe what I tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind

Entombed,"I'm a son of a bitch ready to stitch
You muthers not ready to rock
I've shed all my tears & ain't got no fears
& they key to my heart bears no lock

Hell has granted me three wishes
Life - Death - Immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
Fuck your blessed trinity

Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out

I'm a bastard & brave I'm nobodies slave
I'm telling you once & for all
Breaking the laws coz I know the score
Waiting on nobodies call

Hell has granted me three wishes
Life - Death - Immortality
I will ride the wings of darkness
Fuck your blessed trinity

Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out
Coz I'm bursting - I'm bursting out

Let's burst right out of here
""Let's go""

Entombed,"Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it end
Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight

Flowers growing on a hill, dragonflies and daffodils
Learn from us very much, look at us but do not touch
Phaedra is my name

Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it end
Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight

Flowers are the things we know, secrets are the things we grow
Learn from us very much, look at us but do not touch
Phaedra is my name

Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight
Flowers growing on a hill
I'm gonna open up your gate

Look at us but do not touch
And how she made it end",Some Velvet Morning
Entombed,"Something I learnt today, 
Black & white is always grey, 
Looking through the window pane, 
I'm not inside your brain. 
Something I learnt today, 
Yield to the right-of-way, 
Stopping at the 4 way sign, 
Someone else's rules not mine. 
Something I learnt today, 
Never look straight in the sun's rays, 
Letting all the sunshine in, 
Can't remember where I've been.",Something I Learnt Today
Entombed,"Money, greed and constant fear
The smell of death is everywhere
Got you frozen in your track
And rolling over on your back

You know me, devil inside
You know me godless and wild
You know me, to each his own
But they just won't leave you alone

Sons of the morning
Princes of the world
Black angels of the herd
Part of the system
No way we ain't
We are serpent saints

The little bit of you that got away

Reason lasts but for a while
Kill like it's going out of style
And with a price upon her head
Your mother starts to kook like bread

Sons of the morning
Princes of the world
Black angels of the herd
Part of the system
No way we ain't
We are serpent saints

Redeem the lost tribes
I was buried alive
In the age of disgrace
Waiting to be saved
With lies in the blood
You will never see the day
Rise from the grave
You serpent saints

I'm the bit of you that got away

With the world at your feet
Control alternate delete
And when it's time to thin the herd
Make ten amendments to the word

Sons of the morning
Goddess absurd
Black angels of the herd
Part of the system
Hell no we ain't
We are serpent saints
Sons of the morning
Gods of the worm
Black angels of the herd
Part of the system
Hell no we ain't
We are serpent saints

Living and dying
We are serpent saints
Cheating and lying
We are serpent saints
Killing and crying
We are serpent saints
There's no denying
We are serpent saints

Entrain,"Mama said to Jolene that boy's from out of town
And I forbid you to see him especially when I'm around.
But sneak yes she will
Right outside her front door.

But Mama hears her voice
And screams out to the porch...
Are you talkin' to someone out there, Jolene?
No! I'm just singin'
Are you talkin' to someone out there, Jolene?

It's 10:45 she's at work the next day.
There's no time for a break
But she takes one anyway.
She decides to call her boyfriend

But when she makes the call
Her boss overhears her
And screams through the door...
Are you talkin' to someone out there, Jolene?

No! I'm just singin''
Are you talkin'' to someone out there, Jolene?
Then one day she marries Willie May
And it seems like all her troubles gone away... Today.

Jolene gets a call and receives some bad news.
She sneaks into the kitchen
'Cause her husband will hit the roof.
The kids are in trouble raisin' hell at school.

Then Willie gets suspicious and screams out
What are you doin'!?!
Are you talkin' to someone out there, Jolene?
No! I'm just singin'

Are you talkin' to someone out there, Jolene?

Entrance,"Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
And leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low as low can be
And if I had a nickel I'd find a game
And if I won a dollar I'd make it rain
And if it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry
And lay me down dissatisfied
It's legs to walk and thoughts to fly
Eyes to laugh and lips to cry
A restless tongue to classify
All born to grow and grown to die
So tell my baby I said so long
Tell my mother I did no wrong
Tell my brother to watch his own
And tell my friends to mourn me none
I'm chained upon the face of time
Feeling full of foolish rhyme
There ain't no dark till something shines
I'm bound to leave the dark behind
Ride the blue wind high and free
She'll lead you down through misery
And leave you low, come time to go
Alone and low as low can be",Rex's Blues
Entre Ríos,"Son altas horas
Y vuelvo a bajar
Tantas cosas
Vuelven a empezar

Tu alma, viste temprano
Mi cuerpo, has despertado

Y aún, ni toda oscuridad me detendrá
Yo solo seguiré tu voluntad
Espero, que alumbres, quiero que me des la luz
Tan sólo quiero verte una vez más",Altas Horas

Pero no sé como empezar

Digamos nada para actuar

Camino hacia vos",Claro Que Sí
