Kellie Pickler,"I gotta keep moving 
Nothin's gonna slow me down
I'm countin' on these restless wheels
To get me back to my hometown
I gotta keep moving
I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm doing everything I can
I'm getting back from where I've been

I, I can't wait to see you
Workin' on that pickup truck
All covered in oil and dust
I, I can't wait to be with you
Finally just the two of us
In our old jeans and our hair messed up
I can't wait to see you

I gotta keep moving
With the white lines on the highway
Watchin' every mile go by
The silos and the by-ways
Gotta keep moving
'Cause it's been way too long
I know I'm getting closer now
I'm finally gonna make it home

I, I can't wait to see you
Workin' on that pickup truck
All covered in oil and dust
I, I can't wait to be with you
Finally just the two of us
In our old jeans and our hair messed up
I can't wait to see you

Pretty soon we'll be slow dancing, yeah
You and I, on our own babe

I, I can't wait to see you
Workin' on that pickup truck
All covered in oil and dust
I, I can't wait to be with you
Finally just the two of us
In our old jeans and our hair messed up
I can't wait to see you",Gotta Keep Moving
Kellie Pickler,"Sometimes I think about you
Wonder if you're out there somewhere thinkin' 'bout me
And would you even recognize
The woman that your little girl has grown up to be
Cause I look in the mirror and all I see
Are your brown eyes lookin' back at me
They're the only thing you ever gave to me at all

Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny sky as far as I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me

I think about how it ain't fair
That you weren't there to braid my hair like mothers do
You weren't around to cheer me on
Help me dress for my high school prom like mothers do
Did you think I didn't need you here to hold my hand, to dry my tears?
Did you even miss me through the years at all?

Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny sky as far as I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me

Forgiveness is such a simple word
But it's so hard to do
When you've been hurt

Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
And just in case you're wonderin' about me
From now on I won't be in Carolina
Your little girl is off
Your little girl is off
Your little girl is off to Tennessee",I Wonder
Kellie Pickler,"I've felt the power of forgiveness
I know that life can let you down
I'm not blind
No, I don't need a witness
To tell me there's angels all around

My eyes have seen more than they want to
My heart has scars that run so deep
There's tears that I've had to let go
And there's dreams I told myself I'd keep

Now I don't give up easy
I have many miles to go
But I can't wait to get to
What I see down this road
And all my life I've learned to
Just take it day by day
I'm not there yet
But I know I'm on my way

I've looked out the window
When there's no hope in sight
But I swear I heard a whisper
Said it would be worth the fight

So I woke up one morning
And I put my fears aside
Now look how far I've come
From the back of an endless line

Now I don't give up easy
I have many miles to go
But I can't wait to get to
What I see down this road
And all my life I've learned to
Just take it day by day
I'm not there yet
But I know I'm on my way

I still got lessons to be learned
There's a choice at every turn
Someone out there cleared a path
And there's no turnin' back

And all my life I've learned to
Just take it day by day
I'm not there yet
But I know I'm on my way
I'm not there yet
But I know I'm on my way
Baby, I'm on my way
On my way",I'm on My Way
Kellie Pickler,"Every day when school got out
I'd get off the bus and I'd run down
That old dirt road where you were waiting for me
On the front porch in that blue swing
You'd be smiling and we would sing
Amazing Grace and Jesus Loves Me

You were like my mother
You were my best friend
You were everything I want to be
And all the good inside of me
There's never been
Never been another
That loved me like you did
My grandmother, my angel

Even though I can't touch your face
I feel you with me every day
I wish you could see all my dreams coming true
When I get lost I close my eyes
And I feel you shining down so bright
I feel you shining down on me

You were like my mother
You were my best friend
You were everything I want to be
And all the good inside of me
There's never been
Never been another
That loved me like you did
My grandmother, my angel

You were like my mother
You were my best friend
You were everything I want to be
And all the good inside of me
There's never been
Never been another
That loved me like you did
My grandmother, my angel

My angel",My Angel
Kellie Pickler,"Every single day it's the same old thing
Wake up every morning do the same routine
Paint my nails and get my hair to curl
Lord it's hard being a girl
I love getting all dressed up to the nines
But sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys

[Chorus]
Something bout old blue jeans and a baseball cap
Fellas I get it and I admit it
It just don't get any better than that
Chicken wings, NASCAR, and football Monday nights
Sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys

I like to put my hair up in a ponytail
Climb up in a pickup and just raise some hell
Have a four-wheeling mud bogging real good time
Then go home and play poker all night long
I still love chick flicks a real good cry
But sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys

[Chorus: x2]

Sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys",One of the Guys
Kellie Pickler,"Baby, I've got plans tonight
You don't know nothin' about
I've been sitting around way too long
Trying to figure you out
But you say that you'll call, and you don't
And I'm spinning my wheels
So I'm going out tonight
In my red high heels

I'm gonna call up that old boyfriend
Who says he has it bad for me
I'm gonna take him into town
Flaunt him around for everyone to see
Well you said so yourself
Yeah, you know the deal
Nobody holds a candle to me
In my red high heels

Well, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I'll bet you want me back now, don't you, don't you?
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels

All those games you tried to play
Well, they ain't gonna work on me now
I put up a barbed wire fence
Around my heart
Baby, just to keep you out
Well, you thought I'd wait around forever
But, baby, get real
I just kicked you to the curb
In my red high heels

Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I'll bet you want me back now, don't you, don't you?
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels

Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I'll bet you want me back now, don't you, don't you?
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels

Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to

Kellie Pickler,"I grew up where I could see the stars
Drinking sweet tea from a Mason jar
Dogwood trees like leaves through the pine
People on the porch watching fireflies
And driving 'round the Wal-Mart on a Friday night

I'm just a small town girl
And that's all I'll ever be
I'm just a small town girl
Hey, that's alright with me

I'd rather be fishin' with grandpa on the lake
Then getting all glammed up,
Fake eyelashes on my face
Cut off jeans and an old ball cap
A town so small you don't need a map
That's where I'm from and there ain't no changing me

I'm just a small town girl
And that's all I'll ever be
I'm just a small town girl
Hey, that's alright with me

I'd rather ride in a Chevy truck than a Ferrari
Give me a cheeseburger
I ain't eating no calamari

I'm just a small town girl
And that's all I'll ever be
I'm just a small town girl
Hey, that's alright with me

Coca-cola and apple pie
Dirt roads and old clothes lines
Familiar faces and dandelion bracelets
You never meet a stranger
And everybody helps out
Soft green grass, Sunday school and wild flowers
Driving [Repeat: x3]
Driving around

I'm just a small town girl [Repeat: x4]",Small Town Girl
Kellie Pickler,"I need to go shopping
These shoes are all wrong
Just look in my closet
Not a thing to put on
I wonder how these jeans make me look from behind
Things that never cross a man's mind

Lets turn off the TV
Now can't we just talk
Lets lay here and cuddle
'Til we both drift off
If we don't make love
That'll be just fine
Things that never cross a man's mind

That joke is too dirty
This steak is too thick
Ain't no way in the world I'll ever finish it
That car is too fast
This beer is too cold
And watchin' all this football is sure getting old
Wish I was workin' this weekend
Not on the lake reelin' my line
Things that never cross a man's mind

Here lips are too red
Her skirt is too tight
Her legs are too long
And her heels are too high
Boy, she looks like the marryin' kind
Things that never cross a man's mind

That joke is too dirty
This steak is too thick
Ain't no way in the world I'll ever finish it
That car is too fast
This beer is too cold
And watchin' all this football is sure getting old
Wish I was workin' this weekend
Not on the lake reelin' my line
Things that never cross a man's mind

I feel a little bloated
I think I'm fixin' to starve
That movie was good except for the violent parts
Brad Pitt is sexy
Why did he change his hair
I knew him and Jenny never had a prayer
These curtains clash with the carpet
The color scheme is a crime

Things that never cross a man's mind",Things That Never Cross a Man's Mind
Kellie Pickler,"She was a beautiful girl
She was wild as the wind
On top of the world
Til she fell in love with him
Everyone told her that he was bad news
A boy going nowhere ain't no good for you

Cause wild ponies are born to run
Don't you know wild ponies
Don't belong to no one
So baby, run
Run
Run away

The first time he hit her
Was right after church
He said he was sorry
But it only got worse
Now she's not the same girl
That she used to be
He's breaking her spirit
He's fencing her dreams

Cause wild ponies are born to run
Don't you know wild ponies
Don't belong to no one
So baby, run
Run
Run away

She went out for groceries
Just an ordinary day
She realized she was just a block from the interstate
She sat at the stop light
The wheel in her hands
And when the light changed
She knew this was her chance

Cause wild ponies are born to run
Don't you know wild ponies
Don't belong to no one
So baby, run
Run
Run away",Wild Ponies
Kellie Pickler,"Ain't no rain as cold as the look she just gave him
Everyone around us knows a storm has just rolled in
I'll call for the check now baby, you go get the car
They'll stay here and fight it out, yeah they'll close down this bar

We'll go home and lay down safe in the arms of love
And we'll dance all night long on the edge of can't get enough
And we'll wake up in the morning like we always do
Drunk on the beautiful truth
We got love a hundred proof

She's gonna tell me that he can't help but get messed up
And he's gonna hang on you and say this night's just getting fun
They'll order another round now and try to make us stay
But you gotta know when to say when it's time to walk away

We'll go home and lay down safe in the arms of love
And we'll dance all night long on the edge of can't get enough
And we'll wake up in the morning like we always do
Drunk on the beautiful truth

Yes baby, I'm addicted to your touch
I'm still hung over from the last time we made love like this
Ain't in no shot glass, no bottle baby, no

We'll go home and lay down safe in the arms of love
We'll dance all night long on the edge of can't get enough
And we'll wake up in the morning like we always do
Drunk on the beautiful truth
So drunk on the beautiful truth
'Cause we got love a hundred proof",100 Proof
Kellie Pickler,"The bottle took you from me
When I was a child
Robbed me of the love I needed
Robbed me of a smile
I prayed the same prayer every night
Especially for you
After all
That's what little girls do

It didn't happen in an instant
It happened in God's time
You've finally gotten sober
And found some peace of mind
Yeah you faced all your demons
And they finally set you free
With your back to the bottle
You're finally facing me

And Dad I want to tell you that
I'm proud of you for never giving up on us
Even in your darkest hour I could still
Feel the power of your love for us
And I know that we'll make up for lost time
As we walk through this world
I love you Daddy
Always, your baby girl",The Letter (To Daddy)
Kellie Pickler,"I'm through that pity party stage
The healing's finally come of age, 
No more feeling sorry for me days, 
I'm over you

When I think of us I don't get upset
I'm together as I think I'll ever get
Losing you I've come to accept
I'm over you

It's never easy when love comes to an end
Just when you think you're off the hook you fall back in
But I'll be okay, I'll go my way, we can still be friends
I'll be alright, long as I never see you again
No more tears in these hazel eyes
No more drinkin' down at nights
I'm no good and well I've tried
More than I can say for you

And yes I've heard that you've moved on
I'm okay not bein' what you want
I'm fine with sleepin' all alone
More than I can say for you

It's never easy when love comes to an end
Just when you think you're off the hook you fall back in

Kellie Pickler,"I try to sleep as long as I can
I pull the covers over my head
I pray that there's some way
That life could skip a day to Monday

I try to count my blessings
It's a long, long list
For a girl who has so much
There's so much that I miss on days like this

I wish I could go to town, buy you a card
That says ""I love you"" inside a heart
And one that makes you laugh
Pick you flowers from our yard
You can set 'em in the window in a mason jar
Dad will take our photograph
One two three
Smile, say cheese
Oh I wish it could be that way
Every mother's day

Maybe someday I will let go
But right now I'm still hanging on
Maybe one day God will bless me
With a daughter of my own
I'll have love I've never known

She could go to town, buy me a card

Kellie Pickler,"I've been sitting watching our love grow you know
It doesn't seem like it was long ago
When you carved our names in these old chairs of oak
Soakin' up Heaven, countin' all the stars
Talkin' 'bout babies how the future ain't so far
I hope they have your brown eyes and forever loving heart

Don't stop rockin' with me baby
Without you it wouldn't be the same
Don't stop rockin' with me baby rockaway
Just rockaway

The lights like an ocean off of our front porch
Movin' like waves swayin' back and forth
Right now babe I swear I couldn't love you anymore
So

Don't stop rockin' with me baby
Without you it wouldn't be the same
Don't stop rockin' with me baby rockaway
Just rockaway

I whisper this rockin' chair prayer of the night
If yours is ever empty let mine not be far behind

Don't stop rockin' with me baby
Without you it wouldn't be the same

Kellie Pickler,"Baby, we used to have something special
But lately you’ve been ignoring all the rules
Well, you think that I don’t know what you’re doing
You’ve been running around making me a fool

It ain’t that hard to do
Stop cheatin’ on me or I’ll start cheatin’ on you

Kellie Pickler,"I wanted lace, I wanted pearls
To be a princess like the other girls
But life came hard to my front door
And I grew up tryin' to even up the score

Tough; I ain't never been nothin' but tough
All my edges have always been rough
But Jesus loves me anyway; oh backbone,
There ain't nothin' wrong with a woman that got a little backbone
You just wait 'till you taste her kind of love

You want a shy little thing
A pretty little high-heeled thing
Gonna cry if I don't polish up

The way I see it, the hand of Fate
Did me a favor, with the cards he dealt my way
Found out real fast life is a game

You're fifteen and you're about to bloom just like a rose

And I know you want to be just like your friends
But he'll still love you if you don't give in
But if those girls were being honest that have been where you're at
I' bet they' tell you they wish they had their innocence back

Don't you know you're beautiful
Don't you know you're beautiful

Said ooh, she fell in love

[Chorus]
What is the feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open my door
Surprise, It's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No more the need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Miss guarded heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you want to use that line you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't want to end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside she felt a connection
She fell in love.

[Chorus]

When Miss Independence walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of why can't that be me
I'm so glad I finally see

Kelly Clarkson,"Anytime you feel
Like you just can't hold on
Just hold on to my love
I'll help you be strong

But you're so afraid to lose
And baby I can't reach your heart
I can't face this world it's keeping us apart
And I could be the one to show you
Everything you missed before
Just hold on now
'Cause I could be the one to give you more

Anytime you need a love baby I'm on your side
Just let me be the one that can make it all right
Anytime you need a love baby you're in my heart
I could make it all right

I look into your eyes
And I feel it coming through
I can't help but want you more than I want to
So baby take our love your way
Cast them all on me
That's all I ever wanted was just to make you see

But I could be the one to heal you
All that you've been searching for
Just hold on to my love
And baby let me give you more

Anytime you need a love baby I'm on your side
Just let me be the one that can make it all right
Anytime you need a love baby you're in my heart
I could make it all right

Now there's no way out
And I can't help the way I feel
'Cause baby I'm on fire
And I'll be waiting right here
You know our love isn't real

Anytime you need a love baby I'm on your side
Just let me be the one that can make it all right
Anytime you need a love baby you're in my heart
I could make it all right",Anytime

An exquisite extreme I know
He's as damned as he seems
And more heaven than a heart could hold

And if I try to save him
My whole world could cave in

Oh and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's magic and myth
As strong as what I believe

More damage than a soul should see
And do I try to change him
So hard not to blame him

Oh and I don't know
I don't know what he's after

And if I could hold on

But he's only happy hysterical
I'm waiting for some kind of miracle
Waited so long
So long

He's soft to the touch
But frayed at the ends he breaks
He's never enough
And still he's more than I can take

How did I settle for the world in shades of gray
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same
And you don't know why
And I looked into your eyes
Where the road stretched out in front of me
And I realized

I'd never live
Before your love
I'd never felt
Before your touch
I never needed anyone
To make me feel alive
But then again,
I wasn't really livin'

I'd never lived
Before your love

I wanted more than just an ordinaray life
All of my dreams, seemed like castles in the sky
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands
And I don't know how
I'd survive without your kiss
'Cause you've given me
A reason to exist

I think I'm gonna break down soon

Suddenly I looked up
You were my sky
So go on and
Sleep darling
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It doesn't matter anyway
I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train

Be quiet angel, don't make a sound
Save it for a rainy day
Oh can't you see me, I'm such a mess
trying hard to find my way

Do you remember, wasting all that time, we were feeling fine
Though we couldn't walk a line
We were alright

So go on and

By why'd you have to go
And make a mess like that
Well I just have to say before I let go

Have you ever been low
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know
Were you left out in the cold
'Cause what you did was low

No I don't need your number
There's nothing left to say
'Cept I never thought it'd

I walk out of this darkness
With no sense of regret
And I go with a clear conscience
We both know that you can't say that
This to show for all the time I loved you so

To come in the night
And shine some sweet light on me

Just when I'd given up, you gave me love

Came and just lifted me up
Look what you've done baby

Can't deny the joy it brings
A dozen roses, diamond rings
Dreams for sale and fairy tales
It'll make you hear a symphony
And you just want the world to see
But like a drug that makes you blind
It'll fool ya every time

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Now I was once a fool it's true
I played the game by all the rules
But now my world's a deeper blue
I'm sadder but I'm wiser too
I swore I'd never love again
I swore my heart would never mend
Said love wasn't worth the pain
But then I hear it call my name

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie
It's stronger than your pride
The trouble with love is
It doesn't care how fast you fall
And you can't refuse the call
See you've got no say at all

Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keeps callin'
And I keep on fallin'
Over and over again
The sad story always ends the same
Me standin' in the pourin' rain
It seems no matter what I do
It tears my heart in two

The trouble with love is
It can tear you up inside
Make your heart believe a lie

Can't you find another shoulder, cause I

Find someone else to rain on

And look who's laughing now

Against one another but it won't work

And I know exactly where the blame falls

You, you try to deny all your actions
For once in your life be a real man
At least give me the proper respect of the truth
I already know you did it

Why should I believe anything you say
And how could you treat me that way
Where'd you get the nerve to even think that you 
You could play me boy

Now I see right through you baby
You try to tell me you want me 
Can't you just get it through your thick head

Woke up wide awake
In an empty bed
Staring at an empty room
I have myself to blame
For the state I'm in today
And now dying
Doesn't seem so cruel

And I don't know anyway

I hate myself for losing you
I'm seeing it all so clear
I hate myself for losing you
What do you do when you look in the mirror
And staring at you is why he's not here?

You got what you deserved
Hope you're happy now
'Cause everytime I think of her with you
It's killing me
Inside, and
Now I dread each day
Knowing that I can't be saved
From the loneliness
Of living without you
And, oh
I don't know what to do
Not sure that I'll pull through
I wish you knew

I hate myself for losing you

Is the reason why he left you in the end?
How do you cry when every tear you shed
Won't ever bring him back again?

But we're falling from grace
I'll gladly climb your walls if you'll meet me halfway

Why do we run, we're missing so much babe
Just lay in my arms for a while

Yeah I'm gonna try to give you every little part of me
Every single detail you missed with your eyes
Then maybe
Maybe, yeah maybe
Yeah maybe
Maybe, yeah maybe, maybe

One day
We'll meet again and you'll need me, you'll see me completely
Every little bit
Oh yeah maybe you'll love me, you'll love me then

I don't want to be tough
And I don't want to be proud
I don't need to be fixed and I certainly don't need to be found
I'm not lost
I need to be loved
I just need to be loved
I just want to be loved by you and I won't stop 'cause I believe
That maybe, yeah maybe
Maybe, yeah maybe
Maybe, maybe

I should know better than to touch the fire twice
But I'm thinking maybe, yeah maybe you might

Maybe, love maybe",Maybe
Kelly Clarkson,"I hope the ring you gave to her
Turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her
You think of me
I would never wish bad things
But I don't wish you well
Could you tell
By the flames that burned your words
I never read your letter
'Cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try make it all OK

Does it hurt
To know I'll never be there
But it sucks
To see my face everywhere
It was you
Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew
Exactly what you would do
And don't say
You simply lost your way
She may believe you
But I never will
Never again

If she really knows the truth
She deserves you
A trophy wife, oh, how cute
Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes
And he's through with you
And he'll be through with you
You'll die together, but alone
You wrote me in a letter
You couldn't say it right to my face
Well, give me that Sunday school answer
Repent yourself away

Does it hurt
To know I'll never be there
But it sucks
To see my face everywhere
It was you
Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew
Exactly what you would do
And don't say
You simply lost your way
She may believe you
But I never will

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you

Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you

Running on empty
You can't make up your mind
You try to hide it
But you had to say it
Restless all this time
So completely drained from everything that's in your life
It's so wrong but you had to scream every thought you kept inside

One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back
And you love
And you hate
And you wait
'Cause one minute goes fast

You just can't escape it
You're losing patience
You wonder what went wrong
Everything changes
Happy then jaded
Always a different song
Playin' in your head just when you think you got it down
Out of nowhere you realize it's different music playing now

One minute you laugh
The next minute you're slowly sinking into something black
I get the feeling that lately nothing ever really lasts
I keep trying to get up but I keep falling back
And you love
And you hate
And you wait

One minute goes fast

This could break my heart or save me
Nothing's real
Until you let go completely
So here I go with all my thoughts I've been saving
So here I go with all my fears weighing on me

Three months and I'm still sober
Picked all my weeds but kept the flowers
But I know it's never really over

I don't know
I could crash and burn but maybe
At the end of this road I might catch a glimpse of me
So I won't worry about my timing I wanna get it right
No comparing
Second guessing
No, not this time

Three months and I'm still breathing
Been a long road since those hands I left my tears in but I know
It's never really over, no

Three months and I'm getting better yeah

Three months and it's still harder now
Three months I've been living here without you now

It's time you let me know let me know just let go

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was a simple way to get over you
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene
Where every lie reveals the truth
Baby cause all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was you

I'd rather walk alone
Don't wanna chase you around
Every day every day every minute I'd fall a thousand times
For I let you drag me down
Every day every day hey hey
Your new beginning was a perfect ending
But I keep feeling we've already been here before
It's time you let me know let me know just let go

Tell me with so many out there
Why I always turn to you
Your goodbyes tear me down every time
And it's so easy to see that the blame is on me

The last time you kissed me
You kept both eyes open

Then you don't need to be with me

You didn't let me down,
You didn't tear me apart
You just opened my eyes,
While breaking my heart
You didn't do it for me
I'm not as dumb as you think, you just made me cry
While claiming that you love me
You love me, you love me
You said you loved me but that I
I'm not good enough, I'm not good enough

Your love feels different it's like a blow to the head with your compliments.
Your love hurts deeper
It's like a brick in the sea and I'm drowning with it

You didn't let me down,

That time of year to be with the ones you love, oh

Then will you tell me, you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you a home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain
'Cause I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again

Oh then will you tell me, you'll never more, you'll never more roam

Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing ""Alleluia""!

Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace

Kelly Clarkson,"You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carols sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight

I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday alone to celebrate
But then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carols sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

I found, what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carols sing

Warm, fuzzies, frozen toes

Understand better the weight of the cross

Back down to the river bottom lined with pocket worry stones

Sitting by the rocking chair waiting for the world

Oh, if I could roll back all the years and talk to my daddy's dad
About all the fears I'm leaving in that maybe he had had
I might get some light to shine down this dusty old dry well
Hear the bucket hit the bottom and the rope come rolling by

When three hundred years has been the time from whence it came
Why hadn't someone yet figured out to lower down the gun
And shoot out the middle of this clawing, staring eye?

Out the top of my red wing kickers and down a muddy slippery grade
To the fever pitch Savannah where granddaddy lay

Kelly Joe Phelps,"Bourbon soda over ice, in the basement shade
Got it made, no one here, just the beer man's dog
Howling at the moon heat gnawing on a bone
Waiting for Marty to get home.

Marty's in the bath house yanking out the gray
Getting older ain't a party it's a good damn play
No wonder dogs howl. they can see the rider coming
Waiting for Marty to get home.

Used to be a girl then a woman then nothing
The quilt is in the corner by the oak console
The phone rings once a day just like a daughter
Waiting for Marty to get home.

Blend in with the city and the watering hole
Doesn't talk he wants to think but he can't anymore
The basement game is over. there's food left in the fridge
Waiting for Marty to get home.

The milk man doesn't stop here and the bone is chewed to bits
Stack of mail and old newspapers in the overgown yard
The light bulb on the back porch takes it's last breath
Waiting for Marty to get home.",Waiting for Marty
Kelly Joe Phelps,"CHORUS: 
I am the Light of the World
You people come and follow me.
If you follow and love, You'll learn the mystery
Of what you were meant to do and be.


1. When the song of the angels is stilled.
When the star in the sky is gone.
When the kings and the shepherds have found their way home.
The work of Christmas is begun!


2. To find the lost and lonely one,
To heal that broken soul with love,
To feed the hungry children with warmth and good food,
To feel the earth below the sky above!


3. To free the prisoner from his chains,
To make the powerful care,
To rebuild the nations with strength and goodwill,
To call a man your brother everywhere.


4. To bring hope to every task you do,
To dance at a baby's new birth,
To make music in an old man's heart,
And sing to the colors of the earth!
",I Am the Light of the World
Kelly Joe Phelps,"There are some that blindly and happily plow
While the tractor screams ""feed me some oil""
The scraping of gears and the gnashing of teeth fall softly on full ahead ears
A frown may give away something right
A smile can hide crooked affairs
Sun on the back rings a workman's guffaw
It's all in the bag with the coins

Call me tomorrow, come over here
See if we can figure this out
There in an eye winking curiously
By the campground, the bedside nightstand
My leg bones feel weary yet walk on they will
Holding for wheels and gravy on a plate full of nothing but shaking my head, 
With a side bowl of nothing to do

Could be a time thing, could be a ruse
I will concede to confusion
Ideas spin 'round my crazy old head
Hard as (and light as) an anvil
The liver will wither and wax with the tide
Fine, if I can find the answer 
To a question I've never been asked before
I hear time and time again",The Anvil
Kelly Joe Phelps,"Ten steps weaving to the bottom, to the floor
I've taken eleven, broken the door
Twelve step I don't wanna think like that
I will change my coat, pull down my hat
And pray
And holler
Don't let it fade
Clear eyes and clean hands
A good man

Circle, go down delusion drive
Nine tail cross-eyed two foot slide
Spit the joy from the joyous green
Find an old fence that I can lean against
And pray
And holler
Don't let it fade
Clear eyes and clean hands
A good man

Rocket ship ricochet off the wall
Short little guy in a great big fall
How long is too late to lock it right
So I can ease on in to an easy night
And pray
And holler
Don't let it fade
Clear eyes and clean hands
A good man

Now there's blue water in a shiny cup
I will drink it down, fill it up
Too much of losing would be here or gone
Need to comb my hair and walk up home
And pray
And holler
Don't let it fade
Clear eyes and clean hands
A good man",Big Shaky
Kelly Joe Phelps,"Come along to the riverside. Sit down now
I just want to hear somebody else whine
If you've got tomorrow, I've got a blade
We can dig a hole into an old book
Keep our secrets there

I know of another place beneath some overgrown vine. 
I can cut them back and help you down
There I'll listen to every song you know
I'll clap when you are through
And maybe then I will kiss you

I've been waiting for a long time to get these stories out. 
Tell me yours and I will tell you mine
Spin them sideways, over ground, tie a rope around my shoulder. 
Tend to aching in the morning

Come along to the riverside. Lay down now
We can hold or not say all at all. 
We'll jump out the crow's nest, heave ashore, wave the might skull and crossbones
Up that hill and back down",Crow's Nest
Kelly Joe Phelps,"Play again, oh
Tap on the board
I could use a song here, now
Word unheard, none ever burned
A room to set me in

Sing again, oh
Throw another tale
Walking out across our ground
It's cold behind this cabin door
That high tone light it right

Stomp down, oh
Show them your hands
Hit 'em with that old, steel gun.
I believe that song will breathe
Underneath this cabin floor

Sweet lullaby
Somewhere ago
Daughter, the glory of the world
A single line of a tangled weave
From me to her to you

Feel it, there
In every other hand
Every other john pole child
You know, you drew a tight bow string
And shot that arrow gone",Handful of Arrows
Kelly Joe Phelps,"Old dark ruby coats his throat
Gloves a feathered mind
Sharpens up her fountain pen
Lays ink down along the table
Plaintive, brickyard textbook line
Whips her fable down
As long as she is able

Bang up, wave the weaver's wand
Hand against the sky
Day is rain so watch things grow
Light pours through her window
Tack will need a hefty breeze
Blow as though can be
As long as she is able

Here's a loud that turns to wail
Salvage bits of wire
Holding history blown to hell
He'll nod off and she will sing
He won't dream while she won't sew
Talking never stops
Not as long as she is able

The next day holds a smell to it
Permeates the house
Marches into each cold room
Stands as long as Sunday
Preaches loud as elder ears
Years they'll rectify
As long as they're able",Loud as Ears
Kelly Joe Phelps,"Let a wind mill blow
I want to feel the wave beat hard against me
Let a wind mill blow
This dust out of my head

Let a steeple ring
I want to hear the sound that's not me thinking
Let a steeple ring
This dirt out of my bed

[Chorus]
Strap on, shake it for a hoedown
Beat down on a wooden drum
Laugh hard till hard is gone
And that old trouble run

Let a baby yell
Simple thing like a nail in a driveway
Let a baby yell
This dust out of my head

Give an old man grumble
Wave the tag and bag the coat back
Give an old man grumble
Sweep the dark away

Lay a high boot heel
Swing that skirt from knee to elbow
Lay a high boot heel
And walk away

""God Bless You"" signs on a street corner lamp post
Maybe a vet of his own alley way
An ""Ain't drunk yet wanna be"" shallow song
Ain't drunk yet wanna be

Bits of rubber hanging by a needle
Thread between childhood and where this is now
How does one wither or whittle down a tree
For blossoms that try to bear right circumstance
Blossoms that try to bear

So, it's good out there? Better than some
Folks keep trying to bring back that summer
That turned an un-returnable smile
Shoe string in the nether wind
Fish bite on a silver hook
Soft step in the stairwell that sounds like Dad

Hungry, it is, tired and old
30 or 80 years, ticket the same
The game stays the right of the passing in time
Surrogate rhyme lingers tip o' the tongue
Surrogate rhyme lingers

Kelly Joe Phelps,"She's a gentle bell, she's a cat eye
A gold breath on a wire
A sing soft sail in the other room
A red hot cleansing fire
My cold feet warm in a straight line
Dancing Spanish Hands
My heart retires far early
Away these foreign lands

She's a yellow girl, she's a sunflower
A thin wind well mind lead
A glass like sea for miles and miles
A book to love to read
Long haul rolling on the shadow side
Regardless where I stand
My heart retires far early
Away these foreign lands

Mark these days that constant fade
That wilt among the wars
The big ones we all suffer from
The small ones, mine of yours
I'll throw no coin on grand design
I cannot understand
My heart retires far early
Away these foreign lands

Let kind words surround her mind
Give her sorrow flight
Give the new eyed sleep of babes
Then let her softly rise
To see the morning brush the blinds
Behind no greater plan
My heart retires far early
Away these foreign lands",Spanish Hands
Kelly Joe Phelps,"It's a ditch, okay, I have shoes and a blanket
My head resting light on a stone
Though it's hard it's still rounded with a pocket for 
Brains or what goes for in halls under roof tile
We'll sing another blistering ballad for grandma
Melody sweet till it rolls out the ear
And the beer flows free as advice
With a tight hand holding the jar

The mud cakes my chin strap, fills up my cuffs
As I plod, now, from creek edge to street side
As it dries I can whittle it little by little
""Hey, look, now I'm light as a bee""
Those gray clouds mean nothing to one such as I
Though shadows stand tall as some school master whack 
On the back of a well intentioned quiet kid
Arms held fast to the jar

And it's slow, so slow the idea
The coming around of a sensible word
It hovers and shakes like a hummingbird wing
At the end of a long hot year

Fry up that supper, we'll kill it for breakfast
Turn the table down side and crazy
With the legs up, the women up, the men up to Church for the spirit, 
The hen yard, the bent steel Tack wrap
It's a ditch, yeah, I know that. And, I do wonder
How that bright faced, ten year old me of a boy
Found the road out I never could see
With my eyes held tight to the jar",Tight to the Jar
Kelly Jones,"Emily worked at the diamond store
She wanted all the rings that she couldn't afford
One long day a tall man came
Asked her to marry him and he bought her a ring

He whisked her off to the seven seas
Wined and dined her till she could barely see
One long night the tall man came home
To find Emily in bed with the hotel boy

Oh Emily, what have you done?
It's all come undone
Tell me who lost and who won

Caught in bed with another man's girl
Not just screwing, they were kissing as they moaned
One long knife, the tall man drew
And he stuck the hotel boy cold right through

Cops came along and Emily wept
As they took away all of her fancy things
One long lie the tall man heard
So he took back the ring before they took him to jail

Oh Emily, what have you done?
It's all come undone
Tell me who lost and who won

Oh Emily, what have you done?
Tell me who lost and who won

Water drops from honey dew
Decreasing circles from stones I threw
And greasy skin shines in the sun

And you know you've been here before
Always with me, you're never alone

Kelly Love Jones,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe,

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Kelly Osbourne,"picked me up around a quarter to nine,
I was a little shocked that he was right on time.
He was really well mannered as he opened my door,
he seemed like the man I was looking for.
He took me to a fancy restaurant,
and told me to order anything I want.
I went to the bathroom and called a couple of friends,
and said: “Oh my god he's such a gentleman”
He want to have a good time,
ass I was drinking his wine.
And then I started to feel really sleepy,
and he had this creepy look in his eyes.

So don't touch me while I'm sleeping babe,
I just wake up and break your neck.
It won't be worth the costs you made,
cause this will be the date you never forget.

I woke up in the morning about half past eight,
and I couldn't remember what happened to my date.
My stomach was boozy and it didn't feel right,
I couldn't recall a single thing from last night.
My best friend Suzie called me on the phone,
and said: “Girl you really had it going on”.
If you could imagine the fucking look on my face,
When I finally realized I was a victim of date rape.
I went straight to his work and shoved his face to the wall,
”I hope you had a good time mother fucker, now it's time to say goodbye to your balls”.

So don't touch me while I'm sleeping babe,
I just wake up and break your neck.
It won't be worth the costs you made,

The moral of the story, to make myself clear,
Is that all you rapist assholes better run with fear.
I would think twice before your next date,
Cause you'll just end up someone's bitch in cellblock eight.

Look at all the things you've said and done
I can't feel sorry for you anymore
Its only fare to say that your presents I holed dear
So I'm sorry I'm still here
[Bride:]
All and night 
Only few is right
It dosen't matter who is wrong or right

[Chorus:]
So why you always think that I'm so retarded 
Standing on the edge of your atmosphere
You have everything that you ever wanted
But your life's not full and your miserable
Look at all the things you've said and done
I can't feel sorry for you anymore
Its only fare to say that your presents I holed dear
So I'm sorry I'm still here
So why you always think that I'm so restarted 
Standing on the edge of your atmosphere
You have everything that you ever wanted
But your life's not full and your miserable
Look at all the things you've said and done
I can't feel sorry for you anymore
Its only fare to say that your presents I holed dear
So I'm sorry I'm still here",Edge of Your Atmosphere
Kelly Osbourne,"Well it's a force of nature to be recognized in the various equations of the social kind.
As we look to our left and we turn to our right always taken back when the heat starts to rise, rise.

No one will tell you
Nobody will tell you

[Chorus]

It's a measure of disorder
A matter of time
We're living in entropy

Well it's random reaction that's divided by rage.
A single-handed effort in the escalade.
The static will clear as the masses evolve.
A loss of information as the message fades away, fades away.

No one will tell you
Nobody will tell you 

[Repeat chorus]

Rise
Nobody will tell you

Kelly Osbourne,"Turned the page between the lines
I could read it so clearly
And every word so defined
Turned my heart to weary
Pressed against an ear to wall
While everyone kept on racing
My eyes were closed my mind was shut
But I could feel my body pacing
I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling

I can't wait to be back home
A feeling you will never know
I can't wait to be alone
It seems like it was so long ago

All this time from day to day
The minute pass you'll be watching
I bare the pain the final frown
Constantly still knocking
Everything is so obscure
It's hard to tell but I'm reaching
The thrill is gone but after all
If looks could kill
I'm still breathing

I can't wait to be back home
A feeling you will never know
I can't wait to be alone
It seems like it was so long ago

I never knew there were stranger shades
Fading fast from night to day",I Can't Wait

Don't bother
I rather end up where i dropped off
Not making
Excuses
I guess i'm feeling uninspired
You're speaking but i just can't hear you
Who do you think is listening
You notice
I didn't
Go figure if you got a minute
You're reaching
I'm leaving
Don't say i never gave you nothin'

It's gettin' just a little creepy
The thoughts are there but nothing's sleeping
It's hard to say whats on my mind
The words are always one step behind

Waitin' on a redlight sittin' on a time bomb
Nothin' seems to go right still remaining calm
Walkin' on a tightrope emotionally amazed
A careful execution that slaps me
In the face
Waiting on a redlight
But still remaining calm

I'm fed up
So boring
Swimming in a pool of quicksand
Not making
A scene
Please insert the nervous breakdown
Take a needle stitch my mouth shut
Then apply a little make up
All the stupid things i'll say
Pressure keeps building every day

And all of my friends, Think I'm losing my mind.
I just can't believe I'm blinded by what I'd need,
It's like an empty space I need to fill the void.

When you looked in my eyes You knew I needed saving,
And when you saw me getting high Why didn't you come save me?

All of my life I've locked away my feelings,
And all of this time I've been living a lie.
I was so afraid, Pathetically misleading,
It was my empty space, a need to fill my void.

[Chorus]
When you looked in my eyes You knew I needed saving,
And when you saw me getting high Why didn't you come save me?
When I blamed you for my lies why didn't you just tell me?
Cause when I looked in my eyes, There's nothing there worth saving

Someone rescued me when I was sleeping, Somehow life went by when I was dreaming,
Someone rescued me when I was sleeping, In my dreams.

Save Me, why didn't you just save me?

Kelly Price,"This song is dedicated
To all the brothers out there
Who've ever loved a woman
Whether it was your mother

Whether it was a lover 
Or whether it was your daughter
In every woman lies a soul
And in the soul of every woman

Lies the secrets of love
And sometimes 
You don't do right by her
But the way back to her heart

Lives in that same soul
You just have to find it....

So pure, Mmmm
There through thick and thin
No shame in showing 
She is your best friend

So strong
And though you've let her down
You won't see her frown
But make it right and look inside

You will find 
She was everything your heart desired
But nevertheless, she cries
But you never cherished her
And you took for granted love

You sigh 
Remembering the times she made you smile
And knowing that down inside
She was the only one
Who'd love you forever more

[Chorus]
In her soul you'll find
The way to bring her back into your world
Grown mind
But she's just a precious little girl
In her soul you'll find
The things that made your life seem so worthwhile
Then you can give it in return

So real, Mmm
The way she'll sacrifice
Only for you 
To have the best in life

Been too long
You need to let her know
You want to make it right
You gotta touch her soul to find

You will find 
She was everything your heart desired
But nevertheless, she cries
But you never cherished her
And you took for granted love

You sigh 
Remembering the times she made you smile
And knowing that down inside
She was the only one
Who'd love you forever more

[Chorus]

(You can't buy)
Can never buy her love
Can never buy her love
'Cause money just won't fill the void

You made oh no
You want to have her love
You've gotta earn her love
Her soul will lead the way
And show you where to go

Sunlight, my shining star	
All of the world to me
All I could ever need
Lately I can feel you've grown away from me
And inside I pray it's not too late to find a remedy

Don't want to live a lie
I don't want to say goodbye
So how can I start again
And how will my heart mend
Here I am alone with only memories
So I'm searching just to find a way to keep you here with me

So I close my eyes
And I go back in time
When our love was strong
Before our hearts went wrong
I keep holding on to how it used to be
So lay me down and take me to a dream

Dreams that you're holding me
Dreams that won't ever be
Visions of loving you
Wanting to make them true
I find myself believing you'll come back to me
Cause I'm trying not to feel the pain, that loneliness can bring

So I close my eyes
And I go back in time
When our love was strong
Before our hearts went wrong
I keep holding on to how it used to be
So lay me down and take me to a dream

It's so hard to make it through the day without you
So I pray for night to dream you're here with me, with me

Kelly Price,"Ooh, ooh 
Saw you in the street one day 
Walking up to you, wanted just to say baby 
Instantly you looked the other way 
You grabbed the lady's hand 
And you kissed the head of her little man 
Started thinkin' should I blow him up? 
Tell her who I am? 
Tell we've been making so many plans? 
But instead I left 
And I just cried cause I was broke inside 
Now I want to know the reason why 

Saw you walking by me 
Strolling by casually like you didn't know my name 
Baby in your wifey's arms 
Breakin' up my heart 
You're a married man playing games 
Wish somebody told me 'fore I let you hold me 
'fore I let you in my bed 
Never would've let you stay 
Made you go away 
You're a married man playing games. 

So tell me why do this to me? 
Why do this to her? 
And why'd you do this to your baby? 
I loved you for your honesty 
But it was just a lie 
(Don't you know the way I'm feeling inside?) 
You can't imagine how I feel 
Thinking you were real then to find out we're nothing 
I've been living in a faded dream 
But reality quickly hit me 
When I saw you with her 

Saw you walking by me

Whoa 
I can't believe you've been with me 
While you were keeping home with her 
So now I am the other girl in your other world 
And didn't even know I was, oh no 
You really thought that you could be with me 
While you were keeping secrecy's 
But all that's dark will come to light 
Baby that ain't right 
How you fronted in the street, I saw you, oh 

Saw you walking by me

A midnight clear
Was no Santa Claus
No reindeer.
Only me and you
A love brand new
We fell in love at Christmas
It wasn't Valentine's Day
Or the first day of spring,
Summertime may be fine
But love didn't find me.
Till the snow began to fall
That's when everything changed
Cause that's when I found you.
I remember when holidays were blue
Shopping trips, money spent.
Every year de'ja vu
But now I reminisce on a special gift
In you I found it happened one silent night.
Just one year ago when your love found me
Now my life has changed and it's amazing
Cause I prayed for something special to come
But I never dreamed it would be your love.",In Love at Christmas

For this miracle performed,
That through me would come a baby
Who would one day be my lord.
But right now he's just a baby
And the world is not so sure,
Cause while some bow down to worship
There are some who laugh and scorn.
But there's a will
And there's a purpose
That I know he must fulfill
And the reason why you chose me
Very soon will be revealed.
But for now can I just hold him
And keep him in my arms
And for now can I just hold him
And keep him safe from
Lord, I'll give him back to you
Little ordinary mary
Little baby Jesus boy
He's divine in all your planning
But for me he's pride and joy.
But in him there is a story
That the prophets have foretold,
There is honor, there is glory
There's redemption for us all.
Can't even think about him crucified.
Can't even think that he was born to die.

Said he had a surprise for me
He told me to close my eyes
So that I could not see
And when I opened them up
He was one knee reachin' for my hand

He proposed to me
He proposed with a diamond ring
I started crying
He placed it on my finger and I said Yes
He proposed to me (My Baby)
He proposed with a diamond ring
I couldn't  believe it I looked in his eyes and I said Yes

I'll never forget that night
It was 8:43 pm to be precise
He looked in my eyes and said
You've made me the happiest man alive
And as soon as I got home
I called my mother on the phone
I said mama you won't believe
What just happened to me

He proposed to me
He proposed with a diamond ring
I couldn't believe it
I looked in his eyes and I said Yes

This I know
We will love forever (Baby)

And never let me go

You could run free.

Kelly Price,"I'm reading your ""dear john"";
It says you're moving on
You need your space, you need some time 
And greener grass you seek to find
I saw it from afar 
I knew it in my heart
The happiness had gone away
Pretended we would be ok

For every time you've made me cry
I gotta sit and wonder why 
I love you, I still do
I need you, I always will
I want you to hold me tight
I need you with me tonight
I still do

Why do I hold on?
Why can't I be strong?
I know it's time to walk away
But still inside I hope and pray 
That you'll return to me
My eyes too blind to see
That love should never bring me pain
I know I can't go on this way

I gotta wipe away the tears 
I gotta stand and face my fears 
I gotta love myself enough to make it better
The woman that I used to be
I know she's still inside of me
I'll find a way to breathe again
This won't be how my story ends",I Still Do

If I could be with you tonight
I would if I could but I can't so please understand

Baby, baby, baby
I've been wondering
Whatcha doing now
And how your life has been
And now I see you baby
'Cause you're back again
And you wanna know
If we can kick it again?
But so much has changed now
I gotta man and some kids 
I've got responsibilities
So I can't just up and leave
But I wanted you to know that

It's our secret baby
Is what you said to me
But there's too much at stake
My home, my family 
The thought is tempting baby
But I won't be weak
Can't go out like that
Never, no way, no how not me!

Another life, another space
Another time, another place
But not right here and now
I gotta honor my sacred vows

It's feeling right but this is wrong
And I'm not that kinda girl
I gotta go home to my world",If

Came from nothing & life in my surroundings
Was bad. but deep inside me
I would pray for god to guide me

About my journey
Ups and downs I've had plenty
Looking for love in all the wrong places
But I found nothing to fill my empty spaces

I looked for mother she wasn't there
No father around to care
Sisters and brothers were not around
And my friends no where to be found

But when I called Jesus
He was right there
To hear my cry
And answer my prayer
The lord is so faithful
He's been better to me
Then I been to myself

Twas nothing he could do
He shook his head
And he left the room

Then I remembered
Your words I read
In the holy scriptures
Where it said

That you were wounded for my transgressions
You were bruised for my iniquities
By your stripes I'm already healed
So right then I dropped to my knees

And I called Jesus
He was right there
He heard my cry
He answered my prayer
He is faithful
He's been better to me

It will come to pass

I'm so above fussin', callin' and cussin'
Playin' little games at five thirty in the morn'
Said it's a shame and a pity,

How everybody throws up,
That they're a grown up,
They don't wanna call me breathin' on the phone.

'Cause he with me now
I'm so grown and intelligent
It's clearly evident that you're a child,

You see, that I'm so grown it's silly,
I'm so above fussin'
But if I wasn't,
I'd probably be halfway to your house.
But I'm such a damn lady,
I'm not gonna mess up my hair,
Tryin' to go there,
Break a damn nail or a heel tryin' to knock you out.
But you would have a problem, no doubt

Yelling screaming with you,
But be the bigger person,
Is what I choose to do.
I'm his everything now,
All that he never knew,
He could have all he wants with you,
So get a clue,
So get a clue,
He's done with you.

Baby your love is so hot hot (hot)

Pull up, she been purring like a kitten
Cravin' your love
I've been counting on the days you been gone
A little too long, patient
Knowing exactly what it is
It lasts, time, and now
When you, come and lay between it this time
Take the ice cube (boy you know what)
Sit it right below my navel
And watch what I do
And that's my favorite angle

I'm colder than your man
He should be your ex
Now throw that ass back like we playing pitch and catch, fuckin' right
And all your hear is what's my name, it's your pussy
Sweet tooth roll tussy
If you are what you eat I'm so pussy
I'm skating on thin ice
I put in her windpipe, we do it til we both exhausted
Twin pipes, pillow under her stomach
The other pillow she bite
Would you like anything
Cause I'll do anything you like
Um, I make her freeze up
Pick her knees up, she want a maid
Watch me clean up, I know where to put it
I put it in her life
I leave that pussy smoking
Smoking like ice

You put the pillow (right there)
Underneath my back
Got me up against the window (right now)
We got no shame we going in
He hates it when I use my hands
He got me saying, 'damn my man knows what he's doing'

The mirrors, the mirrors
Up on the ceiling, got things so visual, so visual

They ain't been through the things that you put me through and

Kelly Rowland,"Clover walked in
In his baggy jeans and his Prada shoes
He had a nice shirt, nice scent, nice ice
But he's not the one-the one I'd choose
He was the type I never had
Country and thug with lots of class
Something inside me made me hesitate 
So I made him wait

Didn't think he was the one to treat me right
Until he found the love I tried to hide
He said

[Chorus]
Love lives in strange places
It's the obvious that never shows
It just might find you when you least expect it
You'll never know, you'll never know
Until you just let go

Now my baby sister's got a two way
And a cell phone
She's always happy when she gets a page
But it's not love, girl, that's not a home
Real love isn't digital, isn't physical
It's the one that can reach inside
And you don't know why, but it makes you whole

So if you want the one that reaches deep 
Let him see the you that's underneath

[Chorus]

It's in the corners of the sky 
In the shadows of your mind
The unexpected suddenly
Like the child of destiny
No,you can't control the way
So just have faith

I gotta go
To somewhere beyond imaginations flow
Hear my tone
It says I am alone

Your life seems dysfunctional
It only acts what you show
You're your own psychiatrist
A slight minute from quitting
Showing signs of depression
Life's falling over and crashing
Your heart burns through life lava
And rapes your problem solver, now go

Staring at your empty chair
Remembering all the crazy laughs we shared
Last time you were sitting there

I can hear your voice still calling out my name,
And smell your scent upon the pillow next to me,
Imagining your kisses when I close my eyes,
But they don't replace you holding me??

Our house is not a home when I'm alone here
Summer turns to winter when you're gone
And all I see are clouds outside my window
Everytime you walk out that door?

In the morning as I slowly wash my face
Feel you, sneaking up on me?
But my reflection staring tells me everything,
I'm alone, you're not really there

Or the warmth of sun after rain, you,
Always seem to balance me with your love
If you're so far away I want you near might sound cliche'
But my words are so sincere can't you
Taste the joy inside my tears (I'm so in love)

I've found love's treasure in this ocean of pleasure
And now that I have, have you, I won't search for anything more

Ooh love, what have you done to me
This crazy feeling I can't describe it feels like love,
It must be love, it must be love
Feels like snow caressing mountaintops
When I see your eyes from afar
All I can do is run with open arms
And love with all I got, I feel so at home when we're alone oh...

Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh I feel so high above
Caught a glimpse of heaven in your eyes
Thanks for showing me love (You love so good)

Baby we will grow together, this is a joint endeavor
And there's nothing I'd rather see, than the love in your eyes for me

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found

The everything you need
The every sight you see

No uncertainties for sure

Your sensual touch
It's all too much
Unbearing love

I speak your tone
Dance to your song
Of my confession
Of my obsession

It's fearful when I
Replay over life
No existing night
Feels like this one
I feel your presence
Underrates romance
No fear, you're my one, slight obsession

You stand beside
And everything resides
Every surrounding fights
To fall into the moment, take their seats into the night
An unexperienced heart
Is begging & it starts
To collect all the elements of love
That's sure to draw

Have you read the surgeon's guide
Tells me it's not healthy still I know
Maybe I'll be the one to teach a lesson baby
But the first step is to admit my obsession baby

My eyes glare along with fireflies in the night
Your response is only a test and
Obviously I failed
Cause you're my obsession",Obsession

There's a chance he'll notice me
And when he did
I was poppin' sweet

We can get out on the floor
But take it slow
Baby, won't you keep it right there
Yeah, we can take it there

That I'm not so bold when it
Comes to other guys
I ain't goin trip

And I hope that this
Is a thing I won't regret

When the party ends
Is it gonna be you and me?

Breathe the air that surrounds the every move I run
And I never sleep
Without endless dreams
Of love so simply deep

Kelly Rowland,"He was always such a nice boy
The quiet one with good intentions
He was down with his brother, respectful
to his mother
A good boy
But good don't get attention

One kid with the promise
The brightest kid in school, he's not a fool
Reading books 'bout science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
'Cause smart don't make you cool

Well he's not invisible anymore
With his father's nine and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over prime time news

Mary's got the same size hands as
Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theatre Show
She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole Oh Oh, now we'll never know

They're crying to the camera
Said he never fitted in, he wasn't welcome
He'd show up to the parties we was hanging in
Some guys were putting him down, bullin' him 'round

Now I wish I would have talked to him
Gave him the time of day, not turn away

If I would've then it wouldn't maybe go this far
He'd might'a stayed at home playing
angry  chords on his guitar

He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name

Mary's got the same size hands as
Marilyn Monroe

She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far

He had a tryout with the sixahs couldn't
wait for Saturday

Ya their lives were stole
Now we'll never know
We were here, all together yesterday",Stole

If he knows I can feel him
And I wonder
If he knows I can feel him

And I'm thinking
Maybe we can come together
And I'm thinking
We can bring the rain with a lovely breeze with such harmony

Snowflakes, waterfalls same thing like us
And there's no way to stop it
Once you fall in love

I'm glowing
And overflow of happy laughter
I'm growing
Closer to you more than ever
I'm blowing
Daffodils and kisses, baby breaths, and roses gently
Touching noses
I'm sailing
Without a destination
I'm sailing
Explore uncharted places
I'm exhaling
No more lonely seasons, I'm underwater breathing
Drowning in the sea of love

I heard a song bird, a seed came through the earth
Strangers holding hands, a crowd cheering in the stands
I've already seen the evidence
It's obvious love's in the air again
Saw dark clouds blow, chased by rainbows
Saw two roses bloom just like me and you
Caught up in the magic I can't pretend
It's obvious love's in the air again

There's no way to stop it
Boy you and I
Are love in love you see
That you and I, are love in love
There's no way to stop it, no way

Kelly Rowland,"Two distant hearts on a map both goin' no where fast
Both late for an appointment, they end up together in a city cab
They share a fare and some friendly conversation
That's no coincidence, that's love

She scrambles through her purse, he rushed in through the front
Lookin' for change, there's a jukebox in the back of the restaurant
They start to dance 'til this day they're still dancing
That's no coincidence that's love

It's amazing, it's perfection
How each little bitty star makes up one big constellation of people
Getting connected, it's truly Heaven sent, it's evident
That love is no coincidence

He snapped a photograph, she took a sonogram
She didn't tell him he shipped off to war in a foreign land
Left home a soldier but came back a father
That's no coincidence that's love

Somebody crashed her car, he's got a failing heart
One thing can save them an operation, neither can afford
But through visitation, two families get acquainted
That's no coincidence that's love

How we intertwine is divine
(Extraordinary)
Open your eyes and you'll find
(It's involuntary)
Seasons have reasons for changing
(So that everybody)
Can find love, lose love, find love again
",No Coincidence
Kelly Rowland,"Ladies and gentlemen, Kelly's back

Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See, I told y'all, y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hit like this?

Ladies, drama, leave it home
If he ain't got it right by now, then scratch him off

Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around, then I make it jump like this
(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See, I told y'all, y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hit like this?

Like six, six-four, came up real slow, put a good game on me
Told him: 'Partner, don't get too close so comfortable
Cause the quick ain't for me
Got my girls all here, no enemies, always family please
All of your personal info
I ain't thinkin' 'bout love, I just tryin' to get it up
Pop a bottle, talk a lot of bullshit
And let's, let's go

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around, then I make it jump like this
(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See, I told y'all, y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hit like this?

Tonight I ain't feelin' no (stress)
To my girls that's lookin' their best
Won't you go and show it off for us?
(Ladies, go on, throw your hands up)
And if he's all in your head
Just forget all the things that he said
Girl, this is yours; do whatever you want to
(Ladies, go on, throw your hands up)

Hear these words out my mouth, now, tell you how it's goin' down
Kelly, E-V-E - we comin' through and got 'em bowin' down
Ladies, can you feel it? It's an anthem you can bounce around
Give you just a sec to take your breath; bring it back now
Dudes get excited, seein' what they like, and
Hopin' you the one you choose, hope they get invited
Late night rendezvous is all right
But we lovin' how the club vibratin'; it's enticing
Let the beat knock; trust me, we ain't gon' stop
Here till the light's up; watch us take over the spot
Few mad looks from them chicks you know
And from them dudes who be jealous of a chick wit' dough
Pop another bottle for them, keep my life movin'
No time for the drama, watch me blow through them
I know I sound confident; I'm supposed to though
We do it big, how we live; Kelly told you so, come on

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said, I told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Turn around, then I make it jump like this
(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See, I told y'all, y'all was gonna jump like this

I got that comeback, that hubba bubba
I got that run back, run back and tell your mother
I throw that RA-RA, only I put it all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty, guaranteed you'll never leave

Warning, beware, handle with care
If you're lucky, there's a chance you'll make it there
This is serious; girls like me are so rare
Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

Now, I know what I'm doing; what chu gon' do with this?
I'll let you catch a feeling with just a little bit
Don't wanna rush into it and catch a sugar fit
Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

Caution, keep away from open flames 
'Cause it's hot, hot, hot, fire marshals can't contain it
You'll need rehab 'cause this thing is so addictive
Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

The hazard lights are flashing, and you're now too close behind
I won't give you directions; you better read the signs
I'll reach my destination; you better fall in line
Ones that put that on him, put that on him
Put that, put that, put that on him

(Don't ask no questions) Don't ask me questions of what you thinking I'm 'bout to do
Don't get all clingy on me after I'm finished with you
I'll let you taste this honey, but you better have a clue
Or I ain't coming back to you

Walking takes so long when you're alone this time, don't it?

'Cause the same shoulder that was so cold now needs one to lean on
Same number that was so hard to call is your favorite one
Same door you hated to walk in now is what you wish was home
Same mama who told you I was no good got to tell you:

Same ex who was your back up plan moved on to a better plan
Same friends who told you to leave have all tried to get at me

The grass ain't greener, I swear, on the other side (other side)
I hate to see you, I swear, on the other side (other side)
I hate to leave you, I swear, on the other side (side)

Kelly Rowland,"Can you describe the moment
When two people fall in love?
Some say the clouds will spin in circles
And the rain will turn to doves
The poor will start to laugh
Even the rich will start to cry

It can wake you up at night

Standing here with you
That's what my heart has
Sworn to be true

This is love
It's written on my face
It's the way I lean my body towards you

This is love
Like a diamond in the sand

I can't wait another day to say... this is love, oh

This is love, yeah

You take my imperfections
And turn them into art
If I could change one thing about you
There would be no place to start
You are safety without numbers
You are dangerously wild
But you're sweeter than rock candy
And you ease my inner child

That's what I feel when I'm
Standing here with you
That's what my heart has
Sworn to be true

There is love in the world?

I could find another guy and try to love you out of my life
But it just gets harder everytime we try
Ohh thats why I'm

[Chorus:]
Broken
And its hurting me boy cuz you just left me
Broken
And because of you I don't know if I can
Love again
But I can't believe boy that this is the end (this is the end)
Be together once again
'Cause boy I'm broken

Broken, broken
How could you leave me
Broken, broken
How could you leave me

I can take the pictures that we took and throw them all away (All away)
And every letter that you wrote boy 
I want to forget what you had to say (What you had to say)
Cuz I could never understand what you did to me on that day
That's the only part I wish I could replace
Can't you see I'm

[Chorus:]

Ohh if I had a choice
Baby you'd still be right here with me
And if you give me a voice
Baby I'd tell you I dont want you to leave
Cuz boy I'm broken

How could you leave me (how could you leave me)

How could you leave me

There's a conversation in the corner
Tell a friend, bring everyone
(c'mon, let's go)
Cos the fm music is groovin'
Folks getting down, getting down in their stocking feet
Sleepy eyes are peeping

From the window across the street

And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again

Most people like getting up when I'm just getting in

And oh, it's the only only time
It's the only time when I can unwind

I swore to myself time and time and time again
That I would give up the night-life
(yeah right)
Start laying in
But it ain't easy, no no
(no no no)
Saying no to my friends

Great to see you again
Homie, I'm doin' fine
Chasin' day dreams, you know still pursuing mine
Sleep is so foreign, tv is so boring
New york is New York
Travie is still aight
The freaks come out at night like a vampire
Nocturnal lurking
The daylight creeps up

Don't know what to do without it
My love, my time, my all
Invested in you so much
I thought I'd never doubt it
Now it hurts so bad
I wanna scream and shout it
Tell me what happened to the man
That promised the world and said...

You said that you would be there
Now it seems like you just don't care
And I'm not gonna take it anymore

All of the years that I gave
All of these tears that I waste
I think it's time that I get on with my life
Although I might be alone
I'm better on my own
Without you here I'm doing more than just fine
No man, no cry...

It feels good starting over
Me, myself and I, through and through
I thought I told ya
My independence day
I've found me a brand new life
And though my heart is aching
I get a little stronger with each baby step I'm taking
Looking back on what I've left
I know what I'm doing is right

You said that you would be there
Now it seems like you just don't care
And I'm not gonna take it anymore

Looky here, see, my eyes are dry
No tears when I said goodbye

A breeze that calms me in the night
I got your message yesterday
I feel you here
I wish that you could

Stay with me
Two hearts forever
You were the spark that lit the flame
Only if you'd
Stay with me
This love's forever
And in my heart you will remain
Until we meet again

Sitting in the cold room
Waiting for the sun
Will it ever shine again

The better days
Are swirling in my head
Will I ever find a way

In the middle of the bedroom
The kitchen or the hall way
It's gonna be a lot of leg room
And a little bit of foreplay

Just tell me when you feel it

For love, sometimes you got to do it, do it, do it
Don't talk too much just kiss him
Touch him but do it, do it,

So wake me up
Keep me pumping
Like a song
It ain't nothing wrong
Make love, sweet love
With only nothing
Baby just turn the music on
And I'll be your favorite song

One and one we're having some fun
In the bedroom all day and all the night

It's going down like a basement
I love it when a beat drop
I'm sick of being patient
I'm screaming when the beat stops
Did you wanna do it all alone
Just catch it when I through it
I'm giving you my all love

Even if they are you can still pull your on

When you make pain look this good it never wears out

While my sister was on stage, killing it like a motherfucker
I was enraged, feeling it like a motherfucker
Bird in a cage, you would never know what I was dealing with
Went our separate ways, but I was happy she was killing it
Bitter, sweet, she was up, I was down
No lie, I feel good for her, but what do I do now?
Forget the records, off the record, I was going through some bullshit
Post Survivor, she on fire, who wanna hear my bullshit?
Meanwhile this nigga putting his hands on me

Fix my make-up,

Then we make up,
Well get it together, nigga, get it together
Kinda lucky, I was in her shadow
Phone call from my sister, “what’s the matter?”
She said, “Oh no baby, you gotta leave!”
I’m on the kitchen floor, he took the keys
I was mad at everybody,
I mean everybody

So here I am in the spin cycle
We’re coming and we’re going, nobody can notice
And I was trapped in his house, lying to my mama
Thought it could get no worser as we maximize the drama
Started to call them people on him
I was battered
He hittin' the window like it was me, until it shattered
He pulled me out, he said, “Don’t nobody love you but me
Not your mama, not your daddy and especially not B.”
He turned me against my sister
I missed you

When you’re soaked in tears for years, it never airs out

We up and live like, waiter XO
Ooh, and she be rollin' that fatty
And puffin as long as it takes

Giving you the street life, brap!

I really wanna believe you

Is it true? What to do?
I don't wanna see myself
Played a fool, baby ooh
Uh uh
No way, I prefer you keep it real with me

'Cause I, I
I don't think I could take, another broken promise
Why do things the hard way, when you can just be honest
And Imma do what I'm supposed to do, if you tell me you got us
Why do things the hard way? (hard way, hard way)

'Cause if you give me your love then I give you mines back
If you get to acting up I cut you off like that
I, don't think I could take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way? (Hard way, hard way)

If love, is free
And talk, is cheap
Don't make me pay for all your mistakes boy
Finally go, just be free
Thought you'd get to know me
Don't tell the same stories

If you get to acting up I cut you off like that
I, don't think I could take another broken promise
Why do things the hard way? (Hard way, hard way)

Promises and promises you say they all counterfeit
If we start off telling lies, does loving never amount to shit?
You really think me, I'm the one? Or you just like the sound of it?
If the motive's all wrong, heartaches what you bound to get
Give me one shot, let a ball quit
Imma kill it girl,
Full clip you wearing all white, I'm in all black
We standing by the boardpit
You say I do, I say I do, I'm tired of all the bullshit

Huh, on your face
You lookin' like someone came and rained on your parade,

Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.

We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.

A love that is so true

Now past five before there too.

Will be the start.
When the end, you see

To change the one thing I desire.
To change everything.

Did you hear them whispering our names
Did you hear them say that I'm to blame
My ears are burning as word hits the street
I'm starting to get dizzy from the heat

All we ever do kiss and run
Push comes to shove I want no part of

Seeing us together's all they need

They make you feel nothing at all
They'll never remember and they'll never mind
If you're counting the cracks in the wall
They're quick and they're greedy
They never feel guilty
They don't know the meaning of hurt

The next time they see you they treat you like dirt
The next time they treat you like dirt

Now don't come the cowboy with me, Sonny Jim
I know lots of those and you're not one of them
There's a light in your eyes tells me somebody's in and
You won't come the cowboy with me

Don't be too rough on my cold, cold heart
It's all I've got left to me now
I fell out of favour with heaven somewhere
And I'm here for the hell of it now
Some girls play cowboys and some boys play harder to get
But they're got just the same
They smile and say ""cheese"", they're so eager to please
But they'll never remember your name
The names and the places all change

Did somebody tell you I'm lonely as hell?
I didn't expect you to know me so well

Sometimes I bounce off the wall
And sometimes my head hits the floor

Now we're down to saying our goodbyes
And you still don't see the truth
All I did was try to make life better for you
But a woman just gets tired of being used

So find another fool to love you
The world is full of girls like me
Find a fool to take care of you
That's a girl I'd like to see
Who'll be the one when all is said and done
I know you
You'll find another fool

Now you say you want to talk it over
Maybe I will change my mind
But you never heard a word I ever told you
And it's not my mind that needs to change this time

So find another fool to love you
The world is full of girls like me
Find a fool to take care of you
That's a girl I'd like to see
You'll be fine but you won't know what she needs
And I know you
You'll find another fool

You think hearts are made to be broken
Like your promises so easily broken
Too many good things have fallen at your feet
I wonder who'll be the fool after me

Go find another fool to love you
The world is full of girls like me
Find a fool to take care of you
That's a girl I'd like to see
I hope she doesn't mind
When you don't come home at night
Not all the time
Maybe once in a while
You tell her that you tried
But you can't look her in the eye
And I know you
You'll find another fool



",Find Another Fool
Kelly Willis,"Redemption is all I really need
Cause I've been living like a liar and a thief
They say that you spend your lifetime burning
But I spend mine, just turning and turning

And oh, will it shine through, all that I've been waiting for
Living in the real time, it's been getting to me
Oh yeah, will it shine through, all that I've been waiting for
Taking its sweet time in getting to me

Love is the answer, at least for some
But love is the devil when you have none
So empty your pockets and lay down your dimes
It costs what you've got and you pay every time

And oh, will it shine through, all that I've been waiting for
Living in the real time, it's been getting to me
Oh yeah, will it shine through, all that I've been waiting for
Taking its sweet time in getting to me

So, let go your mind when you're feeling it slip
Yeah, and let go your heart when you're feeling it dip
Sometimes, there's not much a poor soul can do
But dream of the life you've got coming to you

And oh, when it shines through, all that I've been waiting for
Living in the real time, it's been getting to me
Oh, oh, when it shines through, all that I've been waiting for
It's taking its sweet time in getting to me

Hey, taking its sweet time
But getting to me",Getting to Me
Kelly Willis,"If I left you
I wouldn't stay gone so long

But you left me
Alone here in my misery
That's not something I would do
If I left you

If I left you
I wouldn't go out on the town
If I left you
I'd drag my heart along the ground

",If I Left You
Kelly Willis,"Chorus
It's not what I had in mind
Loving you now that you're no longer mine
It's not what I had in mind
Letting you go and then crossing that line

I've fallen under some spell and I wonder
What is the right thing to do
I've been here before and I've never been sure
I'm still in love with you

Chorus

Time has weakened my will
And changed how I feel
I want you still

I'm falling over myself to get closer
To you and I shouldn't want to
I can't deny how
You make me feel right now
I'm still in love with you

Kelly Willis,"Now my dreams can all come true,
And now my life can follow through. 
Suddenly, it's all so clear. 
There's not a thing that I should fear.

Who'd have thought that it would start
With the beating of your heart
And the world would stop for me
And show me love like it should be.

(Chorus):

Holding your hand in mine,
catching my breath each time
Looking up at the stars,
Now they don't seem so far.

(Repeat Chorus)

Spread the news that I'm alive,
Cuz I was born in your blue eyes.

Kelly Willis,"The stars will be
Fading soon
We're losing our love
With the moon

Kiss me and say goodbye

Remember the words
That we say tonight
But don't say anything
Once we're in the light

We have to waste the day
And we have to hide the way that we are
Tell me it's not our fate
That we will always wait until dark

We'll wait for the dark
How many hearts will break
If we don't wait

Kelly Willis,"You might have a happy family, nice house, fine car
You might be successful in real estate
You could even be a football star

You might have a prime time TV show
Seen in every home and bar
But you can't take it with you

You might own a great big factory
Oil wells on sacred land
You might be in line for promotion
With a foolproof retirement plan

You might have your money in copper
Textiles or imports from Japan
But you can't take it with you

You can't take it with you
Though you might pile it up high
It's so much easier for a camel
To pass through a needle's eye

You might have a body of fine proportion and a hungry mind
A handsome face and a flashing wit
Lips that kiss and eyes that shine

There might be a lot all around the block
Long before your starting time
But you can't take it with you

You can't take it with you
Though you might pile it up high
It's so much easier for a camel
To pass through a needle's eye

You might have a great reputation so carefully made
And a set of high ideals
Polished up and so well displayed

That lived within the heart of me

Became impatient to be free

The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Kelly Wright,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away

And in that lamp there is a lonely moth
He’s got one night, he’s got one life
And one thing on his mind, and that’s the fire

He doesn’t care from where it comes
He only knows he’s got to run
Toward the brightest promise in his eye
Now he’s circling to the ground
His wings have burned, he’s falling down
I just watch, and wonder how we carry on

It was a world I never made
I just fell into this old parade
They told me it’s my time to shine
And they got ways to light me up at night

They didn’t care from where I came
It seemed they lost their pride and shame
Looking for a fire of their own
One last ember hits the ground
The wood’s all burned, it's ashes now
If you look up to the moon, you’ll help me carry on

Old man in a bar tonight
He sits down on a stool to watch the fight
He says “One last drink to light me up
And then I do believe I’ve had enough”

Chasing dreams that end in pain

I feel the moon behind the clouds

Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke

Think about the times when life was so misleading
Think about the days before they had any meaning
Think about these things what a difference you'll make

God's gonna heal you everywhere you hurt
You've done all you can so just watch him work
His wonders see this one that is mystical sweetness
Folks stick around as we watch him complete this

Thing he has done in you and in me
Cast your cares upon the sea of tranquility
Which by the way you know he would never let you drown in
So why do we die on the beach when?

Love abounds in ways untold people watch there dreams unfold
Every day in the blink of an eye slight of hand
Trust me y'all when I say god is the man he can
And most definitely will rest your soul

Truth be told let him have control
See his eye is always on you
And still he keeps the sparrow
Even though life isn't easy

So think about the days when, when love was only fleeting
Think about the days before they had any meaning
Think about these things what a difference you'll make
Think about the days

Won't you think about the days when livin' wasn't easy?
Think about the times when, when life was so misleading
Think about the days before they had any meaning
Won't you sit around think about these things won't you, won't you?

Think about the days when life was so sad
Think about the times when love was somethin' you lacked in
Think about the days when you lived on your hands and knees
Won't you think about these things? What a difference you'll make

Kem,"You're going to? 
That your skies are finite and limited? 
That your growth is an impossible dream, that your future is inhibited. 
Oh please! They have been shoveling them lies since the 50s, 
Can't nobody decide what your life can move through! This is YOUR time and your challenge. What is it that you want to do? Sit and be still and not shine the way your life was meant to?
Oh, I pray that ain't true! I pray that ain't true!
Oh please, don't fall in the abyss because something negative once ruled you. 
Please! Understand I'm from where you are and I've got to fight my demons too. 
Please! Don't give up because somebody broke your heart or some things fell through.
This is life. You owe it. Life does not owe you.

An obstacle is a thing that impedes or blocks one's way. 
You can climb over, you can dig under you can chip through it, 
You can go around it, you can move it. You can ignore it!
But you can do it! You can do it!",Golden Days

Tell me can you comprehend what you make me feel
Heaven only knows why broken hearts can heal

I need you, here by my side
If you're not in my world, boy
Ain't nothing right
You're a good man, and I'm a good woman too

Maybe we can work it out
Maybe we can find the time
Maybe we can settle down, girl

Maybe we can find a way to love a little better
Maybe we can find a way to keep it all together
Maybe have a little faith and pray for this love, love

Why su espalda a la puerta apoyó
Why mirándome me dijo llorando

Así siéntate que estas muy nerviosa
Espera un poco te preparo un café
Why mi mano se extendió generosa
Why dije calmate

Que fué, que pasó, por qué esta situación
Hay acaso un intruso entre los dos
Es que acaso no crees en mi amor
A donde tu vayas sabes que iré yo

why mientras tanto ella seguía callada
Ocultándome quien sabe qué
Hasta que con palabras tosadas dijo
Somos tres

Pasarán solamente ocho meses
Why un tercero entre nosotros abrá
Así que piensa si deveras lo quieres
O me marcho ya

Que fue, que pasó, no tiene discusión
Bienvenido sea el tercero entre los dos
Te haré mi esposa si tu quieres
Porque a donde tu vayas sabes que iré yo

The sound of the discos and humming of the cars
That's alright
When you come I will be open to the touch of your love

That fills your ears when your little world starts coming around

Nor to care to bring some coolness on the sheets two lovers share

When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip
And I wore a big red rose
When you caressed me, 'twas then Heaven blessed me
What a blessing, no one knows
You made life cheery when you called me dearie
'Twas down where the blue grass grows
Your lips were sweeter then julep when you wore that tulip 
And I wore a big red rose

If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Ken Dravis,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky mountain high

It's Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high

At the window by the door
Wondering if she'll
Ever smile again
Her eyes filled with memories
And her life in sad array
Unaware of the colours of the day
She dare not cry for fear
Her hope might disappear
But if she cared to try
I know it all could be so clear

But she's living in the past
She didn't know it wouldn't last
And it's a long, long, lonely road
Oh, to go down

The treasured names
You call each other just for fun
And as you woke
She kissed your eyes
You killed it all when it had
Only just begun
What's it take to make you realise

Love isn't easy though
Many like to think it is
But you must learn
To give and take or know
What you will miss

She said she was in love with me
Worse, still, how long it took to see
How cruel love can be

She twisted my words
Though I gave her love in the face of her lies
She is the devil in a fancy dress
She wears her passion as a thin disguise

And now that we have parted
And gone our separate ways
We can look back on all those wasted days

It taught me how hard

With the strength
Of a new day dawning

And the night behind me

In the strangest places

Ken Hensley,"She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning,
Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind.
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking,
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win.

She asked me name my foe then. I said the need within some men 
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of men or god.
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies,
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life.

But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals,
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end.
For she the mother of all men had counciled me so wisely that
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay.

""Oh lady lend your hand,"" I cried, ""Oh let me rest here at your side.""
""Have faith and trust in me,"" she said and filled my heart with life.
There is no strength in numbers. I've no such misconceptions.
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away.

Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear.
My labor is no easier, but now I know I'm not alone.
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day.
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise.

Black from their cold hearts
Down to their graves

Spreading their scorn
Cursing the sun

To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing

Not to move closer

To pull away from your glow

Who I followed like a star
And suddenly you changed
And now I don't know who you are

Ken Mackintosh,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
Ken Mackintosh,"Till then my darling, please wait for me
Till then, no matter when it will be
One day I know I'll be back again
Please wait till then

Our dreams will live though we are apart
Our love, I know we'll keep in our heart
Till then, when all the world will be free
Please wait for me

Although there are oceans we must cross
And mountains that we must climb
I know every game must have a loss
So pray that our loss is nothing but time

Till then, let's dream of what there will be
Till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, when I will hold you again
Please wait till then

Ken McIntyre,"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed at christopher columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when edison recorded sound
They all laughed at wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at rockefeller center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

As they walk that two step
Across the hardwood floor

Every Friday and Saturday night
There's a bouncer standin' at the door
And he don't allow no fights

I drive a pickup truck

Between her world and mine

But we're lookin' in the same direction

As long as me make a connection
The love we have between us
Is as close as we'll come to perfection
We may not see eye to eye
But we're lookin' in the same direction

She was raised on easy street
Her daddy was worth a lot
I was brought up the hard way
Had to scrape for every dime I got
She belongs to the evenin' bridge club
And I'm into late night poker games
We're both as different as different as daylight and dark

I went swimmin' in the fishin' hole
Floatin' around in my birthday suit
When a friend turned over my inner tube
Said a four letter word, and my heart sank
When Mama snuck up and screamed from the bank

You'd rather tangle with a grizzly bear
You got about a minute to get out here
Don't make me have to come in there

Barely sixteen when I borrowed me the car
Started to a movie, ended up at a bar
With a fake ID I got in
And ordered a round for all my friends
Took a little sip, then spit it on the floor
When I heard Daddy holler from the front door

[Chorus]

Son don't make me have to come in there
Last night I was down at the Do Drop in
Talkin' to an old girlfriend

And dance off your dancin' shoes
Don't need jumper cables, 'cause honey I'm able

Every time she looks at me
My heart starts thumping, blood starts pumping
I get weak in my knees

My voice quivers, my body shivers
My vision gets all blurred
Her eyes flutter, my words stutter
I'm just a bundle of nerves

Wrecked my shopping cart, inside Wal-Mart
When she spoke that southern drawl
Smiled at me, wrote down her number
Said, ""Big boy, give me a call""

Tried to play it cool but fell over a stool
As I turned to walk away
Wound up on my back, underneath a rack
Of women's lingerie

I'm a bundle of nerves, get a little disturbed
Every time she looks at me
My heart starts thumping, blood starts pumping
I get weak in my knees

My voice quivers, my body shivers
My vision gets all blurred
Her eyes flutter, my words stutter
I'm just a bundle of nerves

Thought I'd try my luck, so I called her up
She said, ""Let's go out tonight""
Showed up early feeling like John Wayne
But acting like Barney Fife

Wearing nothing but a smile and an itty-bitty towel
She opened up the door
I was floating through the air, when I tripped on a stair
And fell right off the porch

I'm a bundle of nerves, get a little disturbed
Every time she looks at me
My heart starts thumping, blood starts pumping
I get weak in my knees

My voice quivers, my body shivers
My vision gets all blurred
Her eyes flutter, my words stutter
I'm just a bundle of nerves

Her eyes flutter, my words stutter
I'm just a bundle, Lord, I'm a bundle
I'm just a bundle of nerves

Ken Overcast,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Ken Peplowski,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You
Ken Peplowski,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Ken Peplowski,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Ken Peplowski,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Ken Peplowski,"The night was filled with sweet surrender
I had a million things to say
We shared the moon in all it's splender
You pressed your lips to mine, and by the way
 
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am living for you alone?
Did I remember to say ""I'm lost without you""
And just how mad about you I've grown?
You were in my arms and that was all I knew
We were alone, we two, what did I say to you?
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forever more you are mine?

Ken Schaphorst,"Once there was a wicked witch in the lovely land of Oz
And a wickeder, wickeder, wickeder witch there never, never was
She filled the folks in Munchkin land with terror and with dread
'Till one fine day from Kansas way a cyclone caught a house 
That brought the wicked, wicked witch her doom

For the house fell on her head and the coroner pronounced her dead

Ken Schaphorst,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Ken Schaphorst,"Sometimes you can be like a stranger 
In moments when you're so far away 
In the night when I reach out to hold you 
You just turn away, why do you turn away
 
Oh, I love you so when you're smilin' 
But your smile has faded overnight 
Will we stay like this for a lifetime 
Gettin' nothin' right, gettin' nothin' right 

Why do we always have stormy weather 
Why do we have it so rough 
Is it so hard just to stay close together 
Why can't we ever have love 

Oh, I knew from the first time I saw you 
I just had to make you mine 
Felt so sad when you told me 
About your troubled life, all about your troubled life 

So here we are just a few years further 
Still tryin' to make it work 
I've a feelin' what we really need right now, girl

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for

And every time your lips meet mine

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

And let it die

Will come back to me

If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

There's not a man alive that wouldn't want to hold her
And the way she moves, just the way she moves
Well, that's enough to keep me on a slow burn
Keep me on a slow burn

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
She's more woman than I could ever ask for
Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn
Keeps me on a slow burn

When we touch this fire breaks out
And it rages out of control
And the love we made is so deep, so strong
And when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, slow burn

And the love we made is so deep, so strong
That when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
Keeps me on a slow burn

Ken Song,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
