Crystal Fighters,"Sometimes the stars I see are bright
Somewhere above the clouds at night
Some shine the light of starlight
Somewhere above the cloudless sky

With you

Sometimes the stars I see are bright
Somewhere above the clouds at night
Thinking about outside
And walking around and around

Some shine the light of starlight
So far above the cloudless sky
I'm thinking of outside
Walking around and around

Well love is a powerful thing
They need love inside you
Deep down in my heart in light of you
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you

Well love is a powerful thing
They need love inside you
Deep down in my heart in light of you
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you

With you, with you, with you, with you
With you

Each time the light of the starlight
Turns black, black with the dark of night
I'm thinking about stuff
Walking around and around

Some shine the light of starlight
So far above the cloudless sky
I'm thinking about stuff
Walking around and around

Well love is a powerful thing
They need love inside you
Deep down in my heart in light of you
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you

Well love is a powerful thing
They need love inside you
Deep down in my heart in light of you
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you

With you, with you, with you, with you

With you

Well love is a powerful thing
They need love inside you
Deep down in my heart in light of you
Well maybe the stars are dying to tell you

With you",With You
Crystal Fighters,"I try not to believe
Everything I hear, everything I see
But it's hard with everything I bet
In favor of, It all be real, yeah
It's hard to be in doubt with all the pieces there are to believe
And it's hard not to go with everything that I'm feelin' in me

Into the night, I'm going there to
Walk too close to the tides
To be swept up in her arms,
Awake and alive, I come out here to
Be with you one more time

Are we one, are we one, are we love?
Are we one, are we one, are we love?
When we go walk, are we one, are we love?
Are we one, are we one, are we love?
Are we love?

In the sky, open trees
In the ocean blue, everything is free
I'm alive, with all the feeling I have in me
'Cuz they are so real, yeah
It's hard to be in doubt with all the reasons there are to believe
Right now I'm gonna go with everything that I'm feelin' in me

Into the night, I'm going there to
Walk too close to the tides
To be swept up in her arms,

And I gotta let you know what it is

Crystal Fighters,"Rolling mountains, streets white and endless
Laughing, melting, lost all sense of time and the mindset
Helpless, but held it down, made our way across town
All the way to open fields, hoping we could open
Up till dawn, all night all day
Nights and mornings awake in our heads
We are stars in our each beautiful morning

Oh, these nights never end, no
Back on the fields, open grass laid out
Open field, home just a dot in the distance
Down that path we all came down
But you can't go back ever now
'Cuz the world saved the early days
Have gone away with the future

Everything we're changing with the moon and the sun
And we've been holding back way too long for this, holding on

Up till dawn, all night all day
Nights and mornings awake in our heads
We are stars in our each beautiful morning

Crystal Gayle,"Now every since you went away
I've overheard some people say
She's taking it well I hear

Some hurt can make you cry
Some make you wanna die
Some just goes too deep for tears

Like on the day my daddy died
Mommy never even cried
Just whispered in my ear

Some hurt can make you cry
Some make you wanna die
Some just goes too deep for tears

Ever since you said goodbye-ye
How I wish that I could cry
How I wished and wished that I
Break down way down inside

But maybe I will find away
And I get over you someday
But I know that may take years

Some hurt can make you cry
Some make you wanna die
Some just goes too deep for tears

Some hurt can make you cry
Some make you wanna die
Some just goes too deep for tears
Some just goes too deep for tears

And I'm needing you deep down within

To love, to love, to feel
And when nothing else can warm me up
I know your kisses will

The days of our lives go by
And what have we both got to show
'Cause we played all the games
And the fact still remains

Than your old cold shoulder
And it's gettin' colder
Like every kiss

You say it's not over
Over and over
But your old cold shoulder
Tells me it is

What we had we don't no more
We can't feel it anymore
I thought a love like
Ours could never die

But you get colder every day
Every night you turn away
You couldn't say it
Any plainer if you tried

'Cause there's nothing colder
Than your old cold shoulder
And it's gettin' colder

Crystal Gayle,"I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain",Crying in the Rain
Crystal Gayle,"It takes all the faith that's in you
Takes your heart and it takes mine
It takes love to be forgiven
Living in these troubled times

When it rains on the range
And it snows in the Spring
You're reminded again

It's just a march of the dying
Living in these troubled times

Brings you down to buy a paper
If you read between the lines
No one seems to have the answer
To living in these troubled times

Still you try and you try
And you do what you must do
It's the march of the dying
Living in these troubled times
Loving in these troubled times

It takes a man, it takes a woman
It took your heart and it took mine
It takes love to be forgiven
Living in these troubled times

It's the march of the dying
Living in these troubled times

Crystal Gayle,"I can clearly see nothing as clear
I keep falling apart every year
Let's take a hammer to it
There's no glamour in it
Is there any way out of this dream

I'm as blue as I can possibly be
Is there someone else out there for me
Summer is dragging its feet
I feel so incomplete
Is there any way out of this dream
Summer is dragging its feet
I feel so incomplete
Is there any way out of this dream

Lost in the pocket of your overcoat

With someone that I used to be

Nevertheless sometimes a mannequin's
Blue summer dress can make the window like a dream
Ah, but now those dreams belong to someone else
Now they talk in their sleep
In a drawer where I keep all my

Remember when you were burning for them
Why do you keep turning them into

To see if they can still burn you down

Smells like a pool hall, where's my other shoe

And tell me, how long have you been combin' your hair with a wrench

And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you

Well, I've told you before, I won't tell you again
You don't defrost the icebox with a ball point pen
This railroad apartment is held together with glue
And I'm sick and tired of pickin' up after you

Because I know I've been swindled, I never bargained for this
What's more, you never cared about me

Why don't you get your own place so you can live like you do

I wonder if he's (ever) really comin' back
The moon's a yellow stain across the sky
Oh baby, this one's from the heart

(Maybe) And I'll go down to the corner and get a racin' form
(But) And I should probably wait here by the phone

Robin is back against the wall
Pour myself a double sympathy
Oh baby, this one's from the heart

(To put ) don't pound a cold chisel through my heart

Love is the seed and, babe, I need you
To keep it growing
Stronger every day; Oh, no
Don't take me half the way
Don't take me half the way.

Never before have I settled for second
All of my life I have hungered for more
Now I can see where your sweet love can lead me
This is what I've waited for

Half of your love is just not what I'm after
Part of your world is just not what I need
Now I can see where your sweet love can lead me

Many's the woman who's cried herself crazy at night
Over some kind of a man who she says ain't treatin' her right
Expectin' of someone is quick to be takin' its toll
And if you're not careful, you'll wake up lonely and old

Don't start thinking I'm somethin' that I'll never be
Just need me as much as need be
Take it easy, easy, lovin' me

Now dreamin' and plannin' are things I guess all of us do
And sooner or later, we all play the part of a fool
But those in a hurry to unpack their bag full of dreams
Are quick to be victims of the lies and lusts and the schemes

But how can you tell,
You never get inside my head.
The times we talk, we never speak,
We play hide and seek
So many things are left unsaid.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Sweet thoughts and dreams,
Like drops of rain on rippling streams
That wind and bend,
Rivers with no end,
Flowing on the other side of me.
 
It seems I always get unstrung
I trip on my tongue
With words that come out something else.
I'm so afraid the things I say
Might chase you away,
I have to hide behind myself.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Why must I hide

What joy shall fill my heart

In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way

A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

O, jingle bells, jingle bells

Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side

The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upshot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell

A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song

I've got myself, I don't need anyone

And saw the wall of tears I was hiding behind

You reached for me, I felt your touch
I wanted you, we both needed so much
In a world of lonely people looking for love
Why was I surprised to see it happen to us?

[Chorus]
Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody wants to love someone
When the nights are long and cold
Everybody needs someone to love
Nobody wants to be alone

The days were empty, the nights were so long
I wished on every star 'til you came along
I knew that one day you'd walk through that door
Sometimes, it's hard but love is worth waiting for

You'll only see tears of joy in my eyes

I wish everyone could be as lucky as us

I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs

We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Just like the sun over the mountain top

You know I'll always come again

You know I like to spend my morning time

Like sunlight dancing on your skinn


I've never gone so wrong as for telling lies to you

What you've seen is what I've been

And there is nothing I can hide from you

You see me better than I can

(Chorus)

Out on the road that lies before me now

There are some turns where I will spin

I only hope that you can hold me now

Til I can gain control again


Like a lighthouse you must stand alone

Landmark a sailor's journey's end

No matter what seas I've been sailing on

I'll always roll your way again

(Repeat Chorus)

Except for just a dream or two

We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all

But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark

Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories

Got my reservation
Spent each dime
I could afford
Like a child
In wild anticipation
Long to hear that
A-all aboard
Seven
That's the time we leave
At seven
I'll be waitin' up for
Heaven
Countin' every mile
Of railroad track
That takes me back
Never thought
My heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam
Gotta take that sentimental journey

Come shining through

Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear
May be ever so near

And I'm ready for the times to get better
You seem to want from me what I can not give I feel so lonesome at times
I have a dream that I wish I could live it's burning holes in my mind

The feelings gone
What happen to the dream
We plan our future on
You turn away
And try to say
What we both know

I can?t let you go
Let you go away

I don?t wanna lose your love

Don?t take the only love
I?ve ever known
I don?t wanna lose your love
How could you go and stop

Oh baby
I don?t wanna be alone

I tried to hide
The pain inside
So plain to see
I never could keep secrets
From you anyway
So hard to face
I can?t erase

Won?t you change your mind
Change your mind and stay

Crystal Gayle,"Moon, please don't shine on me, help me hide his memory
Stars don't light the midnight sky 'cause you don't want to see me cry
Heart, don't let me think of him, lock your door, don't let his memory in
I feel the cold wind blowin' through a love, like this was meant for two

But it's me against the night and I'm afraid it's a losing fight
I see you in every shadow of the room, you're not here to hold me tight
I can't wait till the morning light, there's no way to win
When it's me against the night

Gone, you said you'd never be and all of you belonged to me
Burning tears fall down like rain, longing for your love again

But it's me against the night and I'm afraid it's a losing fight

It may be the truth or it may be a lie

We can talk of the news
We can talk of the talk of the town
There's another true love going down

We can talk about promises, talk about lies
But there's no use pointing our fingers
And the sound of 'I love you' still lingers
But it rings with the sound of goodbye

逃げ出しそうになった時
一人じゃないって

Without you I don't know what I would do

I'm all alone no friends can come out and play
I need you to move me in your mystic way
I open up the book and I call out your name
Hoping that you'll hear me and you'll save me from my shame

But in the midst of a crowd all they hear are lies

I need your love inside me I can't go on alone

By which I stand
In Jesus
I know that I would surely fall away
Except for grace

I vowed to serve you, when it was brand new

Hear my cry oh God
Listen to my prayer
From the end of the earth
I cry out to you

Lead me to
The might rock
That is higher than I
Lead me to

Let me dwell in your tent
I shall live forever
Oh to be safe underneath
The shelter of your wings

Lead me to
The might rock
That is higher than I

Where water can't be found

Do I hear the brush of wings
Or just the flutter my heart sings
Oh the comfort that it brings to me

Assurance of home, there's a hedge all around me
Every step is foreknown
By the one who is watching
He loves His own

He's sweeter than honey from out the comb; 
He's all that my hungering spirit needs,

And be held in sin's dread sway.

Crystal Lewis,"When peace, like a river, 'attendeth' my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

It is well, with my soul,
It is well, with my soul,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
Let this blessed assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed his own blood for my soul.

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

But, Lord, 'tis for thee, for thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal,
Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.",It Is Well
Crystal Lewis,"Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Jut as I am, Thy love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down;
Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove,
Here for a season, then above,
O Lamb of God, I come",Just as I Am
Crystal Lewis,"My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' Name.

On Christ the solid Rock I stand,
All other ground is sinking sand;
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace.
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood.
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my Hope and Stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh may I then in Him be found.
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

yes, I've been there before

Where their roots cry out for more
where the desert floor is dry and cracked

No change in sight

Can't put your finger on the need
I look at God and see what I want to be 
I look at me and see what I am

Crystal Lewis,"At the final hurdle of a long, long race
With the pack nippin' at your heels
Would you spring into action for the final push
Or stop for a rest on the field.
Just like that race you could slacken your pace
Fall in sin and be left behind
Or dig down deep for the will to compete
And hear the Father say, Well done as you cross that finish line you'd better

You'd better Jump! Just do it!!

As you freeze at the window sill.
Would you leap to your rescue waiting down below
Or stay there burn and be killed.

The alternative is the desire to live
Fall into the Father's arms and receive eternal life

Your mate has left you
Well, this is my advice on what you should do
Cast it on Jesus because He knows
Like before we know
How our lives should go
So don't worry be happy just like the song
There's always joy at the end of a storm
Be reborn into Jesus and expect a squeeze
But the battles like fought down on your knees
So would you please

You gotta walk by faith and not by sight
From dusk to dawn your name will be exalted
Man what you call it, rock solid.

Crystal Lewis,"Complacency can kill as a liar and a thief 
Whisp'ring thoughts of nagging 
Tomorrow's just beyond my reach 
It's ever always subtleties seem harmless for the moment 
It's venom is most bitter every time I give in 
Complacency is danger in its purest form 
It talks me into things to which I would otherwise conform 
Given my ability to give in to the easy way 
No wonder why my spirit hates my flesh 

Tomorrow is much easier to deal with than today 
But when tomorrow comes I still don't wanna change 
Why am I willing to replace a wealth of wonder 
With a life of sure uncertainty 
Tomorrow may not ever even be 

How can I combat a complacent state of mind 
I need a constant reminder of the wrong and wasted time 
I need to train my heart in ways of seeing heaven as my home 
I need to take the power given as my own 

Tomorrow is much easier to deal with than today 
But when tomorrow comes I still don't wanna change 
Why am I willing to replace a wealth of wonder

I want to do right, I want to do right

fearless in the face of danger 
Fearless though sometimes a stranger 
I'm not afraid to tell you what I found 
I'm fearless all around 

I am not ashamed 
I am satisfied

And to live is Christ 

I am not afraid 
I am not alone

though the wind is cold and biting 
I can see the sun is shining 
Though the clouds bring rain for ruin 
I see clear sky 

yet amidst my fear of dying

The gift of God now my desire 
And I watch the word inspire

Why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.
Let not your heart be troubled, His tender words I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears
Tho' by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

A part that none can bear below.

Filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins
And sinners plunged, beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, tho' vile as he
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away;

And there may I, tho' vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.
E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

And the glory of His resurrection share;
When the chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

I stayed up town, been dead broke

Born again when I heard Patsy sing

Temporary glitch but it still works

Wouldn't pour the decaf, couldn't stand the politics
I'd do it all again money don't make me who I am

Get out of line and I tend to step in
I'm no high maintenance
I'd give you the shirt off my back
I'd never hold back

I wanna say it was a good
Go a good try, I loved someone
Never found any gold at the end of any rainbow

Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so

You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Saquen los habanos, que se juntaron el boricua why el cubano, my life's en la mano, 

(Chorus) 
Scandalous (2x), so bad for me (2x), 
Dile que voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui(no verla aqui), 
Scandalous(2x), I can't handle it(cant handle it), she's more than me(shes more than me), dile que voy a pensar que me pueden matar en no verla aqui (el no verla aqui))x3 

[Cuban Link] 
(verse one) 
Yeah, yo, bori, shorty's a naughty one, 
All she wants is a forty and a blunt, 
As naughty as a front, just to get the party crunk, 
So rump, shake and reggaeton, and some puerto rican rum, 
A thong and a pair of pumps to freak it when she's drunk, 
And it's done- I got it all recorded by the tons, 
Even caught it in her buns for the right amount of funds, 
She stunts just for the fun of it, her story's just to front- 
For the chumps, I'm the one who taught her how to hump, 
How to pump, how to bump 'n grind, no frontin from behind, 
How to become a dime, she had to be one of a kind, 
Now she's something fine, sweeter than Dunkin Hines, 
Try to pump your mind up to sign on the dotted line, 
And I ain't having it, she's only for the bagging it, 
And stabbing it, the broad seen more draws than a cabinet, 
To put a cap in it, she tapped the whole hood- 
Like any ho would, I tell ya, she no good 

(Chorus) 
Scandalous (2x), so bad for me (2x), 
Dile que voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui(no verla aqui), 
Scandalous(2x), I can't handle it(cant handle it), she's more than me(shes more than me), dile que voy a pensar que me pueden matar en no verla aqui (el no verla aqui)) x5 

(verse two) 
Yo god, you part of my fam, you my man, 
Understand nigga, handle this, 
The word in los angeles is she banging in sandwiches, 
I'm in and she ran the triz, she's taking a gang of dicks, 
Far from them amateurs, I start with a scandalous nature, 
Ain't nothing you can do about it, cause you already knew about it 
Before you even started, and you're still tryin to change her, 
I'll turn in your lawyer, goddess don't be modest, 
Whatever she wanted she got it, but she still went on and played ya, 
And now you want to pout about it, thought that she was bout it bout it, 
Gave her your heart, but she just wanted your paper, 
I told you you could do without it, you was just a fool who doubt it, 
But you went at it, don't worry about it, 

dile voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui, 
Jamas podria aguantar el que si ella se va( tenga que morir)x2

Scandalous (2x), so bad for me (2x), 
Dile que voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui(no verla aqui), 
Scandalous(2x), I can't handle it(cant handle it), she's more than me(shes more than me), dile que voy a pensar que me pueden matar en no verla aqui (el no verla aqui))x5 

(verse three) 
I'm pretty sure I seen her face before, 
In a different place before, 
And it's not deja vu, 
Could have sworn that we blazed before, 
Back in the days on tour, 
Shorty I know you, 
Now I knew I seen her face before, 
She was that crazy broad, 
Who went and blazed the whole crew, 
I don't have to trace her face no more, 
I rest my case I'm sure, girl you know it's true

Ah-yo excuse me miss, how do you do, you're probably used to this,
'Cause mami chula you're the bomb and your fuse is lit,
Me-I'm coola than the farms, cause I'm smooth and swift,
The type to pull up in to your prom in a brand new 6,

I'm old school, I use the charm to seduce the chicks,
You'll introduce me to ya moms as your future pick,
Your like benita applebalm, or some exclusive shit,
Waiting for you to put me on cause I refuse to quit,

And the truth is- you make a nigga lose his grip,
'Cause I just can't resist the way you move them hips,
The way you walk and you talk with them beautiful lips,
Got a New York train of thought, so you think you the shit,

A suitable fit, you even keep your cuticles ?clipped?,
Fully equipped, heavy duty boo, you truly a gift,
You a cuty with a mind, not a groupie or trick,
Rich in beauty cause you shine without jewelry and chips

[Chorus]
Papi, please be my sugar daddy,
I want you to rule my world,
Dry kisses that taste like candy,
Can I be your sugar girl,
Just put some ice on my pinky ring,
And fly me around the world,
I owe it to papi, I need my sugar daddy,
And I'll be your sugar girl

Yeah yo yo,
Mami you sweet like licorice, deep and articulate,
Baby you look delicious from your feet to your fingertips,
Unique and conspicuous, plus your body's ridiculous,

Make me want to lick my lips and lick you where you ticklish,
Picture this- Lamborghini's, mansions and yachts, 
Trips to Tahiti instead of standing on the block,
Baby I can be your genie man and grant you them rocks,

Ice up your watch, and freeze the hands on your glock,
We can dance till we drop, in the sands of the trops,
Romance is so hot-you'll catch a tan on the spot,
Anxious to shop, I just hand you a knot,

And make you say (ain't no nigga like the one I got)

[Chorus]

Yo, now baby I'm a thug, plus a player by blood,
But we can lay in the tub, play with the bubbles while I'm rubbing ya butt,
Hugging you tight, like I'm cuffing the mic, loving you right,
So light up the candlelights, because we crushing tonight,

It's such a sight- touch you where you like it, hush and feel the tight grip,
'Cause I'm the type of private dancer that'll work the nightshift,
This kid will make you scream my name out, to let the pain out,
Once I hopped in the train I never came out,

The same wild individual from the playhouse,
Who stayed out all day at the bar, till' they said â??get outâ??,
I'm straight out the player's club,
Rocking gators with leather gloves,

Tailor-made tux showing the ladies love,
I'm way above average, I know you love Paris,
But we can ride our horse and carriage through the bronx traffic,
24 Karats Cuban Link, I do my thing, (I want you to be my sugar daddy)
You can bring it if you think you can hang, I bang bang baby

Make dragons fly, make dragons roam,
You're one in a million,

I thought I knew what you wanted me to say,

That it's the very first time I've felt this way,
It cuts me up that we;ve come to this,
It's your turn to want, I want another kiss,
the longer this situation persists,
I know your critics will glow,
And if they don't come and change soon honey,
You know I'll change my vote.

It feels so all-consuming,
It's a hunger so consuming,
You've started life inside of me.

Once again I'm gonna make it plain,
I'm much happier with you again,
I'm scared of the way you make me feel,

Because I'm rich and strange.

Headlong into some crazy scheme,

Success no more a pipe dream,
You must remember how,
Wow is to wow,
And a kiss is just too much.

From the cellar of my house comes a bellowing,
It's the tired and lonely tigers that I've kept there,
I can't imagine who the landlord's expecting,
They've been in their since June last year,
You must remember when,
You loved me like a friend,
And a kiss is just too much baby.

You must remember that,
I'm fat but I know where it's at,
And a kiss would be too much baby, let's get out of this town.

Roll auf der Piste denn ich muss mich bewegen
Ich seh' 'ne Top-Braut und sie, mich auch
Sie winkt mich zu sich rüber verdammt ich tick' aus

Verrückt als ich ihr näher komm
Bitte-bitte kannst du mir verraten wo du her kommst
Doch sie lächelt mich nur an denn sie will nur spielen

Du musst von 'n andern Stern sein
So ungeheuer, monsta sexy

Ich hab dich zum Fressen gern
So scharf wie Rasierklingen
Willst du mich zum explodieren bringen

Fahr deine Krallen aus
Kratz mir den Rücken auf
Zeig mir nochmal deine Piercings
Ich füll' ihr Schampusglas nochmal nach

Sie guckt mich an und lacht
Und sagt ich sei der
Geilste Junge dieser Welt
Doch das wird nichts ändern
Denn sie steht auf Männer

Meine Sucht nach ihr ist
Einfach viel zu groß

Ich hatte grad 2, 3, 4 Drinks an 'ner Bar
War mental schon fast game over
Auf einmal seh' ich dieses Vollweib, monsta

Sie fragt, gehen wir zu mir?
Ich sag, bleib erstmal hier
Ich lad' sie ein wir trinken Sekt
Rum, Wodka, Wein und Bier

Auf einmal passiert was Unglaubliches
Ich trau meinen eigenen Augen nicht
Die Braut teilt sich auf

Alles verschwimmt
Sie setzt sich drauf auf mich
Ich denk', wow sie hat noch
'N Gesicht

Wen soll ich zuerst küssen dich oder dich
Oh Mann bin ich monstadicht

Alk ist umsonst, weil der Barmann gefriert
Wer hat Schuld, wenn die Tanzfläche einschneit?

Und ich spüre wie das Eis zerbricht
Deine Kurven glühen im  Discolicht
Dein Körper kocht, doch du kriegst mich nicht!
Plötzlich seh' ich, wie heiß du bist,
Und ich spüre wie das Eis zerbricht
Deine Blicke haben sich festgekrallt
Du brennst vor Verlangen, doch das lässt mich kalt!

Jeder sucht im Park vergeblich nach freien Ecken
Zwischen Kippenstummeln und stinkenden Plastiksäcken

Meine Haut ist verbrannt
Ich bin trotzdem entspannt und chill am Strand

Bei dem Smog und dem Mief wird man schnell aggressiv
Nix mehr mit Peace

Ich werd' sonst noch bekloppt vom Hitzeschock

Steals across the meadows of my heart

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Cantamos por el niño y porque todo

Cantamos porque los sobrevivientes

Que cuando el viento sopla

Con la que me avivo 
Y me duermo en silencio

Everyone must feel how I do, yeah

Inflictin' in situations that most can't avoid

Juggled two big silverballs

Throwing them at me to catch

Cumberland Blues,"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my Shield and Portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, Who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.",Amazing Grace
Cumberland Blues,"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. 

Abraham Lincoln, November 19th 1863

My Country, 'tis of thee, 
Sweet land of liberty, 
Of thee I sing. 
Land where my fathers died, 
Land of the pilgrim's pride, 
From every mountainside 
Let freedom ring. 

My native country, thee, 
Land of the noble free, 
Thy name I love. 
I love thy rocks and rills, 
Thy woods and templed hills; 
My heart with rapture fills 
Like that above. 

Let music swell the breeze, 
And ring from all the trees 
Sweet freedom's song. 
Let mortal tongues awake; 
Let all that breathe partake; 
Let rocks their silence break, 
The sound prolong. 

Our fathers' God, to Thee, 
Author of liberty, 
To Thee we sing. 
Long may our land be bright 
With freedom's holy light; 
Protect us by Thy might, 
Great God, our King! A-men. 
One verse, crossed out by Smith in original manuscripts, is generally omitted. Originally the third verse, it reads:

No more shall tyrants here 
With haughty steps appear 
And soldier bands. 
No more shall tyrants dread 
Above the patriot dead; 
No more our blood be shed 
By alien hands.

Anything you want it to
One blade for breaking my heart
One blade for tearing me apart
Your six blade knife-do anything for you
You can take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin
When you come up from behind and lay it down cold on my skin
Took a stone from my soul when I was lame
Just so you could make me tame

You take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin
I'd like to be free of it now, I don't want it no more
I'd like to be free of it now, you know I don't want it no more

Cúnla,"You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

You step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Too much competition too many other places
But not too many horns can make that sound
Way on down south way on down south London town

You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
And an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job he's doing alright
He can play honky tonk just like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
And the Sultans played Creole

And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
'Thank you goodnight now it's time to go home'
And he makes it fast with one more thing
'We are the Sultans of Swing'",Sultans of Swing

The saddest thing I ever learned is relationships don't last
Or maybe I just feel that way cause of my past
Bad memories get to me when I drink mad Hennessey
feeling cold and alone even when I got mad friends with me
I'll still see something that reminds me of her
I got so used to her that without her my mind is a blur
She found somebody quick. I won't find another for a while
She was about to be my wife and mother of my child
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
and the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
like everything's changed and suddenly you don't trust her just the same
then you find out some other man's been fuckin out her brains
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain
so much that you can feel it in your veins and you can't forget her name
That's when you Literally go insane
and you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says

[Chorus]
Wise Men say, ""It looks like rain today""
Crackled on the speakers
Trickle down the sleepy subway train

[Kno]
I'll never understand how a girl can say she loves a man
and turn around and have sex with another man
I would have much rather been robbed for a hundred grand
than to get interrupted and get a call that she's touching hands
with another man. Oh God! Another man!
I can't even cry. My tears been dry. That's why it's thundering
hard out tonight and it's dark and it's cold
Cause the angels can hear me cry, and it's all in my soul
and all of them know I've never felt this pain in my past
And it's ironic the first place we made love's the same as the last
In the shower ... that's why I put the rain with her name
And my power to trust someone again has faded away
Other girls want me? Tell em it looks like rain today
I wallow in my sorrow, smoke, and watch tapes that we made
And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades
The day I almost gave up everything that I gained
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
and the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
like everything's changed and suddenly it's on tape and you crumble
cause you notice on the tape she doesn't kiss you, she just fucks you
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain
so much that you can feel it in your veins and you can't forget her name
That's when you Literally go insane
and you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says

Karma's a double-edged sword (repeated & scratched)

What do I really want in this stage of my life
I'd like a beautiful shelby that'll praise me right
I'll praise her back though, I'm not a selfish bastard
Struggle with big shit, but got this elf shit mastered
Time's are strange, I claim to be the man
Like I know G-d can understand his ingenius plan
But I'm just a simple Joe, livin low, avoiding conflict
Cookin food for stereos, so feed your CD-rom this
True, I've struggled, spent days in mud puddles
Shut up shit-talkers and made want to-be thugs huddle
The world ain't all money, suckas and violence
Quit smoke from the fire-lips, protect your iris
Shit's hard, especially hits to scar the soul
That's why niggaz drink and stress for cigars to roll
It's like the farther we go, we cover less distance
Life's a freak and it'll fuck you and all that you want in this diss dance
Cause we really fragle but thinkin' we tough
Get bowed in the heat of the battle but then we get cut
Buts back on the scene of the saddle with our heads down
Wishin' a meal and G-d would multiply this bread now

You know I, come to the fork in the world so many times
But I just keep choosin' wrong (choosin' wrong)
And movin' on (karma's a double edged-sword)
You know I, need to choose the correct path, change the aftermath
Before she sinks my song
Cause it may not be long (we ain't promised tomorrow)

I try to help out my fellow man sometimes get yellow-hands
Scared by darkness, searching for beauty like Cinderella's man
But I'm no Prince Charming I form my share a folk
Hanging my own self, bad decisions prepare the rope
Strangled by pride, suffocated by lies
Showin' my pearly whites to disguise my prize
Missin' my sister, asking the Lord why did she die
Using her death to instill strength inside of vibes
I don't want old things I done to boomerang
Feelin' low-low, for sho Deacon pursued by shame
It get rough, and ain't enough to just think positive
Cause when nobody's helping me out then its hard to give
And go and robbin' shit, runnin' game on hoes
An un-tame negro, runnin' cain for dough
Acting insane, famous for bringing pain to foes
Knowing that shit'll come back and it'll rain for sho
But I'm still out, rain-slickers in the house
Fame stickers in my mouth, cain sniffers on the couch
Walking the world and the crowds, shiftin' through trash
Not knowin' I'm feelin' like it cause I'm livin too fast


You know I, come to the fork in the world so many times
But I just keep choosin' wrong
And movin' on (karma's a double edged-sword)

Tryin' to figure out raps to put up in a song
Nights long but the day's short
Nike shorts, argyle socks, Jordan three's, lounge gear
Long beard you can tell I ain't from round here
Obvious with the occasional glare from the natives
Call em back tell my mama I make it
Not complacent with the life style
Feels good but it's hard to crack a smile
When the ones you came up with not around
Roll a joint after pickin' through the pound
Whole perception done changed
Funny how a 3 hour flight can make ya life change
Tight things I be thinkin' on
When I'm driftin' in and out of herb clouds
Hangin' on every second of the moment
So you can feel all the memories I come home with
And for those that miss me I'll be back don't trip
In the mirror with this shift kick
Ocean side, doors open wide tryin' not to be sea sick
Plottin' in the tropics thinkin' how I'm gone run ish
Back in the states when I'm leavin'

Legendary lay-up Jordan with the right-left switch,
Hang time, Hand glide, Stir fried, Chanky-eyed, Shanghai,
Candy rain, drizzle frame, I ride,
'87 Corvette ZR1, to the T-top softened,
put 'em in the trunk bitch, all gassed up, she been drinkin' from the pump,
That's all bad, tryna pass, fucked around and crashed,
Bitches all flip, Fools tryna make it last,
Emotional luggage, nothin' of it, I don't check bags,
I just carry-on, leave that bullshit in the past,
Half Rose, Sean Don, OJ in my glass,
Mimosa, Testarossa program, Prota-J curriculum,
doors open like a pendulum swingin,
Rock in my Jetset Emblem,
Fool is to serve like Wimbledon, Interior cinnamon,
the car that I'm sittin' in, Calm my bad nerves, I call her my Ritalin,
Just kiddin, not pillin', just element twistin',
From the herb come the fire and the wind I'm livin,
not pillin', just element twistin',
From the herb come the fire and the wind I'm livin,

We landed on the water, the game that I taught her
Got her showing me the Louie that these Duck niggas bought her
Its a game to us, we just hang and fuck
While she swipe your credit card on dispensary pot jars
I'm laid up, calling the front desk, tell them to send the maid up 
While we play the terrace and blaze up
These detailed lyrics is far to intricate to be made up
Not pimping, what you gave her 
Was an inch, she took her foot and kicked you in the ass with it

Was taught as a youngin' to move smart and get my weight up
Federal reserves papers by the layers, and weed by the acres
Bitches by the dozen, just watch me come up from nothin' hata
Greater things await for those who remain patient
Yeah that's real talk, matter fact a true statement
But still I grind 'cause in the end I want more than Nathan

Smokin' kush, tryna ease them thought with vapors
But my mind stuck on gettin' big faces
Racin' toward the guap, these niggas still chasin'
Runnin' in place, tryna catch up with they replacements
Made it to the majors, live from the basement
Straight to the rooftop with spacious living spaces
With cases of the Clicquot, trees in different flavors
Runnin' the game the OGs gave us",On G's
Curren$y,"Well, in these times, well at least to I
It's a whole lot of niggas trying to sound like
That's why I put the flow in a cocoon
Transform it into something new
Created my winter raps in June
Stored them in the vineyard, it'll be November when you hear em
I bought these J's in '99, you just seeing 'em now
You might see me on TV with 'em
Might see me in the streets conversating with killers
I was laid up poppin' bottles smoking loud with my bitches
I own planes to Vegas with Street Wiz and the Villain
Feelin' like it could all happen tonight
Roll the dice, if you scared turn the lights on
Thought we was all meetin' here
Where did all of these mice come from?
Stop tweeting baby girl, roll up, light somethin'
Monsta Beatz is in the speakers and I'm tryna write somethin'

One life we live, highed up
Everybody wishing they was us
It's easy to see
I, too, would wanna be the man with the pounds
And the million dollar plan

Right quick, hit a quick right
In a Chevelle '72 Double-S with the stripes
I orchestrated this organization of niggas chasin' paper
Break a pound down, have a roundtable discussion
Like, 'I think the lil' homie fucking up'
Pull him to the side, get him right, I'm getting high
Tryna keep my profile low
Hoes digging after my gold, I'm on 'em though
Commando, Rambo, ammo
Rappefied aim at a lame nigga bitch like I'm sayin'
I'm finna roll, babygirl, you playin'
Fourteen inch ? with the white walls on the Cutlass
With the suede buckets
Sold a Regal with the vouges and the mayonnaise mustard ties

Watch 'em babygirl, you could be my extra set of eyes
It's treacherous and it's live

Fast as hell, turned heads on the set
Pretty skin, soft voice, asking for rough sex
Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets,
This particular evening she wanted to ride jets
Even though I now shawty was bad news, I played it cool
Vowing to never turn sucker like them other dudes
Misreading signals, attachment issues,
Getting way too into the grip of the vagina lips
Got homies searching for relationships,
She not tryna hear my type of bitch
She ran a story to me over grape juice and Ciroc sips
Married to a doctor, cuddle master
Don't fuck her just buy her her anything tryna satisfy her
On the low, she fucking his partners, feel a void inside her
Cause she weren't fucking with a rider

My fuck game impressive so she come back steady
The shit wide heavy I can carry it
Cant get too far I mean this is a marriage bitch
She roll doobies as I paddle shift
We fuck, watch movies, end up getting too groovy
And then we smash again, she talking about him
How she feel bad about feeling so good, by giving me the ass
Bout how if she could, 
She a tell a nigga everything to get it off her chest
But she don't want see him, man,
Collecting her underwear from the rooms of my pad
She got dressed and left in a flash

Couple days roll by, 
Shawty callin' askin' if I have time
To put a couple in the air I was like, yeah
We could fly more than a pair there's plenty over here
She fell through like always
We broke it down in the hallway
She bossed her way back she don't crawl her way
Her body designed Frank Cartier
Say something talking heavy on her heart today
Telling her the situation is wrong and she should walk away
Cause her feelings was coming into play
Affecting her home life in all kinda ways
Her man askin' her whats wrong she don't know what to say,
But she do got a union to save
But she in love with the lust that we've made
She had far too much she could say
That fucking me was a perfect mistake

Homey come about it that side shit
You call your girl crib in the bed while she bumping my shit
You mad I'm at the crib cutting open vacuum bags
Pouring some of that potent for the true smoking shit my homey head
Last time I was in Cali told him he had to send me that
Ship it to the city, so I could mess some ? with them mama 
Tell them hit some of this sticky with me

Just being rhymey make her slippery, sexy pajamas when she visit me
Her friends fall through, with louder that, over talking, baller stalking
Search for eye contact so they could double back and ass G
When I have some time free, but honestly
Building this empire taking a lot of me
It will be worth it though, she good right now you found my lighter
And my grinding had to be perfect yo
And it's still, and it's still jets central motherfucker

And I stand here, get up from the feet up

Baby smoke it up, I ain't tripping I just read up
She thought real niggers was dead I made her a believer
Now she us, we a different breed
Come planning from a different species, young ? to keep it
My life is like a movie but I'm living out the scenes
I'm pulling x for the Rex I'm all about the cream
By any means a hustling scheme will fulfill my dreams

A better living fatter pockets, prettier women
Super sticky weed I'm puffing late up in the villa
South east suite metro post smoking and chilling
Waiting on my bitch to come through with some more killer
Hit her with the Deals she in love with the villain
But my mind focus on writing raps and chopping spittas
Can I get a witness to this G shit that I'm spitting
Will, it's still, it's still, jet central motherfucking

OK, girl, where shall I begin?
I told her about my lifestyle she said I'm all in
She say most niggers change you ain't nothing like them
So I got her high as hill, I'm talking the butter rim
But I never cared, mama blow it in the wind
Ain't too much changed since back then
But now I got a couple different ways to make my ends
They wouldn't last a minute if they'd live what I live

They couldn't walk a mile in these Jordan's number ten
I got that shit off like think you come again
Such a scary risk but that risk got me rich
So, where my cash for that's worth
That's why I'm buying the bridge at bay when I get it in 
Haters know the set that I rub to the end
It's crazy I keep in my ear, telling me to get paid, my reply bet I will

Lusted at luxury life since a tyke
Switches on a Monte Carlo turn a car into a trike

Chasing that paper like it stole something of mine
It did though, friends killed over small bills
I still go, hard spitting bars for them folk
Life so fragile
But the big bucks lay down the road less traveled
Cause they scared of the hazards
We living for the money, nigga we dying to have it
These hoes shaking asses doing lines
Popping valiums adding to a long list of bad habits
Niggas murdering, burglaring and kidnapping
Dashing and cashing all in the midst of the madness

I was there so I seen and I did what you up to
I know you're chasing the paper (my nigga)
I know that scared but it's there and the girls wanna fuck you

All I wanted was some rims
I had a couple girls
But I knew if I had some chrome, I could multiply them hoes by ten
Materialistic them bitches is kinda hypocritical though my nigga
Because we play the same games wit 'em
Guilty of it fuck it though

Stack up can't go far with the dealings

You think it's a game
But the game is just you
When shall you stop hiding in the heart of your night
When the cold trapway beckons
When the cold trapway stops
And Christ I was thinking of your bended arm
It's blue on the inside
It's blue on the outside
You said and then buckled as if you might die
There's no point in living
There's no point in life

And sometimes I hear you at the back of my mind
And a golden door opens but no light appears
There's spit on the bridle and there's blood on the saddle
And you slip in the shit you've shat in yourself

And oak bend not for me

Not Red-rose invisible

That beats in man
And where in the soul
That beats in this heart

And laughing is the wine

Hammering out belonging to the sky
Their wings form shutters
From Alan's window
The incense drifts past the skins and shells
Ruby waves goodbye
And runs to the valleys
That are beautiful
And drenched with rain and colours
And green was that blood then
The sap of monsoons and butterflies
When I was small the red flowers opened
And I broke letters and dreamed
Or murder and nations and Crowley's jazz
4 or 5 decades later
I am some Egyptian face
Was I in Luxor carving my name?
Was I binding cats with kindness and saws?
The green glass stinks with ash
In the broken windows
Remembered bodies
Fill the streets with novels
And the brave boys pass by
In brave pontoons
And mark graves
With pebbles that sink and shriek jingles
What was the lie in your showboat?
Or your slowboat? Were the paperweights
Calling you to statis? Or murder?
Was your soul at KostKutters or Kwiksavers?
The cats lie under pink lights
And see themselves as ponies with fur
Whilst Judas arises 4 centuries too late
And says ecce homo an
I was not the creator at the dawn or evening
But the trains walk by to Toytown
And call for fares from the wooden front
You and I were walking the calypso
Howling for teatime
At teatime the conquistadors and matadors
Are salvators and astronauts
The sea was bloody red and coupled with fury

People screaming at the top of their lungs when he'd pass

Found a note in a bottle was his body really swallowed by the sea

Und hör auf leise zweifel mehr als auf die großen versprechen.
An vielen ecken der welt fehlt erschreckend geld,
Ich frag mich on uns die indutrie nicht auch zurecht auch für deppen hält,
Wir rauchen tabak doch regen uns auf über abgas,
Saufen uns voll doch achten auf nichts zu essen was fett macht.
Ich schau mir an wie weit gras und becks mich gebracht hat,
Und merk das hat was, manchmal muß man halt weg vom alltag.
Mein alter herr macht es richtig soweit es mich betrifft.
Sicherlich er schuftet such halb zugrunde mann und das trifft mich,
Wir sitzen nachts am kamin doch er unterbricht mich
Fordert mich dann zum schweigen erfüllt das all mit gesang,
Gottes wesen liegt in einfachen dingen,
Bin froh daß beide meiner väter mir zeigen, wie ich goldene zeiten find

chorus

sehnst do dich nach goldenen zeiten?
Wenn sich dein herz meldet folge den zeichen.
Wir tragen's in uns aber wollen nicht begreifen.
Denk nicht dass ich davor gefeit bin.
Wir sehen uns nach goldenen zeiten.
Wenn ich sie götter zeigen, folge den zeichen.
Wann wollen wir begreifen?
Wenn nicht für goldene zeiten,
Wofür sollte ich schreiben?

Zu viele dinge passieren und wir können es nicht ändern,
Doch was viel schlimmer ist dass wir viele sachen passieren lassen,
Firmen bauen waffen, präsindeten investieren und lachen,
Denn wer den wahlkampf finanziert will auch gewinne machen,
Um uns beliebt zu machen sagen und tun wir viele sachen,
Wir beuten aus, heucheln uns raus und würden's wieder machen,
Die wahre last liegt bei denen die probleme sehen doch nichts unternehmen
Denn I'm endeffekt geht's um übereben, so war's wohl damals bei adolf auch
Doch wer weiß das schon, die meisten wollen von gar nichts gewusst haben
In dieser generation, und das ist gar nicht so lang her, genau wie malcolm und
Trotzdem fahren noch schiffe mit sklavenkindern in häfen rum,
Ich les viel toni morrisen und seh den horizont einzig als das was vor mir kommt,
Nicht als das was ich nie bekomm, die liebe kommt aus der seele weil ich's mir eingesteh,
Und trotz der ganzen scheisse die geht noch die goldenen zeiten seh

chrous

all der negative scheiss belastet mich trotzdem hass ich nicht,
Ich lass mich nicht verführen von allüren die wie stars vom himmel stürzen lassen,
Mcees wollen den krieg aber fürchten rache,
Viele wollen viel erzählen aber nichts verstehen als wär's fremde sprache,
Ich konzentrier mich auf mich und das was mir freude gibt,
Der mann der freunde liebt und bewunderungsvoll in die bäume sieht.
Wie kann man schlafen wenn man träume lebt?
Zeih mich zurück und akzeptier pech und glück denn das ist mein neuer weg,
Erwartet nichts ausser das ich leb wenn ich da bin,
Denn den der sich zu weit aus dem fenster lehnt trifft der fahrtwind,
Lass mich konkreter werden ich will nach dem sterben noch leben,
Und keiner von denen sein die schon beim leben sterben

ich war ne ganze weile weg, 2 jahre nose keller,
Und wenn man kinder wachsen sieht vergeht die zeit noch viel schneller,
Denk ich an max als mc: ich hatte goldene zeiten,
Hatte fans und cats die einen um erfolge beneiden,
Doch manchmal fragt das leben: was erwartest do?
Und ich war nicht froh mit dem status quo.
Ich wollt als mensch und als künstler reifen,
Hab mir gewünscht zu reisen,
Dann kam sie und ich konnt nicht anders als mein glück zu greifen.
Um's kurz zu machen, haben nen kind unseren frieden gemacht,
Unsere liebe entsprang ein unbeschriebenen blatt.
Uns es ist wieder mal nacht und ich soll schreiben,
Auf nen unbeschriebenes baltt für goldene zeiten

chorus




",Goldene Zeiten
Curse,"Ey mach mal langsam, was isn los?
Ich hör leute sagen ich hätt hip hop verraten
Und hätt keinen flow,
Ich glaub so langsam ihr peilt es noch nicht,
Zeig mir einen mc der so abwechslungsreich
Am mic ist wie ich,
Ich mein so langsam reg ich mich auf,
Ihr denkt, immer wieder wir' war fett,
Doch da leg ich jetzt drauf.
Denn, ey, so langsam bau ich was auf
Was auf mehr beruht als auf beats und raps
Doch da scheiß ich jetzt drauf,
Ich hab jetzt bock zu flowen
Und jeder begreift es,
Jeder der reif ist, und jeder der weiss
Das rap nicht nur texte schreiben
Sondern live ist.
Ihr wollt das beste, das weiß ich
Und darum knecht ich so fleißig,
Vielleicht zerbrech ich mit 30
Doch bis dahin zerfetz ich reichlich von euch
Wenn ihr meint ihr seid es
Obwohl die zeit noch nicht reif ist
Ihr werdet in ciphers schnell ausradiert
Wie zeichnungen mit bleistift,
Ich freestyle vielleicht nicht oft
Doch für dich noch reichlich,
Gib mir 2 wochen zeit,
Ich geh heim und komm und zerfleisch dic,
Ich brauch nur zwei lines für dich
Und jeder weiß das do weich bist,
Ich komm rein und burn und do brauchst
Noch fünf minuten wie deichkind,
Ich mach aus die gleich nen beispiel für alle rapper
Mit leichtsinn die meinen sie können sich
Jetzt leisten auf meine kosten zu scheinen,
Auf mein sprossen zu steigen
Und durch mich fame einzuheimsen,
Ihr wollt dick in den medien sein
Aber den gefallen tu ich keinem,
Tut mir leid ich hab keine zeit
Um mein fame zu teilen
Es sei denn do bist gesigned bei meinem label
Und ich krieg davon 10 prozent.
Da bin ich konsequent, do bist leider extra lau,
Ich bin anders als do,
Denn ich bin leider extra schlau,
Do stehst rum I'm club wie gelähmt
Von deinem extra kraut,
Ich bin anders als do,
Ich bin liebder extra blau,
Ich hab dich schon mal live gesehen
Und es war extra mau,
Denn dein ganzes konzept basiert auf bites von sav,
Ich bin immer ich selbst und schein mit meinem extra flow.
Und egal was ich tu,
Ich mach es immer extra so ,
Do willst das ich nach meiner show noch freestyle, extra so?
Tut mir leid, aber jeder ryme kostet dich extra, so.
Ich chill lieber daheim I'm bett mit meiner extra frau,
Und check ein in fetten hotels wenn ich mal extras brauch,
Ich mach was ich will, kritik,
Da scheiß ich drauf ,
Ich muss bei dir zuhaus aufs klo
Da scheiß ich extra drauf,
Do willst beef, damit ich deinen namen sage,
Extra laut, ist mir klar warum,
Doch darum verzicht ich extra drauf,
Ich zieh mich nur zurück und dann schweig ich's extra aus,
Doch wenn do nächstes mal schläge kriegst hau ich extra drauf,
Ich muss lachen über die kacke die do extra baust.
Ich glaub do brauchst die beachtung, bist darum extra dauf,
Doch scheiß auf battle, ich bin storyteller, extra gut,
Wenn ich will schreib auf kommando con der ex part two,
Do glaubst mir nicht? Dann hör mal zu:
Was ist das nur los mit uns babe,
Do bist gegangen und seit dem spür ich nur noch schmerz.
Do hast nicht nur die koffer mitgenommen,
Doch auch noch mein herz,
Und weißt do überhaupt dass leben
Ohne dich für mich schwer ist?
Ich sitz am fenster und ich starre in den garten da draussen,
Wo wir beide noch gestern saßen
Und kann gar nichts mehr glauben.
Do bist ganz einfach abgehauen und keiner weiß wo do bist . . . .
Ok, das wars nur als beweis,
Ich glaub das reicht von dem shit.
Doch wisst ihr was, ich hab noch was,
Ich kann was das kennt ihr noch nicht,
Was passier wenn ich language switch und die verses auf englisch rip?
That's what it sounds like:
Just a little preview and a soundbite,
Cause kid, I've been rhymin' before the invention of mountain bikes.
I stand on my own, and go alone against your whole camp,
Cause millionair rappers don't make half my sense/cents.
I've got a lyrical genius and sex appeal like a venus,
You get smoked like a chesterfield since y'all don't know what the deal is
Let me explain it:
My aim is to reach high where your brain is and
Massage it with passages out of my rap entertaiment,
I'm rapidly gaining the ground
I need to put up my people,
Keep my plans undercover cause they fail when I'm see-through,
The people laugh when they see you,
Even though you swear you can flow your lp might have some nice beats,
But you're lacking charisma tought,
Und ich sag das einfach mal so, weil's so ist,
Für mich ist es leicht langsam zu flowen oder doubble time zu rhymen,
Für mich ist es gelcih, denn alles real ist die cliyue die euch zeigt was wirklich rippen auf deutsch heißt,
Ich tripple die lyrics zu neuen styles,
Und kick untern gürtel wie muai thai, ihr punks reißt die fresse zu weit auf,
Ihr hört besser gleich auf bevor's knallt ich töt
Und verbuddel euch vorm wald un die bullerei rätselt am vorfall,
Ich bin immer neu wie der urknall,
Wenn do mich mal burnst ist das zufall,
Ich zermetzel euch deppen mit texten
Mein rappen begeistert den globus wie fußball.
""ole ole"" wie sind die champs in der champions league der combos.
Die größten I'm spiel wie mutombo,
Aufeinander gestimmt so wie bongos, auf curse shows ist der punk los,
Kaum geht der erste song los,
Springen chabos und hoes bei phrasen und flows
Mit dem kopf durch die decke wie ponchos,
Wir sind enorm groß, so wie die gonos von chabos in pornos,
Zerquetschen mcees ohne klasse zu formlosen masse
Wie kacke ihr homos, ihr seht was ich kann oder hört was ich kann
Drum erkennt ihr's jetzt anund ihr zweifelt nicht dran,
Ich hab immer den drang immer besser zu sein,
Immer besser zu rhymen, immer besser zu scheinen,
Komm und scheffel den schein ich will rolex mit steinen,
Ich will alles das sein was ihr wollt
Von dem mann der den rap neu erfand
Und es besser verstand als der restlich schmand,
Scharf- wie'n-messer-verstand,
Ganz egal was ihr meint
Ich verarbeit in meinem lyrics was einen aus dem gleichgewicht reißt,
Ich vergleich mich mit keinem ich bin einzig und allein unerreicht
In dem style der das leben beschreibt.

Curse,"Vielleicht haben wir uns überschätzt

Wir haben uns überschätzt
Wir haben gehofft das aus Differenzen noch Liebe wächst
Wir haben befürchtet, dass irgendwann alles kommt wie es muss
Und doch kämpfen wir Beide noch bis zum Schluss

Keiner will die Konsequenzen tragen und das ist das Dilemma

Wir wollen die Muster ignorieren, doch sie explodieren bei der Kleinigkeit
Und das ist so ermüdend
Wir haben versucht zueinander zu finden, fanden jedoch nur das wir uns selbst belügen
Warscheinlich haben wir es von Anfang an schon gewusst
Wir sind zu verschieden, dass man für jeden Frieden erstmal kämpfen muss
Wie Paradox ist das?
Wobei doch eigentlich Liebe für mich die Zuflucht sein soll wo ich Waffen fallen lass

Wir habens so oft schon zerredet, so oft vergebens
Versucht die Vergangenheit zu verändern um uns den Weg zu ebnen
Auf dem wir wachsen und leben können zu zweit
Als miteinander vereint, anstatt aneinander vorbei

Wir haben Beide das Gefühl in der Partnerschaft nicht wir selbst zu sein
Und wenn es weh tut warum tun wir es uns an?
Und wenn Glück hier drin nicht zu finden ist, wonach suchen wir dann?
Es macht mich krank das ich angeblich der bin, der die Schuld hat
Und gleichzeitig der bin, der die ganzen Lasten schultert
Angeblich der bin, der hier alles kaputt macht
Doch gleichzeitig der, der immer wieder zu dir kommt und alles gut macht

Ich will Chancen geben, nochmal und nochmal wir haben es verdient

Ich kann nicht mehr länger kämpfen, ich kann nich mehr länger stehen
Und ich kann nichts mehr für uns tun, wir 2 werden untergehen

Voneinander sturzbetrunken, Nüchternheit ""Leb wohl"" gewunken
Vom Leben so berauscht, der Kopf setzt völlig aus

Und sagst zu mir Ich sähe wie n' Modell aus

Guck dich mal an
Ich nehme dich in den Arm

In der Umarmung kann ich spüren wie schwach du bist
Doch ich lach für Dich

Und für Alles was noch kommen mag

Fragst wie es mir erging auf meiner Reise hin nach Indien
Dabei bist du Der, Der die größte 
und geheimnisvollste Reise aller Zeiten nun beginnt
Ich hör dir Augen auf und zu
Als ich ankam hast du begonnen meine Hand zu fassen 
und seit Stunden nicht losgelassen

Da war so Vieles noch nicht ausgesprochen
Zwischen Uns
Enttäuschung liegt verwundbar offen
Aber die Liebe, sie blieb ungebrochen
Wir sagen Ich liebe dich, unerschrocken
Vielleicht zum ersten Mal
Vielleicht zum letzten Mal
Wer weiß
Vielleicht ist es egal
Du hustest kleine Brocken
Denn trinken kannst du nur kleine Tropfen
Du gabst ein mutiges Geschenk

Let's get one thing straight: we don't have any answers
We are proposals in a cosmic nursery
And these massive stars -- they're just little twinkles
If I can't possess them at such magnificence
So if you can really hear me,
And you think you really believe in it
Then there must be some kind of privilege here
To putter around with such an existence
And if you see me on some stage
And you really believe it's me over there
Well, there's a chance it's not really me
Maybe we're not ourselves at all
And maybe being is simply believing that each breath we take in
Must lead to another breath out, one more breath yesterday
From yesterday -- and a timeline of yesterdays
Filled in with love or with pain or whatever bullshit we smear on our sleeves
I've found my cause, and this is it

Will we claw out our eyes?
Or will we simply close them
And let sleep seep in?

Stopped showing up for work.

Cursive,"Dear preacher, thanks for making time for me today
Hope you don't mind if I hide behind the curtain
It's been fifteen years since my last confession
By your good book's standards, I've sinned like a champion
But that book seems a tad bit out-dated

please forgive me, for questioning divinity
It's an ugly job, but I think I'm up for it
I'm not saying who's right
I'm just saying there's more than one way
To skin a religion
There's more than one way
To explain our existence

reverend, sir, I don't want to seem malevolent
My teenage angst is far behind me
But father, certainly it's troubling to see
All these people kneeling, instead of dealing
With the fact that we are all we have

so, rise up! rise up!
There's no one to worship!
But plenty of life to lose!
I'm not saying ""let's burn down the church""
But do you want to hear my confession?
It's my greatest sin..

okay, here it is:
I wasted half my life on the thought that I'd live forever!
I wasn't raised, to seize the day, but to work and worship
'cause ""he that liveth and believeth"" supposedly never dies

rise up! rise up!
And live a full life!
'cause when it's over, it's done
So rise up! rise up!
Dance and scream and love!

You're not the chosen one
And I'm not the chosen one

Even on his deathbed he's beaten
Pinned by his fiendish inner twin
Such turmoil in your head
Will it never let you rest?

Blank cake, a blank birth certificate
Blank boy made a decision
They gave you no name, gave you no name
So, you'll give yourself a name:

I am Gemini

A twin star burst into being

I am Gemini

Splattered on the orphanage ceiling
The other children ran off in terror
On your dying day, does absolution even work?
On this, your dying day, do you curse the universe
Do you wish you never were?

Lost twin screaming in the attic
No remedy, no respite
You gave him no name, you gave him no name
So, he gave himself a name",Eulogy For No Name
Cursive,"Crusted bloodstains down the nape of my neck
Concussed rhythms swelling in my bed
Who has been controlling everything I do and say?
They sure as hell have made some foul mistakes
Wait, something's shifting in this symmetry
Something's missing in my memory

Somebody's building a monster, it seems
And the parts look a lot like mine

A mere reflection of your magnitude
A replica cast across the room
A remedy for your solitude

Because you are my Sun and I'm your Moon
I am the one without a name
You are the glue; I'm bonded to you

I can see through you like a two-way mirror

No man's tried the trials you've been through
I see behind your eyes the horror that haunts you
Hanging over your shoulder
Hanging over your shoulder

Who's that misfit sitting in the corner?
The things that kid did are cloistered like a coma
Hanging over your shoulder
Hanging over your shoulder

My flesh and blood? It can't be true
You're everything I could never be
I was no one, now I'm two
You're actually here acknowledging that I am the we that makes us complete

It sure has been a lapper's life, living in these shadows
No that's not quite right
It was an illustrious life, until you eclipsed my lustre

Who was there when you dined with Dionysus?
Who'd you think that was, nourishing your hubris?
Hanging over your shoulder
Hanging over your shoulder

Who was there, engorged in Gommorah?
Who'd you think that was, dancing in the sulphur?
Hanging over your shoulder

Cursive,"There are voices in the attic
Wispy whispers past the cabinets
Filled with tawny photographs
I am stolid, I am steadfast
Where there's panic, lingers relapse
Oh, no; those breakdown days are done
This house alive
I can hear the floorboards breathe

Creak, creak

Are these angels come to take me?
If so, I'll wave my white flag willingly
I have shed my snake-skinned past
Clustered flies hinder the windows
For every angel there's a devil
Oh no, make these voices go away

I was a God-fearing boy
Sure, I stumbled more than once
But so did his begotten son

An orphan, thrown out to the wolves
Not prodigal, far worse

I was hustled, I was scorned
Made a criminal...

But I stand here reformed

There are voices in the dead of night
A child screaming, ""I am Gemini!""
Oh, what are you, and why?
Are you specter? Are you spirit?
Am I lucid, am I losing it?
Oh no, this macabre facade
These walls, paper thin",This House Alive
Cursive,"The hollow at night, a blood swollen moon
An organ-grinder, his chimp churn out of tune
Carnival lights, a barker's decree
Pickled punks, oddities, freaks, all in one ring

I heard there exists a set of Siamese twins
Sisters sharing everything - wow!

An old cabaret, the dance of the bee
Like a swan I float up on stage looking for honey
A back alleyway, cloaked in red light
Coquettes in concupiscent dress bat their eyes

What have we here in my midst?
So it's true, you do exist
Thoughts long lost come crashing in

A birthday boy in the month of June
Blew out his cake, his wish came true
Splattered blood all over the floor
Gemini, what have you done?
What horrid wolves we've become
Oh-oh-oh

Wowowow!

We are the alone
We had no one
Only ourself
Never ever leave me
Without the sun, there is no moon
Without a me, there is no you

I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Looking at the things
That I seem to see
That are filling me with wonder
And the other day
When you were just a flower
And there was a snowstorm
Right inside the bedroom
I became a bee
You became a scarecrow
And we had some trouble
'Cause we took a light bulb
Tried to turn it on
To eliminate the clouds
But it took the darkness
And it made it double

I looked up in the sun
'Cause I thought I saw a light there
Up in the air
I know it was a rose
Still it was a nightmare
Up in the air

Platinum rings
Spinning in search
Shadows on a sandpaper wall
In a duststorm
And I got a mothball
Hanging from a candlewick
And a pair of capsize
And I got a nightstick
Everywhere I look
I think I see a shadow
Everywhere I step
Is looking like dumb luck
If I had a wish
I'd wish I was a caveman
So I could fly like a goldfish in quicksand

I looked up in the sun
'Cause I thought I saw a light there
Up in the air
I know it was a rose
Still it was a nightmare

A fist full of powder
Melting like a sugartree
Standing in a rainstorm
If I had a lie
I'd give it wings
And if I had a wish
I'd wish for everything

Somewhere, sometime you believe there's a price we pay
For anger in mind, in time it will always come
back your way

Of a childhood spent alone

Something new, a love without a reason
It seems like when the lightning strikes
I need you in my life

Didn't ask for sun

Curt Smith,"Black velvet, Elvis is dead
Looks down his crown on the bed
As he's lead to the edge of town

September pardon the son
The hardest part is the one
That you hold in your hands dear

This is the perfect day to blow myself away
This is the perfect time
This is the perfect way and everyone will say
Hey, it's a perfect day

Sunday king's out for a drive
I'm taking leaves from the fire
As the gold in his eyes screams

Forecast is lookout below
Slow dances crashes and God only knows
Where he goes to

This is the perfect day to blow myself away
This is the perfect time
This is the perfect way and everyone will say
Hey, it's a perfect day

Got to tell myself it's alright
Everything that I envied
I have become

Where to now
Now that I've been lost and found
Buried in the afternoon
Breathless and snowbound

Safe as the ocean
Shine like a motor car
Seven of Sundays
Of course you are

Coming down
Ice cream and a towel wrapped around
Flowing hair that swallows me
Follows me down

It's okay
Twisted sheets and endless rainy days
Channels flash across your face
Silence surrounds you

Safe as the ocean
Shine like a motor car
Seven of Sundays
Of course you are

You're more than expected
Cool and confused
You're so easy and hectic

Tender and done for dazed and strong
I'm fine until you're gone
Against the wall you're holding onto
All that and more night and day
All that and more night and day

You're downward, you're smiling
The old man is crying
You're way too removed to
You're eager and flying

Tender and done for dazed and strong
You're fine until I'm gone
Against the wall I'm holding onto
You're all that and more night and day

All that and more night and day
All that and more night and day
All that and more night and day

Let me be, let me be, let me be?

Ain't got no money
I got to play in the alleys, ain't got no pride
Just took everything out of me, I got it sad

Got to make it alone
Got to get away from home
There's ain't no fun, my life I just run

Run on, run on, run on ghetto child
Run on ghetto child
Run on ghetto child
Run on ghetto child

You're runnin' wild
Watch a while
You see he never smiles
Father gone, alright

Boy, you couldn't miss
With a dozen roses

It is true, the makings of you
The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told them so
You're second to none

It slid in on an oily rag
The price is right up on the tag
I'll put in a brand new bag
This thing will let you be yourself
And won't offend nobody else
Nothing like you ever saw
Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time
People thinking they've been took
Just finding out they over looked
They never found the missing link
Forgot they got a mind to think
Why don't you check out your mind
Been with you all the time
Check out your mind
Check out your mind
Check out your mind
Trust in me and I in you
No matter what you see me do
I'm doing me for all I'm worth
None do be better on this earth
Why don't you check out your mind

Curtis Mayfield,"From nowhere through a caravan
Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion 
With hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark 
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman, 
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round to a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow 
How she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near 
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman

All through the caravan 
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun 
Everyone was having fun

To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood

Get down, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Get down, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left

We're all children of the world
A hungry man in search for a hungry girl
It's strange, so plain we're all cannibal
The most wasted and two faced of all animals

Get down, get down
Get down, get down

Take my soul, baby
When you reel I can feel so much desire
Take my soul, baby
Life unfolds from my soul when you start a fire

So get down, just get down

Get down, baby
As the rhythm should follow through your able soul
Get down, baby
Play the part like a pro in a perfect role

Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby

One can never point out the actual path
Of the mysterious need in a female's heart
Man can only follow not knowing how
His faith might erupt [Incomprehensible]

Curtis Mayfield,"Everybody gather round and listen to my song
I've only got one

We who are young, should now take a stand
Don't run from the burdens of women and men
Continue to give, continue to live
For what you know is right

Most of your life can be out of sight
Withdraw from the darkness and look to the light
Where everyone's free
At least that's the way it's supposed to be

We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on

Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us

And there's still a lot of faith and warmth and trust
When we keep on keeping on

Before we dismiss, one thing I insist
When you have your young, remember this song
And our world surroundings, its leaps and bounds
Ups and downs, is reality

Teach them to be strong, and when they are grown
They can proudly imply that we were an alright guy
For all the wrong now is right
This nation's people are now united as one

And we just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on

Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us

And there's still a lot of faith, warmth, and trust
When we keep on keeping on

Keep on keeping on, y'all
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keeping on
(Keep on, keeping on)

We got to move on up, y'all
(We got to move on up)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on

Some years back I remember
Still in my mind so well
My mama made this ?
And I found it never fails

Never worry too long
(Worry too long)
About what goes on
(About what goes on)
Today it's sorrow
(Today it's sorrow)
Look like joy tomorrow
(Look like joy tomorrow)

Keep on keeping on
(Keep on keeping on)
Keep on, keep on
(Keep on, keep on)

We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on

Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us

And there's still a lot of faith, warmth, and trust
When we keep on keeping on

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

We're gonna move on up

There'll be equal stay and equal play
The underground where none can betray

Brother, you know you're wrong
Think of the tears and fears
You bring to your folks back home
They'd say, where did he go wrong, my Lord?

We planned and worked hard from the very start
Tried to make him better than all the rest
But the brother proved to be so much less

Eddie is everybody's friend
But sometimes you wonder now and then
The only time he'll choose you

When there's something to lose through
His personal loss
And the friend pays the cost all the time

Must be something that's freezin' his mind
That has made him, through greed so very blind

And in my opinion I have found that
People are the same everywhere

Shed similar tears

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world",It's All Right/Amen

The righteous way to go
Little one would know

Don`t put yourself in solitude
Who can I trust with my life
When people tend to be so rude

There was no mattress for my head
But, no, she couldn`t call me Jesus
I wasn`t white enough, she said

And then she named me, Kung Fu
Don`t have to explain it, no, Kung Fu
Don`t know how you`ll take it, Kung Fu
I`m just trying to make it, Kung Fu

I`ve got some babys and some sisters
My brother worked for Uncle Sam
It`s just a shame, ain`t it, Mister
We being brothers of the damned

Keep your head high, Kung Fu
I will til I die, yeah, Kung Fu
Don`t be too intense, no, Kung Fu
Keep your common sense, yeah, Kung Fu

Don`t mistake life for a secret
There is no secret part of you
You bet your life if you think wicked

Was it dusty on the train

Then you called me on the telephone (hey baby) 
In your sweet & your softest tone (hey baby) 
Askin' me ""What should we do?"" 
When you know all the time that I'm crazy about you

We had the same conversation 
Well it couldn't have been more than a week ago 
I said ""Darlin', you're breakin' my heart 
& I don't see how I can take much more"" 
I got up & walked out of the door (hey baby) 
Walked on down to the corner store (hey baby) 
& by the time what I said took in 
I turned right around & came back again

Girl, I guess we do it 'cause it's such a groove (hey baby) 
To find somethin' that you need to use (hey baby) 
Oh baby, I love you, I swear

Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman,

She danced around and round to a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun

Curtis Mayfield,"She may not be the best lookin' woman
I ever did see
Nor have the charms of the ladies
Of high society

But the woman's got soul
Worth all money and gold
And all the love that I have belongs
To the woman with soul

Now I'm just a regular fellow
I don't need much
I don't need a Cadillac car
Or diamonds and such

But the woman that I hold
She's got to have soul
And then I'm richer than the richest gold
If the woman's got soul

Well, I don't need a woman
That's got a whole lotta class
Because class in a woman
Don't mean she's gonna last

I need a kind of woman
That when I hold she fits so tight, yeah
Oh, and when she throws it on me
I give in without a fight, then I know
