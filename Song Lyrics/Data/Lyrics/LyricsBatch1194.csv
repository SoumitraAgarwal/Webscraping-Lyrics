Suzy Bogguss,"Do you ever wonder what happened to us
Probably you don't think about it too
Much
If I could hold you I know what I'd say
But I don't even know where you are
Just that you're so far away

Far and away you were the love of my life
No one comes close I don't have to think twice
Nobody else hurt me that much
When they went away
You couldn't stay, I tried to hold on
Until the day you left me alone
Still I'd have to say you were the best love I've
Known far and away
I'm not the kind to live in the past
I can't back and the day's go so fast
I try to be strong and live for today
And it will be brighter tomorrow
But right now it's so far away",Far and Away
Suzy Bogguss,"Give me some wheels
Put me on the highway
Won't look back
Anyway I'll never be the angel you see in your dreams
Oh give me some wheels if I can't have wings

You live in a world that suits you well
But it feels like a cage to me
And the pedestal you tried to put me on
Just slipped out from under my feet

Oh give me some wheels
Put me on the highway
Won't look back
Anyway I'll never be the angel you see in your dreams
Oh give me some wheels if I can't have wings

Well you never knew me anyway
I just couldn't make you see
While you were lookin for the words to make me stay
I was lookin for my keys

Oh give me some wheels
Put me on the highway
Won't look back
Anyway I'll never be the angel you see in your dreams
Oh give me some wheels if I can't have wings

I couldn't love you any better than that
You never seemed satisfied
What I'm tryin to say is I need a man
Who don't mind lettin me drive

Give me some wheels
Put me on the highway
Won't look back
Anyway I'll never be the angel you see in your dreams
Oh give me some wheels if I can't have wings
Give me some wheels
Give me some wheels
Give me some wheels",Give Me Some Wheels
Suzy Bogguss,"These sleepless nights 
When will they end
Each one that passes seems like years
The sound of goodbye
Plays in my mind
While the rain is keeping time with my tears

If I'm gonna live to love another day
I've gotta believe 
That the heart doesn't really break
It beats on
Tonight it might be hard for me 
To see beyond the rain
But I'll outlast the pain
Somehow, someway
I'm gonna live to love another day

Sometimes I pray
Let him come back
Please let me feel his touch again
But it's time to wake
From the hopeless dream
Cause the sun will keep on rising without him

If I'm gonna live to love another day
I've gotta believe 
That the heart doesn't really break
It beats on
Tonight it might be hard for me 
To see beyond the rain
But I'll outlast the pain
Somehow, someway
I'm gonna live to love another day

Tonight it might be hard for me 
To see beyond the rain
But I'll outlast the pain
Somehow, someway
If I'm gonna live to love another day
I'm going to live to love another day",Live to Love Another Day
Suzy Bogguss,"Mamma's crying in the kitchen
Even the dog can feel the chill
She lays her head down on the table
Next to a stack of unpaid bills
Daddy comes and puts his arms around her
He says ""Girl, your stockings' startin' run
Now it ain't ever been easy
But ain't it always been fun, fun, fun""

We fell in love and there's no way out
We fell in love and there's no way out
Sometimes you just gotta laugh about it
We fell in love and there's no way out
I said no way

Daddy's cussin' in the backyard
Got the engine hangin' from a tree
Kickin' the tires on the T-Bird
He says, ""T, you ain't gettin' the best of me, not this time""
Mamma comes dancin' out the back door
Snappin' a dish towel in her hand
She says, ""Don't you be wastin' all that good energy
Don't you know how I love a sweaty man-oh-man-oh""

We fell in love and there's no way out
We fell in love and there's no way out
Sometimes you just gotta laugh about it
We fell in love and there's no way, no way out
I said no way out

Fell in love and there's no way out
Fell in love and there's no way out
Fell in love and there's no way out
We fell in love and there's no way out
We fell in love and there's no way out
We fell in love and there's no way out
Sometimes you just gotta laugh about it
We fell in love and there's no way, no way out
We fell in love and there's no way out
We fell in love and there's no way out
Sometimes you just gotta laugh about it
We fell in love and there's no way
No, no way, no way out

Suzy Bogguss,"If I lose my concentration
Disappear from the conversation
Don't mind me
I'm saying goodbye to a friend

I try to start each day out cheerful
But if my eyes get blue and tearful
Please understand
I'm saying goodbye to a friend

I broke a dish while I was washing dishes
Fell to the floor in a million pieces
It's not just something you can pick up in your hand
These little that shouldn't matter
Make something inside me shatter
And I'm on my knees
Saying goodbye to a friend

[Chorus:]
It's like the end of an era
Like a scene in a rear view mirror
I thought I'd got past it
Now I'm looking at it again
Saying goodbye to a friend

All our secret dreams and fears
All that's left of those hard earned years
Kick up like dry leaves
And drift off on the wind
Just when I think I've let it go
I catch a chill and that wind will blow
I'm out in the cold
Saying goodbye to a friend

[chorus]",Saying Goodbye to a Friend
Suzy Bogguss,"They sat at the table, polite conversation
Avoiding the issue at hand
Then he made the coffee and she did the dishes
And sat down at the table again
She waited a moment hoping he would speak first
Though it never had happened before
He sat there in silence expecting the worst
'Til she couldn't wait anymore

[Chorus]
She said ""I'm mad""
He heard ""I'm leaving""
She said ""I need your attention""
He heard ""I want you to crawl""
She said ""I'm sad""
He heard ""it's all your fault""
There is no translation
Emotions don't fit into words
There's so much between what she
And what he heard

She said ""I love you"" that's not the problem
And I know how much you care
But for too long now we've been walking on eggshells
I just had to clear the air
He looked at her like she was speaking Chinese
With some of the letters left out
Try as he may he just didn't know
What she was talking about

[Chorus]

Then he started smiling
And she started laughing
They both reached out their hands
She said ""I think we're from two different planet
No wonder we misunderstand""

[Chorus]","She Said, He Heard"
Suzy Bogguss,"I'm pulling my suitcase down
Packing the things I need
Just a change of clothes
And a porcelain rose
You once gave to me
Leaving the guilt behind
I'm not gonna take the blame
Got too far to go to be carrying stones
When I roll away

I'm traveling light
No baggage this time
And no bitter memories
Weighing on my mind
I'm facing the wind
And I'm ready to fly
Anywhere my heart takes me tonight
I'm traveling light

It might be another town
It might take a year or two
But I'll find what I lost
And I'll have what I thought I had with you
It could be an uphill fight
Or maybe a winding road
All I really know is for me 
there's only one way to go

I'm traveling light
No baggage this time
And no bitter memories
Weighing on my mind
I'm facing the wind
And I'm ready to fly
Anywhere my heart takes me tonight
I'm traveling light

I'm facing the wind
And I'm ready to fly
Anywhere my heart takes me tonight

Suzy Bogguss,"There was a maple tree in our front yard
When I was growin up, I'd climb up to the top
And watch my brother trading baseball cards
My Daddy pulling weeds, mother callin me
I was hiding in the leaves

And the world looked fine as fas as I could see
From the top of the family tree
A hundred branches growing 'round me
Way up there in the family tree

When I was seventeen, I left that town
My life was right on track, I never once looked back
I was so sure that I was glory bound
I gave it all I had and when it all went bad
Got a phone call from my dad

And the world looked fine as fas as I could see
From the top of the family tree
A hundred branches growing 'round me
Way up there in the family tree

Now I'm older and my husband laughs at me
I'm building houses for the kids up in a tree

And the world looks fine as fas as I can see
From the top of the family tree
A hundred branches growing 'round me
Way up here in the family tree",Family Tree
Suzy Bogguss,"Funny,we should meet 
The three of us here on the street
You know I've wondered what I'd say
Now the moment's here
And suddenly it's crystal clear
Some things are never gonna change

From where I stand I see an old familiar story
Only the last time I was in your shoes
Now it's looking like it's my turn to be lonely
And I tell you I don't like the view

I was just like you
For me he left somebody too
And I didn't care if that was wrong
Oh but now I've found
The tears you cause come back around
And they're coming your way before too long

From where I stand we've got a lot in common and
There's a good chance you'll be standing one day
right here
Chorus",From Where I Stand
Suzy Bogguss,"He was a giant
Swung a heavy hammer in the bottom of a mine
But he always came up smiling, a light within his eyes
Now there is a skeleton that I don't recognize
But it is not the coal that has him fading fast
It's a love gone forever that he thought would last
That he can't get past

I wish hearts would break
It wouldn't be quite such a beating to take
Why don't they give in
Instead of coming back over and over again
Oh I wish hearts would break

She was an angel
Arms open wide, never met a stranger
Now she withdraws at the slightest touch
Like an animal that's beaten one time too much
But it was not an angry hand that hurt her so
It was a gentle one that she used to hold
That let her go

I wish hearts would break
It wouldn't be quite such a beating to take
Why don't they give in
Instead of coming back over and over again
Oh I wish hearts would break

Suzy Bogguss,"You thought I was dangerous, I thought you were cool
I met you in a parking lot one day after school
We didn't have no money, we didn't have no sense
You jumped in beside me, and then we jumped the fence.

We had just enough gas to get to Memphis
Just the right song playing on the radio
Just enough highway to push the limit
You and me baby and just enough rope

Oh, just enough rope
Barely hangin' on, barely in control
You and me baby and just enough rope

I was wild about you, you gave me your heart
We made a solemn promise to never be apart
Days turned into months yeah, we were runnin' free
You and me together and baby makes three

We had just enough pride to think we'd make it
Just enough ride to know the way to go
Just enough time to find a preacher
We tied the knot with just enough rope

Oh, just enough rope
Barely hangin' on, barely in control
You and me baby and just enough rope

We could have hung ourselves out to dry
But we wrapped it around you and I
Then we pulled it tight
Here we stand ready to turn another page
Some things just get better with age
I've been lovin' you since I can't remember when
I said it before and I'll say it again

We got just enough fire to keep it burning
Just enough dream to never give up hope
Just enough love to last forever
We keep it tied together with just enough rope
We kept it all together with just enough rope

Oh, just enough rope
We're still hangin' on we're still going strong
Just enough rope
Oh, just enough rope
'Round and around and around we go",Just Enough Rope
Suzy Bogguss,"(Cheryl Wheeler)

I Don't need moonlight and roses
I don't want you to stand here and tell me lies
I know what you're feeling, I think I know why
Please don't let this love go by

It's so hard to think in the long run
And it's so easy to stand back and drift apart
There's nothing you'd ask me that I wouldn't try
Please don't let this love go by

Don't let this love go by
Don't you feed another flame
And let the first one die
You might believe you can take it in your stride
But these things go bad every time

I feel a whole lot of heartache and bad times
Comin' on like a fast train for you and me
There's a change in your voice, a stranger in your eyes
Please don't let this love go by

Don't let this love go by
Don't you feed another flame
And let the first one die
You might believe you can take it in your stride
But these things go bad every time

I don't need moonlight and roses
I don't want you to stand here and tell me lies
I know what you're feeling, I think I know why
Please do't let this love go by

Darlin' please don't' let this love go by

Suzy Bogguss,"She was all alone at half-past four
At an all-night small-town convenience store
When he walked in and locked the door behind him.
She ducked down behind the counter
He said ""Get up, I know you're down there
I got a gun.  Just hold on, I'll find it.""
He fumbled through  the pockets of his faded denim jacket
Handed her a note and said, ""You'd better do exactly what it says...""
And she read:

""Nobody love, and nobody gets hurt.""
She looked at him with a nervous grin
She pointed to that word
He said ""What the hell? I can't spell
But you know what I meant.""
She said ""Yeah,
But that ain't what you said.""

She said ""I don't think you want to do this
Sounds to me like there's more to it.""
He said ""Spare your views on my abusive childhood.
Cause the last time I saw my old man
Was in a photograph in our garbage can
He never gave a damn, so tell me why I should.
And you don't know the half of all the demons that I've battled
You ain't gonna save me with your mindless psychobabble
I'm damaged goods.""

""Nobody love, and nobody gets hurt.""
And as he walked away in the pouring rain
She still could hear that word
He said ""What the hell? I can't spell
But you know what I meant.""
She said ""Yeah,
But that ain't what you said.""

She said ""Yeah,
But that ain't what you said.""","Nobody Love, Nobody Gets Hurt"
Suzy Bogguss,"Your mascara's runnin' and your hair is a mess
And what have you spilled on your party dress
Sittin in the kitchen all broken hearted
Lookin' for comfort in an ice-cream carton
But all you want,all you really want

Is somebody to love,you want somebody
Oh you've got to be strong 
It's not enough to want somebody
Just cause the night is long
You've got to be tough and hold out honey 
'cause what you really want is somebody to love

I've been to all of the places you go to
And I've danced the tango with Casanova
The wine and the roses are so continental
But the champagne is flat and the tux is a rental
All you want,all you really want

Suzy Bogguss,"Take me back, take me back, take me back to your heart
Can't you love me again like you did at the start?
There's a weight on my shoulders and I know I can't win
Take me back, take me back again

I would call you to plead but I don't have the nerve
'Cause the thing that I need, I do not deserve
The way I was careless with your trust was a sin
Take me back, take me back again

If my love was fire, it would burn this house down
With all of the lies that were told
But it's only a fever that burns me inside
From the longings of a broken-down soul

Now the wind's blowing through and it's crying for me
'Cause it knows I was not what I wanted to be
And the sky must be sorry, 'cuase it's starting to rain

With all of the lies that were told
But it's only a fever that burns me inside

Suzy Bogguss,"Little Towns andneon signs fade away inside my mind
There is only one thing I can hold on to
I see pictures in my head replaying every word you said
Every memory's like a thread running through
Everything I do, leads me straight to you

This train of thought keeps coming back
It must be on a one-way track
It never stops
Just picks up steam
And I can't get off this train of thought

I've tried everything I swear
Television, solitaire
But all I do is sit and stare, dusk 'til dawn
I don't know where this heart is bound
The wheels keep turning 'round and 'round
I don't see 'em slowin' down

Suzy Bogguss,"When I see the way you look at love I feel so blind
'Cause I don't know how to give that much to you
And when I think of what it means to love forever I get scared
That I won't be strong enough to see it through
And about that time I don't know what to do

And when I run, it's only cause I don't know how to stay
I don't know how to get my feelings out of my way
It's not you, and it's not fun
I know tryin' to hide is crazy
Walking out won't save me
My demons only chase me when I run

In your arms I am sound and safe from my own harm
Or at least you always make me feel that way
It's only when I turn away from you that I get lost

It's not you, and it's not fun
I know tryin' to hide is crazy
Walking out won't save me

And how, tell me can I turn around
And face these feelings chasing after me
And why are there still so many things
You know about that I can't even see?

Suzy Bogguss,"Standing in the back yard where our love used to grow
Big September moons above
Your garden needs a little tenderness I know

Can you feel it where you are

Gonna need some rain here pretty soon
My field of dreams is lying fallow

I've got an empty heart and a harvest moon

I guess you're over that for good
It's not that I believe at all you're coming back again

One day I'll talk to you
One day it won't be your voice mail I'm talkin' to
You won't have to say all that much
Just tell me where we lost touch
And if there's a chance of some new version of the way it was
You've got my number, you pick the time and pick the town
You're out there somewhere, it's your move now

I need a lifeboat that's set to sail
Across this ocean of tears I've cried

There's poetry in all I see, look what love has done 
And my heart is dancing through each day

Where once I hardly felt the beating in my chest
Now each breath feels like a precious kiss of life
Now inside me beats the winds of a thousand butterflies

This must be how it's mean to be, look what love has done

Was that lightning striking where I stand

Suzy Bogguss,"I'm alive and well
Just in case you're wondering
When heavy weather thunders at your window pane
The last time I fell
I broke down to nothing
Come to find out something had remained

You know that I believe I should be good as gone
But still I stay just a little bit longer
The only reason why I am holding on
The hurt was strong, so strong
But love is stronger

For the longest time
I all but gave up
My mind was made up I had tried my last
But your hand in mine
What a sweet reminder
Why love puts blinders on the heartaches of the past

You know that I believe I should be good as gone
But still I stay just a little bit longer
The only reason why I am holding on
The hurt was strong, so strong
But love is stronger

And there's no place to wear it so what do I care

And I wonder how we got hung up here
I'm going someplace to ease my mind
Wide open with space, I gotta to find

No place in particular
It's out there I know
Gonna pack all my dresses up
Got no place to go

There's a face in the mirror I recognize
But I remember it clearer and smoother around the eyes
But I don't need makeup to cover my tracks
I just need to wake up someplace, new and never look back

Suzy Bogguss,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Daddy's figured it out by now
She's long gone
To a town she'd heard in a song
On the radio years ago

On a bus
Frankie offers her last cigarette
To someone named angel
On the ride she tells a tale
Of dreams undone and those to come

Oh, oh, oh
Maybe we're not alone
Oh, oh, oh
Maybe we're not alone

On the aisle
A man turns to say
I've got nothing to hold me since she went away
Angel says hey man, Frankie and me
You know we're startin' new just like you

So they ride
Side by side by side
Into the darkness
Every mile that they're passin' through
Just makes them think it could be true

But surrounded by
Silent points of light that fight to be seen
In a world that's quick to cast it's shadow
And douse the beams

It's the end of the line, time to go
So Frankie wakes angel

Just some town
This is just some bus
But it's far enough
For the three of us

Svenska Hotkvintetten,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

Swallow the Sun,"The strength of her pulse is breaking her chest
She's getting wet from this feverish writhe
The midnight's cruel for a lonely girl
When the unknown slowly undresses her breasts

The voice and her eyes wide shut
Her fever burns a mark on her bed
The path that she runs among these silent trees
Leads her body for me to claim

The veil of fog covers her velvet skin
As she kneels naked under the moon

The whispers from her lips and her screams
Invite me to her ecstatic flame, over and over again

Her bed is covered in dirt and leaves
And she's burning down on her knees
Midnight's cruel for a lonely girl
And she's getting wet from this feverish writhe",Deadly Nightshade
Swallow the Sun,"One night it happened
The morning never came
It has been snowing ever since
The plague of cold harvests the land
And only few still wait for the sun

Cities are buried under white curse
Remains of the man lay on the glacial ground
The monuments of ice curve upon us
Leading our way to the bitter end

One night it happened
The morning never came
The clocks tick anew this same hour of dark
And if we had only known
That it would last forever
We would have forgiven ourselves
And let the snow bury us together

One night it happened
The morning never came
Now it's been seven years ever since
The season of dark fell upon us
And only few still wait for the sun",The Morning Never Came
Swallow the Sun,"Now I'm a grey old ghost
Weeping in winter trees
And searching for a soul
Waiting for a voice to come

She was worth dying for
It is my severed woes I cry
Her eyes were pale like dawn
Out of this gloomy light

I'll wait there forevermore
The light holds us forever more
Still one second I wouldn't give away
Cold winter nights, I cry on your grave
Why won't you come?
Why won't you come?

As she is dying in the snow
The moonlight silently glows
Her tears flow down her cheek
When snow falls from the trees

I'll wait there forevermore

Deep black universe upon me
I'm enchanted by this warm light
Yet nothing can melt my cold soul

Whispers from the deep black waters
Ice would keep the ghost's silent
Their mournful song freezes my heart

Come down where the embers burn
Let the night embrace you
And just before the morning haze
You will disappear without a trace

When the fog raises the dead again

Will take away my pain",Under the Waves

Winter turned his frozen mouth
Tearing down the voices of living
Leaving bodies buried in ice

The wrath of distant clouds
And the weeping of the ground, it will come
Cold wind carries the voice of doom
Singing songs for the damned

Descending winters for all lands
All hope is gone in his hands
Out from the north into the south
Winter turned his frozen mouth

Slaying the oceans and darkening the sun
With little breeze, it will come
Enormous tide of burning cold storms
He will cleanse the land with single breath

Descending winters for all lands
All hope is gone in his hands
Out from the north into the south
Winter turned his frozen mouth

No shelter can save us now
As the winds come roaring
There is no place to hide
The final season is close at hand

Swallow the Sun,"Sinking in the depths of her warm caress
But the dagger I hide won't shed forgiveness
Her secret is revealed or am I wrong
Though her flesh is weak, my hand is strong

There slow days and endless nights
I've learned her ways
There open wounds and bleeding scars
Led me to her burning trails

I've been watching her silent sleep
Catching names through her sleep

The truth that lurks behind those eyes
When she grabs her pillow tight
So stay with me awhile and enjoy the fire
The flames that blaze in my eyes
Are your jury and your last trial

I've been watching her silent sleep
Catching names through her sleep

The vipers dance around her neck
When she slowly turns her cheek
It's getting late to leave this all
For I have found the cure
The burning touch of her innocence
And her eyes so pure

I could love her but I can't forgive her
So it slowly slides inside her",Forgive Her...
Swallow the Sun,"I remember her
Dark flowing hair
Eyes like deep blue waters
And her skin so fair

I remember her
How she used to sing
Melodies so full of sorrow
Dreams in the making

She was so fragile

Lying on my arms, not breathing
I can still hear the echo of her voice
And now as I hear them coming
I take her to our last dance

I remember her
Delicate beauty
Her eyes so wise and knowing
When she looked at me

She was so fragile

Lying on my arms, not breathing
I can still hear the echo of her voice
And now as I hear them coming
I take her to our last dance

The red haze fading
My vision regaining
And on my arms I see her lifeless body

Realizing what I've done
Anguish grips my heart
I close her eyes for the last time and she'll sing no more

She was so fragile

Lying on my arms, not breathing
I can still hear the echo of her voice

Swallow the Sun,"The fountain runs quiet
Through the emerald steps and lavender air
The statues praise the beauty of hers
Flowers bloom around her marble breasts

Silver drops of the open night sky
Light this ruined garden
The vines hanging on pillars and walls
Gather the light over the water

Cold serenity lies within these secret halls
Embracing me in her essence
The air so calm and still, and her voice
Leading me deeper, deeper inside

Through the water and floating leaves
I'm following her soft call
Into the throne of her fertile loins

In the flame she was moving slow
Whispering passionate words
As she breathed frost
Out of her warm, wet mouth
She felt like the ghost of Laura Palmer",Ghost of Laura Palmer
Swallow the Sun,"Falling from my life deep to the sea
Drowning from living to the depths of me
Like the water that burns in my lungs
And the light that slowly fades above me
I'm bleeding rivers and they carried me to the sea
Crushing in this pressure, turning to stone

Roots rip my flesh and fill my skull
As worms dance around my drowning body
Feasting for the one that has gone
But I'm arriving, closing the door, ocean floor

Seven steps from my cradle
Closer to the end with every breath
What is this hell that was made for living?
I am arriving

The giant has grown too big inside me
Mountains of black stone, a volcano of dirt
When it went wrong? Why am I here now?
But not for long

Climbing up from this nest of nothingness
My faithful steps behind me
Marking my trail with circles, a path for you all
We've been ripped out from the womb
Through blood and pain into this life, and we cry
Ripped out, given, but made to be taken away

I've been hiding this giant for too long
And it's grown like a parasite inside me
Under this shadow I've been walking
Now it's taken over me, and she
The pure girl, leave me before it's too late
Or I will cut your wings

For I can't control this that burns
It flows inside, through my every vein
It fills my fingers and burns my throat
Chains my heart again
Insane pain

I throw myself into this stream
And let it take me down, underground
Here I end, from here I begin
The line is broken like my fragile body

Flesh rots before the giant's eyes
As he awakes from his silent rest
Rips open my chest, steps out from this crest
Don't take over me please, leave this lonely man,
Please leave.",The Giant
Swallow the Sun,"The velvet fog came after the sun wept her last rays
Shedding her tears for the night,
The night she will never see
The all-seeing eye, the dead light of luna
Watched as the gloom gently close the flowers
But the ones I laid upon her
Stayed open to mourn my loss

The night air never hurt so deep
As it whispered praises of despair
To keep in this lonely heart

These fingers cut the wet flesh
Bleeding red rivers through my face
On my weak knees I wpt, but death stayed there
Until I lost her to gloom, beauty and despair

Please open your eyes
Please don't fade away
I won't let you leave me
I'll follow you through it all
Wherever it will lead me
I will follow

Deeper into the pain
Further away, for her
I step down to where tears remain
Over the frozen rivers
Through the land of the dead
Forever lost and bound in woe
Of my ropes of sorrow I wouldn't let go
They hanged me to this place I fell
Alone and blind I travel in my hell
Forever and forever and forever alone","Gloom, Beauty and Despair"

Swallow the Sun,"It came with the nightfall
The dark that swallowed the stars
One by one it painted them black
And brought horror to our hearts

It came down in the shape of rain
A wall of black waters
Spreading the end to the earth below
And I ran and left them all

Away from those dying voices
I escape the eye of the doom
The triumph of fear and ending lives
And I left them all and ran
Until I reached the shore

The waves greeted me with majestic mourn
To the sea I shed my last hope
And the ocean carried me away

The sound of ending world was fading
Until I only heard my heart in despair
Closed my eyes and fell into a sleep
Relieving dream of the distant sun

""Awake"" whispered the sea

From the hope of a hunter's bow

Rip your arrows out
And make them cut deeper
Crush my mouth, for it still sings praises to you
Run the blood out from my throat
For I'm still yours

When the curtains fall
And silence the pain""

To drink and depression

And I'll keep them with me

And I need your intelligence
And your hate for authority

Face down in the street
With a bottle in your hand
And a wild smile on your face
And a knife in your back

Rolled up in your pocket
Where I said I'd kill myself

And the sun is an emptiness, that burns through the sky
And this ground it will slide down, down into the sea
And when this body dies, no man will ever breath one word
Of ignorance, for me
So bury your trust beneath the ground with me
And lay your loneliness down for the sun to consume
Now the earth bleeds cold water, in my open hands
But their bodies bleed poison, and they swallow the sand
And we'll walk to the river, where we will die of a thirst
And my fate, it's no question: every fool he is broken

When she breathes, when she thinks it once
In the field, steel grass will grow

And from Heaven, she'll rain down the sun
And turn the living into sand
And we breathe her holy air
And we walk this poison place

Made from an emptiness where time was never
Dreamed by one mind so sad as mine

When she thinks it once, when she breathes in me",When She Breathes

And every lie that you pursue, eventually turns true

How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all
I saw you standing in the fire, beneath a crimson moon
The ocean whispered on the sore, and echoed in the ruins
Inside your body is a clear blue light, and time was made from this
Your shadows swallow everything it feels. You punish us with bliss

Some people live their life, with a violence that's pure and clean
But I saw a man cry once, down on his knees
In the corner of a darkened cell, and his pain meant nothing to me

But I was younger then young men never die
When I walked out in the sun, I was strong, clear-minded and blind

Now don't say a prayer for anyone, it doesn't do any good
Please don't ask me questions, it'd just be misunderstood
And if you could step inside me you'd feel what hatred brings
And if you saw with my eyes, you'd see what self-deception means

And though my body was strong, I was self-diluted, confident, and blind

Because when we're drinking, we can never be filled
Show some understanding for a lonely fool
Because when I'm drinking, I am out of control

And saw your body rise over the ocean

We saw the golden boy bleed love
Onto the sand like rain
While we were injecting colours
Into our open veins
And deep beneath the water
The dead black silence crawled

Far away across the ocean
The golden boy's beneath the sea
The golden boy swallowed by the sea

And love is sometimes violent
And violence has no constraint
And I can see inside you
Yes I can feel what you think
And with this knife of silver
I will release your soul
And throw it out into the ocean

Nine million miles in a straight line
In a place just like this
In a ship on the water
Where no dimensions exist

And the image it shifts
I tear it up and scatter it over the ocean

And earth rolls away in
Darkness, and I ride a piece of
Lightning,
Killing time, killing time

Now they punish our imagination, and
Corrupt our blood with fear,
And infinity's beneath the ocean, but

Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, see now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'

Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway & Tech

Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do

Never test me without proper authorization
My lack of patience has cause me to get mad
And explode right in front of your face like a airbag
Your rhyme is fake, your brain is child's play to manipulate
I create lyrics too intricate to imitate
Movin at a velocity
That'll break your stop-watch if you're clockin me
My concrete jungle is like Jumanji
But iller than what you seen in the cinema
A five foot eight nigga wit more horsepower than twelve cylinders
My brain consists of twin pentium chips
That's double the clock speeds of a 5-86
And nuttin about my physical matrix is basic
I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tastin
You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes
It's like explainin color to a man that was born blind
One of a kind, I got divine chromosomes in me
My sperm'll scramble the eggs in a women's ovaries
'cause I'm as original as it gets
And I can't respect, niggas that copy like double-decks
I get vexed, when crab punks bite my style
'cause I'm sellin a thousand records per day, per square mile
Breakin the laws of phsyics, wit metaphors and lyrics
Speakin to dead poets by conjuring up they spirits
From Shakespeare to Edgar Allen
Yo, the whole Dead Poets Society couldn't mess around wit the talent
Much less understand it

You see me standin' outside of your buildin' screamin'

""Puffy is good, (hey!) but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (wait!)
I look at my life in a new light, fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted 
Cause I don't like rap anyway

I'm just tryin to get my porno career started

Study these 5 chapters
Lesson one,
Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers

Lesson two
Face 'em and dis 'em (what up dog?)
Don't give em a demo, kidnap em (I want you to come with me)
And make em come to your basement and listen 
(you're gonna fuckin' check this out)

Lesson three,
Get a job at a label, switch demos with Canibus 
And put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)

Lesson four 
Know you heard this before
""Hey let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan, you want to get signed?
Get the Withest A and R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson Five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street, I ain't 
Givin' you shit bitch, don't even bother askin' me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin' like Master P 
Got a blow job from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones (Ow!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah (""It's all about me.."")
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea (""You're a dick!"")
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin' Aaliyah

You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh 
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with 'Agent Orange'
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here!)

Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nut-sack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back

Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher

While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease

Flashin' back to being shot and repeatin' the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke

You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad""
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
""He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad""

Sway & King Tech,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you 
Without a strong rhyme to step to 
Think of how many weak shows you slept through 
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you 
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss 
The rhymes from the microphone soloist 
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon 
As you hear it  pump up the volume 
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow  
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go 
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control 
Your body to dance (You got it) soul, 
Detects the tempo like a red alert 
Reaches your reflex, so let it work 
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit 
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit 
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go 
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago 
It can be done but only I can do it 
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it 
I start to think and then I sink 
Into the paper like I was ink 
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, 
I escape when I finish the rhyme 
I got soul
 
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul 

Picture a mic, the stage is empty 
A beat like this might tempt me 
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain 
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train 
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this 
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss 
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it) 
Rakim will begin when you make the mix 
I'll experiment like a scientist 
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list 
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold 
You want it next? then you gotta have soul 
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore 
Take the mic, make the people respond for 
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be 
If you want to get on after me 
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
Forget it and don't waste your time 
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
This is how it should be done 
This style is identical to none 
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me 
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me 
I drip steam like a microphone fiend 
Eager to MC is my theme 
I get hype when I hear a drum roll 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came 
To teach those who can't say my name 
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller 
Rakim gets stronger as I get older 
Constant elevation causes expansion 
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion 
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it 
Then on the radio the R's requested 
You listen to it, the concept might break you 
'Cause almost anyone can relate to 
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles 
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
Or should I just let him melt? 
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt 
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got 
Get off the mic before I get too hot 
I want to see which posse can dance the best 
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh 
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, 
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, 
Even other states come right and exact, 
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at 
Since you came here, you have to show and prove 
And do that dance until it don't move 
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, 
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

Smacked a second time, but on a different assignment
And do a sucker new jack who needs a rappin' alignment
Cause I'm the cream of the crop when it's time to do a show
Girlies on my jock for my dope intro
As I glance at E-Double, kickin' microphone wrecker
Turn on my cordless, sayin' mic checka
To the ladies and all party goers
Some call me freak, and others slow flower
Brothers on my jock, for the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

Puttin heads to bed, straight out the box
MC's, are jumpin' out shoes and socks
I'm not playin', understand what I'm sayin'
Catch a sucker in my way, and I'm slayin'
Takin' no shorts, so I'm vital sign
You can tell by my lines that I'm gettin' mines
in eighty-nine, because I'm fine as wine
Sit back and recline, watch the sun shine
Take a stroll, listen to rock and roll
Catch a flick at the movies, dance a bowl
What I chose I refuse to slack while I'm back
I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh my style is def, and as deadly as crack

While I'm slayin' must explain, a sucker is the lame
Battle in the trenches where the funky be playin'
Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
A kin not blood related, but you can call us cousins
Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like I'm Housin', You Gots Ta Chill, and more
The proof is in the pudding (yo check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we was bold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin'
So what you sayin'

Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes the Boy Wonder
No fouls no bleeps no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin'
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
""So amazing, and I've been waiting""
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
Cuz me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
Cause you was Memorex, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all out battle, P comes out swingin'
Cause I'm just that type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
and get mines on time that's why most resign
Sit in my LazyBoy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine
So what you sayin'
So what you sayin'",So What Cha Sayin'

All the ugly people be quiet!
But before we get this party started right
Hey Cash! [Tell the people what you're the king of]
Verse 1
Just clap your hands, just make your hands clap
To Marvelous the mic marvel, dictator of rap
Get on the dancefloor, let me see what you got
'cause the sound we're throwin' down it makes you want to rock, ha
Hurby Luv supplying the beat
They make my rhymes sound fresher to the highest peak
A-check it out, check it out, get down
A wild style form of rap, my dazzling sound
The style I'm reciting, just reciting my style
The double words, words double but I call it wild
So girl just keep grabbing, keep grabbing my tip
Long as the money's flowin' everything is legit
'cause my rhyme is on time, on time is my rhyme
Already on top, ain't no need to climb
And to the bone, he shocked the record down to the bone
Call him Cash Cash Money but his name is Jerome
The green-eyed brother, brother with the green eyes
He shakes your booty, boom shaker from 9 to 5
So listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet
Verse 2
This is a hard rocker that will rock your house
Turn up your radio and stereo and check it out
It's crazy wild and illy, bang boomin' your butt
My name is Marvin call me Marv the wacky Marvelous nut
The raving rhyme roller, rock roller that rolls
Gettin' laid, stayin' paid so you know that I'm cool
The stunning smashing super, super serious sound
The devastating death defying dictator who's down
The mighty hard rocker who's rocking your butt
And everybody check him out, Cash Money's on the cut
Verse 3
Boy, I'm rough and I'm tough, never pullin' your bluff
I'll turn a hard rock heckler to a cream puff
Got rhymes and rhymes, gettin' better with time
Hit so many def lines you have to rewind
Play it back, listen, observe my rap
'cause my lyrics are strong, and it's like that
In Philly down the way, hard rockin' alone
Marvelous and Cash Money, Marv and Jerome
We make your party hearty and say [La-di-da-di]
Verse 4
Bass boomin', bass boomin' but I'm not done yet
Gonna make it real funky on your def cassette
My mic is sweatin' with steam, when I hear the crowd scream
People, ugly ugly people is the name and the theme
I'm the microphone master, money makin' man
And I got more rock than Bon Jovi's band
Cash constantly controls, corresponds the mix
He's my homey, he's my DJ, he's my sidekick
So as you listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet

somewhere in outer space.""

""The mysteries of creation are there.""

""Up in the sky?""
""Up in the sky.""

""The moon and the planets are there.
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.
And therefore as we set sail; we ask God's blessing --

""Prepared for liftoff.""

I self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
and watch another C-Cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combine, over the frontline
The ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down

Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred -- triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome; I span the universe
and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down
Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds

Sway & King Tech,"I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one’s a girl, let’s name her pam
Same father as the first but you don’t give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won’t down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma’s gettin' married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother queen’s risin' a chapter
Deja vu, tell you what I’m gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my god

When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand poppa doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn’t bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I’m clocking pop’s liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that’s where you’re wrong
But give the man a taste and he’s gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don’t wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he’s taking over
I said pop maybe when you’re older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good god, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the r-uh-o-y, how did you and I meet?
In front of big lou’s, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom pam holds the family together
My uncle doc’s the greatest better yet the latest
If we’re talking about a car, uncle sterling got the latest
I strive to be live ’cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my aunt joyce
So pete rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that’s word is bond
I’m not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble t-roy
It’s like that y’all
And you don’t stop
Pete rock and cl smooth for ’92
And we out, later",They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)
Sway & King Tech,"Yo, I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated
While you breathin' you'll be leavin'
The receiving room this evening with Jesus
You hate on us, we'll be waitin' on eight corners
Swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders
I'll hop in the Jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that ya mom bought you
Mess around and get choked and found in a moat
Floatin' around drowned face down in a boat
I'll pile five dudes in a pen
And we'll pull up to the seven mile drive-through
At McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a driver out his Eddie Bauer
When it rides by me at ninety miler per hour
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white-out

Thinking I'd meet somebody
With brown eyes, that's real smart
'Bout 5 foot 3 tall

Sweatshop Union,"Did you want the house, the dog, the white picket fence
The wife with three kids that helped your life make sense
The friends, petty trends, the mercedes benz
Keep the picture on the wall but its all just pretend
I thought I had it all figured out
But time's an empty hole and it becomes filled with doubt
Born a man, hopin to become the boy
Lived a life, only to be destroyed
From birth to death, the baby's first steps
Didn't affect the purest state that we have left
Best to start slow though pressure becomes past
The innocence is lost and ignorance grows vast
It all happens so fast when you're facin to the wind
You better count the chips before its time to cash em in
'Cause by then you'll realize that you've lost your drive
While workin a 9 to 5 until you turn 95
Sick and tired, know why its time to quench the fire
While speakin of how you felt you can call yourself retired
The live wire is dead, left quiet as kept
It's the birth, the death, the old man's last breath

(The old man said...this is how it all began)
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin' to quench our thirst
If I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts
It would all make sense livin' life in reverse
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin' to quench our thirst
And if I only know one thing, its the truth hurts
It would all make sense livin' life in reverse

I am but a reoccurring cycle of light
Bound to this physical vessel until I reach the afterlife
And I might escape as my soul is undressed
I'll fall through all the answers that I saw this time press
Wait and find a different person staring in the mirror
Left to pull my life together from the pieces of a stranger's dream
A vague haze of past days last breath, sun sets, same story, new day, next scene
It's just bickering energy trading places
More like repeating different names and changing faces
The soul's eternal but the body soon wasted
Walk into the new light as the past is slowly faded
I'm falling from earth, return through rebirth
Carry body, open wings, a freedom far from all the hurt
So when my cycle's complete, I'll return to innocence
With nothing else to guide me but the traces of my inner sense

It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
If I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts
It would all make sense livin life in reverse
It's perverse, from birth to the hearse
Immersed in a search tryin to quench our thirst
And if I only learn one thing, its the truth hurts

It's all about ownership of your soul and who's controllin' it
It's not about the gold you get, not about the clothes you're in
It's not about oil, but we're killing each other over it

And it's so fucking heartless, the whole country's starved

Ask his dad the ex-prez how many drugs he ran
So trust us, the shit's about to flood the land
Cause government hands can no longer plug the dam
So fuck the news, fuck the critics, fuck their views
And if you sit and let it happen then fuck you too
It's up to you, I can't tell you what to do
But touch the truth, and don't just judge the few

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Save the World/Punk [Arty Rock-N-Rolla Mix]

Sweeney's Men,"Ramblin' around this dirty old town
Singin' for nickels and dimes
Times getting rough I ain't got enough
To buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Little hotel, older than Hell
Cold and as dark as a mine
Blanket so thin, I lie there and grin
Buy me little bottle of wine

When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Aches in my head, bugs in my bed
Pants so old that they shine
Out on the street, tell the people I meet
Won'ch buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Teacher must teach, and the preacher must preach
Miner must dig in the mine
I ride the rods, trusting in God
And hugging my bottle of wine

Sweeney's Men,"The love that I have chosen I'll therewith be content
And the salt sea shall be frozen before that I repent
Repent it shall I never until the day I dee
But the lowlands of Holland has twined my love and me.

My love lies in the salt sea and I am on the side
It's enough to break a young thing's heart what lately was a bride.
But lately was a bonny bride with pleasure in her e'e.
But the lowlands of Holland has twined my love and me.

My love he built a bonny ship and set her on the sea
With seven score good mariners to bear her company.
But there's three score of them is sunk and three score dead at sea
And the lowlands of Holland has twined my love and me.

My love has built another ship and set her on the main
And nane but twenty mariners all for to bring her hame.
But the weary wind began to rise, the sea began to roll
And my love then and his bonny ship turned withershins about.

Then shall neither quiff come on my head nor comb come in my hair
And shall neither coal nor candlelight shine in my bower mair.
And neither will I marry until the day I dee
For I never had a love but one and he's drowned in the sea.

""Oh hold your tongue my daughter dear, be still and be content.
There's men enough in Galloway; you need not sore lament.""
Oh there's men enough in Galloway, alas there's none for me
For I never had a love but one and he's drowned in the sea",Lowlands of Holland

In sixty-eight Julie was Johnnie's date

Livin' each day as if time was slippin' away
Oh, they were just sixteen
And their love a teenage dream
They passed the time, they crossed the line
The line that ran between
Julie and Johnnie now you've made it

You've just gotta be strong

And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy
You know you'll never go wrong

Maybe they can put it all together

And dream they saw their name in lights
On Desolation boulevard
They'll light the faded light

That sixty eight was out of date
They took the flowers from their hair
And tried to make us all aware
Too bad, too late
So they lived from day to day
And tried to do it all their way
But sixty-eight was sixty-eight
No matter what they say
Bobby and Billy maybe you'll make it one day

I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust",Reflections

You took a walk, left me high and dry
You disappeared, never said goodbye
We had a love that was meant to last
How could our love slip away so fast
Here goes a fool that can't live without you

It's lonely out there
Away from you
It's lonely out there
Since we've been through
Lonely, just like thunderous spaces
Lonely, without your sweet embraces
Lonely out there
Lonely

When did it end
When did it start
When did I know
I'd lost your heart

You took a walk, left me high and dry
You disappeared, never said goodbye
We had a love that was meant to last
How could our love slip away so fast
Here goes a fool that can't live without you

It's lonely out there
Away from you
It's lonely out there
Since we've been through
Lonely, just like thunderous spaces
Lonely without your sweet embraces
Lonely out there

Lonely out there
Away from you
It's lonely out there

Somewhere, where am I
Don't now when I'm high
People lookin' at me
Is there, what did I see

Man with a bible
Won't somebody tell me please
Somebody help me
Tell me what's happened to me

Fever night and day
Woman, hear what I say
Daze all, lighter come
This life won't be long

Man with a bible won't
Somebody tell me please
Somebody help me
Tell me what's happened to me

Woman, hear my plead
Come on, rescue me
Signs all, death has come
Woman look what you've done

Man with a bible
Won't somebody tell me please
Somebody help me
Tell me what's happened to me

Man with a bible
Won't somebody tell me please
Somebody help me
Tell me what's happened to me

And love becomes a leap of faith

And living in the fast lane, could end in tears

I think I'm pretty together
So far, so good.

Well just in case you wondered, it's all true
When I woke up this morning, I couldn't find my shoes
Now take that as a warning.
I wanna do this forever
But I don't know if I should
I think I'm pretty together
So far, so good.
I've travelled every nation
I've stopped at every station
Had every invitation
But then came my frustration
The taxman took my money
From the land of milk and honey
But now I think, it's funny
Lazing on a sunny afternoon.
Now don't get so excited, it's only Rock'n Roll
Go out and sell your records, but not your soul
No remorse, no regrets
It ain't over 'til it's over.
I wanna do this forever

I think I'm pretty together
So far, so good,

As the towers fall, a new world begins

But we gained our pride in the name of the twins

Roll a ""L"" and burn a incent
It's like magic when I invent
This shit that I present
Yo turn my levels up a izinch
And drop the trebble down the pizinch
And let the bass commence
To relax your nerves
It's like a paintin with no color it's-why I attach the words
My mind the brush, my life the canvas, the world, the easel
Combines a perfect picture for people
My words is colorful like autumn
The way they fall on the track like leaves when I record em'
There's nothin like it when I write
And I don't print, I invent it and predict it like a psychic
Pull down the shades on the windows of your soul
And gaze into your mind and watch the wisdom unfold
I was taught when your vision's impaired
The wisdom is there
A message from Big Homey couldn't-have sent it no clear
I know the flow is like hypnotic
And tightest tip when I drop it with no particular topic
Type shit that can't be bitten so stop it
Type shit that can't be re-written on copy
By kinko, kodak, fuji films
Kin-folk know that groovy hymns
Spit by him'll put the gospel to you
Catch some little higher learning from a sermon once I drop it to you
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
The flow is like hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
(Memphis Bleek)
So roll a ""L"" and light a incent
It's like magic when I event
This shit that I present
It's not a secret when I speak it
I know that hatin' isn't physical but dawg I could peep it
It's like a preacher preachin' his scripts or psychic readin' a palm
Lines give me what I write in-this song
The book is now open so let the story be told
I enter through your mind and exit the back of your soul
That could push you to some insight
A shine like a headlight
Pickeny diamond watch me get right
I'm that nice
Words is a cure that help me heal up a heart
Words can become that evil game that help me get what I want..uh
You start where you end, you end where you start
I am the light of the situation I overshine dark
Give you the pen, the book, the word, the truth, the sight, the mind
I put it down, you call it a rhyme, I call it a sign
I predict the unpredictable
Heaven is invisible, but hell isn't physical
Let me stop with the spiritual.. whoa
Let me spit at you, show you how to move with no vehicle
Come through your speakers
Into/enter your ear, end up in paragraphs
Tellin' your man of what you hear
'cause, spit it I often roll it tighter than chronic
Styles versatile meanwhile it's hypnotic
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
(Jay-Z)
Pass the dutchie if you was ill
Take one to the grizzill
Tell me what you fizzill
It's like a complicated puzzle unravelin', mind travelin', with no particular flight patterin
Speak the language of the lizand
Desert feeds worm, worm feeds falcon, falcon feeds man ..uh
Only the strong survive, so if you along for the ride strap your boots and leave your thongs inside..uh
We experience turbulence in urban environments daily, rarely it's aqcuired
We riot like Israelis
Why am I here that question overwhelms me
I am a gangsta, Dr. Melfi couldn't help me
I am a thinker, my mind fixes all that L's/ills me the perfect elixir
I trust mines will never fail me
I let my speech unfold, I reach deep inside the seed of my soul and I got it
Hypnotic...hypnotic....
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style.. hypnotic..

Sweet Baby J'ai,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.

Their not the one's getting burned, slapped or beaten down to the ground.
They say financial security is hard to come by for a woman like me,
And for the children, I need a good home, so I should sacrifice until their grown.

For this, kind of behavior, there is no justification
I'm looking ahead to the future, I won't forget the past
I won't repeat this part of my life, its over atlast!

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

While the breeze on high sang a lullaby

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Sweet Linda Divine,"Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine.
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about,
I feel good, in a special way.
I'm in love and it's a sunny day.

Good day sunshine,

We take a walk, the sun is shining down,
Burns my feet as they touch the ground.

Good day sunshine,
Good day sunshine,

And then we lie, beneath a shady tree,
I love her and she's loving me.
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine.
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.

Sweet Miss Coffy,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary

Am I too late to make amends?

But a fool can have her charms

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I watch your sea birds flying

I've never been

That I would ever wanna be no
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you
Loving me, I'm gonna Love

Yo Dre, pump it up somethin' 
How's that?)
Yeah, let's do this

Sweet Tee's in the groove, yes, I'm back on the move
It's the thriller to kill, cause I got nothin' to lose
I'm at the top of the heap, Hurby was lookin' at me
And oh, how they screamed (Go Sweet Tee!)

Just wanted nothin' but fun, cause I'm second to none
And I'm here in the flesh to show how it is to be done
So turn your speakers way up, until your ears start to pop
And if your mom starts beefin', say, ""Mom, do the Whop""

Hop on the dance floor, dance to the music
Toe-slam to my jam, you can do it
I write rhymes, and to the world I'm givin'
(Get busy, Sweet Tee) That's the way I'm livin'

Leather or lace as I step in the place
People come to say hi cause they know my face
And you know I'm stylin', nails I'm filin'
Standin' on stage, smilin', profilin'

Lean, mean, breakin' out on the scene
Me and the girls steppin' fresh outta Queens
So if you want to have a ball, give me a call
I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'all

Nonchalant as I flaunt the style I know you want
Like a ghost in your mind, it's your conscience I haunt
When I rap I bring joy to every girl, every boy
Some think I play games cause my name is Toi

Back to raise hell, I got records to sell
I'm still on the top, don't you think I fell
Never takin' a loss, weak rappers I toss
Make no mistake, Sweet Tee is the boss

Janet Jackson's nasty, but I'm in control
Aretha Franklin, bow down to the new queen of soul
Never settle for less, god is my witness
Jog every day for physical fitness

Climbin' higher, I'll never retire
Rap so hot, they start three alarm fires
But don't be alarmed, it's just my grace and my charm
I'm here for the good, I'll never do you no harm

Sweet Tee's on the money, you know I'm makin' it
I do it live, so you know I ain't fakin' it
Five foot eight, standin' ten feet tall
And if you ask me why, it's like that y'all

Slam on the jam just as hard as you can
While I rock the mic with my all-girl band
And you know I'm clever, taken down never
Give me a beat, and I'm a cold-blooded terror

My voice is on wax, now you know I'm set
'Cause the better the rhyme, the more money I get
And I hope I'm told, when my record's old
That they all got sold, and my jam went gold

I give it all I got, and all I got I give
I take no shorts, that's the way I live
Tee's on the move, and I never get moved on
(Long live the queen) Well, I'm a live real long

I'm the people's choice, so all the people choose me
Keep my beeper beepin', so the fellas don't lose me
Sly as a fox, sippin' juice on the rocks
When I get on the roll, I can never be stopped

When I'm good I'm good, and when I'm bad I'm better
Keep that in mind and don't you forget that
I write the rhymes that make you jump off the wall
And you want to know why? It's like that y'all

Rockin' to the radio playin' [song name]
Heads all turn as I drive by
As I wave to the fellas, all the fellas say (hi)

Stepped on the gas, and I went to the disco
The music's pumpin' and the people screamin' (Ho!)
The place is packed and people shakin' their bodies
The crowd outside is screamin' (We want to party!)

Jump on the stage, knuckleheads began the rampage
They stopped short when my girl pulled the 12-gauge
Rocked anyway, cause I'm bad, and I'm bold
Another rapper couldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole

If you know what it is, then you know I'm a whiz
Toes are tappin' while I'm rappin', cause I'm in showbiz
Autographs I sign while they stand in line
I remain number one till I'm 109

Sweet Vine,"For so long I've been told,
I am on the road to glory
These days I don't mind,
Just hearin' that old song 
Way back when at the tavern,
I would sit and write the stories
And now, everybody 
Just wants to sing along
And I'd wake-up early on Sunday morning,
And hear the church bells ringin' loud
Some man said we would all be singin'
Oh, can't you hear the sound..

[CHORUS:]
If you're lost and you can't find me,
(roll the mountainside)
Just leavin' all my friends behind me,
(roll the mountainside)
And if you're in need of my acquaintance,
The many miles that separate us.
(roll the mountainside)
The one day, for five and change,
I got mare than I bargained for
I found out that all-the-way 
Was a little-bit too far
And late last night on the trunk,
Cuttin' open the envelope
I found out when I woke-up,
I'd bought myself a car
Then I stayed-up dancin' 'til Sunday morning,
Just let the world go-out
Then someone said we would all be singin'
Oh, can't you hear the sound..

Oh, we gonna climb that mountain... ah-ooh!

And I stayed-up dancin' 'til Sunday...,
And just let the world go down
Ooh, late tonight we gonna all be singin'...
Oh, can't you hear the sound...
(can't you hear the sound...sound...)
Sometime soon, down the road,
Call you up when I've had enough
Wrote-down in a motel room,
I'll send you all my love
I told you then, I'll tell you now
This here place is not my home,
No need to tie me down,
You can call me all your own...

It's come back to let me know
I found it in my heart and in my soul

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
I was caught up in a hazy love, you see
It's come back to let me know
Got a thing for love and I can't let it go

It's so hard to describe what it is that I'm feeling

The truest kinda love I know
Is when I love myself for my soul
What good am I to you if I don't love myself
Before I love someone else?

The realest kinda love I know
Is when I learn to love and let go, go
Sometimes you cannot hold on to
To the river when, when it flows, flows

They think it's just a phase but how could it be
All I do is think of love

Can I lay next to you?
I never want to live without you.

Missing your smile, kiss, and touch.
To live alone without you I'd die.

But I really believe my heart beats one life,
And it's you I choose.
I can't love another.
I never want to live my life without you.

Living alone is not worth as much.
Without you I can't eat or sleep.

From the hightest mountain to the seas
I will be waiting...
Waiting for you to come to me.

And don't I understand we'd never make it anyway
It's a shame that you look at love that way
Cause love like life is only what you make it out to be

And all the good that hearts aren't meant to live without

If I ever stopped loving you you'd rather be dead
Well dear I don't know what on earth changed your mind
No matter who's holding you your heart is still mine

You'd cuddle up and spuddle up and thrill me with your charms

When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true

The trees that line the street

He worked with stone, carved with stone

Chipping' away at the gargoyles 
Under the blistering sun 
He carved out ""Maggie Sucks"" on the backs of every one

Make an electric connection as lightning strikes
Angels' wings not once but twice
Point blank refusal, the earth moves I turn her head

Somebody's learning
To fly with the birds tonight

Solomon flies tonight
Cape to coast, wings in full flight

I walked for miles and it still feels real 1972

I can feel London, North Europe here

Swift,"I cast away everything I own for this feeling inside of me
Live my life for my home I'll be safe rather than be left alone
Feels like I can't live like I used to so I keep bringing new things

In this to improve the stature of my stance
At first glance it seems so hard to figure
Protect my home I hate to but I'm forced to kill
Two birds with one stone

So fly away
Just fly away
Fo' find your place
While I stay
I can't stand these claws
Reaching for my things
I'll clip your wings

You sing the same song all the other birds sing
Pictures and memories take place
And in due time they wither away
And all that's left are the feeling that we had

In reverse
Stay away while you are here
My life's not mine
When you look down from above
Wishing you could fly with me
I'm bound by the same things
I'm not free

I'm just sticking to the path that belongs to me
It belongs to me",Birds
Swift,"Last night, all smiles, we were holding hands.
And now you, won't share the bed with me,
Explain if you can.

We may not agree on this, but lets not fight.
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I
Feel like I can't breathe like this--your
Grip is too tight.

Taken by surprise, because I felt so secure.
Because all the things, that you've done,
Have let me wondering.

We may not agree on this, but lets not fight.
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I
Feel like I can't breathe like this--your
Grip is too tight.

You leave me breathless with your words

We can say that we've changed, together,
Another day--give me your hand, let me
Explain, because I've come to terms with
Who you are.

We may not agree on this, but lets not fight.
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I
Feel like I can't breathe like this-your grip
Is too tight--let's not fight. your grip is too,
Is too--tight.

You leave me breathless with your words.



",Breathless
Swift,"Killed--but I'm still struggling, to hold on to
You--I know I'm failing. it feels like my arms
Are tied to my hips, and I, just tripped I'm
Falling--

But not because I'm lovesick or am I lovesick?

It felt so warm with you and now my own bed
Feels foreign to me--I guess I just hate things,
That are empty and I'm sleepy--

But not because I'm lovesick or am I lovesick?

It seems like my world is falling to it's end,
It seems like the color gray.

Pictures in perfect color with words to listen to,
That's the scene I saw--and now, that my hope is
Crushed, and fingernails are gone, I'm bleeding--

But not because I'm lovesick or am I lovesick?

Please don't hold out on me, the distance can't be
That far, it can't be--this is confusing me, what's
Wrong with me? what's wrong, with me?

I'm not lovesick or could I be? I'm so--confused
What's wrong with me?



",Lovesick
Swift,"Words like violence, break the silence.
Come crashing in, into my little world.
Painful to me, pierce right through me.
Can't you understand, oh my little girl.
All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here in my arms. words are very 
Unnecessary, they can only do harm.
Vows are spoken, to be broken. feelings 
Are intense, words are trivial, pleasures 
Remain, so does the pain. words are 
Meaningless, and forgettable.

Suddenly you're all alone
Wondering where all the years have gone
It's been so long, so long, so long
My life is incomplete without you
Incomplete without you
My life is incomplete without you
Incomplete without you
Some remember
Some live to forget
I can't erase what I don't regret
Time goes by
My heart won't let me hide
Thoughts I've tried so hard to disguise
How can the moments pass?
How can a day seem like forever?
How can a lifetime last so long?

Can't go livin' without you, baby

It's time to rearrange my life
We're speaking the same words
Although their meaning has changed
You're telling me what I want to hear
But what's the use when we just don't share
The same emotions that brought us together aren't there

In this world, nothing lasts forever
Was it you who changed or me
Should we go our separate ways or stay together
Believe me when I say

I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change now
If you walk away
There's no turning back now

I look in the mirror
And see a reflection that isn't me
It's hard to remember the girl that used to be me
In this world, nothing lasts forever
Was it you who changed or me
Should we go our separate ways or stay together

And no-one seems to know what it is they're really here for

We'll never learn to live and grow
If we don't let our feelings show
Everyone of us

[Chorus:]
Here and now
Can't stop what's happening
Head over heels and falling helplessly in love
Here and now
Reaching an all time high
Head over heels

In love with life
Here and now
What seemed so far away
Stumbled and found us here
And showed us the way
To find in our hearts again
This is where love begins
We'll make our dreams come true
If we still keep on believing
No matter what we'll be prepared
The futures ours for us to share
Every one of us

[Chorus]

Tomorrow can wait
Let time run away with us
Free as the air that we breathe
Until then nothing exists
Nothing compares to this
Even in our wildest dreams
Here and now [Repeat x 2]",Here and Now
Swing Out Sister,"Holding hands with summer
Gentle as a breeze
Fragrant as your petals
Cast their spell and leave
Someone was to blame
No one knew your name

Drifting into autumn
Brush away your tears
Shadows spread their sadness
Stole away her years
Someone was to blame
No one knew your name

Chills your empty heart
Buried with the flowers
Frozen in the dark

Empty as a garden in the summertime
Captured by the falling rain
Now the playgrounds standing still are empty
No one else comes out to play

Warm spring that never came
I never even knew your name

Fill me with your sweetness

We saw beyond a sky that had no limits
Much higher than the highest star
Beyond the furthest planet
We thought that we could change the world
And everything in it
But time ran out of endless hours
Gave into doubt, were we just playing an endless game
That no one ever wins

Hide away
Forget the way feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here

Love and hate
Left up to fate
A life we took for granted
We couldn't stop our running from the things we always wanted
No long goodbyes
No tears to cry
And nothing to believe in
But now you're gone
We'll never know a love that's grown
Time took away
All that it gave to the two of us

If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way I feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here

When our hearts were young and nights were long
We'd let the morning sun kiss our eyes open
Precious dreams that we had now they are dead and gone
The promises we made have all been broken

If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way I feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here

In my arms

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!

Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I don't know what you know
The look of love may come and go

Somewhere deep in the night

We've got nothing to lose
We've got time on our side

Come live with me
We'll be the people we once dreamed we could be
See the things we've been longing to see
Somewhere deep in the night

I don't care if it's wrong

What else is there to say
When tomorrow's been and gone
And given in to yesterday

If I'd known before the things that I know now
I'd be way above the ground
A thousand miles high
Spinning and spiraling through the sky

Waiting for the sun to shine
And brighten up my days
Drifting, floating in and out of time
You came and took my breath away

Now we're climbing up above the highest cloud
And we're never coming down, a thousand miles high
Spinning and spiraling through the sky
Through the sky

High as the moon and the stars above
Out of our minds and in love
Through the sky

Why you had to play that stupid game
You know you've only got yourself to blame

When you don't want my love

How many times did I hear my friends
Say that I should have known better
How many times did I listen to a word they said

How could I know that there
Really wasn't someone else
That you were loving instead

What kind of fool are you?
When you find that all you're searching for
Means nothing at all
With no one by your side

Here I am...?
Now You're Not Here
Love was young
We saw beyond a sky that had no limits
Much higher than the highest star
Beyond the furthest planet
We thought that we could change the world
And everything in it
But time ran out of endless hours
Gave into doubt, were we just playing an endless game
That no one ever wins
If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
Love and hate
Left up to fate
A life we took for granted
We couldn't stop our running from the things we always
wanted
No long goodbyes
No tears to cry
And nothing to believe in
But now you're gone
We'll never know a love that's grown
Time took away
All that it gave to the two of us
If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way I feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
When our hearts were young and nights were long
We'd let the morning sun kiss our eyes open
Precious dreams that we had now they are dead and gone
The promises we made have all been broken
If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way I feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
In my arms
In my life
Lovin' you, is just a memory
Now you're not here
Now you're not here

Swingers,"Sixth of June, Nineteen forty-Four
We're off the coast, we're off the shore
Of Normandy!
We're going to hit the beach
Men and machines, and ships of war
Hoping to blast their way through the door
To liberty - Allied Victory
La-la-lala la-da-genie, la-la-lala la-da-genie
Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach!
Oh oh Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach!
Men around me, men I know
Got their stomachs in the throats
But they don't let it show, no-no-no!
I got my carbine, I got my bayonet, I got my hand grenades
And my steel helmet
And a picture of my girl, and a picture of my girl
La-la-lala la-da-genie, la-la-lala la-da-genie
Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach!
Oh oh Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach!
And now we're going in, we wanna get blown away
Don't wanna die
It's too late now, the ramp goes down
No turning back, we're going in
All around me I see death and destruction,
And the sea is red with blood
Pushing through the waves, through the blinding smoke
God it's raining steel
Soldier in front of me is terrified, he doesn't want to die
I don't want to die!
Three seconds later, shrapenl wipes off his face,
And it goes floating by
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh Hit the Beach!
Oh-oh-oh, oh oh-o Hit the Beach!
There are bodies and there are bullets
But they're exploding into little bits
God I mean it, oh god I mean it
Hit the Beach!

Swingers,"Caught up in a haze of loneliness
In the pursuit of happiness
Ain't it just like you,
It's just like me.
Love is obsession, lovers pine
Always working against the brain
But it's always there, there for always
Deserted in the ruins, of your own building
It seems like there's no hope of repair(?)
Standing in the rubble, no roof above you
No walls around you to keep the world at bay
[chorus 1:]
(needle around the tear)?
I need an elixir
I'm feeling lovesick
(needle around the tear)?
I need an elixir
To fix the light
No way out of this nothingness
Nothing can replace the emptiness
But it's just like you,
It's just like me
Oh-oh
Love is a poison in my veins
A part of me that waxes and waves
But it's inside of you,
Inside of me
Amidst the devastation, or was it sabotage
Concrete foundations - all that remains
Standing in the rubble, no roof above you
No walls around you to keep the world at bay
[chorus 2:]
(needle around the tear) ?
I need an elixir
I'm feeling lovesick
(needle around the tear)?

Hold on to your love - it's all that you've got

Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home
Conceding defeat with a low moan
Hangin' in A sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone
I bought him coffee and a snack
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach 'll burst
Feel like I've been cursed
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock
You got eternity for takin' stock
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys
Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part
That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail

I needed to release my sparrow chest from just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges at the thought
Of syringes

Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest
You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near-human pitch
Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears to find the key to this
Cage
And write another stage into a new age
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on gone

Jerome took me home under steel skies
Knowing I'm prone to dramatize but unknown for telling lies
And what I verbalize he can see behind my eyes

And there I stayed

Lay beside me
And listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying
Until the summer comes

I had that dream
About you again
Where you drive my car
Right off a fucking cliff

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Make me promise
That I will never tell
All I remember is
The way her bedroom smelled

I had that dream
About you again
Where I wait outside
Until you let me in

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her

Let me kiss you one last time

We high profile for this shit, I smile for this shit
I stack dough and make all my people just wil' for this shit
Hold it now, we rollin' it down, we holdin' it down
Thick money, foldin' it down in a hole in the ground
Stash more loot than before, a brute from before
Tell the truth and get used to leavin' you boots at the door

We four, five, sixin' it up, we fixin' it up
We keep the bitches strippin' the way we be mixin' it up
Come out from wherever you are, whoever you are
Incredible performance, their so unforgettable star
They'll never find the get because I threw the barreta too far

I was born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
I was born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
I bang out beats by cars and ho stacks
Rap nigga puttin' out rock-n-roll tracks
Anything with wheels, playa I drove that
Y'all, six, Swizz and Busta back

I be hearin' that I'm drugged out
Because I be bangin' them beats like I'm drugged out
I threw gerdems on the bus, threw the dubs out
One, niggas gettin' robbed when the clubs out
Dog, and it gets ugly, and the hood loves me
And your chick know me, plus your man owes me

That clown don't pay
They straight killin' homie
Y'all don't gotta like me, screw y'all, blow me

I put my foot in your ass just like a kung-fu flick
Bust my tool quick hittin' with the force of a mule kick
Spit fly shit as if I was baggin' a new chick
Instead of bitin' mines, it be best you bite on the chew stick
Funny how niggas be tryin' to do shit
When I rock a light bling all my pinky gleam in the blue shit

Bitches lovin' the way we always pass through shit
The way we rep the gutter and bring you the brand new shit
Double back, y'all niggas don't really want to trouble that
Brass knuckle beat you stupid, with a belt buckle rap
Couple cracks, some weed, back when we used to muscle that
And take a niggas shit like we like we fightin' to get our hustle back

Used to be the shit, now you writin' your suicidal rap
Frontin' like your the champ, fightin' to get your title back
Remind me that, this could even cause a homicidal act
And if you blamin' the music then watch me write the title track
The way that we kill and make you wanna cop that
Fuckin' with corny niggas you need to stop that shit

Come on, please just let a nigga pop that shit
All in they trunk, you know you want to rock that
Stay reppin' the struggle, busy pullin' my man's up
Shit we givin' y'all niggas might even swell y'all glands up
Stop, all of my niggas, all of my bitches stand up
And rep whatever you reppin' and put your fuckin' hands up

Right before we run it all in the ground
Motherfuckers know we shuttin' it down
I dare y'all to say somethin'
Motherfuckers want to give me a pound

It's still gone ride, it's still gone ride
Uh uh, uh uh, c'mon, uh, uh, yeah, ride, uh

Damn I miss you
Ooh I feel better than before
We should've never separated
Paused or hesitated
You rocked me to sleep
It's like my body levitated
Looking in the mirror 
But the heat makes it less clearer
It's all fogged up, face me baby
Put your fingers in my mouth, let me taste the gravy
Reunited, feel good, real good, squeeze me
I tell you that I Love You 
But you wouldn't believe me

Hello
Baby
There is something that I want to say to you
You've been on my mind now
For a while and I just don't know what to do
I've been thinking of holding you (holding you)
Showing you, what I'm all about
And I promise that I will do
Everything you want without a doubt

[Chorus]

[Mashonda]
I know
That we've
Had our share of ups and downs but that's in the past
If you promise to hold me down
Then our love will have a second chance to last
I've been thinking of holding you
Showing you, what I'm all about
(And I promise) And I promise that I will do
Everything you want without a doubt

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
Forget the past
We like Bonnie and Clyde from now on
Back to back, through the ups and downs
Right or wrongs, lay down 
Let me kiss you all down your back
Then I'll go further down, swirl my tongue around
I apologize too 
For not recognizing the pain inside of you
I never lie to you, again
Last time had stress on my mind
Had a hard time believing 
That my girl could be genuine
It's different now, we ghetto lovers fo' real
I grab the wheel, you hold the steel
Teach me how to touch you where you like it the most
From now on, til we give up the ghost
Reunited, Baby

Break my cipha, I'll make it at you, slice you
Knife you, stab you, shank you, splat ya

Too many rappers is jealous, who be gassin' the fellows

Nowadays, I'm on some mack shit
But I used to be loyal to tax, cracks
The nigga that would soil in your jacks
Feed 'em with trays the size of light bulbs
Coke so bright, it shine like white gold

And the hoes like Joe way before this rap shit
Before the Versace floors and the Rolls to match it
Joe's a bastard, I sell pussy for cheap
Make my bitch walk the strip with no shoes on her feet

Don't front for me, you kids is not ballin'
If you is then why is your wiz on my dick like I'm Jordan'
Ties swollen for no man with bold plans
Sick of this rap shit, why' Listen to 'Slow Jams'

I'm a grown man, the talk of the strip
Niggas think I'm Kev Childs that way I boss the fifth
Dogs, you's a bitch, I'm here to bring you a muzzle
Saying I'm peepin', I'ma bring you a muzzle

Ayo, listen, I'm the general like Tso Shim Shin
I'm so sick, you can tell by the expression on my face
That I'll get in that ass like preparation H

The weapon on the waist and I spray guns off
'Cause if it's beef, I'ma be on top of it like A-1 sauce
Pause, now who the truth' Me, who quick to shoot' Me
My four-fifth got kick like Bruce Lee

See, I'm a true G, hotter than soup be
Raw like sushi, you gotta salute me
You dudes see, I'll put in an order for you
I'll let the water boil, cook a quarter to the oil

I had it for sell but y'all fagots would tell
Go to jail and start singin' like Patti LaBelle
I ain't gon' back in a cell, you rat and you did
Fuck a vest, put a bulletproof hat on your head

When I'm clappin' the lead, I'll murder a nigga
And if he say he not the feds, then I'm servin' the nigga
I'm thirsty for the change, playin' games ain't a issue now
A bitch would give you AIDS nowadays if she kiss you now

I got that coke and that haze on my gristle now
We goin' to war, you gonna need more than a pistol now
They throwin' missiles 'round, you still tryin' to get a nine'
Uh, it's the last days, end of time

The terrorists jackin' planes, sendin' bombs to the Pentagon
They off the hook like intercoms
We just had a bad wintertime
So you know they gonna start to rob
And steal for a mil' when it's dinnertime

You still spendin' time focusin' on dumb shit
On the block smokin' but you broken on some bum shit

An' them haters I shake 'em off me
Them antiques on my ass them shits costly
I got cream niggas think I'm mr. softy
To the goons I blow 'em off me
See niggas be buyin' the magazines 
An' readin' the articles an talkin bout the paper I got
But niggas don't know all the pain an all the struggle 
I've been through to get to all the shit that I got
Come n' get me!

It started like ""soft and warm""
Don't get excited; I've been invited to the quiet storm
Now it's out of hand 'cause she told me she hate me
And then she said ""what the hell I've done lately""
Plus, she said all she want is love and affection
Let me be your angel, and I'll be your protection
Took her out, bought her all kinds of things

Wanna be ballers, shot callers, brawlers

Cristian Dior and them new Fendi bags
Anything is good cause it's better than she had
She sitting at the bar and she's lookin' so sad
Something 'bout, uh-uh I wanna ride in your jag
Uh uh uh, I wanna ride to your house
I said ""easy chick, I fly to my house""

Why don't you pull it out my pants and put it in yo mouth (echoes)

She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walking 'round actin' all stank
And now she at the party looking at me
Hopin' she can get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like (right)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)

Come on girlfriend why you fronting for my niggas
They come and that paper is nothing for my niggas
Don't you know we got that money in the (money in the bank) I repeat
Don't you know we got that (money in the bank)

I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
She got her hand up but I tryna pay that girl

It's started like soft and warm
Don't get excited, I've been invited to the quiet storm
Now its out of hand cause she told me she hate me
And then she said ""what the hell I've done lately""
Plus she said all she want is love and affection
Let me be your angel, and I'll be your protection
Took her out bought her all kinds of things
But it wasn't enough, so this is the song I sing
Cause she broke

She ain't got no money in the bank
She be walking 'round actin' all stank
And now she at the party looking at me
Hopin' she can get saved by me
I'm lookin at her like (right)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
I ain't tryna save that girl (NO SIR!)
She got her hand up but I tryna pay that girl

Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
So part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way you can

The time was the late 80's
Every block had a stray dog with rabies
Feens threw away their crack babies
Arguing with my brother
To see who pick the mouse up
Walk by open up the oven door to heat the house up
Everyday, police would swarm
Coming home from school
Your brains on your uniform
I wish I could fly away like a unicorn
I'm from the ghetto
And everyday a human born
So who cares if I'm stretched out on the scene
Surrounded by homicide forensic team
Yellow tape... (mmm)
Haters glad that I'm dead
Pedestrians walking by
And they just shaking their heads saying...
Trying hard to speak and
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
So part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it

What's hot, what's not
What should, what shouldn't be
Come on ya...
Who to say what couldn't be
Look at me...
I'm nicest not the ices
Sometimes I wake up and ask God
Who life this is
I look at these eyes
I'm only in this body
If you only could understand
The vision that I carry
White actors will be like
Puff Daddy when he interned
Men play with fire
Men get burned
To talk about this
The only thing I earned
I can rap talking about killing you like this
Or putting a whole in your head the size of that
But that would be cheating myself
And I can't do that... (Man)

Man...
It all ends up on a back street
In abandoned buildings
Where the crack heads meet
All you hear is (coughs & sniffing)
And lighters flicking
Busy smoking
Baby dead
Rat poison in the kitchen
They so high
Walking by thinking she sleep
Don't even put her in the crib
Just cover her with a sheet
This is me in the building
17 with the bundles
and a gun up on me
And I shoot any n- run up on me
And for 2 years my momma looking for me
Crying running up on other kids
Thinking it's me
By now I ain't got no heart
N- I'm a gang member
Suited up and ready to start

Yea, you know the boy did that

Sometimes I feel like the devil but my angels never come
Sometimes I'm wearing a costume but I'm naked underneath
Sometimes you say you're alive what do you really mean
Now is there really a place called heaven
Is there any room for me to join them
Is there really a place called heaven
Well if there's not I don't care cause I think I'm already there
I know I never told you how much our love meant
Back when you were the country and I was president
I know I probably should have but I never realized
That maybe we would grow up and move our separate ways
Now is there really a place called heaven
Is there any room for me to join them
Is there really a place called heaven

I'm dope on plastic like Flex, and always keep it, classic

Then kick off your shoes jump off my jock
And check the new style Whitey Ford's prone to rock

An MC show had to cold rock the masses 
Used to wear a Kangol wit the clear Gazel glasses 
So bang bang boogey, up jump the party

Drunk off Bacardi, high off the trauma 
It's death from above, the livest dive bomber

I break formation 
I get New York love like my name's King Sun 
I T La Rock Bells till they break the dawn 
Steady puffin L's, I fight hell like Spawn

And allows us the chance to advance the study of bacteria warfare, 
And thank y'all for being so up on my business, 
Helping me to develop crimes without a witness, 
And the competition knows I know they ain't comin' clean, 
So I perfected the work of anger release my guillotine, 
And finalize my thesis of the effects of stricken nicotine 
On the human frame with an iron depleted blood stream, 
And I'd like to thank the competition for being liars, 
When they came to protect the sire but weren't able 
Buy my ends two black gloves in the art of piano wire.

Survivors try to retaliate only to learn they defiantly crossed the line, 
Past the point of no return, back and crash and burn

I take them down one at a time, do my crime and put in work, 
You shouldn't jerk this chain, you can't handle the downpour,

My comparative dissention
From high as an intense discription
Of why the valkyrie fly, calculate
The circumference of the sky for future reference
Measure it all from bird's eye to add some fuel to my furnace
To those who scratch the surface and lace signs of plotonus
Expected to strown trajectory of David's sling to Goliath
Nor abundance of nouses accommodate my body weight
Circle 1-9-7-5 with
Instruments of vine and I'll
Dine the road of chrisis if it
Crosses over to the land of radiogiants 
Founded by po-pyus and pontious pilots
I make ?garbious? my habit to stab it until it's had it
Encourage the cutting of Marionette by bayonette
To escape the twin maker's cabinet
I was born in between 11:59 and 12 which 12 falls into thirteen
Prepare the barricades for the running of the ramping
While some try to change or exist to its wash cloth soaked in chlorine

[Madchild]
Much too dangerous
Meet the perfect stranger
I'm the extreme case of fire and anger
The misguided angel with deep routed fears
My face shows the years of blood sweating tears
Pay attention, this gypsy that deeply senses
Evil spirits lurking behind picket fences
Embarking darker images and skeletal remains
Cold hearted soldier with ice in his veins
I'm twice as insane
My advice is refrain
From confrontation, total annihilation
Serenating my princess, gut renching terror
See much clearer on my side of the mirror.....
Progressing modestly, moderately dichotomy
Manslaughter sporadically, automatically adequate
Gang up on myself, by myself, but keep me out of it
Undoubtedly a lunatic, Battle Axe exclusive
I'm utterly repulsive and self abusive
Offerings from the gifted I'm swiftly elusive
Making fun of myself I'm quadrofrenic mentally
Not laughing at me I'm laughing with me accidentally

In the beginning all I hear is people singing
Deep and low with iron bells ringing
And there's a source of heat near my feet
I'm so weak I pass in and out of sleep
Flashes of light blotches of colour
I yell out for help but its drown out by weather
Downpour terenchal power of the vengeful
This was all triggered by the sub-conscious central
Sweet dreams are hideous lets not confuse those
Bad dreams will find you confine you to circles
Every other movement is slowed by your mind
That's why stabbing them blind is no crime
With no REM. your bound to cave in
And life in the conscious life is quite grim
If I can't escape than I'll die in my sleep
Cause the cliff is to steep and the waters to deep

I'm running down a hall with one wall of flames
With friends I've never seen in my life with strange names
Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya
Pains not what it seems cold stares and sudden screams
I get in fights every night as I'm reflecting
Throwing punches fast hard as I can but not connecting
There protected by a force field locked in an engagement
Until I see the colour red when pounding heads into the pavement
Caught up in a chase scene or working on a plan
Sometimes I'm falling and I have to wake up before I land
Lots of doors to open afraid what I might find
My girlfriend getting fucked with eight more guys in line
can't wait to rise and shine when ill thoughts are provoked
My girlfriends right beside me getting choked
In real life plus I heard it could get worse
So much for walking in my sleep that's close to murder in the first

Orchids turnin' grey from what I bring out of my medical tray
Perpetuate Prevail Wonder and the alphabet is the predator and the prey
Don't let 'em walk away, broken in the bone yard, smokin' in the boys room
Spoken in the pattern that consumes you like a vacuum
The war ship I dock is the property of His Worship,
It's awkward when we talk about morbid conditions,
Vividly described from this side of the lie detector
Siphon nectar from the blossom, natural toxin, approach with caution
Blow flames in blue light they dance on the oxygen
Lost again in space? Allow us to demonstrate how it all generates
From motors to engines, machine guns to hand grenades, renegades of vengeance

Ask your neighbourhood martyr about the fire starter
People are driven to buildings when I let it out my system
Built my the hands of man and women

Friction leads to fire, crews could get burned 
How much ink I just injected is none of your concern 
Unless your on terms of understanding with the meager 
Eager to be mute so you can inherit the heater 
I can tell you're not graced in the study of conflict

Swing with Battle Axe cause I can't stay average
Roll with the maverick who moves spider-matic
Down with the ice vein, angel misguided
The phantom in your cabinet of lies
Why can't they fathom the pattern of the skies
It's dark when I wake light falls when I sleep
Fright comes off me when I walk in the street
Embark on my feat of neuroscience's discoveries
Acid on your brain makes the holes seem lovely
And you thought I couldn't rock this way?
You thought wrong, partner, my thought displays
The most caustic array that I bring when I choose it
Fuck when you wanna see me use it.
Red Dragon

Unbelievable, under duress

I'm not easily amused,
I snap when the fuse blows
Alligator trap door, crumbs on the fool's flo(or)
Delta brain of an unstable genius
Flies in your face when the gun's safety freezes.
Run hasty to quicken your suffering,
Grizzly react, when you gasp, they'll be busting in.
Get down, with no buffer zone
Buffering's useless just leave what you suffer whole
Buffalo's roam, the bison's stampede
Icing on the cake is the moment when you see
The scorpion chains, and the fire from the nostril
Hostile, exotic, colossal
Red Dragon

Unbelievable, under duress

My voice resonates, and ignore these featherweights
Resonates, pound up with this acid taste
Resuscitate the double horn side of me
Colliding with tusk, and make the harm bodily
Idle hands never, but whatever, my workshop's still hot
Algorithms, Superior skill shots
Mathematician, its half past sufficient
You grab-ass is wishin'
That you had another mission
In mind
Instead of trying to fuck with mine
Underestimatin' is half of the crime
The rapid supply of my graphic design
Can fool the unwary,
Put a snap in your spine
Don't be sorry, you just findin' out
Chop your neck off, motherfucka' now you really beside yourself
Cyber mouse
This is more tangible than keypads
You ain't so tough with the knee pads.

We gonna rock the whole crowd
Come to your town, Smash the door down
Trash the whole room
Kick the walls in, night to morning
Then we do it again, its adrenaline

[Verse 1: Prevail]
What we spit, beautiful and grotesque
Swim with us in the abyss to the deep depths, take a deep breath
Strike your lungs like a deadly pathogen, let the assassins in
Loss of oxygen leads to hospitals, loss of optical and audio optional
But not optimal, octagonal, box you in stronger than oxen friend
Accidents happen I'm a phenomenon
Looking at me is like staring at the ring too long, you have seven days
Witness one of the greatest efforts we've ever made
I'm a heavyweight swinging like Butterbean
I'm a cut you clean, like a sub machine
Gun and run its fun to chase someone in space the shots I pop a top a bass drum

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 1: MadChild]
You better believe I got a knife up my sleeve
Tell your buddies you ain't leaving 'til you bloody and cleaved
Then by the glory of a warriors code
I'm a destroyer roll with a Bavarian heart
I'm territorial, wish I could look the door
Aggressive localism with my dogs of war
Small man's complex you only get torn apart
MadChild kinda like Napoleon Bonaparte
Fornicate with porn stars, sluts, and strippers
But only on the internet but what's the difference
Cause everything's a memory once it's done
I can be my worst enemy just for fun
We urban guerillas, got friends with turbans that's killers
We go from town to town burn and pillage your village
I'm merely concealing a weapon kept inside of my brain
That's why I'm insane, desire and pain, fire and rain
Sexy beast with an extra piece of ecstasy
So this can work effectively
Connect with me, we'll have a chain reaction
I'm playing the same game, I'm the main attraction

[Verse 3: Moka Only]
I'm carcinogenic; my chemistry's a little bit off
You tend to be a little bit soft
Well I'm off on my tangent, detective agent
Lieutenant who's medicine you left with abrasions
Face the day like a vacation chasing
Fun, sun, and money then its back to the basement
Feels good taking it back to the basics
Like when I was hungry run around in my Asics
S & M was like the new cool band
That everybody be buzzing about at new stands
Who's then, you want to know, a lose cannon man
And it began with the tapes moving hand-in-hand
I'm writing under chandeliers
Something strange going on like langdaliers
This is one of them songs you can bang for years

Nuclear power, you can feel how we're changin' up the game, 
Things won't be the same after we're done with it, 
We're hollerin' at you all like, ""Come get it!""
Bah bum bum Bah bum bum

When the roof comes tumblin' down, 
You know we're the cause of that
I'm a go down in history as some kind of alien rhymer
Who blew up the planet then left in a space liner
An' took all the bitches with him and then hit 'em
My man Nucleus provided this dumb rhythm
Dumb meanin' good, not dumb meanin' stupid
Y'all don't believe it, you can come see me do it
I'm true for my true friends, that's all there is to it
I say what the fuck I feel, get used to it
Ah it's an incredible game, 
I got love for my partners we're never the same
Ooh, sometimes I'm wylin' out, 
Set the buildin' on fire then you're filin' out
An then, we can turn it into a block party
Get your drinks on, when you call the cops on me

I keep a ton of 'em runnin' like mascara
Number one in the last era
Now that's terror, you should call me the crypt keeper
Smoke a green reefer with the Grim Reaper
The kind of rapper you should keep in your household
Turn up the heat 'cause everything out my mouth cold
I'm a ball of ice and rock, 
Hurlin' words at a speed that's unorthodox
Clashin' worlds, Pandora's Box, 
Burning herb, 20 past 4 o'clock
Turn my cell mates loose, all hell breaks loose
Hit you from above and put some shells on your roof
Comin' to move, run through obstacles, 
Retrospect, laser opticals
Seven Nation Armies couldn't hold me back
When I swing a battle axe, I'm a make a skull crack

[Chorus]

Ain't no holdin' us back, like crack addicts
Tell your whole camp to pack up, I'm back at it
As a matter of fact, I'm strapped with raps for combat
Full contact, you don't want that
Put you in a head lock, twist your arm back
Rip up your throw back, snatch your chains
Gotta lot of great friends, but I act so strange
I wonder if it's anything to do with the fame
I wonder how many of them would like to ruin my name
Careful what you wish for, it might come true
Then every move you make they're like ""Can I come too?""
An' everyone you meet's like ""How can I join you?""
I ain't pretendin' that it's not strenuous

I rock heavy like a 70's icon
Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven, my mind's gone
Even though I only did acid twice
My rap's a vice; your head's in it ask the price
For you to be released and me to be happy
With all of your suffering I'm brutally crafty

To get inside of you like I'm a chest infection
Your best protection is to get down and drown
Remember that the Members don't clown around

With swift abilities to lift and drop

Quick on the draw I come equipped with a pick axe
Rock solid, you cock-a-holics, I'm not gon frolic any longer
Cause my crew's much stronger
Donkey Kong stomp, Pac-Man chomp
Attacking competition I'm back in my position
Pop off with the must stop opposition
You have to listen cause mad division of beauty and grace
See what I do to your face, might be me, might be my friends
I might need an alibi it all depends
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, suck this
I'm a small giant, that's trying, dying to find success
You look upset stupid fuckhead

I'm a keep bringing the pain 'til your brains exploded
I'm motivated, voted and rated as one of the greatest
One of the most loved and hated and still haven't made it

I'm addicted to speed but not the drug
I lead by example my breed can hunt
Seen enough mayhem, step into the A.M

A miracle of modern science
With the naturally passionate carnivorous diet (Heavy)

You understand now but you all looked startled at first

I'm runnin up on full strength to pick up a phone booth
Throw it right at you that and I'm tattood
Voice deeper then Ab Rude when I'm in a bad mood
This is my neighborhood a place you never could
Get over its over for you you'd run if you knew what was good
For your health I ain't huntin for no one else
And there's no one else here so you can quit yellin for help

Sorta compulsive, obsessive, disorder
Mathematical pattern addict with defect mind
Before I go to bed I hit the light switch seven times
Yes it's on, nevermind, put the knife back
Mad Child I'm out of my mind, but I'll be right back

[Chorus]

[Prevail]
There's no one behind you, there's no one beside you
There's no one besides you, you know as well as I do
There's no voice inside you, that shadow isn't moving
You must be losing to confusion having illusions
Still you want to prove it, paranoia
That someone might be coming for you, no ones trying to kill you stupid
There's no Norman Bates, peeking in your window
There's no Patrick Bateman trying to pick you up in limos
You pop another pill, to try and calm your nerves
But prescriptions make the descriptions a lot worse
You seeing red bursts, and then your head hurts
You should have checked under the bed first
Crawling on all fours, locking all the doors
You must have flown over the cuckoos nest and lost your course
I thought I told ya, don't let that shit control ya
'Cause paranoia will destroy ya just a lesson for ya

[Chorus]

[Moka Only]
When your mind is acting wild
And you swear you're insane
Can't nothing help you out
Of this trap you're in
You don't know which way to turn
And your head is in pain
Can't nothing help you out
Of this insanity

[Moka Only]
Yo it's paranoia in your brain cell
You think the world's looking at you but you can't tell
You need to find yourself a hobby or something and stop frontin'
Nobody's out to get you, nobody wants nothing
I think you got a chemical imbalance
When there's silence, you swear you hear talking and sirens
Maybe it's a different environment that you need
But whatever it is, your mind's dying to be free
You're trying to perceive with the usual procedures
Your chest's feeling tight; you think you're having seizures
Maybe you're just trying to hard to fit in
You need to let that shit go and get counseling my friend

[Chorus]

[Talking]
Never ends
That's what it is man
I'm losing my head
My mind is spinning man
I'm racing
I gotta unwind
It doesn't stop man

[Moka Only]
The paranoia never ends

[Talking]
It never ends
I'm afraid of what I might do man
It's in my head
I might need to check myself
It's in my mind
I might do some fucking crazy shit

[Moka Only]
The paranoia never ends

[Talking]
Never ends
Somebody needs to help me
Talk to me man I need help
I don't think I can handle this

(Swollen)
Who's thick?
Swollen... la-la-la-la
Yeah, the pockets fat
Swollen... la-la-la-la
The beats bang
Swollen... la-la-la-la
Look at that, see that ass
Swollen... la-la-la-la
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up, but don't turn us down
New Shit!
Swollen... new sheriff's in town

[Verse 1: MadChild]
Bout to show you something brand new
I ain't fronting but there ain't nothing I can't do
Listen man I'm telling you, you can too
Man you got no idea what the heck it took to get me here
I'm talking big hockey bags dragged back and forth
Bring it down South and get more from back up North
So I can stack up more and ? with force
26 inch rims, Cadillac of course
Now that I'm single this shit takes practice
Everyday a new attractive actress on my mattress
Stress relief, I'm a basket case
Give me a six-pack breast implants and a plastic face
Ass banging with them stupid thighs
I like my girls petite and super sized
I got love man that shit's real
I just got to take a few more laps around the field

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Moka Only]
You bout to know me in a big way
Yo, it's Moka Only, the name that all the kids say
Hey, I hope you know the game is in for a change
You love me cause I'm always known to spit strange
I get strange with it plus I get change
Enough to cop the H2 and the Range
Player I don't hate you or the game
y'all hate yourself because you play the same
I mean fuck around its time to change the rules up
y'all can still move your ass we got the new stuff
It's evidence on the track you know the crew, what?
Swollen super extra like my new truck
The 26 inch spinners the don't rub
Making all the jaws drop outside the club
I know you want to sing along do it up
But you got to spread the word tell them who you love

[Chorus]
The crew is called Swollen, remember the name
The heat that we holding, the Members spit flames

[Verse 3: Prevail]
Yo its unfair to put us in the same class
Before the ice melts I drain the whole glass
Nothing but fumes are left, I'm off and half-cocked talking under my breath
Girls in the bathroom perfuming their chest
So when they walk through the club ?damn she's fresh?
They shit off the wall like zero gravity
We hit you all we don't spare no casualties
Glasses clink, asses shake some chick wearing pink rocking boots made of snake
Cop this disc and tell the disc jock to let this rock til its two on his wrist watch
There's a new sheriff in town, don't make my pistol whistle like sweet Georgia Brown
We got this song stuck in your ear
With the sound so original there's nothing to clear

[Chorus]",Remember the Name
Swollen Members,"I'ma pull out my knife or rifle
I'm a polite psycho, it's a full out cycle
Of a trifle life, cops can suck my cock if they don't like us
I hang around prospects strikers bikers
Cruel in a duel, a bull fueled with nitrous
Oxide thoughts fly by like a rock slide
Not a far cry from a glorified barfly
Horrified when you hear this warrior's war cry
Four out of five dentists recommend that you support Swollen Members
Get it?  People get their teeth knocked in
But some of them will get dentures don't keep talkin'
While they sleep walkin', I'm always on their mind
Stressed 'cause I'm successful and on the grind
Look no one's secretly behind or under this
Its independent bitch I funded it
Does that answer your fucking question? No one owns our shit but us
This is independent man, don't worry who I hang out with man
Just mind your own fucking business

You can't even control what's really on my mind
Shut your mouth mind your business
You can't even control what's really on my mind
Shut your mouth mind your business

I'm a juggernaut, you're not, you don't want it
And you don't want us to rock your knot
You don't call us if you got some thoughts
You just call us to rock the spot, demolish and pop your top
So whassup?  I don't do shit to mock you dawg
You doin' that by yourself cause you not too hot
Now the fat cats run around and copy each other like CD-R's
We don't, 'cause we be stars
See these scars?  They didn't appear by themselves
On my knuckles cause motherfuckers wouldn't keep to themselves
When I was younger always havin' to defend myself
I was out there doin' it with nobody else
Until I met a couple cats, set a couple raps
Got a plan together how to get a couple snaps
Flashback to now, we got a whole operation
But wouldn't if we didn't have a whole lot of patience

[Repeat: x4]
You can't even absorb what's really on my mind
Shut your mouth mind your business

Well you trippin' if you think I'm gonna sit on this couch
And tell this shrink what my deeply rooted problems about
The words out my mouth like acts of vengeance
From the blackest dungeons in a mass abundance
We move together like shadows and figures
We strike when we like, with a mind like the Gravediggaz
Painted pictures and still photography
Movin' images, reverse psychology
You should here what they call me when I leave the cypher
A nut case, a coo coo, a loo or cypher
When I talk on the beat, hot hot heat
Shotgun track meet please come compete
One lap to go before the cartridge blow
Hot headed and dreaded with an incredible arsenal
I kick back and witted in record time
And who'd a thought I'd have a lot of this shit locked in my mind

Listen, bitch I'm a tough act to follow
Suck my dick and here's a nut-sac to swallow
Want'a get close, personal and intimate?
Listen, kid I'm a whole different instrument
Mental, I'm not sentimental, I'm intricate
It's impossible not to get into it
My intent to vent is not innocent
I'm guilty of bein' real filthy with menacin' ways
It's time to finish ya phase
I'm proof that raw adrenaline and energy pays

Prevail, Prevail - baseball bat and nails
I'm a menace to society my record's for sale
We're back, back in black I'm back at it
Attack, we're takin' it back like Dead Rabbits
Wreck havoc, me and the metal metallic magic
My talent's a canister of sinister gases
Stomped like a facist, this is my advantage
My tongue's like a whip to administer lashes
Molten ashes, fire and brimstone
You need to hire me to put a name on a tombstone
You're fuckin' with the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
Penalties of venom and armageddon's millennium
Bringin' the hangman to measure the distance
The drop, and listen to the vertebrae pop
I'm a hurricane, pops with the speed of a cheetah
Believe in the new school cause P's one of the leaders

There ain't a thing that I can't do
Plus I act like I'm straight off the zyban too
It's just another mental burst, quench of thirst
With raw shit, makin' you say, ""aww shit""
Got a need to be stable and make profit
Net cash, flip it and triple it, watch this
Plus, what good is the dough if you can't blow it?
What good is the gold if you stay below it?
Fools talk it when they ain't got it
Come out your wallet if you really ballin'
But if you 'bout it then you won't be solid
Come off it, y'all I'm off the wall
I'm on the ball, while you on the balls gettin' off
Got a whole line of products I'm addicted to
I still walk the same walk but a different shoe
It's more comfortable and my whole clique is too
Whatever's unpredictable is what we're quick to do
OPA!

Prevail the merciless mercenaries of militants
No resemblance to any other assembly's heritage
Despair will be the downfall of arrogance
Repairs will be necessary too much heavy damage
Counter intelligence spy craft flies past P's the aviators
Recesuitation reincarnation I'm the reanimator
Greater mind power than einstein genius and insanity
We walkin that fine line talk about prime time exposure
Face remains poker overload the road to stardom like exploding supernovas
Maintain composure while there's ability violentory
You hear the voice of a surgeon and wake up in an ambulance
You're out of your element a graveyard of skeletons
Elephants in a caravan cross a mountain like hannibal
Light the fire in wicks make the air thick with cannonballs
Nothing that I can't resolve chemicals meant to dissolve

You don't wanna fuck with a vain cain corsal
War mask on a chosen path you don't wanna laugh at this sociopath
Don't try to act hardcore you stay soft a unchained pitbull'll rip your face off
Backpack with an axe and a chainsaw mad child cracked imma grab what I came for

A savage land and a band of terrible mercenaries
Program your lives like the wives of Stepford

Glorified hookers smash your glass slippers
Nothing can tempt me, everyone empty

Trade craftwork off exotic substance

I'm trying to hurt myself, still smoking
But I'm a afraid of blood won't cut my wrist open
Told you that I loved you, I was just joking
You can't hurt my heart it's been broken

In whatever shape or form 
Baby girl gotta put me on

It's been ten years runnin' and you still look stunning
One in a million diamond you're beautiful with brilliance
Still it's not enough even though we're inseparable
We need to take a break but that don't mean that I'll let you go
Tears become streams we got the same dreams
What's with all the competition ma we on the same team
Angel some times I don't show it on the surface but your 
Face is un-replaceable, it's perfect, you're worth it
I'm not always there emotionally even though you're close to me
I got work to do that's how its supposed to be
And I ain't into choppin' it up I'll switch the topic 
Don't trip go you a brand new whip, and took you shoppin'
It's cool just do your thing while I work on this music shit
If we don't end up back together though I'm going to lose it kid

Her waist is small, her booty's real fatty
I let her hold the keys to my Caddy

Of all the beautiful women that I've met in this world
Why is it such a challenge to find the right girl?
I've dated actresses models, strippers, intellectuals
Four months max, like Maxim its all sexual
Incredible I've been to more than twenty countries
Got dirty ugly with honeys that were lovely 
Trust me I'm a Scorpio that's how it has to be
'Til I'm chillin' with a children and a house I'm fast and free

Lookin' back through all the springs that passed
A summertime fun with no strings attached 
Never find love and these flings don't last
Will there ever be a queen for this king to match
Until then I'll be...

With like-minded maniacs who like abuse

Revenge will be the motivation, open wounds, lacerations
Focus my fascination, nose to the grindstone
This is not an accident battle axe accurate
Immaculate structure my alphabetic framework
Strength of a monolith, brains of a novelist
Ominous approach engulf words like a bonfire
Spiritual vision quest, sacred as eagle's nest
