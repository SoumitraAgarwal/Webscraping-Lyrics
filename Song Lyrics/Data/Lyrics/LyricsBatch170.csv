That girl can sure enough make my little light shine
I get a funny feelin' up and down my spine
Cause I know that my elvira's mine

So I'm singin'
Elvira, elvira
My heart's on fire elvira
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Heigh-ho silver, away

Tonight I'm gonna meet her at the hungry house cafe
And I'm gonna give her all the love I can
She's gonna jump and holler 'cause I saved up my last two dollars
We're gonna search and find that preacher man

Now I'm a singin'
Elvira, elvira
My heart's on fire elvira

Home Grown,"Now I've been workin' at this company for three years,
You think by then that I'd earned some respect.
But the company is run by high corporate fagots.
Who're only interested in gaining more profit.

And when I thought I wasn't getting my fair share,
And I asked for a bigger cut of the wealth,
They just told me to think again,
And said that they could find someone else.

Employer's market nah they don't give a shit.
Still at this company for the fourth year
Guess I'm too lazy to find a better job.

Maybe I'll see if k-marts' still hirin,
Or get an application at Jack-in-the-Box.
And when I got caught out to lunch early,
I got a lecture for 10 min long and then he fired me right there at 1:30.
That's what inspired me to write this song.",Employer's Market
Home Grown,"I've been wasting my life for 19 years.
I'm tired of sitting around,
Watching football and drinking beer.
I don't want to go to work.
Pushed around by a fucking jerk.
I don't want to do anything.
But my life is in a rut.
An education I gave up.
I don't want to do anything.

Oh yeah! I'm going out to get a job.
I'm gonna rise up to the top.
I'm gonna make a million dollars.
A couple years have gone by,
I feel I'm getting old.
Nothing to do with my life.
I'm just a loser with nowhere to go",Get a Job
Home Grown,"Huh? What did you say?
Repeat it again.
Talk a little louder, talk as loud as you can.
There's a ringin' in my ear.
My hearing is not clear.
Talk a little louder, man, I just don't understand.

You don't know, you don't know what it is like
When i try to talk to people, it gets me so uptight.
All you stupid people! Don't you understand?
To have a conversation, I have to use both hands.

Huh? What? I've got a hearing problem, it's my disability.
It's always the same, every single day.
Physically disabled and it's getting to my brain.
There's a ringing in my ear.
I cannot fucking hear.
Talk a little louder, man, I just don't understand.

Don't try to raise your volume, it won't do any good.
Neither of my nodes are working like they should.
All you stupid people. Can't you understand?
To have a conversation I have to use both hands.
Huh? What? I've got a hearing problem and I try to comprehend.
If I want to talk, I have to use both hands.
I've got a hearing problem and I think I'm going deaf.",The Hearing Song
Home Grown,"Deep down inside me, I feel I need a change.
So sick of everything, it all just seems the same.
Always unhappy, I cannot find a smile.
Wasting my life away, I guess you can call it suicide.

My life's a waste.
Nothing left for me to hate.
I hate myself. I have no friends.
I'm treading water, I'm struggling by the edge.
I'm sitting here all alone, I just can't lose myself.
My friends ignore me, they think my life's a waste.
They're now my enemies, all of which I hate.

Always unhappy, I got a gun pointed to my head.
Will someone come help me now, before I turn out dead?",I Hate Myself
Home Grown,"Impotency really sucks.
I don't know why I can't get it up.
Why me?! Why?!
All of my friends make fun of me.

""Hard to ejaculate! Easy to pee!""
Now I can dance with girls without getting a woodrow!
I'm flaccid and limp. I can't get an erection.
(Aw, my only chance to get laid and this had to happen)

There must be something wrong with me.
I will never get laid.
I've got a penis infection.
There must be something wrong with me!!
Uh, duh...impotency!

I went to my doctor the other day,
He asked me if I was straight or gay.
Well, my eyes are slanted.
That's not the problem can't you see, you stupid rug rat?
I've got a problem. actually, I've got a case called impotency.
Oh yeah, yeah.",Impotency
Home Grown,"I feel estranged from all my friends.
I feel a disconnection, I guess I don't need them.
When they're around, they'll criticize...
About my happiness, it makes me hurt inside.

Overcoming all my fears.
Constantly criticized by all my peers..
I don't want you around me anymore.
Find someone else to be your friend leave me alone.

Leave me alone.
When I'm by myself, I feel so free.
No one to push me down and make me brush my teeth.
When they're around, they'll criticize.
My friends don't understand that they're hurting me inside",My Friends Suck
Home Grown,"When I think about her, I just get down.
Knowing that she doesn't want me around.
Maybe if she would try.
Things would work out.
But I know that it's useless to maintain this state of hopelessness
'cause when i see her.. she said she's got better things too do.

Masturbations' left me alone.
I can't even talk to myself on the phone.
Maybe if she would try.
Things would work out.
But i know that it's useless to think that she'd love me
'cause she is a stupid bitch an' she said she's got better guys to do.

My heads spinning around I can't think about it.
Maybe I'm someone she... she can't understand.",She Said...
Home Grown,"Hey, I cannot wait until the end.
The end is near and coming soon.
You're not bad but you're not great.

Now you're just a worthless, worthless fuck!",Worthless
Home Grown,"What if everything you had, 
You had to give back? 
Would you be the same? 
I don't think you would 
There's so many things that you don't appreciate 
No!Â  

[Chorus]
All that you haveÂ  

And have you ever really thought 
About all that you've got 
More than what you own 
Your family and your friends 
Without which you would be left here all alone So when you're feeling down 
Just take a look around 
And look at all you have 
And you'll see that things are really not that badÂ

Home Grown,"You've been rejected, 
deceived and neglected 
by another girl 
Now you're locked in your room 
Inhaling toxic fumes, 
Because you're thinking about her 

It's been a month and a halfÂ 
And you're still feeling sad 
When you saw her at a dance 
She was kissing and hugging, 
playing and loving 
With her new boyfriendÂ  

I know she broke your heart 
And it's hard to be hard 
And pretend that you don't care 
Well that's what you get 
When you date that girl named Blair 

Now she's calling your house 
'Cause she wants to hang out 
And do that thing you do 
You're getting overexcited 
and you cannot fight 
The fact that she's bad newsÂ  

She says she wants you back 
But back as a friend 
And I know you're giving in 
To a girl that's going toÂ  
Break your heart again 

Just give it some thought 
It never worked out 
Think about the shit she put you through 
You should give up, 
she's leading you on 
I know she's not the one for you 

She's been around the block 
She's been with all the jocks 
Including all your friends 
It's not the end of the world, 
she's just another girl 
That I don't recommendÂ

Home Grown,"You're J.E.A.L.O.U.S
Because I've got bigger breast
I know you're envious of me
It's useless to pretend
That you want to be my friend
You can't control your jealousy

[Bridge: x2]
Unhappy with yourself
Go pick on someone else
""Miss Insecurity"" You have no reason to hate me
I'm not your enemy

Hey think back when, 
you first started kindergarten

Painting pictures for our moms and dads Knowing that they would be so proud

With things that you don't have control over?
What good is it to worry when
You never know what's really going to happen?

[Chorus]
Tomorrow's just another day away, you'll find your way
You'll be okay You just have to learn to let go

When things get you down
Should you look back? No!
Turn your head around
And take things one day at a time
But plan ahead for mountains you have yet to climb

Home Grown,"It seems the harder that I try 
The further I fall behind, I'm falling behind. 
So many things I just don't know. 
All these decisions 
Too little time to decide themÂ  
I wonder why I even tryÂ  

[Chorus]
Seems it happened once againÂ  
Do my best but in the end 
What have I done, well, nothing 
In a world that moves so fastÂ  
Yeah, I'll be sure to finish last 
Left with nothing to show 
I'm going nowhere slowÂ

Not meeting expectations

So many things I just don't know

But tell me something I haven't heard

Why don't you shut up And get away from me
I can do anything I please
I've heard you say it a thousand times before
It's something I ignore The things you say to me

Degrade me by calling me names

Home Grown,"Sitting in her class
Sophisticated, anti-social brat
She never speaks a word
That's why she's sitting in the back
No one knows her name
I never knew that she existed

Then one tragic day she came to school and went ballistic
With an ak in her right hand
She shot the cheerleading squad and ran
They're all dead, they're all dead

She's alone in her class
There's no one left for her to blast
She's always kicking ass
Masochistic, gothic, dressed in black
No knows her name
I never knew she was sadistic

On April 28th, she came to school and went ballistic
With a rifle in her left hand
She blew away the football team and ran
They're all dead, they're all dead

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
She's a bitch, she hates everyone
She's one of those anti-girls
Pessimistic and cynical
She's a victim of this lonely world, yeah

She's a little insane
And she's crazy
She's kookie, ookie, dookie

I didn't mean to let you suffer 
I didn't mean to let you downÂ

For circumstances that

Home Grown,"I was at the beach, 
Sitting on the sand 
When I saw this girl 
Dark brown eyes, and a dark olive tan 
She was watching the sets 
With a surfboard underneath her arm 
The first moment I saw her 
I knew she'd do me some harm 
She's so good 
She came out of the water 
From the best session I'd seen 
Man, she had the biggest chi chis I had ever seen 
She put down her board, 
And sat down next to me 
And played a soft ole lonely tune, 
On her ukulele 
I don't know what had happened 
But I'd fallen asleep 
The next morning I woke up 
She was sleeping next to meÂ  

[Chorus]
I fell in love with her 
I'm so in love with her 
I fell in love with her 
My little Surfer GirlÂ  

She got out of bed 
Waxed up both our boards 
Grabbed me by the hand and then 
She took me out the door 
We surfed all that day long 
At least eight hours straight 
Man! I knew she was the one 
And damn I couldn't wait 
Well I asked if she loved me 
She said, ""Yeah well I guess"" 
So I asked her to marry me 
Dammit, you know she said ""yes""Â  

[Chorus]Â  

I was at the alter 
In my tuxedo-o-o 
Waiting for my Surfer Girl 
Man, where did she go 
Later on that day 
A friend to me did tell-ell-ell 
That she went to Mexico 
To catch a, to Catch a, 
To catch a 10 foot swell

Home Grown,"26 hours, 2000 miles away 
A broken trust severed us 
An ocean of secrets that you left behind Unlocked by false assumptions

And I shouldn't have, shouldn't have, shouldn't have 
Shouldn't haveÂ  
Pushed you awayÂ

Now that you're gone, I know what I've lost 
And I can't get you out of my mind 
I wish I could turn back time 
I'm biting my tongue with my foot in mouth 
I'm kicking myself, kicking myself in the ass 
I know I shouldn't judge you by your past

Jealousy hit me 
I screamed and shouted at you 
When I heard that you've been with my friends It's none of my business, what you have been through 
I was scared I would get hurt again

And I shouldn't have, shouldn't have, shouldn't have

I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
 
You better get back to your use to be
'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me
 
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been

That I would never go with you

Now I know how much you really cared
You cared for me
I never did appreciate
The sacrifices that you made
You made for our love our love

[Chorus x2:]
I know that you deserve
More than I could ever offer
But I can't change who I am

And if you knew what was in store
Why did you persevere and endure
As long as you did For our love
All the words left unsaid
I can't seem to get out of my head, my head
Believe me I meant you no harm, no harm
I'm sorry

Homemade,"Poor Billy received his new on a Sunday
Woken by his mother and she had just this to say 
My son please return to me safe and ok you only turned
18 five months ago this may
Into the chopper his soul climbed aboard
Dressed up all in green with the cross of the lord
He will soon be revealed to this violence and sin
Brought by his country to protect and to defend
He looked to the sky and pictured it way back when
Will I return the same boy or a man without friends
(Chorus)
Lead into those trees
The ones that stood oh so tall
We gave the government our fees
And Mr. Nixon took it all
To pay off all the plumbers that broke right through that wall
Well that was then and this is now Together as we fall

Now this boy comes back just looking to the crowd
Who once was his friend but now is not allowed
To be with all the killers in society today
Given off this feeling Billy was betrayed
Crying to his mother just like he had done before
Forced to see the bed that left behind the door
Pushed to shoot, shoot aim and kill
It was burned into his mind and soon it was a thrill
Now this boy comes back reaching to his chest
Looking for the love of god that he had put to rest
Now I lay myself down to sleep
I shall pray the lord to myself to keep 
And if I die before I wake
I wish I could give back all the souls I had to take
Please set me free
On free to live this place
This manhood? That was given underneath those trees, those trees.

Homer & Jethro,"When I was walking down the street, a billboard caught my eye.
The advertisement written there would make you laugh and cry.
The sign was torn and tattered from the storm the night before,
And as I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr:

Smoke Coca-Cola cigarettes. Drink Wrigley's Spearmint beer.
Ken-L-Ration dog food makes your wife's complexion clear.
Chew chocolate-covered mothballs -- they're sure to satisfy.
Brush your teeth with Lifebuoy soap and watch the suds go by.

When I recovered from the sock, I went along my way.
I'd gone no further than a block, when there to my dismay,
Another billboard caught my eye, just like the one before,
As I gazed upon it, well, this is what I sawr:

Take your next vacation in a brand-new Frigidaire.
Learn to play piano in your winter underwear. 
Simonize your baby with a Hershey's candy bar,
And see the difference that Drano makes in all the movie stars!

Doctors say that babies shouldn't smoke 'til they are three.
People over 35, take baths in Lipton Tea.
Oh, you can make America a better place today --
Just buy a copy of this song and throw it far away!",The Billboard Song
Homer & Jethro,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Honest Touch,"I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

(Don't go sharing your devotion)

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me",Epilogue: Lay All Your Love on Me
Honestly,"You never look my way
You don't even care
Do I freak you out?
I can't help it if I stare
I'd give you everything
If you'd show me what to do
But I'd settle for one glance
After all you've put me through

So tired of being nothing
Something's got to give
I've got to do something
Something

'Cause I
I don't know what to do
Tripped up over you
I'm helpless here
Why can't you read my mind?

Stuck inside my head
I lose my point of view
You make such a mess of me
Does it matter what I do?

I'm tired of being nothing
Something's got to give
Can we just be something
Anything

'Cause I
I don't know what to do
Tripped up over you
I'm helpless here
Why can't you read my mind?
And I
I don't know what to say

Honestly,"I'm falling to a place of recognition
You retreat to avoid the pain
I'm breaking free from my condition
You just sit and wait for change
I won't react if you say there's nothing left to save
You're lying when you tell me everything's gonna be okay

Are you desperate for anything?

[Chorus]
Run as far and as fast as I know you can
You lost your faith
That's all you had
Leave behind everything you pretend to be
Just let it go
Or you'll never be free

There's nothing left
Only isolation
You're drowning in apathy
Can you even see a simple revelation
And if it hurt would you feel the sting

You're not desperate for anything

Free...

You gotta know I've been there before

Honey,"Take me down so easy
Somewhere under the falling sky
Turn around to see me
Anywhere you want to be tonight

Stay with me tomorrow
So I know tonight will last
Stay with me tomorrow
So I feel our hearts running fast

Live it on so easy
Don't need anything but us tonight

Our love is ending
But new love's beginning for you, baby
Only time will tell if this love will fail, 
Will tomorrow bring you sorrow?

If you're drifting around
Having your ups and downs
If your luck starts to change sunshine turns to rain
I'll be your sun again, together we can win

You've been so good to me
Lord knows I prayed
You'll make it all the way with your new love
If the day ever comes, you feel are the ones
It's not too late if it's a mistake

If you're walking down the aisles

A woman's work is never done
Never stops, it goes on and on
You work your fingers to the bone
You gotta be home every time he phones
 
Sometimes the going gets a little tough
Seems like my best ain't good enough
Keeps you losing sleep 
Seven days a week, yeah
 
It ain't easy
Girls it ain't easy
To keep the man you love satisfied
It ain't easy
Girls it ain't easy
To keep the one you love by your side
 
To keep him happy
You must sacrifice
Be ready and willing
To spend lonely nights
Do what you can
Though he seems ungrateful
Love him so true
Even though he seems unfaithful
 
But when his hope is gone
And life gets him down
That's when he'll say 
He needs you around
 
Hard to live with him
Hard to live without him
It ain't easy, no
 
Oh, yeah, it ain't easy
Girls it ain't easy
It ain't easy
Girls it ain't easy
 
You got to favor him with understanding
When understanding is what he needs
We try hard to give them respect
All that we get is their regret
 
But when they're in trouble
They need our love and care
No matter when we gotta be right there
In between the crying
Gotta keep trying
 
It ain't easy
Girls it ain't easy, ooh, ooh, ooh
It ain't easy
Girls it ain't easy
 
It ain't easy 
Girls it ain't easy, yeah, ooh
It ain't easy
Girls it ain't easy, no",Girls It Ain't Easy
Honey Cone,"Do you remember when
Just waiting around the bend
Was more than fortune, more than fame?
But then you walked away
With my last sunny day
Now all that's left in my life is rain

[Chorus]
I lost my rainbow; 
I lost my pot of gold
I lost a dream for you
The moment I lost you

When I was loved by you, 
I had a patch of blue
A lovely star to wish upon
Without your hand to hold, 
I'm lost without a goal
Even the Milky Way is gone

[Chorus]

I can't see it in another sky
I can't see it in another's eyes
No other love can calm the storm that's inside of me, 
Can bring out the sun and keep me warm
The way it used to be
Will I see sunshine ever again?

Without your love I'm never gonna find it

Honey Cone,"[Chorus:]
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow

Life's too short to make a mistake
Let's think of each other and hesitate
Young and impatient we may be
There's no need to act foolishly
If we part our hearts won't forget it
Years from now we'll surely regret it

[Chorus:]

You're young and you're in a hurry
You're eager for love but don't you worry
We both want the sweetness in life
But these things don't come overnight
Don't give up 'cause love's been slow
Boy, we're gonna succeed with another blow

Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Baby please baby
Baby please baby

Love is that mountain we must climb
Let's climb it together your hand in mine
We haven't known each other too long
But the feeling I have is oh so strong
I know we can make it there's no doubt
We owe it to ourselves to find it out

Just,

Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Baby, please baby

Honey Cone,"You know I got a letter from a friend of mine
In Newcastle upon a Tyne the other day
He said to me, ""Eric, I heard you've been havin'
Some trouble down in the smoke with the girls""

He said, ""You wanna catch that flyin' Scotsman
Back up here to Newcastle
'Cause we've got enough females to go around up here
And I can figure you can find yourself a little somethin'""

""And because people around here
Don't go away stealin' each others loved ones
Away from one another
Like they do down there in the smoke""

He also said in the letter that, ah
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne
And I believed every word he said now
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne

One more thing he told me now
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne
He said to me, babe
Things don't happen like that here on Tyne

He said, alright, alright
So I'm sayin' to you who are listenin'
If you've been unlucky in love
And you've lost somebody love

And you hear a voice that comes to you
In the middle of the night and says
It says I want you to get on up
Listen to me, I want you to get on up
And find yourself another one

If you're havin' breakfast one morning
And out from behind the teapot a little voice says
Listen, hey, I want you to get on up now
If you're out in the mornin' on your job

And a voice come to you on your job and says
Get up, get up
And you know it's not the foreman
It's a little voice that says

You wanna get up and walk [unverified], women
Go on and find yourself somebody
That's what you'd better do

Because I'll tell you one thing
There's one thing I found out
One thing I found out
Took me a long time to find it out

Yeah, it took me a long time to find out
But I think I got it now, oh, yeah
One monkey don't stop no show
Yes, it's true, baby

One monkey don't stop no show
Don't let one monkey stop up your show

One monkey don't stop no show

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never should of let you go

I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever

Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you

'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips

Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby

And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you

And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong

The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

Something to Believe In

(Andrews/ Neuhauser)


Did you come here for the show

Or to meet someone you might or might not know

It doesn't matter to me

Did you smile your way in through the back door

With a stamp on your hand from the night before?

It doesn't matter to me


'Cause when I open up my eyes

And you're looking at me

I get the feeling that I

Know just what you need

Somewhere to Belong

Something to Believe in


Every day we get up and go

Pack our things in a different town

And head on down the road

We got somewhere to be

People follow as far as they can

I don't pretend that I understand

When they tell me I'm changing their lives

With the songs I sing


'Cause when I open up my eyes

And you're looking at me

I get the feeling that I

Know just what you need

Somewhere to Belong

Something to Believe in


I wish that I could be the one they needed

Every night I pray, asking what to say

To give them

Somewhere to Belong

Something to Believe In


'Cause when I open up my eyes

And you're looking at me

I get the feeling that I

Know just what you need

Somewhere to Belong

Something to Believe in

Somewhere to belong

Something to believe in!

[Chorus:]
Sacrifice your freedom
Sacrifice your prayer
Take away your language
Cut off all your hair
Sacrifice the loved ones
Who always stood by me
Stranded in the wasteland
Set my spirit free

My name is Leonard Peltier
I am a Lakota and Anishnabe
And I am living in the United States penitentiary
Which is the swiftest growing
Indian reservations in the country

I have been in prison since 1976
For an incident that took place on the Oglala-Lakota Nation
There was a shoot-out between members of the American Indian Movement
And The FBI and the local Sheriffs State Troopers
Two agents were killed and one Indian was murdered

Three of us were charged with the deaths of the FBI agents
My co-defendants were found not-guilty by reasons of self-defense
My case was separated and I was found guilty before a jury of non-Indian
people
The prosecutor stated that they did not know who killed their agents
Nor did he know what participation Leonard Peltier may have played in it
But someone has to pay for the crime

There's a lot of nights that I lay in my cell
And I can't understand why this hell this hell and this terror
That I have been going through for twenty-one years hasn't ended

[Chorus:]

But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay sacrifice
To make things better for our people
The sacrifice I have made when I really sit down to think about it
Is nothing compared to what our people a couple hundred years ago
Or fifty years ago or twenty-five years ago have made
Some gave their lives
Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arm",Sacrifice

Then I started to lose my nerve why am I taking so long?
I had a million questions running up inside my head:
Is she lonely? Is she tired? Does she got a man? What does she wear in bed?
But I just stood there frozen and she got away.

It coulda been me and you together walking in the rain.
We coulda been making out and making plans to run away.
But here I am all alone outside and I really wish I told her everything that I was feeling inside.

I had an angel by my side.
Why didn't I? Didn't I?
I had angel by my side.

I started to ask around if anyone might know her name.
A friend of hers told me that she thought she was single again.
That's all the info that I needed to keep hope alive.
I searched the dorm and the caf and the laundromat and the park and ride.
Then one fateful day I saw her at the top of the stairs,
So I got up my courage, started walking over there.
And as I did I saw another guy with his hand in her hair.
I guess I was too late.

I said 'Who's the guy?' 
She said 'Just a friend and I've been wondering where you've been!'
And we walked around and we got to know each other very well that fall.

Hoobastank,"Staring at the white above
Can't tell if I'm alive or am I dead?
Or is it in my head?
Where'd I go wrong?

Staring at the white above
One day I closed my eyes and here I am
A cold, unhappy man
I've come to realize that the life I have I hate
The pulse I need is slowly fading
Until I've lost it all

I've been waiting for an inspiration
For a chance I never got to take
Before it's much too late
Where'd I go wrong?

[Chorus]
Where's the boy that used to run?
Could it be he's up and gone away?
He seems so far away (he seems so far away-ay)
And all the things I could have done
Could it be they've up and gone away
They seem to far away (they seem so far away-ay)

It feels as if the boy in me has 
Left and been replaced with a cheap and bitter
Imposter of myself
I must find the one that used to be
Approach him slow and don't be afraid to say
""Can he come out and play?""
Where'd I go wrong?

[Chorus]

Staring at the sky above
I found a chance I'm finally going to take
I've learned from my mistakes
Where'd I go wrong?

For just a seconds worth of how my story's ending
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take
And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing

[Chorus]
Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer
Is there something more
Than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer

Help me carry on
Assure me it's ok to
Use my heart and not my eyes
To navigate the darkness
Will the ending be
Ever coming suddenly?
Will I ever get to see
The ending to my story?

[Chorus]

So when and how will I know?

How much further do I have to go? (have to go)

You gave it all up

We're not the same, no

Hoobastank,"There's a pain that sleeps inside
It sleeps with just one eye
And awakens the moment that you're near
Though I try to look away

Only leaving when you're next to me

Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear
Make them disappear and we can stay

Distracted by the sounds
Of everyone and everything I see
And I search through every face
Without a single trace, of the person
The person that I need

Escape to a place where we'll be together, together everyday

All of the dreams we built up from the ground
They never believed them 
They just tore them down
We will rebuild them from the start
We will rebuild them from the heart

Are yours to hold if
You just give them

Something they can sell
Put upon a shelf
That I am not for sell
I am not for sell

I here a voice inside
It's crowning to a scream
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me
'cause I can live the lie
I am just what you see
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me

If I can't refuse
The price they offer
I am sure to lose
And I will suffer
Sell my soul to make a profit
All I have to do
Is make believe it's true
That something I can't do
That something I can't do

I here a voice inside
It's crowning to a scream
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me
'cause I can live the lie
I am just what you see
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me

So when the waiting's gone
This time to face the truth
You know your good enough
Deep down inside of you

You're finally woken up
If only just to prove
You are born to lead the way
Then be the first of you",The First of Me
Hoobastank,"I only wanted you to feel,
How I thought you deserved to feel.
The way you always said you wanted to.

You wanted all we have to be real,
And every word we say to be true.
Still after all I gave it's not enough for you.

Well, I can't give any more,
So now I'm giving up.
Cause nothing's ever good enough.

And the more I try to pour,
The less I fill your cup.
Cause nothing's ever good enough.

I only wanted you to see,
That you can be who you wanted to be.
And fill the lonely void inside of you.

I gave you everything that you need,
Did what you always wanted to do.
Still after all I've done I can't get through.

Well, I can't give any more,
So now I'm giving up.

Hoobastank,"You seem to find the dark, when everything is bright
You look for all that's wrong, instead of all that right
Does it feel good to you? to reign on my parade
You never say a word, unless it's to complain
It's driving me insane

If I were you, holding the world right in my hands.
The first thing I'd do, is thank the stars for all that I am
If I were you

Look what's around you now, more than you ever dreamed
Have you forgotten just, how hard it use to be?
So what's it going to take? for you to realize
That all could go away, in one blink of an eye
It happens all the time

If I were you, holding the world right in my hands.
The first thing I'd do, is thank the stars above, tell the words I love
That I do

Yea if I were you,
Whoa, yea if I were you
If I were you, whoa
Yea if I were you

So what's it going to take? for you to realise
It all could go away, in one blink of an eye it happens all the time!

If I were you, holding the world right in my hands.

A simple Truth I was scared I'd felt it all along. 
But it hurt to much for me to share. 

[Chorus:]
If only I had been less blind, 
I'd have someone to hold onto. 
If only I could change your mind.
If only I had known, if only I had you. 

I finally understand why things have 
Happened and how it all could go so wrong. 
Will this pain ever end, 
Cause I don't think I can carry on.

If only I had you.

Hoobastank,"It seems so obvious
There's something up with us
I swear I feel it
From across the room.
So can I ask you this?
Not to be forward, miss,
But I think I'll kill myself
If I never know

What do I have to do
To get inside of you?
To get inside of you?
Cause I love the way you move,
When I'm inside of you.
When I'm inside of you

Just ask and I will do
Anything you want me to
There is no limit
To how far I will go
And Im sure I can pretend
To be a gentlemen..
But before I begin,
I just gotta know,
Just gotta know.

What do I have to do
To get inside of you?
To get inside of you?
Cause I love the way you move,
When I'm inside of you.
When I'm inside of you

For now I'll play the game
And I'm waiting for your move
But I've got to say
That I never lose

To get inside of you?
To get inside of you?
What do I have to do
To get inside of you?

When this all felt like a dream.
So completely out of reach,
Frustrating.

We kept our nose to the grind,
Make the days turn into weeks.
Hoping time will heal the pain,

Now it seems so long ago.

We've made it somehow,
Look where we are now.

Our battles won.
We've made it somehow,
Look where we are now.

I used to wonder if I,
Would ever have the chance to be,
Something more than what you see.
I doubt it.

We learned to open our eyes,
Now I both think we'd agree, 
That we're better off than when we started.

Too afraid to upset anyone

There's something I need to say

No more guilt for what I see
In the mirror staring back at me

There's something I need to say
It's growing everyday
Things are going to change

[Chorus]

And it feels like I am naked
Stripped for you to see
My scars and imperfections
But you never seemed to notice
'Cause you're too busy covering up your cuts and bruises
From who knows what
Just like me

So why apologize
For who I've come to be
'Cause who the hell am I
If I cant be me
I've wasted too much time
On insecurities
'Cause this is who I am 
And that's fine with me.",Who the Hell Am I?
Hoobastank,"I feel the wind rush across my face
Like an invisible wave crashing over me
I started holding my breath the moment I left
Wondering what the day was gonna bring for me

But there is no way that I could ever prepare
For the scope of it all for the chill in the air
The cold of the rain the, the warmth of the day
I'm never gonna be the same

[Chorus]
The whole world's racing by
And no words can describe
How this feels inside
You need to be here
You need to be here with me
They come and go so fast
These moments never last
So you need to be here
You need to be here with me

It's something new and beyond every corner is a mystery
'Cause every road that I have taken can never be mistaken
For the one that is now under my feet
And I realize with open eye's
Every second that we have is once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

[Chorus]

'Cause something is incomplete
Not quite how it should be
And I try and I try just to live in the moment
But everything I do
Just leads me back to you
'Cause there is no thoughts

[Chorus]",You Need to Be Here
Hoobastank,"Tonight I'm letting go
Of all the old excuses
The fears I built so close
Cause inside I've always known
That no one else could ever do

But this I know for sure

You're the one
I need you more than ever

Just tell me where and when

Who understands
Who makes me better than I am
I do it all because of you

Had come undone
You stood and fought

You're the one who
Pulled us through

Will help us to get through
So by ourselves

So close your eyes
And just let yourself go

Those words jump off the letter, that I found behind our
Bed, haunting me they echo in my head
In my head...

It's too late to try and work it out
There's no way to turn this thing around
It's all there in the letter that I found
I've memorized it line for line
Too bad the letter isn't mine....

""When can I next see you? I've been counting down the days.
I promise you our secret will be safe.""

You wanted me to find it, girl.
You never tried to hide it, girl.
The writing nevere fades, the words are here to stay.

I hope you find this letter, I'm writing you today,
These will be the last words that I say....

All the dirt of my mistakes

So I write your name in my breath on the window

Of the tears of yesterday

It's not enough to drown my thoughts or ease the pain
So instead I'll soak it in
While I stare outside again

And I write your name in my breath on the window
Sit and watch as it fades away
The painful memories
Of the tears of yesterday

I try so hard but I can't seem to let go
I lost so much when you walked away
The painful memories
Of the tears of yesterday

The sun just won't seem to come out
Not since you walked away
Now I cannot escape
I cannot escape the rain

Blinded by the fear of something new

All along what's missing has been you

To fill a hole in me

Thought I had it figured out
But then you came along

I knew that I was wrong, I was wrong

Is sit and wait for you

Is sit and wait for you

Are you movin' ahead
Am I fallin' behind
Fuck it, probably either way, it's probably all in my mind
You got all that you want
I got nothin' but time
Honestly all we want is somebody to grind with
In a junior high prom, probably regrettin' my haircut
And the color of my tie, let's photoshop it and airbrush
As long as the girl with me is more fly than air miles
I'mma be a happy camper with nothin' to care about
Damn, well put, that's the way it goes
I know you say that you love him, but that was days ago
I moved to London and tried to find me a Daisy Lowe
I mean it can't be that hard to find a crazy ho
She high up on the Macy floor, I'm flowin' in my fast car
You want to watch the world end in my backyard
We go in circles, that's NASCAR

Only you get me high, high, high
High again
Leavin' your smell on my clothes
I think that I'm losin' my mind again
Baby, don't leave me alone
You get me high, high, high, high

All I want to do
Is sit and wait for you
All I want to do
Is sit and wait for you

Are you goin' with him, am I takin' you home
Fuck it, probably either way, I end up alone
You got all that you want, I got nothin' to show
Honestly all we want is somebody to bone, so
Can I get your phone number, your credit card, and your passport
You gave me this crude face like why did I ask for it
My plane to the UK, but I didn't pack for it
If this is a layup, then where is the backboard
A sinful investigation is makin' me
I'm with you, I'm suffocating, my lungs are like fuckin' fire
There isn't an explanation you wouldn't try to get me high

All I want to do
Is sit and wait for you
All I want to do
Is sit and wait for you

Nobody's gonna keep me down
(You get me high again)
My feet are floatin' off the ground
(You get me high again)
And every time they ?
Only you can get me this high

Where we stayin' tonight? Am I playing it right?
And can I knock it out of the park like late in the 9th
Cause everyone in the crowd loves a comeback
So name a city that I'm in and I run that

They be lookin' for world peace by they end up with Art
Testing, testing, one, two, three heres the microphone
I kick it with the Hoodie Mob, and now I feel like Al Capone
But you the biggest drama queen, fine you won the trophy
Cause the only time you like genuine is on the pony
I hit the gold mine, I'm trying to whore this

You a small town girl but you living in the city
So you always keep your heart near your passport

I don't know what's next for us

People wanna tell me that I'm too honest
Walking on eggshells, two omelettes
And I know it's hard cause you left your town
Dad don't call like he let you down
You don't wanna talk when the sun is out

Baby I don't know.
Want me more or less
Want me more or less, or less
Is it all for sex?
Baby, I hope so.

You tell me what you want, what you really really want.
I ain't got time, if you think that you're in love, with me.
So tell me what you want from me, oh

You're bitching all the time, that you never get enough from me.
So tell me what you want from me, oh

Give me some bad advice,
I hate when you ask me over
You drunk off a glass of wine
No wonder I'm acting sober
So cut me out of your life
And leave me like class is over
When the day goes, and the night comes
I'll still be your Casanova

And you can say it's just a dream I'm feeling
You wanna take me down a notch but this is more appealing like
I got the type of life that no one trying to mess with,
You got that McKayla Maroney bitches ain't impressed with, you

And I don't need a damn guitar

Watch me I'm going far
Living out all my dreams
I used to live in my car
Now it's a limousine
I put it in the garage
Right next to my degrees

Hundred dollars for a hat
Trying to keep it supreme
I bet you're trying to fit in with your best friends
But your best friends
Made some bad investments

I wish I could but I don't believe you for a second
You said you living good but call me when the Mets win
The Mets win it in the pendent
Doing it independent
They tell me I hit a wall
They wondering where I'm headed

Busy buying the barn and busy trying to rent it
It happens when you sit around and wait cause you forget it

And I be playing poker with a blind man, throwing all my chips in
Working till I'm breaking every record like I'm Ripken
Dang

I wanna go where the lights are low and the dreamers are chasing,
I wanna live like we don't know much but we know we're gonna make it,

Hoodie Allen,"I said my tour just sold out
Album's been bought out, girlfriend might put out terrific
Oh that's the good route, shit that you dream 'bout
Now that you got it feels different
I don't need no one, no one to tell me
Everything will be alright
Hair just like Elvis, hands on her pelvis
But let me delve in

I said I got a lot of dreams and you got a lot of needs
So there ain't a lot of time for me to help it
And I ain't slept in nearly twenty weeks, is that healthy?
I'm making money when I go to sleep, is that wealthy?
I'd rather talk about my self esteem but that's selfish
Lot of folks complain about the cards that you dealt me
But I'm still here shuffling the deck, yo what's come of it?
Used to know it all, now I'd rather just discover it
So fuck it, man
I said fuck it, man
Yo, fuck it, man, I'm just a lucky man

Baby I want it all
Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore

She like ""oh you so worried about getting broads and shit""
Comin' to my shows just to hear applause and shit
They get mad at me when the fans throw they bras and shit
Tryna tell me that it ain't part of my job descrip
I'm re-writing the history either way you interpret it
My life is like a circus the way these clowns have been surfacing
But you had my back, you memorized every word
Maybe bridges are meant to be burned
And when he gave you passes, I was gassed I can't lie
But I was busy living out my passions, that's why
My friend's just laugh, it's funny
The type of shit I'm mad at
90% Is love, but all we hear is the bad
I wish I could take back the time we wasted talking 'bout you
I wish I could take back the time we wasted being mad
The funny thing about it's that I'm better off without you
It'd be worse if nothing changed
So now I'm glad that I matter on my own
Yeah I matter on my own
Really out here on my own dog
And I just thought that you should know

Baby I want it all
Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore, oh oh

And I don't want to let this thing go
'Cause they leaving me with nothing, nothing
Leaving me with nothing, nothing
On my own
I'd rather just watch it all grow
'Cause at least I got something, something
100% Of something, something
On my own

Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore

Baby I want it all
Baby I want it all
And I can't run away, don't know what to say or do anymore, oh oh",100 Percent of Something
Hoodie Allen,"Yo, they say the way I act is immature
Well don't be mad at me because you're feeling insecure
The only golf I ever tried to play was miniature
And when you ask me sign your boobs I smiley face my signature
But my parents raised me right, they were sticklers
And we don't even fight, we're like oil and some vinegar
Getting a job is like a pregnant woman giving birth
You're trying to push me in the wrong direction and it fucking hurts
So most our friends already moved out of they mama's cribs
I'm still throwing parties at my house, like Stifler
So if you go around and try to tell me how to live
I'mma take your girl and Mortal Kombat finish her

But when it's done and the party shuts down
And the cops try to lay my ass on the ground
One day we might tell our kids
But until that day let's live like this

My friends grew up, they never get drunk
They never wanna hang out late
They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills
They're gonna get old and gray
I'll never do that, I wanna stay young
Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun
So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age

Yo, and when it comes to getting older
No matter what I do, I'm never feeling like a grown up
People trying to make me change, you'd think there was a quota
Like there ain't enough unemployed motherfuckers with diplomas
Everybody waiting 'round hoping that they blow up
But I'mma make it sooner, Oklahoma
I learned to be a player, make money like I'm an owner
These other rappers are so over the hill, word to Jonah
So if you see me in a restaurant, say hi to me
And if I ask you if you like my new shit, lie to me, word to Tim Roth
And I don't know if I fit in with your society
So chill, take a pill for anxiety and doze off

But when it's late and you're all alone
And you're too damn drunk to be walking home
Then maybe you should call it quits
But until that day let's live like this

My friends grew up, they never get drunk
They never wanna hang out late
They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills
They're gonna get old and gray
I'll never do that, I wanna stay young
Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun
So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age

Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay
We can live however we want
And there ain't nobody that can get in our way
Oh, it's all good, it's alright, it's okay
We gon' do whatever we want
Never gonna listen to a word you say

My friends grew up, they never get drunk
They never wanna hang out late
They're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay bills
They're gonna get old and gray
I'll never do that, I wanna stay young
Don't wanna fit in, I wanna have fun
So if that's okay, I don't think I'm ever gonna act my age

Never gonna, act my, act my age",Act My Age

Said I'm all about it

'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby, hmm

I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 People in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming ""Who want what?""
Now, please be warned, that every song I feature on
Has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the lime light
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time

And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, ""Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front""
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, but we can pretend, oh
Typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent young
Prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus
One for the money, two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold, and not everybody is winning I'm
Larry David plus Miles Davis
So everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em

'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby

'Cause you use me just a little bit
You try to confuse me when we're intimate
You'd rather accuse me but I'm innocent
I'm not gonna lose sleep over sentiment

I'd rather just hang with my friends
Sometimes I think that things will change
And then I land in your bed, ay
And it don't feel like it's the first time
You're everything I want and you're not mine
You keep saying I can live without him
I say put your money where your mouth is
Come back to me when it feels right
Kiss me so hard you make me fight

She want Ds, and I ain't talking the breast size
Everybody in the club getting reckless
You go home at midnight, we stay out 'till breakfast
I cash checks and you cancel them
You make calls but there ain't nobody answering
I want a smart girl who gives brains like it's charity
Every night a Friday night, me and Lyla Garrity
On another level, ain't nobody that compare to me
These bitches going dumb trying to marry me

And that someone is me

After someone new

Used to be the outcast, now I'll lead out the class
Like I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, oh
I'm for real, that's just me on acid
Give me one day, then I promise I'll smash it
Robbing you rappers, I'm leaving them batshit crazy
Looking at her ass like ""baby damn!""

Friends get me out, cause her ass a distraction man
Get everybody in there stopping like a traffic jam

But I stick around for the benefits

Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime
Clocking in that overtime
And I'm getting paid for it, paid for it, overtime
Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime
And I'm getting paid for it, paid for it

I'm pushing back when push comes to shove
Deep down, wondering why they ain't pushing us
I got friends with deals, I got friends who front
But just keep it real, 'cause who gives a fuck
If I was Pusha T, I might push a brick
Working 24/7 just to push my shit
'Cause if I slip, there'll be twenty other rappers, quick
Trying to fit in my shoes, but my feet just too big
I can't relax, I can't even sit back
With my girl on my bed, got my face to my Mac
And I know she act disappointed in that
But how the fuck we gonna blow off a rap
So I stay grounded, never catch an ego
As far as we go it's good just believe yo
Love all my fans, without you, where would I be though?
Where would I be though?

Working them late nights, every night
Motivation, super high
Double shift it, over drive
Make that money, multiply
Oh lord not this, walking home I wanna quit
But I stick around for the benefits

Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime
Clocking in that overtime
And I'm getting paid for it, paid for it, overtime
Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime
And I'm getting paid for it, paid for it

Could it be so easy, well don't believe me
'Cause you know good things always take time (it always take time)
And please don't leave me, 'cause I need you with me
And there ain't no shortcuts left in this life
And the great things take love, love
And the great things take love, love
And the great things take love, love
And the great things take love, love, love
Are you putting in work?

Overtime
Clocking in that overtime, clocking in that overtime

Hoodie Allen,"I'm gonna talk when I wanna talk
I don't need the long distance to plan this shit
Did it on my own with no management
Must be why nobody can manage him
A&R's always want to take advantages
Find a poor kid, sell him on a fantasy
But I've always been way above the average
That's why nobody else can compare to me
Other rappers don't offend me
'Cause I got more drive than a Bentley
In the driveway with a Hemi, dream girl Rossum
I'm just tryna get an Emmy
Fuck that, I just wanna get a Grammy
Then add three more for my family
Got a plan but I never had a plan B
If you think you'll fail then you might as well drive in a Camry
And I may never get the cover of that Rolling Stone
Didn't fit the vibe they were going for
Went to XXL, but I couldn't excel
They said we really don't get it but we're wishing you well
Oh well, LOL, ain't got time for no print
Fame come and go when you rhyming so shit
Ain't gotta sign on no dotted line
But if I do, fuck you for criticizing
When I pick up the phone, they don't even call back
They just leave me a voice-mail
They gon' tell you you changed and shit ain't the same
Like this shit was a choice, hell
My haters are kicking the bucket
It must have been hard to be wrong all along
But isn't it love when they memorize every damn word of your song?

'Cause they be calling my phone but you already know
I be hitting ignore 'cause you late
I just throw it away, I don't care what they say at all
'Cause people keep talking (hey), people keep talking
But I don't hear nothing when people keep talking

One shot, two shot, three shot, super drunk
Four shot, wrong shot, jump shot, no fucks
Even when I spit it I'mma be the spitting image
Of somebody you recognize when you watching television
I'm just trying to be like Jordan, I'm tired of being Pippen
I've been coming off the bench and watching my haters get it
It's a young Jake Gyllenhaal, drop the beat 'cause I kill 'em all
Grab a seat 'cause I fill them all
Go hard motherfucker, ain't a pen involved
Y'all try to get up any way that you can
Step on the back of your favorite fan
Charging like 50 to take a quick picture
You scummy ass rappers are not in demand
And you certainly ain't in it for love
I'm just saying this shit cause it's true
I know that all of y'all wanted a bus 'cause the image important to you
Well I guess that's human nature
Selfish motherfuckers never do you favors
Till they all get dropped and they sent to waivers
Go shop get shelved like it's Lord and Taylor, what?
I'm the man in the city, well I guess that'd make you the miss
These rappers are acting all over the mic nowadays and they ain't Ludacris
You tell me you hate I exist while your girlfriend is grooving to all of my songs
She made you a Spotify playlist and there ain't no room for you dog?

'Cause they be calling my phone but you already know
I be hitting ignore 'cause you late
I just throw it away, I don't care what they say at all
'Cause people keep talking (hey), people keep talking
But I don't hear nothing when people keep talking, talking

""Hello? Um Hoodie I just wanna tell you if you’re listening
You’re my favorite artist ever, and I just watch so far
And you’re just so amazing and I love your song
'No Interruption' and oh my god 'Two Lips' oh my god
I can’t wait for the new music to come out
And um I was really wondering will you follow me in instagram?
Um, my handle is patymail 565 um, and you're underscore, I'm so sorry
Oh my god yes and you have to come back to Wisconsin because I made you
A bracelet and um oh my god I’m so nervous
I’m sorry I’m like a little girl okay um
I gotta go take shit but it was really great to
I guess talk to you okay bye Hoodie.""",People Keep Talking
Hoodie Allen,"Super duper early morning Sunday breakfast
Ain't in a rush to go to church because I used protection
You complain about the way I cooked your eggs
I'll probably hang up the phone and then, hello?
Disconnected, but check it, that's just a metaphor
I'm talking if you left your man then you'd be better off
The game I spit is sweeter than a bag of kettle corn
My name is Hoodie Allen but I'm here to take your sweater off
And I'mma do whatever it takes to make us a pair
You wanna travel around the world, well I'm taking you there
I met a bunch of mean girls like Lacey Chabert
Busy talking shit but they ain't stopping to look in the mirror
If you making it bad, well I'm making it worse
You holding onto all these baggage, stop taking it pers
I'll tell you anything I can to get you down tonight
Tryna take you out the clouds, bring you down to life

I think that she like me, that she like me
And she think that it might be, it might be
The real thing but we moving too fast
The real thing but we moving too fast

I think that she like me, that she like me
And she think that it might be, it might be
True love but we let it all fade
'Cause I just ain't ready baby

Treat me like I'm the man with a couple hundred grand
And a family full of cousins with a couple Uncle Sams
Tryna gamble away my money, that's funny like Douglas Yancey
Wanna paint a perfect picture, they'll probably think that I'm Banksy
But I might die trying to afford it
I'm living in the studio, everything is recorded
My life is like a song and stuck on fucking repeat
And I'm making the same mistakes that you only make in your sleep
That must mean I'm in a dream world
But I'm sleepwalking until I find a dream girl
I got these teen girls screaming like I'm out of a magazine
Next to Harry and Justin, nobody fucking with me girl
Switch it, do I make you mad when I talk about shit that I envision?
Are my dreams too big? Do you think I'll sink or swim with these fishes?
So you could let me down easy
'Cause it's hard to let go when you the only good that I know, you know?

I think that she like me, that she like me
And she think that it might be, it might be
The real thing but we moving too fast
The real thing but we moving too fast

Hi, it's me, wondering where the hell you are.
You said you were gonna call me and I still haven't heard from you.
You know, it's not that hard to just send me a text and say hi.

She got me feeling like a Magic Mike
You're a beauty girl, tell me what the pageant is like
Skinny chick with a booty and got an appetite
If she catches looking I just act polite (like, like)
Yo what a conundrum, bitches are punch drunk
Love like Floyd Mayweather, just pumped em, full of some Russian vodka

She a product of the nineties, I'm a show her like I'm Truman, ooh
'Fore the night is over, she will beso me, muah
Got your girlfriend so obsessed with me, that Cecily strong
Making all of these bangers for girls who look like Topanga
Who grew up in Staten Island, banging 36 Chambers
Ya listening to history in the making now
Trying to retire at thirty with a vacation house
That money funny like Jefferson on a twenty
Ivy League like I'm hangin' out with Beyoncé and Jeezy now
Swaggin', I can see you impress
She on her knees and she ain't trying to confess
Save me the stress, ya girl already say I'm the best

And I'll put out the fire that be burning inside
We can roll in my ride and make the sirens go off
She make the sirens go ff

Okay, working 'cause I love it, do it for my people
Words are like my ammo, bang, bang, reload
Watch me as I freak flows, ball hard on these beats though
Used to take the bus, now I whip it like I'm Devo
Nowadays we sittin' court side at every Knicks game
Close enough to go and hand Carmelo my mixtape
Models in my phone book, bout to make a mistake
Tell'em spread the love like we living in the sixties
My friends say that my life is like a movie dog
I'm bangin' actress after actress like they groupies dog
She think I'm James Bond, you just an afterthought
These rappers beggin' for any song in my catalog
Working nine-to-five, but the opposite
Killing it so much, they bout to build me a monument
Tell her ""we can do it in the dorm room of your colleges
And she can rock my mothafucking world or earn an scholarship

Sippin' in a text, I got your bitch in it, don't mention it
Those who want the D and I appreciate the sentiment
Can't afford to own it, I'm just leasing it and renting it
'Cause I am not cuffing shit, I am not no odd boy
I'm more like a hot boy, Gucci leather socks boy
Fin dripping in the kitchen whippin' up the box toy
I get it for the low, I bet you get it for a lot boy
Last night at the Trump towers taking drunk showers
At the airport, they went through my bag and found a bunch of weed that was not ours
If it's not reeking than it's not sour
Smoke in her face, you don't need a vase for these bouquet, then buy flowers

Calling over from Gigantic Records.
Man we just listened to your project
I got a bunch of writers up here,
Every one in the office is flippin' out.
Man, I just wanted to call ya and let you know
That we really, really loved it
But we just wanna, you know, take it that next level man
First thing I would wanna do with you is kinda
Get you a little bit more matured.
Throw in on a bow tie every now and then, you know
Carry a cane around, and wear a grey wig.
But other than that, we really love it

Got a text from a chick who wondering if we're meeting up later
I said I don't make plans
If you want someone who can, then
You're not looking for me
You're just lookin' for another type of man
I'm just tryin' to be the first man in my fam
To graduate, go to college, get em high, auto pilot
Be someone they all are proud of
Buy a car, get it polished
Brand new clothes I'm always stylin'

Okay, I could be your Elvis, you could be Priscilla Presley
Caught you looking at me like you might want to undress me
Tell her I'm a good fella, like my name was Pesci
Cooking up the fliest shit and I don't need a recipe
But damn, that was vicious, ooh I admit it
I just want you to fly with me, fly with me
No other language, I can't explain it
I just want you to fly with me, fly with me
To a place where we can't be bothered
Feeling like I'm racing to the top from the bottom
Got no whips but multiple garages
I guess you could say that I'm an optimist
Had a dream I was coppin' shit
And like Copperfield it all disappeared
Had a crazy ass a long time ago
But I'm now I'm smiling from ear to ear because it all came true
Love what you do
And the love will come back to you tenfold
Felt like I had a brick tied to my leg
But I'm never gonna Ben Folds
At the top of my game like a tentpole
I ain't make it there yet but I'm Glenn Close
I'mma take her home and have her clothes hanging all over my bedpost

Dude, don't you feel like
Every song nowadays has just a complicated dance move to it?
Hoodie, I do feel like that
I can't dance like that.
That's not realistic, man.
We need to do something for the people.

Hoodoo Gurus,"When I was seventeen
My blood was gasoline
No matter where I turned
I got my fingers burned

I wouldn't go back there if I could
I wouldn't go back there if I could

But then I turned twenty one
No fear of anyone
I always let them know
If they were friend or foe

I wouldn't go back there if I could
I wouldn't go back there if I could

I remember very well
Way back then I went through hell
Well, oh, well

I remember very well
Way back then I went through hell
Always thought I was smart
Never played it from the heart

I never listened to
My daddy's point of view
And though I wish I had
Things they turned out so bad

I wouldn't go back there if I could
I wouldn't go back there if I could
I wouldn't go back there
I wouldn't go back there, no

Don't ever go, don't ever go
Don't ever go back there
Don't ever go, don't ever go
Don't ever go back there

Don't ever go, don't ever go
Don't ever go back there
Don't ever go, don't ever go
Don't ever go back there again

Don't go back there

Hoodoo Gurus,"Ever since this troubled world began
Every woman and man,
Trying to find some purpose in their lives,
Some way to survive.
And I'm the same,
I'm not ashamed:
Riddle's my middle name.
I'm not a saint,
I've got no complaints:
There's a lot of worse things I ain't.

I'm crackin' up.
I'm crackin' up.

People wanna put their tag on you,
Define what you do,
And you might enjoy some small renown
But it's hard to live down.
Stuck in a mould,
Do what you're told,
A product that's bought and sold,
Made out of straw.
Sentenced before
The Court Of Unwritten Law.

I'm crackin' up.
I'm crackin' up.
I won't stand for it so I am
Crackin' up.
I've got no time for it so I am
Crackin' up.

Though I hide behind a cool facade
I can't drop my guard,
Almost made myself a nervous wreck
Keeping feelings in check.
You've gotta perform,
Stick to the norm,
Wishing you were never born.
You've gotta behave,
Facing looking brave,
And you'll dig yourself an early grave.",Crackin' Up

Hoosier Hot Shots,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

You wore a gingham gown
I kissed you as I placed a yellow tulip in your hair
Upon my coat you pinned a rose so rare
Time has not changed your loveliness
You're just as sweet to me
I love you yet, I can't forget the days that used to be
 
When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip
And I wore a big red rose
When you caressed me, 'twas then Heaven blessed me
What a blessing, no one knows
You made life cheery when you called me dearie
'Twas down where the blue grass grows
Your lips were sweeter then julep when you wore that tulip 
And I wore a big red rose

To think about it, all right
Why is there a rebel flag hanging
From the state house walls
Tired of hearin' this s***
About heritage not hate
Time to make the world a better place

Why must we hate one another
Well, no matter what we gotta live together
Just that you don't look like me
Tell me what do you see
When we pa** on the street
What do you wanna see

P.E.'s coming is all I gotta say
Wanna turn and run away
They're just telling you how they see it
Right or wrong they don't care
You wish that they would quit

Drowning in a sea of tears
Hatred trying to hide your fears
Living only for yourself
Hating everybody else
'Cause they don't look like you

Nancy singing it's a hard life
Wherever you go
About some fat racist living in Chicago
Trying to teach his kids to hate everyone
Well, tell me why is that something
You wanna teach your son

Why must we hate one another
When the people in the church
They tell me you're my brother
You don't walk like me, I said that
You don't talk like me, saying
Go back to Africa
I just don't understand

Hatred trying to hide your fears
Living only for yourself
Hating everybody else

That he could look up to, but
When I walk down the street
Tell me what do you see

No I'm not like you
Why do you hate me so

Now love is gone and you're into someone far away
I never thought the day would come
When I would see his hand not mine
Holding on to yours because I could not find the time
And now I can't deny
Nothing lasts forever
But I don't want to leave and see the teardrops in your eyes
I don't want to live to see the day you say goodbye

Now there comes another part of life I go alone
Sitting at a bar with Chris that I can't leave
'Cause my house ain't no home
I just want to touch you girl
I want to feel you close to me
Without your love I would give up now and walk away so easily
So maybe while we're young we'll figure out together
That even with the pain there's a remedy
We'll be all right
I don't want to live to see the day you say goodbye

When I first met you I couldn't love anyone
But you stole my dreams and you made me see
That I can walk into the sun and I could still be me
And now I can't deny
Nothing lasts forever
But I don't want to leave and see the teardrops in your eyes
So baby why break up
Let's figure out together
That even with the pain there's a remedy
And we'll be alright

You don't want to see the sun go down
You don't wanna open the door

One step and tomorrow comes
Two steps and she's off with someone
Three steps and it's all you know

Look at me in the eyes
Then look away and tell me why...why

Another kiss goodnight
Could be a dark oasis in my life
Another icon smashed to pieces
By yesterday's romance
Another hated person no more chances

I like the Stealers in '75

I liked the Redskins in '83

Hootie & the Blowfish,"Saw you last night
you were sleeping in my mind
Doubting you'll ever be free again
Then I climbed back inside
Someone open my eyes
To find me drunk again
Bonnie on the radio
And she was singing low ""Give it up or let me go""
Every night there is one more
Every night there is two more
Saying I shouldn't be feeling this pain
I think I better grow up now or go insane

There's so much I feel
So much I conceal
There's just so many things I can be

Someone write the story of 5 points
No one wanted to know me
Now they all have opinions of what we do
So they go down to Bar None so we can have a drink or two
Can't write a story from the trees
I know somewhere she's watching me
Saying ""Boy carry your load""
Oh I don't want to go back on the road now

There's so much I feel
So much I conceal
There's just so many places to see
And faces I can read
There's just so many things I can be

Hootie & the Blowfish,"Fly inside
Feel me dealing
Holding on to a story just told
About a man who's the life of a funeral
Grabbing on to a woman who's soul
He just stole for a dream he don't believe in
Now she sits and she yells for a smile
""Don't let the sun make me feel lonely""
Oh let me in let me in let me in

Is it me
Or is it honey

We all seem to hold
To Something we don't see
Is He here
Is He there
Where does He live

Some people say in the mind of a stranger
I can't explain what it is I believe in
So take your heart take your mind and escape

Is it me
Or is it honey
Is it me
Or is it honey

Is it me trying to raise your little children
Is it me trying to take your little flame
Why are you trying to steal my judgement day away
Let me scream let me scream let me scream
Don't take it away

And I didn't say this time

And turned to the right to bend

But your face cracks a smile when you see it shining

It's so delectable to see a stone
It's so impossible to find a reason
When you're standing there
Watching me now

Could we live it again
If we dressed just the same
And held on to lovers when
We couldn't really live with anyone
See mostly ourselves so just go on lying

In a voice filled with pain 
Where you going young man 
Said I'm going to fight a war 
Gonna fight for my country

I could die on foreign streets 
But I could not vote

Say this is my fate 
But every time you walk the streets boy 
Most of them you meet

And I wonder who will walk with me 
When I get to Heaven 
I hope I get there

And I wonder who will walk with me 
When I get there

She's been there for a long, long time 
And when I fell, she picked me up 
When I cried, she wiped my tears 
I thank god she's mine 
And when I leave this world

Hootie & the Blowfish,"I fall in she sees me and smiles
Then she starts to hate herself again
She screams something under her breath
That I wouldn't know if she said it out loud

She turns over to start a conversation
With a man that no one else can see
She dreams of loving me sometimes
And it makes me see what we've been missing

It's like I never knew anyone so strong before
She Brings the man outa me
And she makes me see that they don't matter

She runs around you and then
It's like the sun goes down and she crawls away again

She wears white pants a Miami sweater
Says that She loves the O's
So Uncle Dean will come by

Her smile is like sunshine
Her tears hurt like leather
She runs the show she lets me know
Says it's all about being the only
It's like someone said you could have one good thing in your life
She couldn't be your type
I didn't plan for your smile, but you make me laugh when you stand dreamin'

I believe, we see her layin with another
She runs around you and then
It's like the sun goes down and she crawls away again

Now that my heart is wild and free
And my lips have room to wander
How can I say your needing me now
When I've got a plan
I know you don't understand why my heart is sorry know

We see her laying with another
She runs around you and then

We see her waiting with another

Hootie & the Blowfish,"One thing's for sure
I just can't find the way
To let it seem like all is wrong
Inside my den

Hold back
Breathe easy

Go somewhere and change your mind
Just let me sleep

I've been living in a lesson
Please just come inside and listen

Is it anger at life
Or are you happy to be with me
Are you seeing someone

Or will your faith
Go with no other man
Come on
Let me dream

I've been living in a lesson
Please just come inside and listen
No need to worry 'bout all the lying
Please just come inside

It's a thing
To make me want to go
See another

Won't you let me read a book about

I see mornings left for the children
I see people holding back, trying to find another reason so they can walk away

i'll be all right
don't just settle for living the lie
that I thought you might

put on your disguise
let me see that you're bigger than me
tell me that tomorrow
I'll wake and yearn for you

And when I call your name out
You leave and take a bow
You say what do want from

Call off the service now baby
No one really knew
That I would have to leave
But now I'm a better man

I wanted you but
You left so suddenly

You say ""what do you want from me now""

And I'm doing what you said
No one answers
So I cope cause you are gone
Oh I just wanted you baby
But I have to deal cause

Why were you so afraid of the truth? 
Now, no, no.

Hope I did not ruin any plans you had to pull me through.
So sit down at my table.
We'll talk about and label all the things you claim to be untrue.

That I don't want to play the part of being the blame for a brokenhearted fool.
And, now that I don't see you much,
I wish that we had stayed in touch.

We've been trying so long
You've been pushing too hard
You should say what's wrong
And never what's right

And I need mine

You and I all alone

When your inside it

And I wish my dreams alone would bring back my old friends. 
Yesterday's just something I can't mend. 
And I broke down for my lost brother and I've died for mama, too.
Now my tears fall down for you. For you. 
And I say one thing each day before I lay me down. 
I thank god for your sweet smile although you're not around. 
And I can't overcome your memory in my mind. 
It's a bridge I'll never cross until the end of time.

Now she spends her days with a mission to live. 
She loves to laugh, and will offer a hand to forgive. 
And she has a man with two arms open wide who will take her in when she's gone. 
When she's gone. She's gone. When she's gone. 
She fights through the pain and she smiles when she sleeps.

We play a game where we'll sing all our troubles away.

What we did to become this way

When I woke everything was gone 
And I remembered we were through

You come around here looking so fine 
Makes it so hard to walk away

Remember you were the one to leave 
I came back home and I couldn't believe 
I know I would have given anything 
You took it all and you made me think 
Why would she leave me for another man 
What does he have, Lord, that I don't have 
I see you stayin' in his fancy home 
I put on Lauren and I drink alone and say 
Don't come 'round here no more

Looked around for a place to stand

Reminded me of you 
Reminded me of leaving, this evening 
Reminded me of leaving, 
Reminded me of you 

Stood so near the ocean 
Wearing only your birthday suits

He remembers how he's not suppose to feel 

And I say I believe this is killing me 
Don't go, don't go, yeah 
I say I believe this is killing me, don't go 

And if the hardest fight 
When all of my armor has pealed 
My defenses are down 
He retreats without a sound 
From the silence his intentions are revealed 

And I say I believe this is killing me 
Don't go, don't go, yeah 
I say I believe this is killing me, don't go 
I just don't want you to go 
Yeah, I say I believe this is killing me 

And maybe I'm just holding onto something your not holding onto any longer 
I wish that I could let it go and let my senses take control 
So that we could finally end this war 

And I say I believe this is killing me 
Don't go, don't go, yeah 
I say I believe this is killing me, don't go 
I just don't want you to go 
I believe this is killing me 
Can't believe I should leave him be 
I believe this is killing me

and i can still hear you wispher in a crowded room 
i know you can here me to 

Cause no one love me love me love me like ya do 
you know i love ya love ya love ya too

Kissed a boy who
Is in love
With someone else
I didn't mean to
Feel the way I do
It just happened by itself

And now I'm sick inside
Yeah it makes me wanna cry
I'm so sorry about last night
Yeah it happened so fast
I wanted it to last
In the moment it felt so right
But now I'm sick inside

He stopped by my house
We were hangin' out
He was wonderin' where you are
We went walking 
We were just talking
Then he kissed me by his car

And now I'm sick inside
Yeah it makes me wanna cry
I'm so sorry about last night
It happened so fast
I wanted it to last
In the moment it felt so right
But now I'm sick inside

Now I'm stuck with this feeling in the pit of my soul
I guess I should've had a little self-control
I knew that it was wrong I admit it
I wish there was a way that I could make it all right
I really wanna tell you that I put up a fight
But that would be the lie (that would be the lie)

And now I'm sick inside

Or would you change the color of my eyes 
Tell me why my television's filling me with lies

It's getting cold in here, baby 
And I don't what's going on

And I don't what went wrong 
But I think you're letting go

All my friends can't believe that we're still together 
It feels like something strange 
Is it you or has the weather changed 
Say what you got to say 
I'm not here to place the blame 

It's getting cold in here, baby 
And I don't know what's going on 
But I feel the love is gone

I close my eyes and hear you call me
I swear your voice is real

I've seen them all I've seen just some
so you have no mercy it seems
I can be worse than what you deem

I didn't mean to
give it away 'cause
I'm coming back and this is what I hide

It's for you
there's something you should see
for every time you lied
I'm taking back was mine

For a forest's will a horse was lost
For a horse's will a horseman lost 
For a horseman's will a battle lost
For a battle's will a kingdom lost

It was ever less than a treason
To yield with a grace to reason

chasing all the sake you stole
chasing all the sake you stole

Thought this life was worth
to be lived with you

No turning backs when patience fails,
Leave your drama in fairytales, 
Crawling in the shadow of your soul 
Chasing all the sake you, 
Chasing all the sake you stole",Sidney Shown

I'd tell her how I don't eat pork, she took it straight to the heart

Hopsin,"You think you original? You ain't original
You were programmed to be you
You're a slave and you don't even know it
The shit you think of ain't even your thoughts
Let's step out the box for a minute

How do we know if God exists?
How do we know what's positive?
Are you the definition of an angel or the opposite?
If you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit
To stealing it, but if the tables turned then you would pocket it
See I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is
How come I'm the one my teachers used to have a problem with?
I show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it
But in the underground I seem to get so many compliments
Say my name and it's like people get afraid and shook
But if you take a look you'll see I'm nothing like an angry crook
I'm learning hands-on, you busy with your face in books
I'm here to benefit the world so Heaven's where we're safely put
I'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues
I just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs
I'm from where a child's future's in the streets with the bums
Because it's hard to become something so unique where I'm from

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

Obama's president, so? What's he represent?
Just because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent
You're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with
His charm and smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit
Frontin' like he's truly Jesus
And all you fools believe it
The change he's making isn't good, that's just how you conceived it
It's like we all broker than ever, it's due to reasons
Dealing with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with
Illuminati, or whatever the fuck they go by
They're the reason real shit happens, and we don't know why
Why did Michael Jackson start his tour than have to go die?
How did rap music go from really good to so dry?
Real artists get shelved and wack one's get famous
To leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous
In their eyes there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist
You're just a product of what the government has created

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

We're all smart and we know what's bad and good for us
But yet when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff
Your brain's a fucking powerhouse, but what? That wasn't good enough?
It's people like you who talk that ""should've, could've, would've"" stuff
You probably threw your life away cause you would rather get high
With no license or car, so you bum rides to get by
Saying ""I should've did this"" or ""I shouldn't have hung with this guy""
""I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized""
I ain't being cruel, these situations that I address
I more than likely could be someone you admire, yes
But it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest
We play the same game, difference is you never try your best
You don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess
I work around the clock, you slack off a lot for time to rest
You bullshittin' till your life is gone
'Cause living's naturally hell, you have to work to put a smile on

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie

It's not that bad, you're okay, kid, cheer up!
But I got a life that I ain't too sure of
Swagger lookin' just like Ace Ventura
Can't look at myself, I might break this mirror
(Shit! Fuck! Fuck!) I'm paranoid
I panic over every little scary noise
See, when I go pick up the phone and tell friends about it
They won't answer, 'cause they're annoyed
I'm like uggghh, I put a porno on
'Cause my life ain't awesome, man
Jack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again
Then repeat the cycle
Can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on
You don't know how many fuckin' demons I know
Maybe I should go and tell 'em read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)
I don't even like rap
The only thing I wanted was just to be cool
And hang out with a group of friends
And solve mysteries like I'm Scooby Doo
But I got way more than I bargained for
You can't chill when your heart is sore
I'm so mad I could start a war
So fuck Hopsin! Man, I don't even know who I are no more

I feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!

Man, y'all niggas tryna kill my vibe
Lately don't nobody feel my rhymes
Dizzy blowin' up tryna steal my shine
I'm all outta ammo, my skills just died
But, ""Oh my God, I love 'Ill Mind 5'!""
The one where the dumb skippity bums get high
That there changed my whole entire life
You make more tings like that? I'll buy!
Well, I got news for you
My screws are loose (I'll tell ya)
This rap thing here's what I use to do
Now I'm movin' to (Australia)
When I go ghost I'mma get a house
On the Gold Coast, yellin' YOLO
On a couch, feelin' so dope, livin' low pro
So these foul niggas don't know
I'll be struttin' around like (hell yeah!)
Man, I'm losin' my mind
Y'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme
See, I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin
But I get depressed when the two intertwine
Truthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be
Nobody cared, so I use the beat
To talk to, so I lose the heat
I'm cut bad and the bruise is deep
Is there anything you can do for me?

The world made me feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holler at cha boy if you know somebody!
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know

Hopsin,"I remember the first time you overdosed
A fucking overload on meth, paramedics saved your ass, you was close to ghost
You never did know which road to go
It’s like you rode the boat and sailed away and hoped to hit the golden coast
But you sank like the Titanic
The incident, it left your life damaged, and that’s when I panicked
You thought you had it locked, well you ain’t on the right planet
If you're trying to live your life right, plan it
It’s like your mind vanished, you don’t even know that
I wish that we could go back, 'cause it’s so sad when I tell jokes and you don’t laugh
Like you used to, I really hate to stress it, but you strange to mess with
So I keep my distance, cause you always got this blank expression
Like you’re confused and unaware of your surroundings
Emotions have gone and no one’s found it, it’s overwhelming
Your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass, now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world 'cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block like we used to (Like we used to)
(Where’d you go?)
I never would've thought my best friend would be gone in the future
But I was wrong

I should've stopped you when I had the chance to do so
But back then I had felt like that was too bold
You started hanging with new folks, and made the drug environment your new home
This world is too cold, could I have prevented this? Who knows?
They convinced you that this shit was cool and hip to do
Saying it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible
So you started skipping school, hanging with these wicked dudes
Unaware that when you got older you played a bigger fool
And it’s pitiful, where the fuck they at now?
In they mid-20s passed out inside of a crack house
Back when you met them I had doubts, they put you on the bad route
And when you needed they help to pick you up, they fucking backed out
They fucking got you, I can’t lie
But now your brain's fried, and you don’t even act like you’re the same guy
Your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain’t listen 'til the fire burned your ass, now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world 'cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block like we used to (Like we used to)
(Where’d you go?)
I never would've thought my best friend would be gone in the future
But I was wrong

I ain’t never felt this shit before, it gets me sore
I reminisce on us playing Nintendo 64
And that Christmas in '97 we got new crispy boards
And we was doing ollies in my kitchen on the slippery floor
Shit changed and it happened quick
But I can’t forget that you was the first homie I started rapping with
You could’ve had half of this back when I had established it
But now I have to sit and feel bad, look what your actions did
Man you were so outgoing and so hysterical
Seeing you now is just unbearable, it’s terrible
You should've made your choices wisely, fucking with poison ivy,
Without your brain please tell me what would your point in life be?
It’s a struggle to get your ass to listen
You really hurt me and the rest of your family with all your bad decisions
We always told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass, now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world 'cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block like we used to (Like we used to)
(Where’d you go?)
I never would've thought my best friend would be gone in the future
But I was wrong

Excuse me do ya need a ride? Looks like you’re going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride, well hi, I’m Chris Dolmeth

Live life, mind power

Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Life is a tour, I sit and ride along
Taking some notes and then I write the song
I'm staring down the road my life has gone
Is this where I belong?
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?
My mental state is fucking me up
And I cried upon while asking you for some answers
But we don't have that type of bond
Now my desires gone with the way that I've been living lately
If I died right now, you'd turn the fire on
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout
'Cause I hopped on Christianity so strongly then I fell out
Now I'm avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down
Feeling so damn humiliated 'cause they looking at me like I'm hellbound
What story should I tell now? I'll just expose the truth
I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to you
But who the fuck are You? You never showed the proof
And I'm only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do?
There's way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Begging all fucking men and women to listen
I can't even beat my dick without getting convicted
These ain't wicked decisions, I got different intentions
I been itching to get it, I've been given assistance
But the whole fucking system is twisted
Now I'm dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
And I've been told that my sinful life is an addiction
But I can't buy it, it's just too hard to stand beside it
I need an answer and humans can't provide it
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
It's truly mind blowing, I can't deny it
Is heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?
Where's the Holy Ghost at? How long it take Man to find it?
My mind's a nonstop tape playing and I can't rewind it
You gave me a bible and expect me not to analyze it
I'm frustrated and you provoked it
I'm not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it
I have a fucking brain, you should know it
You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment
It was a mission that I had to abort
'Cause humans be lying with such an inaccurate source
It's gon' be hard to put me back on the course
Next Jehovah's witness to come on my porch, I swear I'm slammin' the door
A lot of folks believe it though, but I'm not surprised
Humans are fucking dumb, still thinkin' that Pac's alive
I ain't trying to take your legacy and torch it down
I'm just saying, I ain't heard shit from the horse's mouth
Just sheep always telling stories of older guys
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Now I'm supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise, sounds like a fucking poltergeist
Show yourself and the boom is done
Every rumor's gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you're the one
I'll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
And all my old habits can hop onto of a roof to plunge
I'll donate to a charity that could use the funds
Fuck the club, instead of bitches I'd hang with a group of nuns
And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do
I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of You
I hate the fact that I have to believe
You haven't been chatting with me like you did Adam and Eve
And I ain't seen no talking snake or rabbit from trees
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I don't know if you do or don't exist, shit is driving me crazy
Send your condolences, this is me reaching to you so don't forget
If hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
I'mma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
My gut feeling says it's all fake, I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith
This isn't a small phase, my perspective's all changed
My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day
And in my mind I make perfect sense
If you aren't real then all my prayers aren't worth a cent
That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is
And I could just sit in the church and say fuck in the services
Man what if Jesus was a facade? Then that would mean the government's God
I feel like they've been brainwashing us with a lot
So much that we don't even notice that we're stuck in the box
Man everything is what if, why is it always what if
Planet Earth what if, the universe what if
My sacrifice what if, my afterlife what if
Every fucking thing that deals with you is fucking suspect
I'm fucking done, I'm fucking done
This is my fucking life and I'm living it, I'm having fun
If you really care for me, prove that I need to live carefully
But I'll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isn't even guaranteed
We are you, and you're us, stop playing games
My life's all I got, and heaven is all in my brain
And when I feel I am in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain
Do as you please, and I'll just do me, I'm a human, I'll stay in my lane

Never had no sense, so I'm bad with manners
Who'd have thought I'd be living life in the flashing cameras
Got b****es on my nuts like pubics (ooh)
N****s could never figure me out like Rubik's (cubes)
I be bullying everybody like I'm Brutus (who)
So don't underestimate me, I do this, truest
I'm calm and ill but still drop bombs, I kill
You know the deal, with my godly skills
You wanna jog the field in my shoes, that's a lot to fill
It won't happen, you cannot be real

So many b****es that wanna snatch my blang
I'll probably end up on the news dead, bullet in the head

You want me to keep it to a minimal with the syllables
I think you should get up off my genitals

Imma have to get rough and get all my sentinels

Is it difficult for you to get better, you're so despicable

I do not bump it, it's hard to get into you

And my mind's exhausted, I'm nauseous from the process
Of hopping on stage and trying to dive in moshpits
N****, why you focused on diamonds
These Cubic Zirconia's all up in my ear
Over jewelry, I don't get excited
My perception in life is why the f*** am I here, n****
I've been this way since your a** has been sucking on titties
Since n****s c***ed back, and start busting on Fifty
Since J Lo was mobbing in public with Diddy
Since Biggie and Pac got shot up, it's a pity
That's bulls*** you're talking, I'm not in the mood, bro
Continue yapping, you'll see Hopsin is brutal
Keep pushing me, you gon' get dropped with some Judo

Y'all thoughts are sailing on the same ship
And if that's the case, then that's the reason that you ain't shit
Let me enlighten you my niggas, just let your brain drift
First of all, the best type of marketing is marketing that doesn't feel like marketing
It makes the people feel like they a part of it
And when it's done right, corporations think its marvelous
They feed us these ideas and then we place 'em in our hearts to sit
It's why players are good at getting chicks
It's why Nike is good at selling kicks
It's why Disney is loved by all the kids
Why McDonald's owners are super rich, we too blinded to ever see 'em pitch
See when this happens we take our health, wealth, lives and just hand them off
Thinking that we did this from organic thoughts
I know you seen parents trick kids with candy, toys, and Santa Claus
The same method is used to trap adults
But instead of candy it's with money, religion, drugs and alcohol
Mention that shit and it's gon' arouse us all
I done seen niggas get into fights over cigarettes like a pack of dogs
They get you hooked and then they laugh at y'all

I really hate to break it to you but your life's being played with
You have not witnessed the world 'cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly

Man, can't you see we're robots who know not what we do when we got no shot
In the real world until we climb out of this ice cold box
Your whole life has been part of a whole plot
To keep you at the bottom while they on top, stay quiet, then they won't stop
They always tryna show us what we don't got
They do it to all of us 'til we finally break and go cop a gold watch
Knowing we need the cash for rent
My ass is sick just thinking about how rich and powerful all these bastards get
They package ideas like it's oxygen
They make us feel like if we ain't got it, we fucked and we cannot fit in
This fucking system is not your friend
And understand they controlling your thoughts 'cause they got a lot to win
Niggas get turned away when I mention this
Ignorance is bliss but I don't give a fuck, I won't censor shit
The Matrix is real when you done entered it
It's way too intricate for you to ever realize that you fucking simpleton

I really hate to break it to you but your life's being played with
You have not witnessed the world 'cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly

Yo, fuck Hollywood, fuck all these reality shows
Making us feel lame unless we blowing stacks on new clothes
Making us feel like we ain't cool unless we have a few hoes
Making us feel like we ugly, unless we have a new nose
I see naturally beautiful women get Botox, fake tits
Fake lips, they so brainwashed and it doesn't make sense
Focus on your life and the path you're pursuing
'Cause y'all too busy worried about what Kim Kardashian's doing
Check it, most of this shit that you sheep are watching on television
Is fake as fuck and it's not real, I rebel against it
It's the Devil's business, they just reel y'all in
If they say it, we do it, yo, I'm tryna tell y'all man
The system created the stereotype for the Black image
That's why my people are scared to be different, why don't you get it?
I'm done practicing these ridiculous rituals
It's time I become a real individual and just do me

You have not witnessed the world 'cause you're stuck in the Matrix

And, and nobody else but you
You and the meaning of life has no rules, no rules, no rules

Movin' on to the second segment
I spit shit like I got chest congestions
You shoulda known to never neglect the reckless
Time to myself was the best suggestion
Sex before bed and sex for breakfast
The sound that you're hearin' is the stress digested
You ever tell me, a little less aggression
You'd better get ghost 'fore your head get pressed in (back up)
You rap niggas just a facade
You only do ten-percent of your job
Your producer is the only reason that they bumpin' your shit while they sit up and nod
Who the fuck you think you kiddin' bro?
You think you're fly because you gettin' dough?
If your label would stop paying radio stations to play you
You think we would feel it? No
That's just how it goes
Please do not get close, this is not a joke
Better be jottin' notes of my hottest quotes
Till your pockets swole, puto vámonos (ay wey!)
Shit I'm just talkin', don't mind me
I guess it's my comical mind state
The moment I came into the game
I've been gettin' fame, I've been the hottest since MySpace
I ain't even gotta try to amaze ya
Mind been missing like a flight from Malaysia
That I can do when it lies in my nature
These are the bullshit rhymes I get paid from
Yup, I done made a career
Most niggas think my situation is weird
But don't get it twisted, I know what I'm doing
I've been had it locked, I'm just making it clear

Niggas wishin' I fell o-o-off
But I'm forever ill, that's by law
These commercial niggas keep jockin', killing's my only option
Ask about me boy, I get shit popping
(Yeah, yeah, Pound Syndrome)
My mind's telling me kill all these niggas
(Pound Syndrome)
There is no limit to my madness
I'mma smash it, smash it, smash it

Yeah, ain't shit changed, been off the chain, can't kill off the flame
My nigga you'd better (ask about me boy, I get shit popping)
That's right, that's right, bring it back, come on
Ain't shit changed, been off the chain, can't kill off the flame

Hopsin,"Yeah, early 2014 I was on the Knock Madness tour
I was mad about it, I half-assed my album cause I really didn't know what I was rapping for
I was going through a break up and that was hard
I wasn't in my right mind, nigga that's for sure
Every night I was praying and I would ask the Lord
To please give me strength, so I don't slam the door on my fans
But no luck I was stuck
Even though a nigga had a plus size buzz
I didn't even know who the fuck I was
I tried so hard to see a plus side, but
I couldn't find the spark inside the dark
Even with my crew saying nice remarks
It felt like some darts were stuck inside my heart
I was thinking that a brand new life's the start
But I couldn't leave, I made a commitment
On my off time the fans invaded my business
So I started feeling a gang of resentment
Flipping on everybody when they ain't even did shit
I needed to go home and gather my thoughts
I didn't wanna suicide as the result
So the night at my Fort Collins show before I hit the stage
I left through the back for a walk and no one saw
I thought I was going up to the store to get a drink or somethin'
And a voice had told me to keep walking
And do not step foot on that stage for nothing
So I kept on walking
Then I camped out up in an abandoned house
I hated this rap shit and I hated my life
The spotlight does that when you can't get out

Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat
And I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry

Don't know where I'm going tonight baby
(Money and the fame)
It just doesn't feel so right
Don't know where I'm going tonight
Someone guide me to the light, please

I got a girl back home, yeah
God know she the sweetest thing on earth
I can't sleep on her
But there's too many women on tour and I try not to cheat on her
Man, my options for pussy are unrealistic
There's bitches who'd give up a lung for this dick
My music be leaving 'em sprung and twisted
The average nigga would have fun with this shit, that's real
Here is a secret, you don't have to keep it between you and I
Upcoming rappers who 'bout to be touring, I promise the road will eat you alive

But you know that shit when you rise
And by no surprise, I'm not gon' feed into the lies
No, I'm not gon' say that you wrong
But I'm not gon' say that you right, it's hard to keep quiet
When all I do is hold you down
If I ain't know you then, well I feel like I know you now
I know you had a little doubt, but to hop off stage and find out
You done walked out, and you not taking nobody calls
You don't wanna deal with it
But I'm looking at these fans like damn there's a lot of y'all
You got me tripping with the bodyguard
Like ""Nigga, how the fuck you lose the headliner?""
Now I don't care that you left the show
I just wish you woulda let me know
Cause I don't know if you've been kidnapped
Or know somebody from the city where they live at
But, the way you went about it make it hard for me to feel bad
Honestly it made a nigga real mad
Cause I'm texting you like Hop the devil just testing you
When Fort Collins got respect for you
And that's why the next day, you was like

Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat
And I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry

Hopsin,"Ya'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming
That's how I roll, dawg
The second niggas take they eyes off me
I leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg
I'm the realest, believe me
Niggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me
Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga

Yeah, you behind if you don't know the power (nigga)
Product this shit the moment Ruthless started goin' sour (what?)
Niggas is sayin' fuck you to us, but we have spoke it louder
Now they come to us for advice in the game, they know it's ours (true)
Cause It's so hard just to survive in this era
We learn from trial and error, it's hard for cowards to bare us
They know the style is terror, nigga we everywhere
Yeezy and Hov ain't the only niggas that's wildin' in Paris
Back in the day, me and my nigga SwizZz was always in grind mode
Reppin' that 818 was just like walkin' that tightrope
We've seen rappers come and go and get lost in this cycle
So we had to fuckin' make sure we left all of your minds blown
SwizZz? He told me 'bout his brother Damien sayin' that he could create a structure for us
We're guaranteed to make a win
I said I'm in, let the games begin
So he introduced us, then after that
We plotted on some ways to make us trend, yeah

Ya'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming
That's how I roll, dawg
The second niggas take they eyes off me
I leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg

Niggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me
Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga

You see, I took a shot out of the glass of mischief
Made an album so raw the way you just had to get it, every track explicit
I figured those of you who was in love with rap would listen
And tell your parents that it's the one gift they should grab for Christmas
Then I blew up way faster than what I had predicted
It's like magic, isn't it, they love my language and graphic image
Some people thought Ruthless put me into a bad position
But I over came it and outshined 'em, I'm back up in it
2011, went on a nation wide tour
Came back and dropped that Ill Mind 4
That put me in a cool place, swiped up a million views in a few days
I celebrated inside of swimming pools sippin' Kool Aid
I shot a video with my nigga Tech and B.o.B
I went from feeling lonely to how does everyone know me?
2012, I made the XXL Freshman list
I knew that this fuckin' game was gon' be mine when I stepped in it
Come on, man

Ya'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming
That's how I roll, dawg
The second niggas take they eyes off me

Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga

I was online chillin', bloggin' and what not (okay)
I stumbled across this one nigga, reminded me of a young Pac (right)
I asked Dame if he heard of Dizzy he said, ""Come on Hop
I been bumpin' his shit before you, bruh, his songs hot.""
If he had that push, then so many doors'll become unlocked
He said we should sign him, I said that's a long shot
We flew him to Denver to see our show and said you fuck with this shit?
He said, ""Shit nigga, yiggity yamp, I'm up in this bitch.""
A few months later, one of the homies had stopped me
Asked if I had seen this raunchy, zombie filled, godly video, that's beyond beast
I said, ""probably, I don't know, who the fuck you speakin 'bout?""
He showed me Skitzo by Jarren Benton, I started freakin' out!
I'm like, oh shit! I had to show SwizZz
And Dame and they both flipped, it's a trip, this nigga's so sick!
We had to put him on quick and blow this nigga up
Now we got a serious squad, the truth, it is nuts

Yo, I took the college route to figure out my path in life
Romp the UCI and that lead me right back behind the mic
I tried to make my dad proud, brother got his MBA
While I was wildin', takin' random classes tryna find my way
Junior year, I had to bounce not to blindly chasin' dream
Calculated riffs, I knew that I devised a perfect scheme
Hop was gazin' at the moonlight, I just hit the valley scene
Dame got rocked by the recession, then we formed the fuckin' team
F-U-N-K-V-O-L-U-M-E, nigga
Seven years into this shit, somehow we're only gettin' bigger
And we're just now gonna start the shit, I've been up out the picture
Dizzy, Hop, Jarren, and Hoppa stay confident I deliver
So I'm grateful for the chance and the position that I'm placed
Meet the aftermath, the aftermath, the Funk is in your face
Independent livin', we control every decision made
What up Dame? Prepare the reign, we killin' this thing, it won't stop, bitch!

Haha, Zzzeed up
Don't act like you don't know what time it is fool

Then I'm like ""sure you gon' pay for her ticket?""
That is the question, dammit I'm stressin'
I've been sufferin' from manic depressin', baby it takes a real man to confess it
I don't care if you confront me with issues
You got just be careful with how you address it
Cause sometimes you attackin' me the wrong way, and then my mind think the wrong way
Then all of a sudden I be actin' like I got no brain
And I'm doin' foul shit like it's okay
But don't say I ain't ever tryna make things better
You been the only fucker since the day we met up
Every time we get into it, you got me wishin' that 
I never broke up with my girlfriend back in maryada
You say I don't love you then I don't know what else to do
Cause I don't want nobody else but you
I know that I've been hurtin' you and you've been hurtin' me
So baby lets get it right because fightin' doesn't help the bruise, we both lose

I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe

Why do we fight so often?
These games are oh so ridiculous though we cannot let this shit get to us
We just need to focus on the brighter side so we can make it
And if you ain't doin' somethin' I like, then I promise you that I'ma be a little more patient

Cause these bad vibes are contagious and our relationship is now breakin'
And I know, I know, I know your heart is constantly achin'
It's like I snatched it out of your chest and tore it up, just tore it up
And I, I played the bad guy towards you more than once, yes, more than once
Man, this shit be frustratin' me
If you ain't the one then who may it be?
We tried to make love, but we made a beast
Now we just stuck cause we can't agree
This is my heart, please take a piece
And put it in a safe place to remind you
There's a million other guys in the world to choose
But none of 'em will ever love you like I do, baby

I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you

You ever dated a woman that held you back?
She ain't making no moves, you like, yo where the hell you at?
Life is valuable girl, I shouldn't have to tell you that
Cause you grew up with some bums who knew nothing but selling crack
She'll tell you that she'll do better and convince you
You move her in with you to fix the issues, you assuming it's gonna be simple
But shit didn't change, now there's something deadlier emerging
And her situation just became a heavier burden
Now your life is more than crazy, you fighting on the daily
Man it's time for her to go, you done decided, no debating
Cause there ain't no light shining on the future
She wasted all my time and all my mula
And she ain't even grateful for the cheddar I blew
Eff it, I'm through, bitch, I'm no longer messing with you
You ain't nothing but good for nothing, that's what evidence proves

As I grow, I learn from all the mistakes I made
Shit, I'm better on my own
You've got a lot of niggas around and they'll cut you
It's important that you learn to say fuck you
Yeah, they never gave a fuck about me, oh, na, na, na
This is the last laugh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Man I don't get involved with these phonies no more
I just open the door, and kick 'em all out, I don't keep 'em close
Been through this shit too much, you don't even know
Damn, you used to be the trophy of my life, but now that trophy is broke
And now you're wondering why I don't text back or call you
I deleted you out of my phone, bitch, who are you?
Pay attention close, I hope I come clear
Bitch, if you looking for a fuck, you won't find one here

Cause if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Oooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me

Hopsin,"I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me

I'm fucking tired of playing God when you in need
The choices you made are on you completely, what's it got to do with me?
You mobbing through the streets, clueless but it's not like you could see
You know I'm cool, so you take it like it's an opportunity
To get some free money, damn you ain't got no shame
You been living off of my dough, bitch I'm not your bank
You be asking to borrow knowing that you not gon' pay
Abusing the privilege my nigga, that is not okay
Why don't you get it? I shouldn't have to explain it
Our foundation should be on some real shit, not you asking for payments
So create a dream, then get off your ass and then chase it
I'm mad and frustrated dealing with this shit, I'm lacking the patience
You the homie, I don't mind you coming around dog
But I should not have to pay for your downfall
Choose your faith, but still even if your day seem great
Just know I got your fucking back either way, you already know

I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me

Now my own family tripping, I ain't think I would get this shit from siblings
The money I'm making is yours right? It's a given
Let me tell y'all why I get a different feeling
Y'all was living good watching me and my momma struggle once we get the bills in
I don't recall any help or sympathies
Since 15 I been paying rent, you know what that did to me?
Could have been here, had this rap shit popping off, if y'all had lent the hand
But y'all wasn't worried 'bout helping us, you had a different plan
Focused on yourself, and now you holding on for help
You were self centered, and that was just an open door to hell
Oh, you need some money now, yeah of course I know the deal
You want the benefits without playing the courses on the field
You ain't even doing your best or trying
Don't ask me for shit unless you dying, this is me testifying
Just know that when your bright days going straight
I couldn't have your back without feeling strange but you already know

I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me

Money can leave you isolated cause people are shady
So why debate it? They love cash and fantasize to make it
To get it, we'll fight and break shit, develop unrighteous ways
Even taking the side with Satan, thankfully I've awaken
Foes who abused the privilege by having those who were gifted
Around them close and they vision, stop corroding your friendships
Don't be having your hands out, smiling, hoping to get shit
Mooching off of a man's treasure is bogus and it's just
Not the way you should function with brothers when you're amongst 'em
That is what we call punk shit and it can leave you stuck in
A boat that's already sunken, this can happen to anyone
Sisters, brothers and cousins, they disrespecting, then fuck 'em
That's the way that the fountain leaks, keep on pushing your boundaries
In due time I am bound to see all the snakes that surrounded me
I know that if my brightest days turn gray
You wouldn't have my back unless there was pay, it ain't no secret

I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me",No Hope
Hopsin,"Yeah, haha, yeah shout out to my brothers, turn it up!

I put it on rollie, I'm drinkin' straight lean, a bitch is straight feelin' my diamonds
I'm rollin' specific, my nigga you countin' my shit, but that shit out my dome, burrrrt
Give it some time, diamonds, some niggas and rum
None of this money and no place to put it, so I'm puttin' all it up, turn up!
I tell all of you niggas, my family, I tell you, I tell you I love you
Now, tell all your family right there when I say, when I say that I love you
I done came with these bands with my niggas and niggas is callin' me crazy
I went to the doctor, he looked at my dick and he said I got rabies.

A lotta nigga tryna figure out
She gonna do a nigga, big? I know
I'm on the jury duty's corners standin' big, I know

I'm a new route for these emcee's
This is a drought that's coming
I'm about to sprout to start a new style's full of envy
I need to cool down what is in me
Everything I had bottled up pukes out when the pen bleeds
You drown from a 16, who's doubtin' the sick steeze?
I could spit a wild verse without taking a breath
Then crowd surf, who's helping this kid breathe?
The worlds against me so I gotta come harder than the average
Think smarter than the masses
Everybody's on the move, ain't no time to get caught up in the traffic
When shit goes down I got the heart of an assassin
This here's harder than my last shit
Gotta do it now, no luck in tomorrow if it crashes
If I do die before I awake, I don't think too many will feel sorrow for my ashes
With this song I've frozen time, don't skip this, don't rewind
The throne is mine, close your eyes as I provoke the mind
This was bound to happen before I wrote the lines
And it's so divine the way my influence multiplied
It's like I created a cult inside this rap industry
Please don't look so surprised
I'm at the top, I ain't throwing down a rope to climb, come on

Shak, shak, right in his back
I might just crack while I'm writin this rap
From even, a tire that snap, I'm light in the sack
I tell you how I feel and that's part of the deal
I'm like, Seagal with the steel but ""Harder to Kill""
It's real, big Beans up for lettin me know

Won't be a second we won't; they lettin me go

Funny how one thing leads to another

Should I trip? Should I not? Should I set this off?
A whole lotta pressure is on my shoulders
My soul is with all my niggaz I roll with; so know this
Cut the bullshit, take it back to the music
use it right, don't matter what you do with it
I'm here to represent the real
I still stayed G'ed up unless must I will
I stayed up all night, I argue and fight by myself; this can't be right
Hmm 'cause if the lights were the sound of the siren
I'd make you niggaz get a deal and act wild
I'm for real and I can see through these suckers that dick riding motherfuckers
Yeah, that's me bustin' 'cause I'm a huslter for the chips
And I'm trippin 'cause I'm sick of this shit

I can't get a job; I might as well steal and rob
Man, life is so hard
Hanging in my homie garage while other niggaz
doing killing for a living in the city of stars
I got a lick but I ain't got caught

And I seen where he set it, thought he had hid it
Nope, and I'm about to go get it

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good",I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)
Horace Parlan,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love
Horace Parlan,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me
Horace Parlan,"I was doing all right
Nothing but rainbows in my sky
I was doing all right
'Til you came by

Had no cause to complain
Life was as sweet as apple pie
Never noticed the rain
'Til you came by

But now whenever you're away
I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing better than ever now

But now whenever you're away

Horace Parlan,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Horace Silver,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?
Horace Silver,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Horace Silver,"I've sure enjoyed the rain and I'm looking forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain when you lose the love you gave someone
I thought by now that time would take away these lonely tears
Well I hope you're fine all alone, where do I go from here
'Cause

Without you I'm not okay
Without you I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

Well I never thought I'd be lying here without you by my side
It seems unreal to me that the life you promised was a lie
You made it look so easy making love into memories
Well I guess you got what you want but what about me, 'cause

Without you I'm not okay
Without you I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you

Somebody tell my head, to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you
'Cause baby I can't live

Without you I'm not okay
Without you I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you",Without You
Horace Silver,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Horace Silver,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony

Horace Silver,"Day in, day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in, day out","Day in, Day Out"
Horace Silver,"Of the wonderful things that you get out of life there are four.
And they may not be many but nobody needs any more.
Of the many facts making the list of life,
Truth takes the lead.
And to relax knowing the gist of life,
It's truth you need.

Then the second is honor and happiness makes number three.
When you put them together you know what the last one must be.
Baby so truth, honor and happiness
And one thing more,
Meaning only wonderful, wonderful love that'll make four.

And one thing more,
Meaning love and that's the real score and more than enough when times are tough and poor.
They may not comprise a lot
Still (you) only got those four.
And there ain't no more.",Four
Horace Silver,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me
Horace Silver,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love is

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Porque la vida, la vida misma es todo un canto
Si se calla el cantor, muere de espanto
La esperanza, la luz y la alegría

Si se calla el cantor se quedan solos
Los humildes gorriones de los diarios,
Los obreros del puerto se persignan
Quién habrá de luchar por su salario

Que ha de ser de la vida si el que canta
No levanta su voz en las tribunas
Por el que sufre,´por el que no hay
Ninguna razón que lo condene a andar sin manta'

Si se calla el cantor muere la rosa
De que sirve la rosa sin el canto
Debe el canto ser luz sobre los campos
Iluminando siempre a los de abajo

Que no calle el cantor porque el silencio
Cobarde apaña la maldad que oprime,
No saben los cantores de agachadas
No callarán jamás de frente al crimen

Que se levanten todas las banderas
Cuando el cantor se plante con su grito
Que mil guitarras desangren en la noche
Una inmortal canción al infinito'

Y este hombre que te ama, se quiere quedar 
Para siempre atado a tú alma",Prohibida
Horacio Palencia,"Todo hubiera sido mucho más sencillo 
Si al principio hubieras dicho que no me querías 
No habría perdido mi tiempo haciéndome ilusiones 
Tu mejor testigo siempre fue la hipocresía 
Tus palabras dulces me volvían loco 
Me soñaba de tu mano una larga vida 
No contaba con que tú tenías una aventura 
Que tu amor era tan falso como una mentira 
Y que ganaste con herir mis sentimientos 

Y colgarte una medalla al hacer llorar mis ojos 
Que ganaste con alimentar tu ego 
Y echar a la basura lo que hacía entre nosotros 
Que ganaste con romper esas promesas 
Con decir que me decías que tu amor seria eterno 
Si la vida te va a castigar un día 
Por el daño que me hiciste y verme como un pasatiempo 
Que ganaste 
Y que ganaste con romper mi corazón

Horror Show,"In her car six hours long,
Whisper words song after song
Eyes wide shut we sat and stare,
Long loss sought OH! life's unfair!
We always want we can't have
And we always lose,
So were always sad grade school crush
Blood soaked hair,
Four more hours and well there.
Utter words of importance,
When we forget to say.
She likes me, I love her
But they always go away wishful thinking,
Lost train of thought,
Shattered dreams broke
From the start ""desperate yells"",
""cries for help"" we do it ourselves.
What we always want we'll never have..
Cause we want too much
What is love and what's it like?
One one zero off the mass pike
Irony floods the car like air,
Hope and pray that she is there",Boston
Horror Show,"Friends came and went,
They always have.
Some at my side,
They never left the fights,
The drinks, the youth..
They've passed, still in my heart.
Always thinking back
Reminicse the arguments,
The innocence days grew cold,
They always do
...stay gold...
I'll see you soon
They've gone but not for long
This is my ode.
To the kids, who fought side by side
To the kids, who would talk and stay up all night.
To the kids, who made up our lives
To the kids, who fought and lost to time...
I'LL SEE YOU SOON",Stay Gold

That I'll ever find
My friend Julia, she hasn't got a clue
But Julia always stay true

Tall as a mountain, but yet so fine
Her feet never touch ground

I'm standing over you and I laugh
Straight in your face

With so many needs
You craved all I had and I gave in to
Your every little desire
You slept in my arms
And you sucked from lips
And when everything
Was taken

I never cared for guns
But that night I opened 
The bar keepers box
And I shot you both down
A bloody mess of fire
Was all my heart desired

Eye for an eye
You sucked my heart dry
Now I'm taking what is mine
Lie upon lie
No more hurting crimes
What's left
Is for you to cry, oh cry
You sealed my heart with a kiss
Now I'm taking what it needs

Eye for an eye
No longer will I cry
I'm taking back what is mine.",S.O.B.

With the same role plays that's about to go on,
Any stagnation, I rise beyond
Get it right, understand ma, ties are strong
From the streets where it all started, back in school
To the dough stacks,and nigga start actin' fool
Who's be the loud type and like to flash the jewels
Hit something nice then broadcast the news,
Facts and weed, this slow track that we
Did it all in the hood, had to leave
Asthmatic, guess I had to breathe
Short nigga wait up, suppose to grab the 'vees
Blasted for few winters, rejuvenated
Return like you remembered, but more swifter
Stronger than your malt liquor,
Money, hoes and clothes, don't let them hoes get cha,

Jack them hot, the real never wrestle with pride,
If you lie, that's the only way I let you inside
Drop them or not, probably for the love of the block
See me solo in a photo, hands under my cock
For face, the white clock and tainted shades
Take for fake, got a face that just say for raise
Get in the mix, sittin' up in cinema six,
Multi-complex, go before the end of the flick
It's just me, besides I'm just a G
Wit the O in the front, I know what you want
Believe… I'm sucka-free

So I won't stop til I'm sittin' on top,

If the streets don't get us, the peace gon' get us
Wait til the lord they don't hit us,
I'm so iffy, keep the 'dro sticky
(???) fifty, come and smoke with me
Bring some cups in the clubs and toast with me,
So small crispy, man I flow sippy
And the last Griffin, play chef in the kitchen

But the book didn't live up to the cover.

The tears rolled down my face.

Left behind like a tree hit by lightning.

So hard at persuading.
They don't know what's real
And a great imitation.
I was so sadly mistaken.

And you know what? 
I'm amazed I fell for the
Spell of a lowdown hit and run driver.
You only wanted to make your mark,
To write your name into the history
Of my heart.

But I get more wise to myself.
And I fall less for the dazzling jewel,
More the jewel in plain wrapping.

All my senses you worked 
So hard at persuading.
They don't know what's real
And a great imitation.
I was so sadly mistaken.

And if your star falls,
It won't stop til' the gutter,
In a better place than where
You came from.
And if all you hoped for 
Was destruction,
You've got a nerve and another thing comming.

I can't be late

I'm heavy with you
Through cold morning avenues
Rushing with the rabble
Under gluttonous swelling skies

I'll come to you
Over clandestine sidewalks
I'll come to you
Crashing through dead leaves

Crashing, I'll come to you
And the cracks in the sidewalks
I'll come to you, crashing

Well, and the crosswalk says stop
Yet there you are
Trust the flicker of a picture
Between the static of cars

And it's a relief
That these walls are so high
Like arms that hold us together
Waiting for a green light

Go, go, go, stop
Go, go, go, stop
We embrace in the heart of our city
On wet broken sidewalks we're free

There was a country fiddler, 
A jester, a riddler, a joker, 
A singer of songs, 
In every town he passed 
He'd stop to help the dancing master 
Entertain his straw-rope-foot throng 
And from a green cloth on his back 
He'd take his fiddle 
And some goodbye snow 
Now singing high, now murmuring low 
Now in the middle with his magic bow 
And all the people would know.

Mad Paddy's gone back on the road
A wire string fiddle is his only load,
He's kicking up turf everywhere he goes
And he's on his own.
From the houses all the people they stare
At his Horslips and his emerald green hair
You know he keeps on moving 
He just doesn't care
When he's on his own.	

First he'll play a slow, slow air 
So fair, to drive away your cares 
And bring a magic sleep 
Then the pace will quicken 
As you burst out of your slumber 
And find yourself up on your feet 
But then his magic tune will change 
To something strange, there's something wrong 
What's going on. 
And through the tears you cry 
You'll look, you'll sigh, you'll feel like dying 
'cause the fiddler's gone 
Mad Paddy's moving on.

Mad Paddy's gone back on the road 
A wire string fiddle is his only load 
He's kicking up turf everywhere he goes 
And he's on his own. 
In the corner there's a smile on his face 
His fancy is taking him to some distant place 
You know his tunes keep changing 
He can't keep the pace 
And he's on his own 
Mad Pat's on the road.

Horslips,"Her words were sharp; they cut him deep,
In a war between the sheets.
But when he brought his bull to her
It meant a woman making war
Beyond the eiderdown.

Told her that she would love again.

Called men to war in hide and bronze.

Ireland's most exciting saga is, undoubtedly, Tain Bo Cuailgne ( The
Cattle Raid of Cooley ), the centerpiece of the Ulster cycle of Heroic
Tales.
Normally referred to as ""The Tain"", it deals with the conflict between 
The forces of Connacht and Ulster for possession of a prize bull.
The events of the Tain are estimated to have taken place in Ireland 
Approximately 500 B.C. The earliest written version of the Tain known
To us is contained in the Book of the Dun Cow, which dates from the 12th
Century. Before this the story was kept alive by storytellers.
Two other manuscript versions are also available; the 12th century Book
Of Leinster and the 14th century Yellow Book of Lecan. The Tain, as
Ireland's equivalent of the Aeneid, has long intrigued historians, academics
And writers",Charolais

You handed me your book ... I signed this way:

""Roses are red, my love.

I wrote into your book,

There came a knocking on my door

Said ""pack your bags and move on out

if you say so long, if this is goodbye. Oh!

Hey, Girl! This can't be true,
How am I supposed to exist without you?
And, Hey, Girl! Now don't put me on,
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone.
How will I live. How can I go on.
How can I go on? Hey, Girl!

Hey, Girl! Now sit yourself down,
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground,
Don't go away. Hey, Girl!
Don't go away. Hey, Girl!","Hey, Girl"
Hot Buttered Elvis,"The devil went down to Scunthorpe
Looking for a soul to steal
In a bind and way behind
He was willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Pickin' on a guitar, playing it hot
And the devil jumped on a hickory stump
And said I'll tell ya what

I guess you didn't know it
I'm a guitar player too
And if you care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a real good guitar boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a guitar of gold to get your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you

The boy said my name's Johnny, it might be a sin
I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret
I'm the best that's ever been

Johnny resin up your pick
And play your guitar hard
'Cause hell is here in Scunthorpe
And the devil deals the cards
Now if you win you'll get
This shinny guitar made of gold
But if you loose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And said I'll start this gig
And fire flew from his finger tips
As he resined up his pick
He strummed the pick across the strings
It made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
Let me show you how it's done

Fire on the mountain run boys run
Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Ready says you don't fight, no child, no
Let's go

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
He laid that golden guitar
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said Devil come on back 
If you ever want to try again
I told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best I've ever been

Fire on the mountain run boys run
Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Ready says you don't fight, no child, no

Come back in the middle of the night
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
It's alright, it's alright

You here everything is gray

And you drove away

And honestly I'm way to tired to fight

Round and round drama every time

Im'a go cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry I should scream
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
'Cause honestly I just don't care
Honestly I just don't care

Honestly everybody's stoked I'm finally free
And honestly my phones blowing up tonight

So I'll go out get drunk again
Make out with all your dumb friends
Tag your face just to rub it in

I'ma go cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry I should scream
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
'Cause honestly I just don't care
Honestly I just don't care

Oh
Don't go up when they're playing my song
Don't act right when you know you're dead wrong
You're out of line, out of line tonight

Well I'm on the couch when you come back home
It's a little too late cause I'm already gone
I'm already gone

Honestly you did it to yourself
So don't blame me

Im'a go cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be

You are, you are the truth something unusual
You are, you are my fire you're burning like the sun
You are, you are, you are

I need some lovin'
And my baby, I can't hold it much longer

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing, sexual healing
Oh baby, makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing is good for me
Sexual healing, it's something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby

And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the things you're dealing
I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you do it right

Baby, I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

And when I get that feeling, I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me, makes me feel so fine
It's such a rush, helps to relieve the mind
And it's good for us, sexual healing
It's good for me, sexual healing is good for me

And it's so good for me
And it's so good to me, my baby

Oh, come take control, just grab a hold of my body and mind
Soon we'll be making it, oh we're doing fine
You're my medicine, open up and let me in

It can be confused if fueled by desire

Said it's hard for love

But I tried my best to cloak it, in a bind, I'm getting stronger
Will these women's take this somewhere else
Somewhere we don't hurt
In my heart we're getting stronger and I know where we belong in

It's our last time to choose
How are we gonna lie or second guess
When we cover our eyes and we open our scars
Are we ready to lay this all to rest

Don't destroy your heart (say yes)

If you want to step, I'll step with you
Walk ahead, walk through
You'll be grown to soon
You'll be grown to soon

Now there's nothing to lose
How are we gonna move together
Time you're breathing ? with me

And let's get the guitar track right
We don't know where this day ends
But we know we've got tonight
You know I find a sadness
In dark, in dark of night
Alone and I'm wondering
Wondering for something so right

When I'm with you, we're only losing time
Drinking the hours, as I pour you and you sip from mine
When I'm with you, what's real is out of mind
Dreaming is binding, stay close to me as we redefine

Connection, correction
Connection, correction
Correction, correction
Correction, correction

We've been staying up all night
Been just deleting the days
Something happens at midnight
When the world is torn and frayed
I'm in love with the daylight
But find it hard when rearranged
Nothing's better than stage fright
We turn heads as we turn on a phrase

I threw up my fist but she spiked my punch
So I couldn't fight all her moves, she turned the light off
She spoke the words and unravelled my pen
And parts of my body that had devil and sin
We took the stand for one night, so one might
Not believe the thoughts received
But remembering her thighs keep my eyes shut
I told her now you in my hut
And I housed her, by design
But she now owns real estate on my mind
Now this all started from ""Excuse me Miss""
Drunk on ethics, Socrates' pissed
The wish of a well connects to my gut
And the preacher said the devil lives in a struggle
She ain't got wings but bless her mama
My nerves saying it feels like nirvana

When I'm with you, we're only losing time
Drinking the hours, as I pour you and you sip from mine
When I'm with you, my heart is on the line
Dreaming is binding, stay close to me as we redesign

Hot Cross,"Caught cutting through the running tide.
Bleeding out;
Portrayed way past a prime tripping over words and playing tricks on time.
Eastern standard time of the dead.
Wear clocks round our necks like tombstones.
Fuck not lest ye be fucked.
A point invariably moot when you've outgrown smarts and frustration is your strongest suit.
Keep in mind, it's the wisest man that will always be told to foret his ego for a minute and 
Realize that he can't replace his ass just because he found a crack in it.
(26 years past my prime as if minutes made a difference)
And How can we sit so still when it's so hard
(Like ostriches with heads in sand we fear our desires.)
So hard to find what you loved
(Breathe every breath like it wasn't a countdown)
To find what you felt in that touch?
(Breathe every breath like it wasn't a countdown)
And How can I go searching for these days when I'm standing among them?
Rhetorical wisdom is a locked door a lost chance and all you'll ever see a statement betrayed like Your worst enemy.
Breathe every breath like it wasn't a countdown.
Can't change a mind lost to the hours held so dear,
Can't force your way out of a dream purchased with fear.",Fortune Teller

I met a pretty girl when I was living on the road
She told me she’s never-ever leave 
I believed all them lies, and now her I do despise
And there was nowhere else that I would rather be

But on my way
He was wishing he was on his way 
Yeah, I was on my way
On his way back home

Well I’m old and fat and grey, and I’m walking with a cane 
My heart’s a-growing weaker every day 
I’m thinking about my life and all my mistakes
