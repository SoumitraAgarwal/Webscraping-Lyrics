DJ Bigg Mike,"O...Let me tell you girl
Oh...hey here I go, here I go

I know you heard me say it
Time and time again
That they would rock your world
And change your life
But I can't blame them
Cause you make a nigga wanna get involved
Wanna get the drawers
Well I'm gone put my bid in 
And get at you
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do
The only difference is 
they look out for themselves
But I'm doin' it just to hear you yell..yeah

O...that's gonna be the sound
Girl when it's goin' down 
Your body sayin' O...
Don't have to say my name
Girl I'm just glad you came
So you can say O...
In the morning O...
In the night 
You sayin' O...
Means I was hittin it right O...
You can't be mad at me
I'm just aiming to please
Let me hear you scream O...

Girl come on over and 
Let's get this thing crackin'
You'll be surprised when 
You see what O's I'm packin'
Cause I'm young but I'm ready
Trynna get hot and heavy
Turn you out if you let me
yeah, yeah
Girl I'm gone take you 
Somewhere that never been
Show you some things that 
Make you wanna show your friends
Have you so weak that you 
Can't even say a thing
But that's okay all you gotta say 

O...that's gonna be the sound
Girl when it's goin' down 
Your body sayin' O...
Don't have to say my name
Girl I'm just glad you came

Let me hear you scream O...

O is for that overtime I'm puttin' in
We'll go for hours take a break
And go at in again
Girl I work my way from A
All the way to Z
But trust me baby girl 
O is where you wanna be
Couldn't believe me when I tell you
I'm not trynna tell you what to do
Cause when it's said and done 
The choice ain't mine it's really up to you
Just say yes don't fix your mouth 
To tell me no drop the bottom
Jaw for me and just say O...

O...that's gonna be the sound
Girl when it's goin' down 
Your body sayin' O...

O, when you can't make another sound
Now scream
Baby girl let me hear me scream Oh...
Baby girl let me hear me scream Oh...",O

DJ Black,"Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

It's the people's champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppi Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Ho's that diss me in the club, the same ho's in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T Ferris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm what they do, you on 5-9 double O
In the Tahoe on 24's, I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Couda Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say cheese and show my fronts, it's more carrots/karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil, and I'm paid plus I'm sittin' sideways

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

What it do
I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gang bangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a Styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Trying to find some ""Honey Love"" my macking game is top rank
These ho's peeping me, ill hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, trying to figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping
Look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm sittin' sideways

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

Maybe O.J's, ho's be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's
Watch ya ho, watch ya money, watch ya clothes
Single women's out the mold, glidin' like a ice skater
Motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows
Sensei, Don Key, Paul Wall in the place
Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Raised on Scott and Yellow, when I blaze...
Boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking off the intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses
S.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the plates
Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm sittin' (I'm sittin')

DJ Black,"I gotta stay fly, until I die
I gotta stay fly, until I die
I gotta stay fly, until I die
I gotta stay fly, until I die

Call me the juice and you know I'm a stunt
Ride in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's the pump
Breakin' down the good weed rollin' the blunt
Ghetto pimp tight girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chains
Ridin' through the hood got me grippin' the grain
And I'm sippin' the same while I'm changin' the lanes
Eyes real tight 'cause I'm chokin' the creep
Vision messed up 'cause I'm drinkin' the lean
Messing with D boys riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel but I know I'm a star
'Cause when I'm in the club I be back in the far 
In the VIP part everybody in the bar

DJ Paul is a dog one you do not trust
You leave your green around me
Nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drink around me
Believe your drink gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me
And she bad she gonna get stuffed
These niggas is spies we living it live keep them nice tires
Ridin' around what they like
Make a couple of nuns a couple of dimes
It's purple purp purple purp purple and swallow it down
With the yurple yip yurple yip yurples, it's goin' down!

I gotta stay fly, until I die
I gotta stay fly, until I die

Puff puff pass nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke us one
Car pull out the phantom
Niggas can't stand it but them hoes gon' come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my cheese

Stop at the light and pause on 3
Hit the mall and it be all on me
But gotta keep one eye out for the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo
Know they mad 'cause I roll the Benzo
It's that purple not pretend-o
Three 6 Mafia and they my kin folks
So when I'm in Memphis, Ten-a-key
I just might not bring my own
'Cause them niggas still let me smoke for free

What's up Mary (How you doin'?)
Mary Jane (Stanky nigga)
Since I have met you girl you ruined my brain (Ruined my brain)
You stole my heart (You stole my heart)
Right from the start (Right from the start)
So I broke you down lil mama and hit you in the dark (hit you in the dark)

I gotta stay fly, until I die
I gotta stay fly, until I die

Front row full of that dro'
Leave the club full of rolls 8 mo
Yo girlfriend wanna ride with me
In the car wit a pimp where she supposed ta be
You ain't met no dudes spittin' cold as me
With a bag of kush that cost six-fifty
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughin' and choking constantly
Tastes like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That should be the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, 
Hit that shit, hold that shit, 
Blow that shit out slow
Then pass it to me bro

MJ gonna sprinkle in some of that 
Super incredible, leave a nigga runnin' back
Where the nigga really good sticky number at
Cuttin' through the cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the morning what I need is to breath again a whole lot of weed
But maybe somebody can give me what I need when I want no less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8-ball and M-J-G
And Young Buck we don't give a fuck
We must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessey
Nigga got a little hair on his chest
And we be like Bill Clinton girl take it out ya mouth
We'll shoot it down right on yo chest

DJ Black,"Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold

Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top
All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')

I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say

[Chorus]
Smile for me daddy
(What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill
(Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
(Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)
Smile for me daddy
(What you looking at)
I want to see your grill
(You wanna see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom rows gold)

What it do baby
Its the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But its what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

[Chorus]

Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

It's what it do, in the Lou'
Ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks
And the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em
On the top, on the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold)

[Chorus]

Boy, how you get grill that way
And how much did you pay
Every time I see you
Tha first thing I'm gon' say hey

DJ Black,"Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S-H-O-are-T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be livin naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell

I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fuckin maker
'Cause I ain't takin no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts

Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch

This dope ain't yo dope
And these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafuckin guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafuckin road

And don't even try to come back nigga yo
Cause me Dre and see got fingers on a fat trigger

We makin too much money movin weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper boomin cold blow yo ass up

And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailin on yo bitch ass

But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas

Niggaz on the track droppin shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cookin up some llello for the local drug king

The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slangin some more white dust

Real, oh so triil, the life's no glamour
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fuckin up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home

And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales

Stupid muthafuckas smokin dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fightin' Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops findin my stash, yo what could the worst be

Through so goin undercover then turnin dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Callin my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas

I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't bout to sell no fuckin dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope, but you still ain't sellin shit

Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafuckin cuts
So step in, like I said before, we'll take them muthafuckin nuts

Ask the last nigga brought his fuckin ass down
Tryin to sell that fuckin dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'mma go to Port Arthur and run them fuckin niggaz

Brought his fuckin gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac

Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho

Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain

DJ Black,"This Boosie Bad Azz and lemme tell you somethin', 
When I was 16 0r 17 my mama looked at me she say
""Boosie, son, get on yo motherfuckin' shit nigga"". 

Big money I like it. 
Used to have hoes who triflin', 
Now I got pros, who dikin', 
And its exciting, its exciting. 

I had to get my shit together mayne, I didn't like it. 
I had too many hoes, who triflin'. 
Dirty shell toes, and Nikes. 
I didn't like it, it wouldn't exciting. 
Till I got money, I got icey and hoes got right, they got feisty. 
Turk to put me in the studio, I kept writing. 
Droppin' that gangsta shit, and its exciting. 
Purple after purple, mayne, we kept lightin'. 
Concert after concert mayne we kept fighting. 
We struck tha' world real quick, like lightning. 
You pussy ass rap niggas, stop biting. 
I used to fuck wit lil' girls wit lil' minds who wouldn't grown yet, 
Before you wear a thong get yo pussy in check. 
Yo hygiene a motherfucker you 'sposed to stay smellin' right, 
Especially if you got a nigga wit money,
That's wat he like. 

Big money I like it.

All my shows, be exciting. 
Hoes grabbin' on my dick, wanna bite it. 
Didn't yo mama teach you betta? 
You triflin' Just chill, after tha' show, you can lick me like icing. 
Money make yo life betta so fuck what they say. 
Girls be wanna ""G"" up every time they look in yo face. 
She used to kiss me on my neck. (uh huh)
Now she suck me till that pussy get wet. (uh huh) 
I remember way back when I used to fuck plats, 
When wore them daisy dukes and had that pussy sittin' fat. 
Now a nigga gettin' stacks, I do whatever I like. 
I hit em Asian, Black, or White. I have my pleasure wit dykes. 
I'm first class on every flight. I'm a big dog nigga. 
At tha' super bowl on the front row. Where is ya'll niggas, look. 
I used to fuck wit hoes who like to cut
Yo tires up. Now I'm breaded and they can't even get a nut. 

Big money I like it. 
Used to have hoes who triflin', 
Now I got pros, who dikin', 
And its exciting, its exciting. 

Big money I like it.

I been livin' like a timer, and I like it. 
Hittin niggas baby mamas and they wifeys. 
Rims all shiny, dressed nicely. 
Hoes wit tha' white tee, fresh white G-Nikes. 
White 2 seat, or I might be new SUV, doing 90. 
Lookin' for tha right weed, for tha right fee. 
Hit it once or twice my eyes tightening. 
I go faster, I swerve slightly to the left of the lane I came back right. 
Grab that clutch tightly 'cause it might be my night, 
You know we got niggas dying nightly. 
Tonight I'm wit a nice freak. She half white, 
She clean up, lick a nigga nuts 'cause she like me. 
Finding another me up in the streets is unlikely. 
Don't hit me on the phone later on 'cause I might be gone. 

Big money I like it.

Who want your bezzle
And that voice that he wish he had
Jealousy got niggas creepin' down to bust ya ass
We livin' fast
But you notice I got em B
Money cars clothes and hoes
Till they pocket me
This for my niggas down in Texas
All the fuckin' swingers
Who got the whole other side of town
Wanna thank em
I'm stressin' cause the things I did
Not wearin a rubber got me stuck now with three kids
This shit is real
Wish I had a real friend to holla
They tend to laugh 
When I tell em bout my fuckin problems
But I be stackin' the feds
So I be straight when I'm gone
I been prayin' for webbie

[Boosie:]
I'm sippin gallons tryin' to ease the pain
Hopin my niggas keep it gutta
But they seem to change
That's why I'm solo
Blowin' dodo in a different city
Thinkin' these niggas tryin' to do me
But they rollin' wit me
My ho da sickest
But she listen to what the streets say
That got me stressin
Cause she might be leavin' anyday
I try to pray
But when I holla he ain't holla back
That's why I'm missin' prayer daily
Tryin' to get these stacks
Why that
The situation that I'm in
The judge tryin' to send me to the pen
And give me ten
And do me in
Got me stressin' on some major shit
My mama agin'
And my grandma and my baby's sick
This hatin' shit
Got me one step away from clickin'
This me against the world livin'
Got all my people bitchin'
I look my mama in her eye 
Told her respect the game
She like boosie leave it alone
Look at craig ganes

You will be the only one for me

Than a thousand words

Day by day 
Your magic to me 
There is no need to deny 
I really know why 
You're mine endlessly

Shadows of the night
They are coming when the moon is shining bright
Leave their graves as shadows of the night
When the city is asleep
No one knows the

In the darkness they are flying side by side
Silent cowls are shadows of the night
No one ever saw a face
Of the shadows of the night

1.
Cemetery - it's 1 o'clock
A wolf is howling on a distant rock
It's time - for the silent slaves
Waking up to open their graves

One, two, then three and four
Grave by grave more and more
Commemoration of transmutation
Traces - of a lost generation

The shadows of the night have never died
Unsatisfied
They paid the highest price
Waiting - for another advice

Never found final peace
Their restless life will never cease
When the moon is shining bright
They leave their graves as shadows of the night

2.
The shadows of the night are on their flight
Never saw the light
Silent strangers slow and fast
Without future without past

Flying through the streets of an endless town
The way to nowhere up and down
People locked the doors of their floors
Shadows are fast like a flying horse

A short attack, like a maniac
Confused by the ghost in black
When the moon is shining bright
They leave their graves as shadows of the night",Shadows of the Night

About you and me.

Stay in our memory.
So alone, so lost in the dark,

You walk out the door , I'm lonely
Cause you're the only one, the one and only
I need you in the heat of the night
Come quick, I wanna hold you tight
Could you feel I need you
When you're in my arms all my dreams come true
When you're gone I feel weak
It's so hard to be all alone another night without you
Let me feel all the warm next to you
Let me feel the passion
All alone I've been waiting for you
Let me feel the passion

Can't be without you baby

Dans tout mes reves je dense avec toi
N'arrete pas de retourner chez moi
Ecoute la deuixieme voix dans la nuit
Ecoute tu as fais de moi un grand mut
No vibration, troublecation, domination
Just bad creation of mine
Couldn't see the sign
Imagination I'm feeling fine
I can't tell how I feel
Since I've realized our love is for real
I can hurt many times

DJ Bobo,"Black rain falling on me
Black rain is all that I see
Black rain colours the sand
Too fast I don't understand
False prophets talking about our life our destiny
Rain forest still alive sounds like a joke an irony
The air smells dirty we can all see pollution
To heal the world is not a game or an illusion
We see the world hunger not enough to eat
We close our eyes walking through the lonely streets
Strange disease there's nothing there's no cure
Cancer aids and much more we know for sure
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Sometimes we get angry there's no focus in our life
When people get hungry they gonna learn how to survive
Homeless people concealed in the street
With no hopes and no dreams with no shoes for their feet
How many guns they have to melt they have to burn
Return to good sense when will we ever learn
Fighting this freedom for everyone for you and me
I know that this world is the place for us to be
Black rain made out of steam
Black rain to the extreme
Black rain what can we do
Too fast a nightmare comes true
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
The message is love
They've got drugs for children sniff to be free
They've got so much corruption this is all what I can see
Respect yourself you don't need that pack of crack
You only live once and you're not coming back
Spread your arms against the wall you're not to small
That's all to call who's next in the line to fall
This world is in motion runs faster and faster
We pray for a wind of change don't want that disaster
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Rain forest can survive rain forest save our life
If there's a wind of change the message is love
Protect the seven seas protect the helpless trees
We need the wind of change the message is love
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay

I've got the music in me 

I've got the music in me, deep in me 
And I'll never feel alone 
I've got the music in me, deep in me 
Let it goin' on and on 

On our mission to no man's land 
We followed the traces in the sand to a 
Land, never seen before 
Without mountains and valleys and lakes without shores 
All my friends disappeared 
Being alone that's all they feared 
Transformed by a metamorphosis 
A matter of time and I'll be like this 
In the dark there's shining an invisible 
Light, cold and bright through the night 
Made by an enemy or made by a friend 
What does it mean, I can't understand 
The drums are calling boom, boom, boom 
I'm ready to rumble, when the fight resumes 
Left alone on my own, I'm 
Captured in a danger zone 

Hundreds of voices in the deep dark night 
Searching for a light, avoiding the fight 
I feel there is someone else beside me 
Around the tree, mysteriously 
Time is running fast, I'm the last of the past, 
Time is running fast, I'm the last 
I hear the ticking of a bomb inside my head 
Tic tac, tic tac waiting for the big attack 
I'm the last survivor of the expedition 
Of a mission, into a no man's land 
Like explorers, like strangers 
We saw shades of a dwarf but didn't see the danger 
Surrounded by a groove I was hypnotised 
Tried to run away but my feet didn't move 
Left alone on my own, I'm 
Captured in a danger zone

DJ Bobo,"The snow is falling in a cold winter night 
Stars in the sky shining bright see the light 
Forget about the problems for one day in your life 
With your wife, your family, your friends and in harmony 
Let's come together help the sad and lonely through 
It could be me or you so what we gonna do 
Come and take my hand, let me understand 
Welcome to the Christmas land 

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas 
Feel the power of the silent night 
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas 
See the guiding star is shining so bright 
Oh oh oho 
We're celebrating Christmas 
Come and join the party of love 
Oh oh oho 
We're celebrating Christmas 
See the stars are shining above 

Who wants to spend Christmas time alone 
At home on your own sitting next to the phone 
Waiting for someone who's calling tonight 
To hold you tight, let the stars shine bright 
Feel the spirit, the power of love 
These emotional moments and the sky above 
Friends are together celebrating hand in hand 
Welcome to the Christmas land

DJ Bobo,"Return to silence 
We need no violence 
Fighting for freedom in a restless world 
We are praying for peace 
Without pain and disease 
Heal the world and close your eyes 
Return to silence 

Return to silence 
We need no violence 
Fighting for freedom 
Return to silence 
Praying for peace 
Pain and disease 

Where is a real paradise 
Where is the land without lies 
We just have to find a better way 
The loss of heaven is the price we pay 
No more nightmares each and every day 

We don't need any wars 
People wanna change course 
They want the union of love 
Where's a heavenly place 
For the whole human race 
Without weapons and wars 

Every being on earth, needs a dream in his soul 
We need our freedom, let loose of control 
The older we get the less we see our way 
We think of the past, but now we are trapped 
And if I want to know why, we are trying to deny 
The loss of heaven's road, is the price we have to pay 
Stop violence, let's come to one's sense 
Return to innocence 

Somewhere inside, we still feel to be a child 
Where the eyes are big and the problems being mild 
If we try to go against, the current of events 
Sometimes we gonna loose but we have to take the chance 
Always have in mind, things should change in peace 
Searching for someone to help, the sad and lonely trough 
It can be me or you, so what we gonna do 
I have a clue, for me and for you

Follow your trace, embrace this human race
In case, there's a new decade in human history

Feel free and stop running away
From the doubt in your mind-never fade to grey
Dreams can make you fly

Rainbows in the sky
This world is magic to me
Dreams can make you fly

We need peace on earth
The second birth of paradise
Planet earth, gentle and blue
Then cold as a rock, or ice without a hue
Planet earth made out of dust
A big ball of metal, condemned to rust
Pray, let your soul be free
Find out how to heal a bleeding wound, don't stand around
Life could be paradise, peace on earth is what I found
All around in a magic world from the air to the ground

DJ Bobo,"I have a dream, I have a vision
You may say it's an illusion
Together we are strong
Let's give peace a chance
Tell me what will be tomorrow
Will we find a road to follow
I still believe in love
Let's give peace a chance

Now I feel like I'm stranded
But I'm not the only one
Light the fire and give peace a chance
It's a wonderful world
Let`s see it, believe in it
For tomorrow, let's give peace a chance

I tell you, now wake up or be swayed by my dream now
A world of hope and peace, I'm trying anyhow
Most of us only care about money making
And that's for real - the thought of it is aching
Facing everyone with an open heart
We better going to start before our worlds apart
No matter where you from - no matter who you are
No matter what you do - the pain has gone to far
There's a falling star, please achieve my dream
Peace for the world and try and grow your self-esteem
To resort to violence means hate and frustration
Coming back stronger then your own imagination
Power and money shouldn`t be the temptation
But shouldn`t be love our best motivation
I still can't believe this is true, right here, right now - I haven't got a clue

Whatever happens in your life you've got another chance
To advance yourself, grow and give a better glance
Tolerance between religions and races
Let's talk about respect between different faces
We all are the same at the end of the day
Rich or poor we have to fade away
And if you`re black or white – doesn't matter anyway
Hindu, Muslims, Christians, they all just pray
For freedom and a world of peace and harmony
Lord I'm so confused about this living human tragedy
Tell me what is wrong, - tell me what is right
Tell me why are people still suffering and fight
People hear me - it's time to wake up and love
Before it's to late let us all free the dove
I still can't believe this is true, right here, right now - I haven't got a clue

Is this what life was meant to be
Sometimes we lose reality
But then I'm reaching for the stars
And I know, and I know

I have a dream, I have a vision
You may say it's an illusion
Together we are strong
Let's give peace a chance
Tell me what will be tomorrow
Will we find a road to follow
I still believe in love
Let's give peace a chance

Now I feel like I'm stranded
But I'm not the only one
Light the fire and give peace a chance
It's a wonderful world
Let`s see it, believe in it
For tomorrow, let's give peace a chance",Give Peace a Chance

I'm gonna miss you so much if you go.
And, Hey, Girl! I tell you  no lie,
Something deep inside of me's going to die,
if you say so long, if this is goodbye. Oh!

Hey, Girl! This can't be true,
How am I supposed to exist without you?
And, Hey, Girl! Now don't put me on,
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone.
How will I live. How can I go on.

I've been around the world, saw the desert and the rainbow -I go for the show from the sand to the snow,
From Moscow to Manila, from Milano to Beijing,
Caracas to Cape Town and back to Montreal,
Stop running every day from the pain; say no, go!
Driving you insane, no shame that you want let show -
Call my name; I feel the same when ou have sorrow!
Grow, let it go! There it always be a tomorrow.
Rap 2:
All around the world when you need a friend;
I'll be there, anywhere, don't care with a helping hand,
Understand one another 'til the end,
I swear; I'm fair, I care always gonna be there -Black, white, yellow,
No matter if you're young or old;
All for one, one for all -That's what my mother told me!
Different colours and faces, find the traceTo your embrace this human race;
Life, will flows like a waterfall -I've been around the world, saw the desert and the rainbow!
Rap 3:
I've been around the world, saw the desert and the rainbow,

From New York to Paris, Sao Paulo to London,
Sydney to Munich and back to Jakarta,

Peoples ( are ) so open, much more as I expected - Invincible pleasure in Brazil ( Samba ),
Fond of life - there was no time to chill!!
I've been around the world, a thousand times for sure,
Could be more explore?
Before you walk through that door.

Life's a castle on a raining sandy beach,
All your hopes and dreams so far beyond your reach,
Climb the highest mountains, swim the deepest sea,
Free is, what I wanna be, see the key - count on me,
No jealousy, eternally; the family is, what you need!...........

DJ Bobo,"Baby's in the parlour waiting for the rain 
Beating like a hammer washing out her pain 
Clearing like the one seven years ago 
When her first big love melted like the snow 
Back then she doubted, if she would ever find a man 
Who could love her that way the same way again 
And just when she thought she's living in vain 
The man of her dreams came like the rain 

When love is the price freedom is the cost 
Love is the price freedom is the cost 
And just when you think everything is lost 
Love will be your price 
And I'll know, I would not change a thing 
Cause I know I would not change a thing 

They spoke about her dreams 
They spoke about love 
They spoke about all the things she was so afraid of 
He had a key-word for everything she felt 
So it didn't take long till' he got her nailed 
Pin ones hope on someones elses life 
And all your dreams will hurt you like a knife 
The same whit her she soon got lost 
When love is the price freedom is the cost 

She didn't trust that very first man 
To come to her life trying' to understand 
What nobody ever could before 
He only made her see there is something more 
To learn about freedom to free about love 
To handle all the things she was so afraid of 
To always follow what she really felt inside

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

We hardly need to use our ears

So stick around 'cos we might miss you

This is the way to reach our soul
The rhythm takes control

",Let the Party Begin
DJ Bobo,"This is the story of a star
He gave up reality for fame
He's the man in the mirror

Money was his best friend
Lludadi dadida
Lights are off, the curtains closed
No one is here now
Ludadi dadida
To turn back the hands of time

he's the man, in the dark
Trying to see the light again
He's the man, in the dark
To fall is hard to understand

He's the man in the mirror
He was a hero, he was a superstar
He's the man in the mirror
Searching the spotlight, Searching a fame bizarre

He's the man in the mirror
Ludadi dadida
He's living inside a nasty world
No one was honest
Ludadi dadida

Searching for the fame he lost
He's the man in the mirror
He was a hero, he was a superstar
He's the man in the mirror
Searching the spotlight, Searching the fame bizarre

The curtain is closed
The camera is off
The make up is washed away
He's looking in the mirror
Trying to find his inner self
The real world is waiting
He's so afraid to be alone

Time is getting over
Ludadi dadida
The past is running through his hands
No one is waiting
Ludadi dadida
The show is over he's alone

",Man in the Mirror
DJ Bobo,"I'm living far away
In darkness every day
I'll never forget your smile
I miss your style
How can I go ahead
I need you I am sad
And I'm still running around
In a Russian town

Moscow
When the rain falls down in Moscow
When I'm all alone in Moscow
I am thinking of you
Wish the sky would be blue

Ladadi dadada
Ladadi dadada
Ladadi dadada
Ladadi dadada

I hear you call my name
There's still a burning flame
I wanna let you know
I miss you so
I never felt this way
And I don't wanna stay
But I'm still running around
In a Russian town

When the rain falls down
Falls down in Moscow
I'm so alone
I am thinking of you
Wish the sky would be blue

DJ Bobo,"Tell me why, tell me why oh tell me why 
I am hurt so deep inside don't make me cry 
Tell me why, tell me why oh tell me why 
Live in love with you was just a lie 

Another night why do I believe 
Life could be like before 
You ran away said I have to leave 
And then you walked out that door 

Time will heal, I'm alive 
Broken wings need to fly let me try 
Time will heal, I will rise 
And then I close my eyes 

Another day I'm feeling alone 
I don't know what to do 
I can't believe our love has gone 
You don't know what I've been through 

Tell me why, tell me why 
The day we met I've learned to fly 
Tell me why, tell me why 
To live with you was just a lie 

I'm lonely, hope you feel the same pain too 
You walked out that door, the next rendezvous 
For you, I was the name of the game 
Insane, I feel like the man in the rain, 
The one to blame, the one without a name 
Standing on the end of the road so ashamed 
And naked, there's no way to your heart 
I guess that's it, we're apart",Tell Me Why
DJ Bobo,"Now it's time to turn off the light 
Now it's time to - say goodbye 
Planet colors is coming back 
Once again - someday 

Time was flying by, on silent wings 
Now we have to say goodnight 
Time was flying by, we gave our best 
Now we're turning off the light 

The love you gave - is our strength 
We're now at the end - and soon we'll come back again 

Time was flying by, the lights go off 
The curtain has to fall again 
Time was flying by, you gave us joy 
We say goodbye and wave our hands 

Now it's time to turn off the light 
Now it's time to - say goodbye 
Planet colors is coming back 
Once again - someday 
Hope you enjoyed the show 
Now it's time to go 
We thank you for a party we will never forget 
Now it's time to turn off the light 
Planet colors, say goodbye, say goodbye 

Time to turn off the light 
For saying good night 
We thank you for coming 
Time to turn off the light 
For saying good night 
We hope you enjoyed the show 

Hope you enjoyed the show 
Now it's time to go 
We thank you for a party we will never forget 
Now it's time to turn off the light 
Planet colors, say goodbye, say goodbye 

Being with you has been an important part of my life 
To see your smiling faces ,to feel your energy 
Knowing you've come a long way to be a part of the show 
We will always come back, whenever you need us 
From the bottom of my heart, I thank you


",Time to Turn off the Light
DJ Bobo,"First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind.
All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel,
Made of stone.

Well, I hear the music,
Close my eyes, feel the rhythm,
Wrap around, take a hold
Of my heart.

What a feeling.
Bein's believin'.
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life.

Take your passion
And make it happen.
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life.

Now I hear the music,
Close my eyes, I am rhythm.
In a flash it takes hold
Of my heart.

What a feeling.
Bein's believin'.
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life.

Take your passion
And make it happen.
Pictures come alive, now I'm dancing through my life.

What a feeling.
What a feeling I am music now
Bein's believin'. I am rhythm now
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life.
What a feeling. you can really have it all
What a feeling. pictures come alive when I call
I can have it all I can really have it all
Have it all pictures come alive when I call
Call call call call what a feeling
I can have it all bein's believin
Bein's believin' take your passion
Make it happen
Make it happen what a feeling

Everyday, I feel your love slip away 
If you don't feel the same, tell me the truth
I hope you never go cause girl you gotta 
Believe if you do
That my heart will be lonely for you

I only care about you and me I don't want you to pretend;
About the feelings you have for me cause I heard it from your friends
saying that you want to leave say you want for something more ,
But when I try to hold you and squeeze you you're pushing me away 

Pre-chorus:
I know what you do and what you say to me I know that you're playing with my love
I know what you do and what you say to me Girl - you - gotta - know * that

All alone and by the phone, girl I'm waiting for your call ; 
Telling me you will be late and in the end you never show
Is this the beginning of the way you say goodbye 
Girl I want to hold you and squeeze you and beg you not to go 

If you gotta go the you'd best let me know
I'll accept if you need to be free
Oh its all I can say I won't beg you to stay
See this man needs his dignity (ooh baby)

Tell me the truth, don't let the sun go down on me don't lie to me, let me be your destiny
Cause you've got the key, to my heart
We'll never part you can start this love 
Once again don't let our love slip away come on girl stay night and day, find out, 
Who's right who's wrong, and what's going on my heart is empty when you're gone
You came into my life, you set me free you made it brighter so that I could see, 
'Cause you are - my sweetest temptation my only sensation
I won't beg you to stay, I always knew it's cold alone, can you feel it to ?

I need your smile, all the time
You light my darkest night
When you are by my side
I need your love, all the time

Hope you are always mine
I never would turn back the time
You are my destiny
My heart is in your hands
I pray to God above
Please never stop this perfect love
You are the best of me
Your love can set me free

Vers 2:
Your heart is like my home
You never walk this road alone
I'll never let you down
The best is yet to come
Love changes everything
With you I'm living in a dream
And when you're far away
Your love will make my day

I wouldn't change a thing on you

DJ Bobo,"I hear a lot of stories, I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do for you
High is the risk of striking out, the risk of getting hurt
And still I have so much to learn

Well I know 'cause I think about it all the time
I know that real love is hard to find

And a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high, I blame it on my youth
Soon enough I'll learn the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter then boast how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

Well I know 'cause I learn a little every day
I know 'cause I listen when the experts say that

That a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I reflect on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't as foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find

I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know it will be worth it in the end

A good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

A good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart

Two piece your man and let Big Noc put him in a sleeper
Then see ya, catch me in a club on a wall
Spliff in my hand, big-booty broad winin on my balls
Surrounded my thugs, maybe two or two times ten
Plus the other nine cats, my Rapper Card got in (Your Rapper Card?)
Yeah my Rapper Card, it works in live sessions
Plus barbecues, hoes, clubs, weed spots ecetera

Buckshot rock knots wit fists
Niggas stay high while I rock wit this
Mobb on why'all niggas like The Infamous
Too close wit the dillinger, two shots I don't miss
I'm wiggin out while I'm diggin out backs
Run from the gun claps, run three laps
Perhaps, them niggas you sent to carjack
Buckshot got stopped in they tracks wit macs
Now this is what I act like when I smoke on black
Stay high wit the lazy-eye, bomb wit facts
>From the, street Bible or the street Quran
Fake thugs ride the dick when my shit comes on
I'm a nappy little nigga, still goin strong
You can eat a dick while I eat a thong (CLUE!)
But still the bomb

[Tek]
It's the wave-king, rock the two tone Wallees strip-ons
Don't want to end up miss-on, then play your positi-on
My grimy Brooklyn niggas stay flippin ya chick
While my crew from New Jerus stay vickin ya whips
Tek is the shit, ain't nobody spittin like this
Deep impact steez been like a chromed out six
Wit the AMG kit, Ericsson wit the chip
why'all stockin-cap copy-cats, get off the dick
I keep the livin quarter held down wit two nines
One in the bed, one in the bathroom at all times
So while I'm takin a shit, I'm at route and plan a hit
The amount we flip depends on what we get
It's like a Wall Street trick, dirty money move quick
My mans wear stones you can tip the scales wit
On they ears and wrists alone for every deaf one's bone
Look, ain't no tellin how many gats I've thrown

Rockin shines in the 'Ville, you better tuck that shit 
Or watch yo' step baby, watch where you walk
I put a slug up in yo' mouth so that ass won't talk
For real son, now we got mad cops on the block

Lidu Rock, what the fuck I know why'all niggas mad at me
So if you rep for yours go 'head take a stab at me, muthafucker

When the gun click, your ass shit navy beans
Maybe these, niggas ain't ready for the Magnum
Force, the Holocaust, balls I just dragged them
Off lost in the sauce and of course I'm glad them
Monkey niggas don't fuck wit the Ruck 'cause they fags, son
The last one, to step to Sean P caught a bad one
Quincy toes tagged em after somebody stabbed em
Cornball niggas wit drugs thinkin they weight great
Still bummin money for stoges and a Drakes cake

Get it straight, why'all niggas fuckin wit some heavyweights
Boot Camp-ion champions on point like paper mates

Smackin ya upside the back of ya head wit a spatula
Snatchin ya, off the street like police
Next week, they find your body washin up on the beach
Don't speak if you ain't at norm (ain't got nuttin to say fool)
Tally on, be gone, as we rally strong
See me in Brook-lyn where crooks be armed
Terrorial disputes leave you in memorial suites
Callin your troops, I shoot straight stay in ya place
We the type you love to hate 'cause we stay in your face

And for the frauds I got techs
Heading straight for your chest
Feel me on this

The way my nine drops flues
The way my mind influes

Type of shit you never heard of
From jimbos to fat burger
On some last long shit
I be doing this forever like that nigga von zeil
Plus I calm shit, I bomb shit
I had a lot of brooklyn niggas
Saying ""yeah them bronx niggas they get down""
So hold your heat up, and move fast

And there's nothing to comprehend
When my nine talks

I peep the devil screaming bk
'cause I rock for b.i.g.
Live like pop did, shells couldn't stop the kid
In some rap I pack, used to be in passing for crack
Molka type of lid with a passing for stacks
Dreads call me african black named after my medicine
Street veteran with one gun
Killed eleven men
It's too crazy, why'all fake tough guys with full gazi's
Blue mercedes, three pounds under the blue avy
Bomb crews my mind power beyond you
Now I push your hair line back
Do what the con do
I warned you, and sworn no talking
Bring the thing out
Got the block surrounded like cops
And shots rang out
Animal instinct, blood type is therobreed
Run with thero heads
Leave you in another burough bed
Respect my hood, like the heats do
Be k to the bronx
Poor kane, lord tariq & clue

DJ Clue?,"You never hear that we buckle
Beef? we chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit

Now it's a symphony
Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??

One two one two, come through run through
Gun who, oh you don't know what the gun do
Some do, those that know are real quiet
Let me think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless because I'm the hardest
Rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up foreal, get up and feel, my words
I make herbs split up and squeal
Ill is all I've been hearin lately
Niggaz hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late for that 911 call
Niggaz stay beefin but a lot of them bluffin
But not me because I'ma nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them tough
Not just for frotin
When I hit them niggaz like 'What you want?'
The battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggaz chasin em down
We all knew that you was pussy
But I'm tastin it now
And never give a dog blood
Because raw blood
I have a dog like one bitin whatever
All up in ya gut
Give it to them raw like that
And ain't no love I do em all like that
Four right up in they back
Clak Clak
Close your eyes baby, it's over
Forget it, happened in front off your buildin but
Nobody knows who did it

What
Where my dogs at?
What what
Where my dogs at?
Uh
Where my dogs at?
What what
Where my dogs at?
Uh
Where my dogs at?
What what
Where my dogs at?
Uh
Where my dogs at?
What what

Niggas is pussy
Keep me runnin from the werewolf, owww
Howling at the moon on the roof
Eh, ah, no, get em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Trieed to strike back
Left him like that, layin up with the white hat
Gettin right back at ya when I snatch ya
Up out the grave, nuthin but bones and ashes
Hittin niggaz with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red
But this girl gave me head for free
Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003
That Nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that
I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinkin and eventually
Found that's what you get for stinkin
Blowin up the spot when you rot
Plus if it gets hot they know you dipped
For four squared blocks
Hit em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill
Yet still they don't know I'ma rob who
That dog DMX is a muthafuckin problem

And havin bad dreams of spooky voices and graveyards

Luv ta Fuck Ya, fuck ya, fuck ya, fuck ya

[PMD]
Aiyyo I detonate on impact
So niggaz better get back
The playahaters stay off the dick, P ain't wit that
The blunt, I split that, bust a four wit the kick back
No need to stress that chickenhead nigga, already hit that

[Keith Murray]
I put the pow in the wow like gun to the powder
Give the hardcore niggaz something they could be proud of
I get out of hand like I lost my arm
Decipher the head of see-cipher like Voltron

Who got wins? those that be hard pretend
You got skills? come here, let me tap that chin
Bing, my style ropa-dope around the ring
I'm well promoted, and don't even know Don King

Cops know the SL hand do well
Can tell by the nails you frail
We can battle till your girl big ass feet out them Channels

[PMD]
Aiyyo my brain attack this hip hop shit aggressively
My recipe, mixed wit stress and niggaz testin me
Consecutively, five golds so technically
You niggaz got a long way to go to catch the PMD

[Keith Murray]
Aiyyo we put you to the test, put it through your chest
Make a mothafucker catch a cardiac arrest
Live out the Fresh Fest, one of the best
I asked my nigga Red Alert, he said ""YEESSSSS""

[Erick Sermon]
I intimidate MC's from the throwing of my vocal tone
It don't work, I show em the chrome and flash the greens
Coincide wit the red beam, and hear about it all day on Street Scene

[Redman]
I Welcome niggaz like Kotter to the night marauder
Pull out my gat, you'll be like ""AAAGH!!"" like Godfather
I hang small, but when I'm hard I'm gigantic
In fact, my big-ass dick sunk the Titanic

[PMD]
An MC massacre, got a click and crew ready to blast at ya
(Why these niggaz mad, P?) 'cause we the masters (CLUE!!)
We catch you niggaz wit glass, and who you gon askin
Like you gaspin, backin up while P's blastin

[Keith Murray]
I'll be like ""ROOF!!"" Get At Me Dog like DMX
Keith Murray pack a black tech
And I don't give a fuck, I can't be touched
Females jump in my flow like double-dutch

[Erick Sermon]
My technique, knock niggaz off they feet (why)
I'm Ultimate, like the fuckin break beat
It's My Thing, back wit the sequel
Hold my Squad down wit the chrome desert eagle

Shut niggaz down that be tryin to win

[PMD]
So peep the Thriller of Manilla, wreck shit like Godzilla

See what I'm able to see, (ugh) 'cause my vision is good 
It's like I see through the eyes of a wise old man 
So I chill, and when I can kill this guy's whole fam 
Something better to be thought dumb and remain silent 
Then to open your mouth and remove (?) 'cause if it came violent 
See I'm gonna give it to you straight, so you don't ask anymore 
You don't really want what you asking me for 
It's a war (ugh), when it's on it's on, when I'm long (what) 
Till I'm gone and I ain't got long 
But while I'm here, (ugh) ya'll niggaz gonna burn 
Be (?) after this money (what) and ya'll niggaz gonna learn

Always make sure I know where the toast is (uhh) 
Always cover my tracks when I creep 
Always get away when I'm done to relax to D 
I always know the rules of the game before I play 
And always keep enough dough to know I'm good for the day 
Always walk my dogs off the leash and 
Always get my thoughts off the streets and 
Always will ever lend a hand in borrow 
And always no matter what plan for tomorrow 
I always pay my respects to the dead 
I always take at least one blunt to the head 
Now always know -- (cut off) is gonna end up getting fucked 
And always know-- (cut off) is gonna end up getting stuck! 
I'm always strapped; I'm always cracked 
I've always rapped; it's always that 
Always black 

Never try to knock off rock on the block that ain't yours 
Never take a man's life 'cause you hate yours 
Never become so involved with something that it blinds you 
Never forget where you from someone who reminds you 
Never take for granted what's been given as a gift 
And if I sleep on -- (cut off) left that nigga stiff 
Never turn your back on -- you don't trust 
Never turn your gat on -- and don't bust 
Never expect to give away with cent -- more than twice 
Never forget you could get it too for a price 
Never bring a two and -- if you scared to die 
Never gonna do it -- if you scared to drive 
Never gonna be another day it gets dark 
Never get it -- here for the heart 
Never say never, 'cause I never thought, this never thought never 
Ever caught better, getting cheddar, with doing better, Dmx!

You know what I'm about, slidin off get my cock sucked
Or writin rhymes watching Scarface in the hot tub
Whatchu wanna bet, when I pull it out
if you don't shout that every bullet'll go in and out
Who you know besides 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
and then give it to a modelin bitch 
And you like your watch plain, I'ma flood mine
Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time

Y'all niggaz ain't hearin me out, til I pop up 
appear in your house, clearin it out, holiday style

Snatch the wife silence the child, that's how we move
Kill me my man kill you, that's how you lose

Then the gun's only helpin the clip
And the clip's only helpin my hand
And like who the fuck is helpin your man?

Hit a party start a fight at the bar, and snatch your R
Sell your shit for some coke and get the fuck out of Dodge

Guess you figured that my niggaz, flippers, pullin triggers

My niggaz roll dice in the back park
We sip bacardi darked wit sprite all night
Till the sky get bruised or thug nigga lose
Pull out two-two's only catch two, hundred
Half the crowd skated ?when? which you wanted
This nigga got shaky and panic when you fronted
When he saw the black kron
I thought the nigga wore a thong
The way he froze his arm
Dukes said its on
He stripped to his drawers when he heard one raw
Took off half ass when the nigga spit more
And we all spit game you niggas ?heard free? game
By soft motherfuckers, you lame mothefuckers
I fall, I get back
To test my worth
I tell heads to hit that, its raw get rid of that
My worker take thirty off a bundle
Dodging the bikers, and'em D's 
When they rush the jungle
So we stash in the fences
Sit low on the benches
Keep a small gun in case its on in the trenches

And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown

Briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', got no,

Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll  take her
And I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me

Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight
But we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib
Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment
Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers,
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world,
Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me

At the bar three iced teas, Long Island

I stay stylin?, boots stay filled with weed
In the V, lane three, switchin? up speed
I'ma be obnoxious until I can't breathe
And until then, y'all can't win

Luck's twelve on a scale from one to ten
Influenced by hydro and lots of gin
Nigga back up, damn I need oxygen
Surrounded by lots of men that'll rock your chin
And pop your limbs

While you think your moms look rocked every day
'cause she come see me for them rocks every day
Keep the thang close, ready to pop every day
'cause I'm tired of you spot betters
I got a 380 full of hot peppers, that'll rip through them cop's sweaters
You dudes is chumps, talkin 'bout you live like thugs
You be home watchin Midnight Love
No bitch, you and your hand makin midnight love
It's over dog, you need to just get right fuck, what

I got the gun and clip, runnin shit
I run chains, run rings, run in your block, make you run
Then I run things
Piss in a cup, come on, fuck a drug test
I'm on my block, knockout kings, slugfest
A few beers cold, come through here bold
A few of us blew our goals when fuckin two years old
Off to the lobby, all to the body, then auction a shottie
Go to Boston and party hardy with Walter McCardy
Drunk, smackin bitches off the Bacardi
Hustle often as robbery, so guns, coppin double
Fuck around with me, I'ma pop your bubble
Put up my own yellow tape, save the cops the trouble
If you wanna see my true portions, screw bossin
Kill you like Mike pop for new Jordans
Come through flossin, jail ain't nothin for me
I got cake baby, bail ain't nothin for me
I'm that same son of a be, gun in the V
Coke, guns, hookers, I'm the one that you see
Cats still talkin fly, put his tongue in a tree
If we nice, then we'll let him keep his lung for a G
When I rap, it ain't nothing but hungry you see

When it cause catastrophes, will actually 'cause you to bleed
Fuck up anything you breathe, pass the weed
If a nigga proceed to step outta line, I'm a gradually
Fill his anatomy wit' bullet holes in his behind

I happen to be the type of bitch
Get a grudge I don't budge and shit
And look at what I did in life as a kid
Wit' thugs and pents

Now I got the knowledge of a college mother fucker
Wit' a scholarship
At any degree my temperature get, boiling hot to freezing
When I release, you can see the reason, I'm so cold

Niggas continuously rolling me beats to choke on
Tryna get a smoke on
High, 'cause I have to get it
When you can never see me coming the Devil's Advocate

Material hoe, keeping niggas dropping they draws
And fiending for more
Surrounded wit', diamonds around the wrist
Cruise the town in my six, bruising them every time I hit

And I ain't tryna quit
If I do, you can never find another to fill my shoes
I prove you can't duplicate this
Attempt to and lose

This little nigga been rocking the basement since I was about two
Pick up the pace quick, why worry about a replacement?
When I stepped in came wit' my feet in the pavement
Leave niggas in amazement

And guess what the ingravement say?

DJ Clue?,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Change the Game [Feat. Daz/Kurupt/Beanie Sigel and Memphis Blee

I keep ten glocks, ten rotts up in front of me

Yours is like Evander, seventy-seven slow

Luck stay ghetto like Rican dolla bands

And late periods, there she is

Screamin in a two by two, too fly two seater
Too much ice, too cold, two heaters
Love men but got lesbian guns
That love to lick off at you pussies for fun

So play dumb in these dum dups, hit you where you pump cum
Stick you for your lump sums, we the ones you run from

Ya talkin' greasy like Paul ain't a nigga wit fire
Like I ain't got guns or killers for hire
Got wolves that'll run through mask and arms
Like point break clear the safe out and smash your moms

Over 40 years old still blastin' chrome
Smiles never cross they face till there's cash in palm
'Cause they still do murders for bucks
Have 'em put hollow points through you then pass the burner to luck

We like a two G Bonnie and Clyde, back to back in beef
Wit two heats a piece, mami gon' ryde
Spit four, she behind me wit five
You know Paul Cane and Lady Luck MO catch homo's and slide

Before we drop the guns
Wipe off the prints, push the pedal through the floor
And get away back to the bricks, ya don't want nothin' wit us
Paul Cane, Street Life, Desert Storm, we're dangerous

We ain't jokin' no more, this ain't a game to us

catch you from the passengers side

my words turn the sea red 

like the eyes of a weed head

ya'll peep my led then hide like Easter eggs

I ride 'till the beef is dead, caskets dropped

your soul go further up than astronauts

I talk it and live it

ya'll weak dudes should offer forgiveness

'cause frontin' like you ill gets yourself torchered by killers

[Verse 2]

When ya'll niggas fall 

and start makin' 800 collect call commercials like Arsenio Hall

I'm on times square on New Years with Dick Clark droppin' the ball

with Kool and the Gang, doin' my thing

princess cut chains

I bend bitches like bike frames

my tight game will make Hilary leave Bill quick as lightning

I'll have her wearin' tight jeans

givin' nice brains in a white Range

pullin' up to club life, turned her to a thug life dame 

I'm sayin', you rollin' with Nastradamus

we flowin' to St. Thomas

jewelry box full of stones so I can change diamonds

matchin' masterpieces on black sandy beaches

even the paparazzi tries to peep us

disguised with dark shades and fake beards

a lucky photographer noticed Tyra Banks here

but I showed the tabloids bogus passports

I told 'em back off before I flip like Castor Troy.



[Verse 3]

Live from the Bridge, cliques stay high from the iz'

wear the most popular shit, niggas knockin' my shit

Denali's, fat designed rims, 2000 S Benz

watchin' ESPN with two dime lesbians

I hit it of course, I did it to floss

the last Don, doin' hits like Pepe and Cross

Esco, cash long, niggas think I'm Blacula

'cause I'm in a castle with a bitch cold waxin' her

I leave my teeth marks in hoes, scoop 'em like a spatula

pass 'em to my peoples and party like a Bachelor

'till I meet a gangsta bitch, give her banks to hit

in return all she wants to do is drink the dick

Fuck street clothes, we thug it out in Tuxedos

stomp niggas with hard bottoms in casinos

And mix this is...audio Jesus the repent s*** gets big
Keep it sharp like knife in a pop device
So ""Duro you gotta let it bump!"", I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true 
I suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down I'm still wylin'
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all-a my dogs wit' me
And they all rich, and still all-a they palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walkin' like we talkin' drunk while we stumble over words

Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man
Can you imagine when the race is won
Turn out all the faces into the sun
Praising our leaders we're getting in tune
The music's played by the.. the mad man

Do you really wanna live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever

Some are a Melodie and some are a beat
Sooner or later we all will be gone
Why don't we stay young?
It's so hard to get on to another course
I don't wanna perish like a fleeing horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swingin' out of the blue

Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I f-ck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration

Talking to myself because I am my own consultant

You full of sh-t, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I f-ck around and cut my head off
Real n-gga all day and tomorrow
But these muthaf-ckas talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya

Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do
If these n-ggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on

Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it

Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You n-ggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate

Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well

I done told these f-ck n-ggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I f-ck these on your mind, pause

Keep throwin' my sign in the middle

DJ Cover This,"I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

Again, sitting on the plane
Reminiscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended, with a heartbreak
Now your heartbroken, tears in your face
I ask myself why, lookin' at the sky
If I could turn back I'd make it all right
Praying that your better but it's still stormy weather
Don't wanna let go but the rain won't let up
Now you're gone 

Still thinkin' 'bout you everyday, and I
Know feelings was hurt and you're complaining but
I'm sorry for the games that I played
But now it's too late and now

[Chorus]

It's cold putting up a fight
Arguing back, and forth through the night
Regardless what I said, I don't mean most of it
You know I really love you that's the real it's gon' get
It takes time, to realize what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault I should've gave more
Now your miles away and I'm out on tour
Now it's drums playing, crowd singing, lights changing
Wish you was here to witness all that a stars spaying
They say two wrongs don't make it right
And I was wrong now it ain't right

You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for ‘em, they just say it's wack, but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it’s dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this f***in' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, cause the s*** I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to f***in' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the f***in' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to f*** with the white boy, Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for f***’s sake

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the s*** like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the f*** are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, f*** all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
F***in' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the f***in' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the f*** we been?
You can kiss my indecisive a** crack, maggots
And the crackers' a**, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags and as I’m leavin'
I’ll guarantee they scream, ""Dre, don’t leave us like that man!"" cause",I Need a Doctor

How do you 
How do you
How do you
How do you

You let me win,
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide
And when they lookin'
You let me hide
Defend my honor
Protect my pride
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money,
Just get my weight up
Know when I'm lying,
Know when I'm crying
Its like you got it
Down to a science
Why am I trying
No you ain't buying,
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance
You made me laugh
You make me horse
From yelling at you
And getting at you
Picking up dishes
Throwing them at chu
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you

[Chorus: x2]

What are we doing,
Could you see through me?
Cause you say Nicki
And I say who me?
And you say no you
And I say screw you
Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And I start crying
And I start screaming
The heavy breathing
But whats the reason
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually fronting
I'm askin' you something
Yo, answer this question,
Class is in session,
Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind,
Capture my soul
OK your right
Just let it go
OK you got it,
Its in the can
Before I played it
You knew my hand
You could turn a free throw into a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

Stop,
Would you just stop looking through me 
Cause I just cant take it
No I cant take it

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

And you played it to the beat

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

We could have had it all

Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper

As the smoke clears
I awaken and untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed
All my windows still are broken but I'm standing on my feet

Thinkin' 'bout those people then 
I know that in a thousand years 
I'd fall in love with you again 

This is the only way that we should fly 
This is the only way to go 
And if I lose your love, I know I would die 
Oh, say you'll always be my baby 
We can make it shine 
We can take forever just a minute at a time 

More that a woman 
More that a woman to me baby 
More than a woman 
More than a woman to me 
More than a woman",More Than a Woman

Don't lose your cold dear

Still in the hood I got work to fill the low-low (I'm dumb)

Still wearin' packet, we don't rock white tees
Represent the A, I do it for the hood
I'm still in the trap on the block blowin' good
8's on my Chevy, purps in my blunt
Throw my wrist out the window just so I can stunt
Got a little money so I ask her what she wants
Ten grand and the club, out the bar just to flaunt

I can get it back, hit the trap and get it in

Thangs in my ears lookin like a cup of gin
The girl wanna come so I told her bring a friend
What happened after that? You already know
I pulled out the pole and they did it limbo

Elaborath a maze
Where yes men could easily be known

Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

Don't know who I can trust
I'm living in a rush
I don't understand the fuss

I might be losing it
I just might lose

If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

And then goes passing us by,
And I, I, I can dream for us all, 
I hope I'm in a better state,
When here and now crumbles and falls 
And you, you , you who make worlds collide
I knew you'd come knocking one day,
Unannounced like a thief in the night.

Where do we go from here, 
Time ain't nothing but time, 
I now have no fear of my fears
And no more tears to cry, 
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow means nothing at all
If we don't hear the line,
When today places its call, and morning, morning, morning
Won't ever be the same, 
Now I won't make the same mistakes, time and time again (5x)

Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you
I had a dream my trip would end at you, 
And now I know paradise.

I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town

No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

[Chorus: x4]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spins the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be taking you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking jacks never been my flavor

You jealous, what? Take your black ass home
Yo spots been blown from the brown skin pretty tone

DJ Doug G,"It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man

Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waist another tear

If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

Tell him to just get out,

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat show him out

Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

If you've reached the end, 
Don't pretend that is right when it's over

(it's over)
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over

(over, over)

Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out:
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough

I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,
But he turns out to be like every other man

Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (tearing us apart)

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough

No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough

To the drama 
Got away from the problem 
To see another hour 
Cuz tomorrow

Many soldiers 
From my country 
Got killed because 
Of power 
In the end it all reflects 
On president obama

Stop treating

And ask for change 
Please wash away 
The pain 
From the homeless 
On the streets 
Sleeping with no heat 
The wealthy don't care 
Because there all 
Controlled by the beast 
They got the marking 
On there flesh 
Scanned by dst 
Not me I'm not weak 
I got my mind 
Occupied on one thing 
And that's wall street 
Please listen to me 
We are all anonymous 
Under one an abolishment 
Snatched for scholarships 
To fight in a war 
Where lives are mourned 
While big brother 
Just sits and applauds 
Like he's court side 
Watching basketball ?!

The story was written by the corrupted who’s only goal is to oppress
If I ain’t believe in jah, put a hole right through their chest
But I'm civilized, focus on breaking into their system
Stacking paper isn’t the goal, it's the intermission
Direct your mind’s energies, not on your enemies
But rather on increasing your charity over centuries
This is meant to warfare with solidarity

Can I follow in your footsteps?

You paved a road that's so divine
Can I follow in your footsteps?

What the future brings
Living day by day

Can I follow in your footsteps?

With an open heart
Knowing deep inside
You left a trail of love behind
Can I follow in your footsteps?

DJ Encore,"The little girl you're looking for
Is no longer here
She's out of reach out of sight
And slowly disappears
Into the dark
And empty night where we used to lay
So while you sleep
I'm whispering goodnight.

'Cause nothing's the same forever
I wish I could change with you

Go on (and) leave me
While you still can go on
Without me
You must understand
That's who I am
So goodnight my love
Now you're on your own.


The little girl
Who used to say
I'll always be here
Has changed her mind
Or woken up
From her
Endless dreaming
In that dark
And empty place
Where we always go
But when today is yesterday
We'll know

That nothing's the same forever
I wish I change with you

I hope you'll feel better
And maybe one day you will see
That we're alone together
Baby don't
Become like me",On Your Own
DJ Encore,"You must be out there 
Every time I've got an hour on my hands I hope you feel me 
Every now and then I understand the fact that you believed me 
How can I go on 
If you don't come along to set me off 
I don't know nothing 
How can I move on when I am half as strong 
Without your strength 
I don't know nothing 
Cause you're not in my world to ease my worries 
And you can't be the one I turn to 
who's gonna watch over me if not you 
Will your memory live on inside me 
Ever since you went away I wondered why the world kept turning 
Every time I think of you I feel the flame that keeps on burning 
How can I go on 
If you don't come along to set me off 
I don't know nothing 
How can I move on when I am half as strong 
Without your strength 
I don't know nothing 
Though you're not in my world to ease my worries 
And you can't be the one I turn to 
you're gonna watch over me I feel you 
Cause your memory lives on inside of me 
You must be out there 
Though you're not in my world to ease my worries 
You must be out there

Tell me 
What you need to know
About the destiny before
Before it fades away
Maybe I could
Try to understand
What you feel inside i know,
You'll make it through someday.

Baby you can walk on water 
Baby you can fly like a bird
You can walk through a fire
Without even getting hurt
Baby you can breathe once again
You can reach the highest mountain
You can do what you want
It's up to you

Baby you can walk on water

Sometimes when I think of you
I feel the magic to the heart
It's all matter of faith

You have to give it time and than

Though I'll never feel this way
I will hold on to this feeling every day

We should never stop this moment
And the feelings will remain
Knowing it will never be the same again
Knowing we will never be the same again

You make me feel alive when you hold me
In your heart and I could be the falling star
In a world you haven't seen

You make me feel alive when you hold me
In my dreams and you could be the falling star
In a world I haven't seen

When I close my eyes I see you
When I reach out I can feel you
Maybe you'll be true enough to hold my hand
Baby you are real enough to understand

You make me feel alive when you hold me
In your heart and I could be the falling star
In a world you haven't seen

You make me feel alive when you hold me
In my dreams and you could be the falling star
In a world I haven't seen

I should have seen where this would go
I know you still will be my star
But now you fade Into my dreams of solitude

You make me feel alive when you hold me
In your heart and I could be the falling star
In a world you haven't seen

You make me feel alive when you hold me
In my dreams and you could be the falling star
In a world I haven't seen

You make me feel alive when you hold me
In your heart and I could be the falling star
In a world you haven't seen

You make me feel alive when you hold me
In my dreams and I could be the falling star
In a world I haven't seen

You make me feel alive when you hold me
In my dreams and I could be the falling star

Watchin' the late show
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own

Autumn winds blowin' outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me
Chase the shadows away
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness
To the break of the day

On end of the rainbow
With a fortune to win

DJ Ensamble,"Here's to us, one more toast and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me, we fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still strivin' for the sky, no taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

It's so strange when you're down and lyin' on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed with nothin' left untried
Standin' calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

DJ Ensamble,"I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

(Don't go sharing your devotion)

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me",Lay All Your Love on Me

About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

Beside the victory
That's her destiny

Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed

I dont know where you from but out here we ride
So if you scared of conflict don't come outside
Get your hands on a gun
Cause ain't no one gonna repspect you as a man if you run, dial 9-1-1
I'm hear talkin' to the street now
That's only gonna lead to bulletwounds and beatdown's, retreat clown
You still strugglin down to your last rock
G-Unit is gorillas and Blackchild's the mascot
You thought you wouldn't hear my voice
I'm in the hood cause I'm hood
You in the hood cause you ain't got no choice
Your top seller gettin' sticked for his shine
Either I'm blind, or Ashanti's sideburns is thicker than mine
I'm youngest in charge with my dick in a dime
Grippin' the nine, sippin' that lime
Becardi in a party, you sorry
I'm blowin' wet green right out the safari
That'll put you in a left lean higher than a marley
And as far as Charlie, a studio hour is a waste
She look like she took a bag of flour in the face
You want street credibility instead of I'ma sting you
C'mon Ja you put a fuckin crackhead on your single

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
What goes up must come down, what goes around comes back around
I suggest you run when you see the pound
Or get laid the fuck out on the ground
What goes up must come down, what goes around comes back around
I suggest you run when you see the pound
Or get laid the fuck out on the ground

My cousin bringin' back them blueberry bags, I've been waiting all day
On them Shelltops that got Jam Master Jay, on 'em
I got a jeanius and kneehighs that swallows me whole
Tongue's longer than the ones on your Fila's
She's buys anything I desire, prolly cause I'm on fire
The 2003 McGwire, until I retire
My neighborhood breed ballers that slam dunk
Cross overed to crack now they can't even jump
I leave with any panties I want, the industries new face
I'm in a bitch mouth every morning like toothpaste
Place your bet, Envy pull out a few crates
I got enough 16's to battle 2 states
I'm in a spaceship, neck full of grey shit
Bigetes in the braclet, expect nothing basic
Respect and embrace it, your sketch in the basement
I'll have them try to find where the rest of your face is

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
The hoes know I'm lazy as hell, that's why I get the bitch to twist
Dogg, I stay around trees like Christmas gifts
Yea, you laughing and dancing 'til they stick you
And have you holdin' your chest like I'm singing the National Anthem
Have your worried bout the reprecussions after the tantrum
I'll be alone in a mansion, and it's snowing in the Hamptons
Regardless of what these fools say, I'ma be around longer than 'Cool J
Armed with a new K
So dumb in a new way, If I don't fuck Monday, I'm gone hit it Tuesday
My charm get it usually
You put a lot of years into rap, these lil' starvin' chumps
Start your career from the back of a milk carton
Your gased up from whatever he must of told ya
But everything in Army fatigues ain't a soldier
In my upbring we wore the same socks
And buckets in the living room to catch the rain drops

Feel me nigga, fuck with us nigga
Whattup?

If it's a gun I don't mind to pull it
Hit your son with the nine millimeter with the rhino bullets
Know S.P.'ll lose your peeps
Come through in a bullshit hoopty with the Gucci seats
With some Brooklyn bitches that'll boost for weeks
So you know I stay fresh for days
Tote the gun in your mouth, tell you death is just a breath away
You alone like The Castaway

Listen dawg, if you ain't pass a dude then you pass away
They ain't tell you that the Ghost was here?
You ain't seen me comin'?
Told your man that the coast was clear
Now I'm tearin' off both your ears
Kick in the door, load the shotty watch the sofa tear
Y'all scarface niggaz, Sosa here
So the army and the coke are here, we loc' out here

They ain't tell you that I Ryde or Die?
Thirty niggaz on your block, only five alive
Shit, they ain't tell you that I'm harder than Brillo
I'ma give your mother the wire, your father the pillow
I don't play too much, I weigh too much
And when it comes to the drugs, I weigh too much
And I don't say too much, I spray too much
Step over the dead body then I blaze the dutch, what? My niggaz

You know what?
I'm takin' over the game 'cause niggaz is lame and everybody's so butt
You know why?
'Cause I feel I could, I Ryde or Die and everyday I'm so high
You know where?
Right in they crib in front of they kids, I feel I gotta go there
You know when?
I ain't tellin' you niggaz so load up your guns or join up in Gold's Gym

I buy back haze just to get me weeded
One cornball nigga just to get me heated
Listen nigga I am not playin'
He gon' know, the .3 gon' blow and he gon' see the shots sprayin'
Wrong end of the barrel
Too bad but I'ma ring your bell like a Christmas carol
If I run out of bullets
The ghost is a sag and I don't ever miss with arrows

Got a old, old soul, I miss the pharaohs
I am too deep for you, street for you
Wanna fuck with S.P. I'll bring the heat to you
Five niggaz holdin' Tec's on a creek for you
Make the whole family weep for you
Too bad that, they was too sad but you was a scumbag
What? And that's why you fuckin' with dickheads
If they drive through the block I'm turnin' the whip red

Y'all better keep shiftin' ahead
'Fore I take your nose off, put your lips in the head
And all the fiends call me the pusher
But if you see my knife work then you call me the butcher
And it ain't no meat I cut
I'm S.P. listen dawg, I run every street I touch
And you oughta come fuck with the ghost
I got butter open your mouth, see if you could fuck with the toast

You know what?
I'm takin' over the game 'cause niggaz is lame and everybody's so butt
You know why?
'Cause I feel I could, I Ryde or Die and everyday I'm so high
You know where?
Right in they crib in front of they kids, I feel I gotta go there

With Princess cut Canaries the size of lemon cough drops

Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you want to hate?)
Why wouldn't I what?

[Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow is all (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The Princesses in my hair, are clear and cut, right?
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get it homes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin' that

[Fabolous]
Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw (uh huh)
And academic sample the laws (uh huh)
Hypnotic samples the poor (woo)
The European sample is all (yeah)
Will on the right side do with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws 
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep kefs jammed in the four
Amp meter draw, end up in a wheelchair rammed by your dog

After a million scanned on it (yeah)
Why wouldn't the Range look like it got 20-inch ceiling fans on it (woo)
Only reason you in my face ma'am
Is cause i got the same mic/mike stat Jordan had on the ""Space Jam""

[Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I chase chips
Come through Aves, like ""Pluto Nash"" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous 
Watch with flawless rocks, invisible placement

[Fabolous]
Uh, I oughta feel like a boss (uh huh)
Why wouldn't I get a 100 an appearance, quarter mil a endorse
I oughta feel some remorse

[Paul Cain]
Yeah, I know when you see us, it be pissin' you off
Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft 
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior

Jet skies, and speed boats docked up in Barbados

The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 1: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
Uh, you remind me of hard liquor
Feel like I overdosed on hard liquor
Now you got a G leanin (Jodeci)

Is are Dot, the fresh and the flyest (Yeah)
The thighs in that dress could start a riot
{UH OHH!} It's the lovin like that
Like a round-trip flight, I be comin right back (Right back)
Shakedown got me thuggin like that (Like that)
All night, I'm out chasin that trap
It's like every thug's dream
To have a down chick or a thug a** queen
Face in the pillow, a** in the arch
Legs done had a divorce, they split apart (Split apart)
I do it slow, til you scream (Do it faster)
Red Cafe, I'm back the Trackmaster

[Verse 2: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
It might be wrong but it feel so right, yes yes this is life
Love is so hood you could bottle that stuff
If it wasn't Cafe I would gobble it up
Yep! No longer thinkin 'bout them R&B girls
Like, Ciara (Uh Uh) Nivea (Who that?) Teairra (Nah) Olivia (Whatever!)
All them names seem trivia
You look mean in them painted paints, do that dance, do that dance
I ain't no backyard n****
But my workout plan will make your backyard bigger
{I like} To see you in my favorite jeans
{And I like} The way you don't hold your screams
{I like} The way you make your body rock
And you ain't scared to lick the lollipop

[Chorus: Nina Sky]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
OK! OK! I know you like the finer things
Designer names like Vera Wang
Necklesses and diamond rings
Bling blaow shirts with the shiney things
You could get all that plus a rover
Put my chain on the arm give you the cold shoulder
And the hood respect it man
I bring the pain that's the Method Man
What's 'gon top that? Who 'gon knock that?
We a tag team girl they can't stop that
The world feelin your fella, on the road to the riches let's get it together

[Verse 4: Nina Sky]
I see you sippin slowly (Slowly) I can tell you want me (You want me)
Like that drink so tasty, there's no need for chasin, no no no

Steady breakin' me on down, break break down,
Steady breakin' me on down,
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down,
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down.

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me,
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was o.k
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

[Chorus]
Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

It'll break you down
Only if you let it

Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it
Forget it (forget it)

I be feelin' like you bringing me down
Taking me around
Stressin' me out
I think i better go and get out
And let me release some stress (stress)

Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain)
Hoping for the sun
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)
Lord, I just wanna maintain

Yeah, I can feel pressures y'all

Stupid retarded crib, and all my whips clean
Rocking some Jays that don’t come out 'til 2015
I’m moonwalking bitch, yeah I’m Michael Jackson Thriller fresh
Slipped inside the Mirror, saw a pimp nigga in the flesh
Spray some Polo cologne, to match my Polo socks
Now Coke bottle bitches, make your soda pop
And drop it like I ain't ever seen you drop it before ho
Drop it for a legend or this DTP logo
Drop it for a little free marketing and promo

So many to choose from, I can’t make up my mind
But whoever I pick better get up on the dick real quick, don’t waste my time
'Cause I got shit to do, so I’m just bout to smash
Soon as I’m through with you, back to counting this cash
I’m hung low to all these women, I’m their antidote
And when they on my dick look like they riding a banana boat
But on they period, I don’t want them mislead
So it’s a sign by my bed that say “No turn on red”
Treating women like spades, I’m so unstoppable
Just tying to leave the club with 'bout 3 and I’m possible

In a foreign whip with a foreign bitch

Bitch don't kill my vibe, ho don't kill my buzz
Bitch I'm so fresh and clean but my cup is full of mud
If she not fucking she gotta go
One monkey won't stop the show
I'm backstage with a flock of hoes

Pull up on yo baby momma, she treat my dick like a flute
Juicy J kilin' the game, go ahead and buy you a suit

And this? Givenchy
My shirt covered in all stars
And y’all wasn’t wearing gold watches
‘Til you seen us wearing gold watches
And you may have a hit bitch
But this one out the ball park
And oh! Lawnmower, just for the snake boys
Shoot your ass into pieces, man
And deliver it to your front door
Oh! Encore, they want more, they’re fans now
Got your girl ass clapping, hands down
Don’t approach me with your hands out
Sittin’ down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
It’s me, and I’m cool with it
You don’t know what to do with yourself
When I do it, I’m doing it fresh
Born to do it, so I do it to death
Calm in the steps, welcome my dawgs
We don’t get along, I’m tellin’ ‘em fetch
Hit ‘em like “PA!” Hit ‘em like “PA!”
Shoot up the spot and I’m leavin’ like “Ah!”
Okay, you know I started from scratch
I got to the strip club just to relax
I get a flat tire, I buy a new car
You know what time it is, check the Rolex

If you keep whining, baby, you gon’ lose me
Better choose me, baby, come choose me
So fine that I let the girl use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually (turn up, turn up)

Woke up on the beach with a bag of bud (damn)

Pause. Take a breath and go for yours
On my command
Now hit the dance floor
It's gonna make you sweat till you bleed
Is that dope enough indeed
I paid the price to control the dice
I'm more precise to the point I'm nice
Let the music take control of your heart and soul
Unfold, your body is free and behold
Dance till you can't dance, till you can't dance no more
Get off the floor and get a blow
Then come back and upside down
Easy now let me see you move
Next in line groove, work me all night
The music is my life
Ev'ry body dance now
Ev'ry body dance now
Ev'ry body dance now

Ev'rybody, come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat

We might be coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do

And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me
Doctor says let them die said his fucking dog bit me
I don't know whats wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turning into murderers
Couldn't fuck with a third of us
Still against me

Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.
Leave you Red like Foxx
Ain't nothing funny about that

You thinking it's alright 
But it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Giving niggas facelifts and taking it
While making you bleed
And if I got a taste of the shit I'm taking more than you need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up wrap his body up in a area rug
Who holding the heat?
Who leaving niggas cold in the street?
Y'all know me, ya Co-D, Ja-Rule the O.G.
Niggas better watch me closely
Get a grip, it's hennessy that fuels all that murderin' shit
When I look in the mirror my reflection is killer

Look up to the cross 
Stranded in the land of the lost 
Standin up, I'm sideways 
I'm blazin' up the path 
Runnin on the highways of rap 
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal 
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode 
I'm Dashin all the meteor strikes 
Keep the media dykes 
As re-enforcements for the fight 
And that alone with keep John Ghotti on the phone 
Tangled in his own I got the bees on the track 
Where the fuck you at? 
Tical
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now 
Shut the fuck up!
I'm pluggin in them social skills 
That keep my total bills over a million 
The last time I checked it 
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it 
Wait until the second round, I'll knock him out 

They call me big John stud 
My middle name mud 
Dirty water flow 
Too much for you thugs 
That can't stand the flood 
What up doc? 
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd 
The sure shot 
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged

Temperature's too hot for sunblock 
Burn 
Playin with minds can get you state time 
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind 
Killa bees in the club when there's ladybug 
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug 
Love is love all day 'til they both slug 
And take another life in cold blood 
Can't feel me? 
Cause it's your blood 
Murder is tremendous 
Crime is endless 
Same shit different day 
Father forgive us 
They know not what they do 
Our praises do

Why risk it

Knocked out their front teethes

Roll on the check 
Kick a hole in the speaker 
Pull the plug and inject 

Mic check 
So what's it all about? 
Where we gonna run? 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
Limpin on the track with Method 
So get the sunblock 
You get your one shot 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve around everything you got 
From outta nowhere prepare 
You'll be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone 
But don't you forget you're in the zone 
So shut the fuck up!
And take that shit back 
Cause all your shit's whack 
Doodoo is doodoo

Burnin up your brain like a piston 
So all those who didn't listen 
Never even knew what they were missin 
And never even knew that the sky was fallin down

DJ Godfather,"Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 Nigga (Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, Andre?

Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was ""The Chronic"" (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping two one three (fo life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world

And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

DJ Green Lantern,"Good morning
Haha, wake your mother fucking asses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my roof bitch!

For whatever it's worth it's worth me having my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
I just can't get past these little peasants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Hawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't crap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having a slapping
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
'Cause I'm telling you right now your not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit be	
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?

[Chorus]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an
Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
So have sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know 'em motherfucking join in
Everybody come on an


Its in the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popping slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a Holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit,
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathing
You die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefing free when
You niggas need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a boutique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

[Chorus]

Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
'What the fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seeing them white I empty out them white to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!""
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life

I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off-a the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shooting them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on moving key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you selling is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you coming

DJ Green Lantern,"Hit him up two times
Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out
I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot
So far.. how many mother fuckers do you think I got?

When the lights go off pimp, the sharks come out
Thangs bang out, bust till ya brains hang out
Come to your house, sitting on your porch where ya live
Waiting till ya come back to the crib

We started off as the best of friends 
No intention of falling in love again 
He held me there in my time of need 
My heart was set free 
What a sweet memory

The day I fell in love 
It was so beautiful 
His hands, his tender touch 
I remember the day in September 
When we fell in love 

It was an unexpected night 
The sun was somewhere, but out of sight 
So familiar, yet unexplored and new 
We surrendered to our love in bloom

The warmth of your touch

Yo, last night I had a dream it had me open like a fiend
And all I remember is me, you, the moon and ocean breeze
My heartbeat increased like I seen approachin D's
I relapsed cause of these words you spoke to me

You said you want to feel me - inside you - conceal me
I belong to you no other woman could steal me
We mentally attached, essential in fact
What you give is so real you know I had to give it back

How I feel don't even matter if I ain't expressin (affection)
My mind was affected you healed me (we destined)
Your beauty so addictive, I can't deny your presence
So pure I gotta add cut to spread you on

You're all I need in this world to succeed

I'll never leave or deceive you, and if it's understood

All I need is you - I'll be there, when you need me to be..

When I was runnin the street I know you wanted to leave
Especially the time, you found a nine in my jeans
But you persevered, gave work and tears

I used to keep feelings concealed, now I reveal 'em
I was hustlin to get right, now we chillin
Oh my man starin at ceiling thinkin of children
And any other situation we might deal with

At first, I was hesitatin, makin a commitment
Now I see you different - so many ways
I need a queen like a king did in great Egyptian days
And it seems you've been afraid I might get into things

That might put me away for years, save your fears
Listen ma, let's get one thing clear
I'll never leave you, deceive you, and if it's understood
We can be together cause you treat a nigga good

Yo, I'm not the type to have a next chick call on your phone
Come see you at night and in the morning you alone
I keep it real with you, like my connect you got it good
I need to deal with you, have yet to leave the hood

But I'm still with you everytime you need me I'm there for you
If I didn't care for you why would I be here for you?
You 'pear loyal, got the kid spoiled
On the low I don't think I was prepared for you

You cook good, look good, Boo I adore you
And if you get me mad we won't fight I'll ignore you (yeah right)
Just playin, but yo I'm just sayin
I'm about to go, cause Hi-Tek waitin
Yo son that beat ready?

And guns is rusty
I'm stingy with trust, you only get once to fuck me
The pure white endorser, skills real like a Porsche
For the cash I'm there like a stalker, uhh

You say the same shit
I play the game with skills like Latrell, and write so well
And I gotta go to heaven cause my life is hell
If I quit rap, this cook white gon' sell

You niggaz got fat while I did time in jail
Now it's time to pay, the rhymes you say
Sound a lot like mine, but not quite as ill
As my rhymin skill, I could relate to how Tyson feel

Of somebody else life, or shit you imagined

Due to that I'm technical, TKO's I got those
I got control but I'm wreckless in studios
I got Harmony and Thug tendencies all in my Bones
No need to be flashy, for heads to recognize me
Hi-Tek throw them joints that magnetize me
We global, East, West, North, South, we robo
Hands that touch mic's get smacked 'cause that's a no-no
Who rock the mic? Yo, we take the whole show
When heads hear this piece they call off with no shows

I struggle more in tug-of-war, writin rhymes by the score
Before I lived the hustle, swore this poor man would give the law
As a testament it goes, it was destined in my soul
They tested but questioned weapons rest in my foes
Blessed in my flows and obsessed with my scrolls
Midas Touch as it's told, writin nuttin less than gold
My journeys, I march through madness like atorneys
Send you out on a gerdy talkin 'bout yo' eternity
Can't stand it, search for your wind like Ban Enti
One man band on the MP and a nigga ran simply
Hi-Tek, all these other niggas can exempt me
Say he's the nicest out loud and gently
Have it your way, a freestyle mean no pay
If you sign a wack contract that mean.. (no weight)
Got your John Hancock on the paper to say
""The band locked and don't know, dough flow your way"" {x4}

[Main Flo]
Woes out my treasure box, seven locks, pressure to plot
Measurin blocks, releasin this live like Desert Fox
Hear spiritual, remain plentiful, same generals
Train criminals to get the most plus the minimals
Rob past, raw cash, facin the God last
Spot grabs, sure pop laugh, jump out of stock caps
For cop cash, watch taps, eyes on my top hat
Flop fast, stock crash, how when I drop math?
This rare rap, air vac', exit and fair fact
We share packs, stare back, cover our bear tracks
Ya peeps move, each choose, jump in our Jeep smooth
Unleash two and leak fumes, studyin Hebrew

Talib Kweli-Verse 1:

It's a funky sen-sa-tion ain't it?
I'm havin a conversation wit'cho imagination
It was explainin how you was waitin, for somethin amazin
Like when it come out you out the door racin to the store (*zoom*)
It took a lot of perse-verance and patience
We was preparin for our place among the ancients
Yo basically yo' take on me ain't makin me
or breakin me and yo I hate to see a fake MC
I take out all my competition from like A to Z
Cause I get fly more frequently than a travel agency
That's what I'm made to be, hip-hop through my artery
An important part of me the soundtrack to my oddysey
It got me, rockin retardedly
Pardon me for speakin incorrect politically
Anything less would be me speakin hypocritically, and I don't do dat
You lingerie MC's I see through that
I make a point about you and your crew, go ""Tru dat""
Who dat? It's the Reflection
Remember the name, slid in the game before the ""2000 Season"" came
Breakin the chain, usin the pain as our ammunition
to blast Babylonian towers out of position
It's the Reflection and we poppin like your ears on a plane
We make you disappear like tears in the rain
The fears in your brain is clear when I appear on the terrain
and bloody your nose
I got more lines than co-CAINE that's why you sniffin' around
We diggin' for different sounds to keep it hittin'
Straight up the only way we gettin' down with the sound is provacative
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
You got a issue with that then it ain't my problem kid
Y'all niggaz gotta eat, we gotta live, yo

Talib Kweli-Verse 2:

We remain, hotter than the blue part of the flame
I got a glock in my brain
that baffle weapons inspections like Saddam Hussein
and rocks with the impact
Gettin beat with socks filled with ten-packs of tokens
Men's backs get broken when I get open
Words more than spoken
Most of dem MC's on the first thing smokin
Leavin town at the same time causin traffic on the interstate
We stay droppin classics cause the key word is innovate
These cats is so plastic that we call 'em laminated
Tried to duplicate the style quickly got frustrated
More desperate than dudes who search people's ashtrays for clips
I burn MC's like Coca-Cola through the paint on your whip
Shit! My rhymes is like a magnifyin glass
When I shine my light through it, I burn up everything in my path
Last Dragon like Lee-roy (sho' nuff) rock for the b-boy
My rhymes are so sharp you catch cuts that key-loid
Destroyed the decoy, most of y'all d-boy, my culture
It's not that I hate, y'all just p-noid cause y'all fake
Embarassed and ashamed and don't know where to put the blame
And never hesitate to call out my name!
I ain't effected by the negative
It's the Reflection and we dealin with the positive
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
It's the Reflection kid
Never gotta look between the lines to get the messages
You're too sensitive, checkin out our references
The turntable and microphone specialist
It's the Reflection kid, it's the Reflection kid
It's the Reflection kid, like that like that

[Verse One]
Free the rhyme or risk a dig into a deep sound abyss
Unit in the stash the beats and never found the shit
Experience like Hendrix, keep my sound enriched
Cats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch
In my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it
I'ma give it, as far as you can take it
Tried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny
Many can find it but few can climb it
I'm open-minded like a pothead
Doin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed
In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls
Worn hoes, who been molested by they uncle
I bundle, amongst you cold mother-uckers
The world is bitter, like baby mothers
Look how far El Dorados and wine bottles drug us
Least God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God

Everywhere is broken glass
Nephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass
Try not to say shoot around my daughter she already know to blast
Catchin the future, don't know who threw the past
It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon
Niggaz is fake like bitches braggin
Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion
In motion like cars
I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars
The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours
Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies
Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me
(.. from a distance) niggaz tried to appraise me
I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me
My days be spent, behind dream's tent
Through the sun the divine being is sent
It's the Sun God

Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion

Specifically the ones who forgot where they come from
So it's the light that they run from like roaches
Whenever the truth approaches
I attack the track ferocious, never lose my focus
Hold this true hip-hop, closest to my heart, and you know this
Nowadays it's hopeless and my diagnosis
Is to grab the microphone and be the dopest, you can quote this
Niggaz sound like they injected with collagen
You followin these hollow men no honor when 
You bite off more than you could chew or could be swallowin

And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
She's awfully hot, asshole burning like Tabasco
She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go
Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right
Infatuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein
Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain
The monkey on her back is now a gorilla
Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's goin' kill her
The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman
Destroying her pretty image and her health
Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?
I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching

Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by
So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle
Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel
Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback
The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack
A regular John, she met her through Tom
She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind
From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind
Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS
Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days
Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around
With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases
Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus
But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners

Trying to make some quick cash for a hit of that stash
Listen, baby, you growing up much too fast
Uh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto
For those getting high, using drugs on every level
Living your life, day and night, getting stoned
You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?

Had to open doors no time for broads I was scopin' crack
Baggin like a newborn, barely profit beef pop off
We carry Tommy guns and smoke trees and grab pockets
Pilgrimage life, real like with no money and no white

Livin' by the sword, a hundred niggaz daily
Who get on board and kill for some proper live on them acres board

INTRO 

What's up  world? 

Goin' give you a little love right here 

My man  DJ Honda blessed us with a joint 

Word up  De La up in here  ha 

We goin' to spread a little love 

To some folks who up in my hair right now 

Ah'ight? Check it out 

Verse One 

It was a big deal moving my big wheel to L.I. 

Had a back yard  tho' shit moved slow 

Caught a cat on the humble  wassup  wassup  kid? 

Ya'll be memorizin' flicks of the wild things we did 

We was brick-ball niggas, six small niggas 

And they knew it, and wasn't no-body runnin' through us 

Steppin' in the backyard parties was a blast 

Fucking up our sneakers on the wet grass 

Remember getting stabbed in ya ass? 

Your Moms sat us all down 

Said we was niggas and clowns but it was just love 

And plus love showed me that she was a diamond 

Findin' out God, took a hit me dead on my heart 

And made the eye water start 

But you was strong, can ya hear me Huggy? 

Keep your mind crystal clear when your thought gets muggy 

We them easy street kids from Mr. Bryant's basement 

Wishin' for the Apollo, tryin' to get dough 

Now my time moves slow, ain't it all full circle? 

A dove cry makes the whole scene turn purple 

Remember that night you had to hide in the freezer? 

For real, see them kids were real, we still ?slear? 

But now we grown niggas, and we handling kids 

We been since day one, and the days ain't over 

Gotta share a back seat, push with the chauffer 

My Pops said he's waiting for your ass in the zone 

So we can fly to the land, and welcome you home 

Rob-O see we good to go, you know the rest... 

Don't stress, love-love baby. Ah'ight? 

Chorus 

If you got time to give, I got time to think 

See, it could all change in one eye blink 

While you in the trouble water I hope ya don't sink 

Don't sink, don't sink, don't sink 

Verse Two 

Check it out 

Some rarely saw the negative cause 

From the depths of one's blurred everything's now 

Cleared by laws 

Mad for mere seconds, in the span of dying 

Trying to tell you don't go, I'm about to blow 

No mo' innocence, it's about the dollars 

And events of fame 

Aren't you? Search your name 

From the group? Search your name 

On the dotted line, back before the rhyme I had reasons 

To punch the kid who tried teasin' during lunch 

It was a matter of pro-mo-ting de-cen-cy 

But the 'de' and the 'cy' fell off, so I sinned 

Again and again, until Jesus came down 

Wait, I'm still sinning! I guess he hasn't reached the ground! 

Thoughts of me, before my voice could 

Even recall, couldn't afford the physical peep 

How then was now, but now is not 

Yo, I'm a minute wiser but it seems, kid 

I got some beef, can't take or shake off the wrong 

Accept my apologies to Bob, pass the horn! 

No need for false alarm 

Word up! 

The Nuyopian charm is for show back again 

It's rememberin' the was that is now gone 

For the access of the now so I can move on 

For the access of the now so I, so I

We gon' bring justice to the game
(That's how we gon' put it down)

That's the sound of the man, cockin' that thang, that thang
That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang, thang
Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya

Say a prayer for me if you care for me 'cause I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it

Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot this
Say I'm skinny now, but I look big in the coupe-dee
My cuzin' Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans

I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh, you the black hand of death
Then why your name ain't preacher

If you a pimp like kid, why them hoes don't treat ya
If you wanna ball like Kirk
Now shorty let me teach ya
This flow's God sent, it's bound to reach ya

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

They say you can never repay the price for takin' a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit fifty
Blaaat, y'all niggas can't bang wit fifty

Say I'm born to rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
Face stone and the cross, there's a bitch I tossed
See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check CNN for the, 'War Report'

See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I do it myself, I don't need no help

Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young
Niggas jumped me 'cause they couldn't beat me one-on-one

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cause pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass

I got, ""God Understand Me"" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'ma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say, ""'Sup up, niggas get ready to duck""

My heart is a house homie, fear don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings

See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'ma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems

It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys? 
They only talk to her, because, 
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay? 
I mean, her butt, is just so big 
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha 
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me 
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin' 
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet, 
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (Yeah) Fellas (Yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (Shake it) Shake it (Shake it)
Shake that healthy butt

I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double

Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (yeah) Ladies (yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back

Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' 
To do with my selection 
Thirty six-twenty four- thirty six  
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role 
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

When my niggaz comin through you see we comin correct
Who are you, what you do, who you tryin to threat?

I'm the wrong cat to call out; we fall out
The police gon' have some dead bodies to haul out
All out in the open for the world to see
Avire-x to the z-I, be-I-t
V.i.p., you're small time, three on three
Cause you can't ball accurately, tackle the beast
Stomp it down, slap it with heat, bitch behave
Shit, we blaze to make a nigga act his age
I'm tryin to write the phrase that pays
You kick it with gays, dykes, and all type of wackness
Preach what you practice
Here we separate the real niggaz from the actors
A&r's, mc searchin, suck my cactus!
Blackness surround your sight and sound
As xzibit hit you and you hit the ground
My chips ain't never gon' be down, watch me smoke
And flatline the first nigga to cross this line

It's the gipp goodie, we kick the soul slang
To yo' block, or they streets, we all gon' hang
We like to shine and ride, bump corners in our bumper cars
Top down, with the candy paint job
Import export up and down the highway
Old ladies transportin straight through the skyways
In the corner in the five(? ) I got purple haze
Fat knot short sess with the tree ton(? )
These streets we run, rapper refund
You ridin up but we want yo' flows old like girbauds
We hold, everything it takes to create the odes
To north to the west to the south again
If it's war that you want just pull the pin
Rules we don't break 'em, we refuse to bend
If you don't build right you better take yo' ass home
Cause some catch stray bullets all alone

Styles, multiply like japanese mathematicians
Cut cause chaos - my kicks kill criminals
I'm the subliminal adolf
I'm the bomb that's attached to the time of a ticker
Figure or swastika
Quicker to pick a form of execution, pull it
Bullet, to the head instead of eletrocution

Totally insane, hurricane with pharoahe monch, gipp

DJ Hurricane,"Yo believe I paid the dues man I started in the game
With mans on linden and Devan we drinking ghetto champagne
Slinging rocks and packing glock's on the blocks
It's early in the morning I'm selling tumbs from my Reebok

Tres nicks and dimes I write rhymes
But the ghetto times they got the cheeks doing crimes
The street life yeah that's the only life I know
Where niggas sling rocks bust shots and push yeah yo

Sit on crates keep their backs against gates
Every man is insane he's got a brain like Norman bates
Timberland boots ski hats we pack gat's
Carry across town because we tapping Niggers Hoodrats

But they don't want the fam
See a south side Jamaica queen fellas get down man
Listen so what your crew is x-rated
Peoples if you violate you getting violated

[Chorus]
Come on and keep it real; this is saying
that the lost boy and group home fam want it all what would you do
And if you feel that you'se a real soldier from the street
throw your hand in the air we salute you
Bounce it up town bounce it down south
Bounce bounce it up town bounce it down south

I had a messed up childhood the head is mad nappy
I need money in a snap gee kid I'm trying to blow like papi
Fat cat the street life is where it's at
Peeling caps so yo we got to stay strapped

Terrified cause the crew from the south side is bustin
No question
I keep my hear in braids taliq got dreads
Hangin out in the reds wearing levis and pro-keds

Pouring beer on the curb for the dead
I had to bring drama to some powder head
(Freaky TAH) hey yo cut the music down
Yo half the world thought the album failed in this 94 and its on..

I'm smoking weed in 96' with my peeps
Jetting from the police cause police they'se a bunch of creeps
I'm testing off the new burners in the park
We sleep during the day and creep when it's dark

I once had to cry when I seen Tyrone die
This black on black crime I cram to understand why
Baby girls having kids in their teens
Young fellows baggy jeans slinging crack to the crack fiends

That's the type of lifestyle that I lead
With my fams on the corner drinking beers and smoking weed
Yo believe I been through all the struggles and the pain
I'm ripping out my hairs and I can't get to my brain

I want the gold teeth and chains
I hustle with timberland boots and rainsuits when it rains.
Fools make your moves pay dues
Give up your cheese you loose my baby boy need shoes

Stepping to the CHEEKS you made an error
You been to the ?house of pain? now welcome to my yard of terror
What you think I'm some sucka
Word to him I stomp you out with my tim chukkas

Who who you stepping to the lost boy crew
Boy get stomped that ass is through

[Chorus]
See we live the street life
Smoking blunts with the wife stay on point like a ....
Every day on rockaway is getting hotta
I can't do what a want to I do what I gotta

Survive I might not be around in 95
See I was taught young to be strong and just strive
So nowadays we packing guns
We racking grimy hills for funds and I stash all my sons mons

A little man to look after
Taking rap as a joke but I see no laughter
To man Charles Suitte and big tig in Atlanta and Va.....

Turn the lights down low and the speakers up high
Feel the energy that we bringing inside
Doin it right, ridin all night
Payin the price, livin the lives

Take it from me, in this business it ain't unusual to lose your soul
So I zone and put the microphone on cruise control
To let my hands be free
I shape and mold the energy in the room like pottery

Methodically in tune is probably how I be
I walk with God most cats is children of a lesser
On the face of earth they like swords that fester
When they get a little light these snakes be acting all extra

With congratulations that be mad fake like vester
If it's a scam they the investor
A lot of ??? like professor
I make sure my words stay honorable like ??Rob Vinesta??

So true heads is glad I'm hear giving lyrics out the stratosphere
Giving birth, my cipher stay pregnant with ideas, so push
Ever since way back in Ethopia it's known as cush
To the now how we roll through flatbush

We civilized most people in my state is kill or die
Still I rise real hip-hop is still alive

[Chorus: x2]

Most of these rap goons, they suck like vacuums
I rhyme great they stuck on primate like baboons
They steady coming lazier than Sunday afternoon
Make me want to turn that shit off and cool out to jazz tunes

But I'm back soon, resurrecting hip-hop is my dream
So you can get the whole picture like a wide screen
Sometimes the road is dark so I flash my high beams
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen

You see these weak in the knee emcees speaking to me
Like they freakin the beat, seeking to be in my company
When in actuality they leaves on the tree compared to me
I'm basically the square root of what they reaching to be

But you can't now can you, I pay my dues on the annual basis
How to lace it I wrote a manual face it
You small like granules and on that fake shit
We keep it down to earth well why'all act like you on spaceships

Whiter then veneers
Allergic to broke (broke)
Determined to blow (blow)
On the boat we hit the working detergent and soap
We ship it from Haiti
Baby I'm whipping them baby's
Let it dry later try to whip a Mercedes

You gotta push it to the limit
If you wanna be paid

We started minute
The money matured
My money secured
I got bunnies in Europe
My bubbles be pure
Cost like a hundred a pour
The world is yours
Hundred million and more
Now I run the streets (Ross)
They all mine (Ross)
Twelve years over due
Call it two time
I told you never roll on the soul of a soldier 
You never know that dishwasher may be a beholder
Who ever thought that fat girl would grow into Oprah 
Or that boy Rick Ross would be moldin' the culture
I push and I push (Push)

We push and we push (Push)

Middle Passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denyin' history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their niggas be beaten viciously
Battle in the wilderness of North America
Ran by the river, only stoppin' to pray
Chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom
For their protection deserve neither
Fuck a name, fuck tradition
Religion, you learn Jesus
Turn the other cheek
Inherit the Earth, just stay meek
Fuck the way you speak
Try to walk, we chop off your feet

Beef is not what Jay said to Nas
Beef is when workin' niggas can't find jobs
So they tryna find niggas to rob
Tryna find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack kids can't find moms
Cause they end up inna pine box or locked behind bars
Beef ain't the Summer Jam for Hot 97
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef don't come with a radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin' you ""defendant""
Beef, it comes with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit
Talkin' bout ""I'm pregnant by some other nigga""
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need a loan for your home and you're too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doin' is gettin' bigger
You tryin' not to raise 'em around these wild niggas
Beef is when a gold digger got ya seat and a
A manicured hand out like ""pay me nigga""
Or I'm tellin' your wife
Or startin' up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangster ain't doin' it right
Another gangster then decided what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight
Yeah, beef is not what Ja said to 50
Beef is more than Irv not bein' here with me
When a soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is tryin' to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what y'all call beef is not beef at all
Beef is real life happenin' everyday
And it's realer than them songs that you get at Kay Slay

So niggaz no competition with the clear mos definition

Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay

Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a younging, before the days of thugging
How me and Charlie Chims (hey yo what?) I'm only bugging
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sitting roadside, that ain't harder to plan
I'm out here for my fam doing all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cause we grown to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp!) we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes

Settled by the judge many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go

Good morning Vietnam!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up)
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the Jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbing it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shout out ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representing it
Sitting on they front stoop sipping Guinesses
Using native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenements
To the Mom & Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm
From ""sun"" to the ? to the Lafayette Gardens
White ""coff guawinas"" in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya goin wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my ""yarda trenny"" Brown's Village
Parkside tenants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starite City gettin busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playing loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown strongly!
Raise it up!

Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jam is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustling you can't relax
The crack babies trying to find where they mama's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stomping grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that
Be blazing charm that have your wave cap floating back
The doorstep where the dispossessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave selling zovarax
You big balling better keep your money folded back
Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black

DJ Ideal,"Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

Our Taj Mahal, our monument

Now, this would seem to be clear common sense
But, cats be livin' off, sheer confidence
Like ""F*** that, picture them tellin' me run that""
But acting invincible, just ain't sensible
It's nineteen ninety-now, and there's certain individuals
Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle
5 star general, flashin' on your revenue
You takin' a ride on the Downstate medical, Like (whooooooo)
Colorful sparks, yellow and blue
A fool on attack and it's happening to you
Wit' nothing you can do but bust back and cop a plea
But five of them and one of you, that equals Got to me...

Don't get mad
Don't get mad
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get mad (repeat 3x)

Come on ya'll now, let's be real
Some jokers got a rough time keepin' it concealed
I wonder what it mean, it's probably self-esteem
They fiendin to be seen, get hemmed like Gaberdeens
Cats think it can't happen until the gats start clappin
They comin' down the wire spittin fire like a dragon
Cause while the goods glisten, certain eyes take position
To observe your trick, and then catch that a** slippin'
Like, come on now ock, what you expect?
Got a month's paycheck danglin' off your neck
And while you Cristal sippin', they rubbin' up they mittens
With heat in mint condition to start the getti-gettin'
They clique starts creepin' like Sandinistin guerrillas
You screamin' playa haters, these n****s is playa killers
Mr. Fash-ion, that style never last long
The harder you flash, the harder you get flashed on
There's hunger in the street that is hard to defeat
Many steal for sport, but more steal to eat
Cat's heavy at the weigh-in, and he's playin' for keeps
Don't sleep, they'll roll up in your pa**engers seat
There is universal law, whether rich or poor
Some say life's a game, to more, life is war
So put them egos to the side and get off them head-trips
'Fore some cats pull out them heaters and make you head-less...

Don't get mad
Don't get mad

They say
People come from far far far away
To find their dreams
Chasin' down these meteors and comets called dreams
(Chasin' em chasin' em chasin' em)
In the sky of life
In certain hotspots where these meteors and stars have a tendency to fall
And legend has it
That California is one of those spots
I believe that to be true

They say
This the place where stars are born

This is the place where angels come play

That this is the place where it all can happen
For you, for you, for you, for you
California, knows how to make dreams seem so sweet
California, knows how to whisper in your ear and tell you
You're a star, you're a star, you're a star, you're a star
And you keep on staring
Pretty girls by the ocean side
Softly refuse to shine
Tasties on your mind

You know the deal
It's just me yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my peoples, Negros and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it one for Charlie Hustle, two for Steady Rock
Three for the fourth coming live, future shock
It's five dimensions, six senses
Seven firmaments of heaven to hell, 8 Million Stories to tell
Nine planets faithfully keep in orbit
With the probable tenth, the universe expands length
The body of my text posses extra strength
Power-lifting powerless up, out of this, towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop past all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects, prison-industry complex
Broken glass wall better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom sing
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
But you chain cats get they CHA-POW, who dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like
Sixty-nine billion in the last twenty years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a ki
A five minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear, everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess, Michael Jackson was right, ""You Are Not Alone""
Rock your hardhat black cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whipping motherfuckers ass
You wanna know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
It's mathematics

[Chorus: x2]
""The Mighty Mos Def""
""It's simple mathematics""
""Check it out!""
""I revolve around science""
""What are we talking about here?""

""Do your math"" [Repeat: x2]
""One.. t-t-two.. three, four""
""What are we talking about here?"" 

Yo, it's one universal law but two sides to every story
Three strikes and you be in for life, manditory
Four MC's murdered in the last four years
I ain't trying to be the fifth one, the millennium is here
Yo it's 6 Million Ways to Die, from the seven deadly thrills
Eight-year olds getting found with 9 mill's
It's 10 P.M., where your seeds at? What's the deal
He on the hill puffin krill to keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you gotta find a new ground to get cream
The white unemployment rate, is nearly more than triple for black
So front liners got they gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still living
Join the other five million under state supervision
This is business, no faces just lines and statistics
From your phone, your zip code, to S-S-I digits
The system break man child and women into figures
Two columns for who is, and who ain't niggas
Numbers is hardly real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret:
The million other straws underneath it, it's all mathematics

DJ Ideal,"In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big thangs
Jewels chip, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi
Shot me a glance in that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants
Hot damn
What's your name love, where you came from
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The slims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of
I tried to play it low key but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance she was like, yo I'm leaving now
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up, skanking, winding her waist up
Scene two: my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand big things is in the plans
The brother Big Moon make space for me to move in
Hey, this my man Mos, baby let me introduce
I turn around, say word
It was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Trying to play me for the herb
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feeling
Oh, I'm fine
My name is Mos
I'm Sharice
I heard so much good about you it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey-love ended up sitting directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
We conversated, made a laugh, yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm about to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, how you gon' leave before you dance with me

Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby you know what its like, some brothers don't be coming right
I understand, I'm feeling you, besides
Can I have a dance ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered honey, let's exchange numbers
Scene three: weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Issac
Like, if I don't, if I don't
Showing me that tan line and that tattoo
Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like an Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rocking the P-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever
Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down I'm really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ah damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Moon hit me up, I saw Sharice at the kitty club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up

[Mos Def]
The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like who on top of this?
People was hustling, arguing and bustling
Gangsters of Gotham hardcore hustling
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is picky, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Strength in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living
Is preposterous, stay alive, you play or die, no options
No Batman and Robin, can't tell between
The cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbing, the Shiny Apple
Is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative, rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

So much on my mind that it can't recline
Blasting holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

[Talib Kweli]
Breathing in deep city breaths, sitting on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicating with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be making
You on the wrong side of the track, looking visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plunging to death that's painted by the numbers
With crime unapplied pressure, cats is playing God
But having children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets, swearing you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Getting knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keeping it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Micky and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me AND THE CROWD LEFT ME STRANDED
My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggaz
Actin spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state

Yo, on The Amen, Corner I stood looking at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixing down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to heaven
And hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leavened
Veteran of a cold war It's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listening to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearing down the 'jects creating plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my God how he thought traveling the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

And I was hoping you would creep in

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like
""What is he doing? Oh, what is he doing?""
Cause I keep checking my cell phone
And these missed calls
You texting me like I'm a kill y'all
If you don't get your a** up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
Oh, oh my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin'
And I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing
Girl I got you, girl I got you
She might come and find me, and then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night and then
We always wake up singing the same song

It's 5 o'clock in the morning (yeah)
Conversation got boring (talk to me girl)
You said you're going to bed soon (let’s go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won’t let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (alright)
And I was hoping you would creep in (baby girl goodnight)

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you're going to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)

You ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to
Leave here with one of them
That's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
Iphone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah so by the time I'm at your crib...
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
And you yawning, but I've been drinking all night and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom
Floor to the dresser
Don't want nothing less cause I'm sure you're the best
You're the one, so I let you
That's how you show me love
And when we finish you like ""Damn, babe you woke me up""
I love the way you put it down like it's for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you're going to bed soon

Cause the filth took away my licence
It doesn't get me down and I feel okay
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless

A fella looking dapper, but he's sittin' with a slapper

There was a little old lady, who was walkin' down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called AL fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

DJ Inamasu,"Early in the morning, risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot

Well, life is too short, so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start static I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity

Love is what I got
Within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve
Try and test that you're bound to get served

Love's what I got
Don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that

(That's) why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that

DJ Jamad,"Sitting here, guess I didn' make bail 
Got time and a story to tell 
Started when I was nine years old 
Woke up and daddy was gone 
I started hustling and the couldn't tell me nothing 
Fronting in the hood, trying to be somebody 
My soul was on empty 
I was searching for something 
Tried to be good 
Tried to keep from trouble 
Living too fast 
Trying to make a good hustle 

Sometimes it gets rough 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Times got hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta walk to work 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Wasn' really looking guess I found it 
Five foot three light brown skinned 
Coming from the university 
Lifestyle looking kind of lovely 
Didn't know she had much game 
Down to ride out, even take the train 
Even take her to a poker game 
Top notch fried chicken and sushi 
Tried to be good 
Tried to treat you like a lady 
Tried to be your friend 
Turned out that you were shady 

Sometimes it gets lonely 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times ain't what they seem to be 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times would get the best of me 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Well, tried to be good (I tried, I tried) 
Wanted nothing but to love somebody 
Didn't want to die young 
Steady hustling trying to feed my family 
Too scared to have kids and like daddy did 
'Cause I'm so scared of failing 
Sometimes it gets hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta moan 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta cry a little louder 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta fight the pain 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get a little worried 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get lost out of touch 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I think I pray a little to much 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I get a little scared

I hold on to the feeling
I don't know when I will feel it again
I've become amused by the little things
Seconds of pleasure

Second of pleasure
Life's little treasures

Ooh, girl, it's small talk
A touch so soft
It's watchin' you walk
It's the taste of a sour pop - a lemon drop
It's the last one in the box
It's a kiss in the mornin' sun
A few minutes of fun
Before you have to run
It's all of the little things that you've done
To ease my burden and my confusion

The Love Below?

She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in the coolest moods, clearly woman of the year

She comes back to the cooler side of town
But she lives in my lap

She lives in my lap
Forever my fiance

I'll get the courage one day

Make me want you, make me miss you
Make me wonder where you are, then forget you

We're oh so close, but yet so far

Baby why are you acting like this?
I don't care about any of them
I care about you!
Baby I love you!

You've got me open wide (I love you)

[Verse 1]
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryin' to talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speaker phones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

[Verse 2]
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryin' to and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

[Verse 3]
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggas lives
Like UPN

And I still find new ways to recognize shine
It's like light gets better with age
The way a song sounds better on stage

And rhyme books get better with each page
What before the first bar was written
A first verse was spittin
Before label execs was bullshittin

Before food was bitten, consumed through a nipple
I'm talking about when times were simple
To make a long story short it goes

Port-au-Prince Knoxville Anvan love and the city that never sleeps
From thought to finish I was born just a couple of weeks late
Stayed home longer just to make sure everything was on straight
All systems go cut the umbilical cord

From old earth to new earth Manhattan to turf
For what its worth my mum held me down one deep
Pops was absentee but minds you don't sleep
It took her feelings to raise me lean taught me how to read

By the time I went to school I was in high speed
Ready willing and able jackie taught me how to add with
Dried up black eyed peas on the kitchen table
And coming home to a mothers love and good care

Never wanted it was always enough
But when it came to education its like she had one rule 
There's no such thing as too much school
Not to mention lean taught me how to play the piano and then

Every summer I was out in south ben
Grandpops a bartender at a country club
Me and my cousins from grand rapid was living it up
Me and granny watching ??? football golden blue

She said you can't beat the team and them be	's too
Some say I got my sense of humour from her
And I learned patience from making models in the basement
Brookyn, new york to wherever you at

This is autobiographical taking you back
With no time for refrains I barely got enough time to explain
How hip hop captivated my brain
My mama raised me on soul and beethoven

Sports clubs from private school put me up on soft rock
That was cool but I left Z100 and WGLJ
To find bliss with real s and kiss
Video music rocks showed my what time it is

Wrote my first rhymes as corey but j-live was sparked
Making pause mix demos with my main man mark
Playing ball in the park, there was other heads too
I was the herb of the crew, then I learned what to do

Got my way from school started battling fools
G nice my friendly rival at the lunch table
He started spark at a dark with damian and I date
I was down for a bit but that was just a DJ

Starting spinning in the PJs with satcho and them
Back and forth from the tables to the pad and the pen
Then I had to do a bit upstate but wait
I wasn't incarcerated but college educated

As soon the Albany I was a full time student part time emcee
At the time raw shack was the place to be
Living on judge Clark
Started building with gods

16 man squad
By the time knowledge was 120 we was just 5 deep
I went from Mecca to Albany a student and landed in medina as a teacher
I had this rhyme reacher

We recognized what what's happening
I'm making records and I'm winning
But that's another story and it's only the beginning

A roll big flow, shows out in Kosovo
Between flows and chasing them hoes
I make the crowd get down like its supposed to go
Get down year round glad to see y'all came
In the summertime banging at the b-ball came
In the wintertime kickin rhymes up at my block
With an L in one hand and a cup of hot chocolate
A man for all seasons damn I'm raw even

Ice cold Colt 45, not Corona
Get down see me on the prowl now I'm gonna
Holla at this fine young girl named Sherona
See, morons stalk, I walk right up on her
And make her heart race like the Dodge Daytona
Tired of the neighborhood guys “hey hold up”
How's she get that good lovin feeling when I show up
Down and ride wit me, don't forget me when you blow up
How you gonna walk away from this, sis slow up
The head games is over ma I'm for real
Your ain't Oprah and I'm not Dr.Phil

It don't pay to stay away from mysterious guys
That get the girls on the floor and keep the party alive, cause yo…..

That nigga that got all y'all waitin
To get off the wall and get the bar room shakin
I came to but the party under a rest
And if they like it in the hood, let it pump in the jets

Who am I to judge the man with the needle in his veins
When he's just chasing freedom to escape the pain
Of the worlds fast paced pipe dreams and shortcomings
He's just trying to make do and find a way out of nothing

And it's a very thin line between respect and being broke

And always always pulled over
Facing police brutality
Why is every street a living hell
Probably cause they want us to fail
Yeah three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slave ships when they sail

[Verse 2]
Years and years of civil rights chasing to pass that bill
But ask yourself people have we changed or are we standing still
Down and out struggling
In this concrete jungle

One check away from starvation, poverty
But they say being free is about speaking your mind
Prophesise too much and that's where they draw the line
A line as thin as the line between war and peace
A line as thin as the line between west and east

[Chorus]

One button away from world war III
Being called a minority
And being pulled always being pulled over and subject to brutality
Why is every street like a living hell
Probably cause they all just want us to fail
And three strikes and surely back to jail
Like the slaves ship when they sail but they don't know that

My people whose pains are cornered
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
That's more peoples more sistas and brothas
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain

Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
That's more people more sistaz and brothaz
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain

Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples in jail
That's more people than sistaz and brothaz
My people stay strong as an ox
My peoples will never fail
My peoples will always remain

Remain with a story to tell
My peoples was paints on the door
My peoples all shapes and colours
My peoples got more peoples with ills
More people more sistaz and brothers

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"Bounce wit me why'all 
Bounce wit em why'all

Now check it
Who get it live when the party dies down
Mysterious man showing up in your town
Lyrics like lightning, vocals like thunder

Neighborhood success or the overnight wonder
Uh, precise on mics but nice with the toe-to-toe
A roll big flow, shows out in Kosovo
Between flows and chasing them hoes

I make the crowd get down like its supposed to go
Get down year round glad to see why'all came
In the summertime banging at the be	-ball came
In the wintertime kickin rhymes up at my block

With an L in one hand and a cup of hot chocolate
A man for all seasons damn I'm raw even
We set the bar high everybody start reaching, cause?.

[Chorus]
Who said I couldn't get it down like this
Some tried to get it but they got it like this
Put you in a mix, get your body the twist
It's the mystery man, that the fans can't resist

Six sold M-K-T playin the corner
Ice cold Colt 45, not Corona
Get down see me on the prowl now I'm gonna
Holla at this fine young girl named Sherona

See, morons stalk, I walk right up on her
And make her heart race like the Dodge Daytona
Tired of the neighborhood guys ?hey hold up?
How's she get that good lovin feeling when I show up

Down and ride wit me, don't forget me when you blow up
How you gonna walk away from this, sis slow up
The head games is over ma I'm for real
Your ain't Oprah and I'm not Dr.Phil

Despite your size and them serious thighs
The long eyelashes and mysterious eyes
It don't pay to stay away from mysterious guys
That get the girls on the floor and keep the party alive, cause yo?..

[Chorus: x 2]

Now if I wanted I could pump it in every club this week
But I pass cause it only adds to my mystique
If ya think that I'm weak then catch me out in the street
It ain't nothing to show me homie man we got this heat

That nigga that got all why'all waitin
To get off the wall and get the bar room shakin
I came to but the party under a rest
And if they like it in the hood, let it pump in the jets

Mystery man, never take my mask off
But when it comes to the raps I can act why'all
Non-stop flow that might flood the dance hall
Peace I'm out, be easy I get at why'all

Amazed to find someone so fine
Up in here alone, I feel im bout to lose my mind
Was gonna spend the evening with my crew
Had no idea I would run into the likes of you
The dance floor is so ti-tight
Somewhat like the way my hands move on your thighs tonight
Oh you wanna turn that thing around

I want everybody to listen
Come on
Cause when I get on the mic and do my thing
You need to listen
Reach out and feel this
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Rockin is a state of mind for niggaz who really do it
Leavin suckaz behind and can't move through it
You cut a throat to do better than niggaz doing better
But you can't cut the neck of the second letter
you MP knucks rappers get swung like trucks
Niggaz swearing that he nice when he really suck
And yo ruck why do rappers say they thugs and gangstas
When they halloween dress up nigga panty hose
Acting like he hard with them new edition candy girl flow
I'm funky like george sir knows
I'm real like tax time you try to escape
I clamp down on your real estate and your fake estate
That means everything rented borrowed stolen
And anything you might be holdin
I Come like ?? it us
Under pressure buss it
Philly soul reaching
Bumpy heart touching
Jazzy like jeff nigga I'm not a giraffe
I'm bumpy abdu jamal I clap you fast
And be dead centre chest like the gold medallion
That hangs around a neck on a old italian

[Chorus]
Scram kid your new to me you bother (that's right its bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know you niggaz really ain't thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not
I'll write your eulogy you bother me(that's right)
It'll be no help from family or friends
nobody can really help you now

[Verse 2]
Here I am the real emcee
Writing off sucka emcees like I'm dmc
Little killers in the bm 3
Follow one be in the black 600 with the one true v
I'm in V12 but wherever I dwell
They bust for me in heaven they bust for me from hell
Cause I'm still hot any rapper I fear not
I give it to you raw like my pops was gil scott
Mama was jill scott
Humming melodies
My head on her chest feeling the bass in her breast
Time nor space exists for the man
That knows the eternal
Don't make me return you
You can pull it out
Wave it no doubt
But before you bust it off
here's one to think about
Come to bumpy get your heart tested
If you pass you'll be passing out
I'm blasting in and I'm blasting out

[Chorus]
Scram kid your new to me you bother me (that's right)
Cause I know why'all niggaz really ain't thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you're not (your not)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends
nobody can really help you now (come on)

[Verse 3]
I'm more convinced now than on a part on my life
That I'm a die with rhyming kids and a rhyming wife
I'm a body every nigga that ever did me trife
That's word to great grand grandma indian and her carving knife
I'm power in its finest hour ask queen latifah
Whose the hardest rap gansgta that she'll ever speak ta
You better check my record
Matter fact check my album industry shook down
Niggaz is shook down
Its time for revolution
Cause I see booty its wax prostitution
'I'm the chairmen of busting niggaz with chairs
Cracking niggaz heads open with heineken beers
Most people see my shadow black and wide
But can't see my heart black with pride
Cause you got a devil inside
Plotting for the spot where the late great biggie reside
I be a father like big chuck
Raising my son and keep the enemy close
And bust their gun
I step to a few niggaz and made em all one
With a 16 shot beretta that I call fun
Music must reflect the time time reflect the music
The shorty come correct if you next to use it
From lil bow wow to lil zane
I told lista kane brother little daddy shane
I always spit a nigga name
And hope to god he answer then I get all in his body
Like a nasty cancer
I take honour and take pride in the mic and I fight for it
Like it was a civil rights baby

[Chorus 2x]
Scram kid your new to me you bother (bumpy knuckles)
Cause I know why'all niggaz really ain't thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not (not baby)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends nobody can really help you now

Scram kid your new to me you bother
Cause I know you niggaz really ain't thugs
you trying to be hardcore but you really not (your not)
I'll write your eulogy you bother me
It'll be no help from family or friends nobody can really help you now

Lets go",Scram
DJ Jazzy Jeff,"[Chorus]
I gotta shake you off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake, 
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
so I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

[Chorus]

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake, 
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

[Chorus]",Shake It Off
DJ Jazzy Jeff,"Yo, just feeling the way that I do
Hope lives on, if not through me through song
I'm getting the long, take deep breaths and hold on
I write like I realize I could be gone

I'm here, is the true meaning of love clear?
If love is pain, is love really fair?
Is the meaning of life just to breed?
Is death losing all of your precious things?

Some think men don't cry, well, here's tears
Been told all these lives for these years
It's unclear why truth is untold
But hold fast and truth will unfold

I know but it's kinda hard to believe
That a whole generation will die over greed
And that most of our young will die overseas
But it all remains to go unseen

We are living for today not the past, trying to hold on
Cause the trouble won't last
We are showing that the roots run deep
And the hope won't cease 'cause everyday we believe

We will, hold on and hold out, put it together
And make it work somehow
This is, this for Malcolm and music
My story, my movement, never forgetting the children

Keep your head to the sky
The only way that you fail is if you never ever try
Where I come from, I'm there for you, care for you
You don't have to worry I'm gonna always be there for you

Doing what, laying the foundation 'cause we gonna make it
But it's gonna take dedication
And what and hope and love and peace
I hope one day you'll see and then you can join us

Listen if you love me say the words to me
I'm surrounded by so many things that hurt to me
You know you'll always come first to me
This is music, it ain't nothing but a verse to me

Remember after the pain there's sunshine
It's not in vain we all feel it sometimes
Stay strong, hold on, we gonna make good
Every member [Incomprehensible]

This is for the mothers single handed
For all the ghettos way to dammit
Hey, the world, don't you panic
Let courage lead you right

Darkness is temporary
Even though the future's looking scary, yeah it is
The most I don't make mistakes
When your chosen us the light

I know we're a long way from home
On this land that they stole, took it all
Gave us drugs after gold
Incarceration to a fold

To raise the murder toll
What else, to divide communities
Do away with unity
Where the strength is human beings

On the corner out shootin' the dice

Push up on a shorty lookin' live on the prize
I couldn't get the time of day when I was Little K
Now you call me Buck so your lips want to puck?
Fuck that bitch, I know your X amount of thoughts
But they call me Buckshot Shorty cause I take no shorts
Word to the shell around my chest

and expose, you know how it goes when it be pretty
when we roll is like we got the key to the sitty
it won't be pretty, 
for you to challenge, knock you off balance
betta reconsider your talents
You weasel, you better off pumpin diesel
I find it feasible your days is over frontin evil

Beans in box, you need more strength than just locks 
I rocks hardcore even when I dress suited
On some business shit my street is deep rooted
What is this shit?
Rappers want to blossom, put they all a costume
Toking weed buffoon I'll tell you soon you learn the hard way

For my arrival, rappers are teamin' up
Do your stuff finize is going to be limpin' MC's

Obsolete is the punk that talk more junk than Sanford sells
I jet propel at a rate that complice their mental state
As I invade their masquerade
They couldn't fade with a clipper blade
10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it
I let you take a swing, and you bunted
For an easy out, I leave mc's with doubt
Of exceeding, my name is Bottie Brown and I'm proceeding, leading,
They try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
I can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle, of O.E.
They have no key, or no clue
To the game at all, now they washed up
Hung out to dry
Standing looking stupid, wondering why
(why man?)
It was the fame, that they tried to get
Now they walking around talking about represent
And keep it real, but I got to appeal
Cause they existing in a fantasy when holding the steel

[Slim Kid 3:]
Rock a bye baby,
Listen to my heart pumping to a fine ravine
Of all things it's a vain of a shrine
All missions impossible are possible, cause I'm
Heading for a new sector 365 days from now, I'll
Wipe the sweat from my brow
And each and every true will stick, or fall from the sky of my cloud nine
From homies all the way to chics, no matter how fine
Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
And the worlds at a stand-still
Deep in broken mansville, trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
Killing yourself, and dogging ya health
You ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself

[Knumbskull #1:]
Shit is-shit is ill, my flow still will spill
Toxic slick to shock you sick like electrocute
When I execute, acutely over the rhythm
On those that pollute, extra dosages is what I gotta give em
Got em mad and trembling
Cause I been up in my lad assembling
Missiles, to bomb the enemy
Because they envy me, and the making of my mad currency
Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
Cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
And I think they can't follow
They can't swallow, the truth because it hurts
This is how I put it down, this is my earth, my turf
The worth of my birth is a billion, and you know what time it is
I'm going to make a million",Drop

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club you would not pay
Hey yo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puero Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that We Can Get Down
Now let's Knock the Boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm Above the Rim and this is how I ball
A pretty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat

My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state

Stronger Than Pride, stronger than Teflon

By the way, my name's Malik

Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, ""No,"" labeled me a hoe
I said, ""How you figure?""  ""My friends told me so.""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that

I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep
Keep it in the down, yo, we keep it discrete
See, I'm not the type to kid to have my biz in the streets

If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me sink the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seamen's Furniture

Stacy, DJ and my man L.G.

You're missing the hootah

Of your fucked-up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws stridin'
While suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when you see me drivin'

With my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco

I'm ignoring all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around my gat straight humming
Hummin', Coming at ya
Yeah ya know I had to gat ya
Time for some action
Just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance
To run the interference
Into your satellite
Shining a battle light
Sen got the gatt and I know that he'll gat you right
Here's an example
Just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome
I said, ""Yo, it's on!""
Take cover son or you're assed-out
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway
That young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I had to establish
To lite
My spliff ignite
You with insight
So if you ain't down, bullshit!
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the One-time and play the role model?
No!I think you'll play like a thug
Next you hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming coming at ya
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gatt ya!
How you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome
Just for a bucket
Or a fast duck it
Just to stay alive, yo I got to say ""fuck it!""

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gif when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic

When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick, your lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead

Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Ooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head

To think that you could fuck wit me or any of the members of my click
For that matter, wit ya chitter-chatter

Send you an e-mail bomb and erase your data
Now you're clueless, wonderin how I do this
Simple and plain, I run wit real niggas and squads that carry Rugers

And keep the point focal, you hear me but you don't listen
You think its easy being put in this position
I freak speech, but still don't want to preach
This peak thought in stimulate movement at at Emcees
Grab your gat hit the streets, that the rally cry the war horn
The activist, those cats is spiritually war torn environment
So I leading a community movement
And I don't need money for me to make a community improvement
Tell me what you stand for
Would you settle for less or do you have the strength to demand more
Only time will tell, what this new world brings
Revolutions at order, check the mood swing, swing
Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing

Low like sweet chariot
What I say make my voice deep as berries get
Carry it like a torch
Give birth to rhymes to meet beats and then I'll marry 'em off
Have a divorce if the track is whack

Blackin' out doin' shit that I can't rap about
Passin' out, wakin' up, not awake awake enough to take it up and not stop
Love is a friends never know if we can love again
I said we gotta leave, she asked if she can come again (come again)
I had to meet Asheru at the studio
I'm runnin' late, you know I hate to make a nigga wait
But damn baby ""You look good in the summer time
Gimme some of yours, I'm a give you some of mine""

Yo Kweli I remember being in the same dilemma
Hip-hop was number one my girl was number one contender
The great pretender wit a whole different agenda
Until I make it big ""Life is one long gig""

Like Soul Train its timeless just like this rhyme is
So all of why'all that wagging they campaign
Grab a hold of that mood swing and do the damn thing

I'm a truth seeker, on a quest not a believer
I'm an emcee for all of the world to see
Yea ya got my word on it, I'll put the Herd on it
That we rep shit, its the least to be expected
Fuck that prep shit, jump on stage like we connected
From the same minds saying the same things at the same time
Back stage rappin' like gettin' ready for game time
We a family, and ain't nothing goin' to change that
For better or worse like somebody prearrange that
The way it is the way it always will be so I can still and still be
Soon come we will witness a shift in consciousness
And black music is one of our greatest accomplishments
(one now) our names will live on this monument
So that our kids can hold up they heads with confidence
That's when our nation will rise and realize that 

Life without knowledge is death in disguise

The answer to my comprehension is just too complex
One minute from the next, go from happy ta vexed

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"You lack the minerals and vitamins, irons and the niacin
Fuck who that I offend, rappers sit back I'm bout to begin
Bout foul talk you sqwak, never even walked the walk
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested
My album will manifest many things that I saw did or heard about 
Or told first hand, never word of mouth
What's in the future for the fusion in the changer?
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Some will keep their limbs and, some will be maimed
The same suckers with the gab about, killer instincts
But turned bitch and knowin' damn well they lack
In this division the connoisseur, crackin' your head with a 4 by 4
Realize sucka, I be the comin' like Noah
Always sendin' you down, perpetratin' facadin' what you consider
A image, to me this is, just a scrimmage
I'm feel I'm stone, not cause I bop or wear my cap cocked
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock
Those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

Their time's limited, hard rocks too

Speakin' in tongues, about what you did but you never done it
Admit you bit it cause the next man gained platinum behind it
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed
Most write about stuff they fantasized
I'm fed up with the bull, on this focus of weed and clips
And glocks gettin' cocked, and wax not bein' flipped
It's the same old same old just strain it from the anal
The contact, is not com-pexed or vexed
So why you puhsin' it?  Why you lyin' for?  I know where you live
I know your folks, you was a sucka as a kid
Your persona's drama, that you acquired in high school in actin' class
Your whole aura is plexi-glass
What's-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
That's a lie, you was in church with your moms
See I know yo, slow your roll, give a good to go
Guys be lackin' in this thing called rappin' just for dough
Of course we gotta pay rent, so money connects, but uh
I'd rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect
It's the principal of it, I get a rush when I bust
Some dope lines oral, that maybe somebody'll quote
That's what I consider real, in this field of music
Instead of puttin' brain cells to work they abuse it
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Everybody's either crime-related or sexual
I'm here to make a difference, besides all the riffin'
The traps are not stickin', rappers stop flippin'
For those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"It was the third of September; that day I'll always remember, 
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just looked at him and said, ""Son, 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""

Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Whats up dude
Ay man remember that girl you know when I was walking to school
She used to diss me everyday (yeah)
Man the record came out she called me 2 days ago
Man my phone is off the hook with people asking me for tapes and free records
I ain't with it
Word man 
Bust this

This rap is for the people in the past who were against me
Who snapped at every opportunity to diss me
Put me down like I was nothing treated me like a jerk
Now I'm seeing the pay off of all my hard work
But now that its my records on the reel
Somehow all of a sudden it's a whole new deal
For those in the past who dissed me don't deny it
What? Your sorry? Don't even try it

Word man
People are a trip
Putting everybody down what's up with that
Word man I gotta let em know I gotta
Bust this

I used to know this girl by the name of Teresa
I did all I could to make her release her
Emotions to me but she just wouldn't do it
She built up a wall and I couldn't break through it
I used to walk to school everyday of the week
Watching Teresa walk on the other side of the street
One day I finally got my heart up to speak
She dissed me and dismissed me with a smack on my cheek
So I bought six bottles of new fancy cologne
But all I got from Teresa was
(leave me alone)
Bought new clothes to wear every place
But all Teresa would say was
(get out of my face)
So I gave up this quest for Teresa
But then on the day my record was released
A strange thing happened when it came on the radio
Teresa broke her neck just to say (hello)
I looked at her I said you must be foolish
Why did you ignore me on the way to school if you were interested she said
(oh I apologize)
I looked deep into her dark brown eyes
I said you ignored me for months on end
Now all of a sudden you wanna be my friend
You didn't talk before so don't talk now what be quiet
What you really like me? Don't even try it

Man she had a lot of nerve man (word)
But man she ain't have half as much nerve as that record producer
The one that dissed us man
What up

When I first started rapping I had one idea
And it was set in my mind very vivid and clear
I knew that I wanted to be a rap artist
I'll give my all and work my hardest
But when I took my song to a record producer
He told me that I better go drink some rap juice or
Something because my song was really absurd
He said that it was the worst trash that he'd ever heard
Yo my ego was shattered he busted my groove
I could hear him cracking up as I left the room
I thought my song was good but he busted my bubble
The title was girls ain't nuthin' but trouble
Hopefully I found someone who had faith
He lifted my ego back up into place
His name was Dana Goodman (chill) he thought the song was on track
So two weeks later it was out on wax
It busted up the charts like a hydrogen bomb
Up up up it climbed climbed climbed
People eat their words that said I couldn't achieve
Now they have no choice bit to believe in me
Then no sooner than my record came out
That same old producer started calling my house
One night he called me about half past 12
I've got some cash if you wanna sell
I said you big stupid half wit idiot
I told you before that my record was a hit
I just laughed like some kind of kid
Now don't you regret what you did
I wish you'd get off my tip now that's my request
See he who laughs last always laughs best
Okay I'll be reasonable you wanna buy it
Okay I'll sell it psyche don't even try it

You know what I'll tell you sumthin'
I got this so hard man
I'm a tell you sumthin'

Yo Prince you remember when we first started out
How we used to go to all the parties just to rock the house
Word man I remember those good days well
Well chill out man cause I got a story to tell
About five years ago I began my quest to be the best DJ in the whole US
There was a lot of DJ's striving in my spot
They were putting me down every chance I got
Never cut me a break on any given night
They used to all look at me and say
(Jeff's alright)
But when your magnificent cuts were released
All of that left has ceased (word)
When you and I used to do our shows
All the crowd would say is Ho
Yeah time after time we were tearin' it up
While you rock the mic and I rocked the cut
But now that I'm making a name for myself
All those DJ's are like
Yo Jeff whats up
All that stuff is dead nope I ain't with it
They'll push me on the street and say
(yo Jeff how bout a ticket man)
To your very next show
But I say no
And I tell them where they can go
I cant believe that they have the nerve
To hop on my tip now
Yeah man word
Just the other day homeboy approached me on the street and said
""yo Jeff how bout a record for free""
Man the way you dissed me you better go buy it
But man we're friends for real don't even try it

Man straight up you know how it is
Word
Maybe they'll know not to diss next time
We let em know
Cause I ain't with it
Aight Jeff chill",Don't Even Try It
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Have you ever in your life experienced a day 
Where nothing at all seems to go your way 
No matter how hard you try to get out of the rut 
You just could not break the string of bad luck 
A day where Murphy's law takes over your life 
And you just can't seem to do a darn thing right 
And when the day was over you just had to say 
You said man it's just one of those days 

My day started off kind of cool 
I brushed my teeth I combed my hair and I got dressed and went to school 
I stopped at the store for a breakfast snack 
A tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack 
About that point I proceeded to class 
I spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed 
I went to my room which was on the first floor 
I had no idea what I was in for 
I sat in my desk and minded my own business 
Someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it 
This girl walked in my imagination ran wild 
She stole my heart just by the way that she smiled 
I couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt 
She said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut 
The teacher turned around while my arm was extended 
She looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended 
I said your tripping it's just a bad habit 
She put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it 
I pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip 
Then I just shook my head I said I don't believe this 
She sent me to the head of the discipline staff 
I tried to play it off so I started to laugh 
I said ha ha this story is great 
It's a big misunderstanding one big mistake 
He didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile 
He said hm-hm-hm you're an unlucky child 
I stopped laughing and I said why is that 
He said just get out my school and don't you ever come back 
I said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it 
He handed me my books and said yep you'd best believe it 
As I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze 
And said man it's just one of those days 

I woke up around a quarter to eight 
I wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great 
I flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise 
I thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine 
I hopped up and put my feet on the floor 
Ran to the bathroom then I (ow) hit my foot on the door 
The pain was immense as it started to throb 
I said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job 
So I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth 
Threw on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks 
Threw on my Fila underwear and my Fila hat 
Then I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat 
I grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys 
Then I prayed out loud car start please 
The car started but what good was that 
I couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat 
I did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block 
Then I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock 
The bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous 
I got real mad because the sign said out of service 
I started hiking it I wasn't liking it 
I saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it 
I thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner 
There was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner 
Slammed on the flat I did 180 turn 
Peddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn 
With the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk 
I thought man all of this 'cause I was trying to get to work 
I could've got away I almost had 'em shook 
'Til this girl walked by something said not to look 
But I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt 
But she made me miss the sign that said men at work 
I screamed out loud as I crashed through the barricade 
I saw my whole life flash before my face 
I felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars 
I put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars 
That was stupid I got off track 
'Cause about that point everything went black 
The next thing I remember is a head ache nagging 
I woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon 
I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead 
A big Flintstones lump on the side of my head 
They took my picture and my finger prints 
I said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince 
I demand that you release me you incompetent fool 
You can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules 
You got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights 
But then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche 
I had a call so I called my boss 
I figured I might as well what else could be lost 
Boss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today 
He said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday 
Stuck in a cell scared as hell 
I'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell 
Maybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways 
But for now it's just one of those days 

It's just one of those days",Just One of Those Days
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Each and every day when I come home from school
Like clockwork I go up into my bedroom
I secure the door and it's the moment of truth
I flip on my sound system and let the bass loose
The earthquake bass makes the walls all tremble
A discotheque is what my room resembles
How loud it gets to me it does not matter
I open up the windows so the glass don't shatter
The blast falls off my neighbour's wall
My phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls
But I just let it ring and I don't go near it
I turn the volume up so that I can't hear it ring
My ear drums rumble my lungs vibrate
I'm in my own world and this realm is great
We rock this power at my command
The decibels exceed the limits human ears can stand
The lower frequency better known as bass
Sitting nice with the treble at a jazzy pace
My neighbours complain they say they can't endure
They form a congregation outside my front door
Mothers who yell saying its too loud
Start banging on my door to turn it down
My response to my mother when she starts knockin
Is come on mum I'm just rockin 
(rockin)
(ready rock c)
This style that's mine is rarely heard
Suddenly there is an opportunity to observe
People gots my rhyme the super computer
The literary genius rhyme ruler of the future
I'm the fresh prince slaying all emcee
So hold the red cup when we take to your knees
Pay home submit you can't defuse my scheme
Cause I'm the fresh prince and this is my regime
To all other rappers you're being subdued
I don't mean to be rude but this is my prelude
This introductory performance has just one plot
A sample jeff and about me and my DJ rocks
I'm not listening to reason so don't try to talk
Do yourself a favour and take a walk
Or I'll amputate your mic and repossess your core
I'm the man salute to the prince the power lord
My friends I'll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and I'll strangle you
I'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator
I'm like a bomb and my turbo is the detonator
The crown chief of the poetry industry
Vocabulary that to others is a fantasy
highly respected by the public at large
The prince will rock is taking charge
I'm like a tiger in a battle field I'm invincible
You want a battle me man be sensible
I'll never submit to any other emcee
Be a duel to the death either him or me
And as I verbalise to my DJ's cut
If we kill a wack crew or two so what
We just rock it
We just rock it
DJ Jeff
Break 2
On each occasion that I perform
The force captures my body like a magical storm
Suddenly I'm rendered helpless in a state of shock
But it is rather abrupt when I start to rock
Adrenalin rushes my ego swells
And the yells of the crowd make my hype excel
My metabolism quickens my body gets sense
That's when I metamorphosis into the royal fresh prince
And as I display all my lyrical beauty
You become a slave as your hype increases
And as I vocalize I can see it in your eyes
You stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the mark of red
You scream oh my to what the prince just said
As my energy is drained from being so crushed
All of a sudden I get another adrenalin rush
It happens each and every time that my dj spins
More commonly known as my second wind
The spotlights are beaming
You are screaming
From my body all the sweat is streaming
Commanding the stage
And perpetually frayed
Giving my all to the pulse of
One hundred percent everytime I rhyme
When I step off the stage that's when the stop
And that has been the account of the evenings events
Reporting to you live by me the fresh prince
I'm the latest that you heard so you may seem shockin 
(what does it all mean)
I'm just rockin
Rockin rockin rockin
Go crazy

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Yo Jeff whats shakin' man
Whats up dude
Ay man remember that girl you know when I was walking to school
She used to diss me everyday (yeah)
Man the record came out she called me 2 days ago
Man my phone is off the hook with people asking me for tapes and free records
I ain't with it
Word man 
Bust this

This rap is for the people in the past who were against me
Who snapped at every opportunity to diss me
Put me down like I was nothing treated me like a jerk
Now I'm seeing the pay off of all my hard work
But now that its my records on the reel
Somehow all of a sudden it's a whole new deal
For those in the past who dissed me don't deny it
What? Your sorry? Don't even try it

Word man
People are a trip
Putting everybody down what's up with that
Word man I gotta let em know I gotta
Bust this

I used to know this girl by the name of Teresa
I did all I could to make her release her
Emotions to me but she just wouldn't do it
She built up a wall and I couldn't break through it
I used to walk to school everyday of the week
Watching Teresa walk on the other side of the street
One day I finally got my heart up to speak
She dissed me and dismissed me with a smack on my cheek
So I bought 6 bottles of new fancy cologne
But all I got from Teresa was
(leave me alone)
Bought new clothes to wear every place
But all Teresa would say was
(get out of my face)
So I gave up this quest for Teresa
But then on the day my record was released
A strange thing happened when it came on the radio
Teresa broke her neck just to say (hello)
I looked at her I said you must be foolish
Why did you ignore me on the way to school if you were interested she said
(oh I apologies)
I looked deep into her dark brown eyes
I said you ignored me for months on end
Now all of a sudden you wanna be my friend
You didn't talk before so don't talk now what be quiet
What you really like me? Don't even try it

Man she had a lot of nerve man (word)
But man she ain't have half as much nerve as that record producer
The one that dissed us man
What up

When I first started rapping I had one idea
And it was set in my mind very vivid and clear
I knew that I wanted to be a rap artist
I'll give my all and work my hardest
But when I took my song to a record producer
He told me that I better go drink some rap juice or
Something because my song was really absurd
He said that it was the worst trash that he'd ever heard
Yo my ego was shattered he busted my groove
I could hear him cracking up as I left the room
I thought my song was good but he busted my bubble
The title was girls ain't nuthin' but trouble
Hopefully I found someone who had faith
He lifted my ego back up into place
His name was Dana Goodman (chill) he thought the song was on track
So two weeks later it was out on wax
It busted up the charts like a hydrogen bomb
Up up up it climbed climbed climbed
People eat their words that said I couldn't achieve
Now they have no choice bit to believe in me
Then no sooner than my record came out
That same old producer started calling my house
One night he called me about half past 12
I've got some cash if you wanna sell
I said you big stupid half wit idiot
I told you before that my record was a hit
I just laughed like some kind of kid
Now don't you regret what you did
I wish you'd get off my tip now that's my request
See he who laughs last always laughs best
Okay I'll be reasonable you wanna buy it
Okay I'll sell it psyche don't even try it

You know what I'll tell you sumthin'
I got this so hard man
I'm a tell you sumthin'

Yo prince you remember when we first started out
How we used to go to all the parties just to rock the house
Word man I remember those good days well
Well chill out man cause I got a story to tell
About five years ago I began my quest to be the best DJ in the whole US
There was a lot of DJ's striving in my spot
They were putting me down every chance I got
Never cut me a break on any given night
They used to all look at me and say
(Jeff's alright)
But when your magnificent cuts were released
All of that left has ceased (word)
When you and I used to do our shows
All the crowd would say is Ho
Yeah time after time we were tearin' it up
While you rock the mic and I rocked the cut
But now that I'm making a name for myself
All those DJ's are like
Yo Jeff whats up
All that stuff is dead nope I ain't with it
They'll push me on the street and say
(yo Jeff how bout a ticket man)
To your very next show
But I say no
And I tell them where they can go
I cant believe that they have the nerve
To hop on my tip now
Yeah man word
Just the other day homeboy approached me on the street and said
""Yo Jeff how bout a record for free""
Man the way you dissed me you better go buy it
But man we're friends for real don't even try it

Man straight up you know how it is
Word
Maybe they'll know not to diss next time
We let 'em know
Cause I ain't with it

",Special Announcement
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Now I'm the Fresh Prince, and if you got good sense
You'll keep your distance, because my sole intent
Is to rock and shock the spot and give my all, which is a lot 
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm taking it to the top 
A whole lot of people rap, but what good is that 
If the rap that they're rapping is way off track?
I don't mean to attack you, but I'm cutting no slack 
To those people that I hear saying meaningless raps
In actuality, I mean in reality
The words that you use are a mere formality
Vocabulary is not what it's about
The point that you're trying to get across is what counts
Cause when a lot of rappers rap, they try to use big words 
But that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard of
They think that that's impressive, but when will they learn their lesson
That it's not the words that count, it's the message 
They get a lot of big words out of some magazine
And nine times out of ten they don't even know what they mean
They stand up on the stage, huffing and puffin
Rappin for nearly an hour, but they're not sayin nothin
Really but a lot of jibberish
And I know that they all wish
They had access to fresh rhymes like this
I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top
Fresh rhymes and a razzamatazz 
Smooth power and grace and mucho pizzazz
Good looks and charm and personality
You punch it in your calculator, and it adds up to me 
I know the same goes for the rest of my crew
My D.J Jazzy Jeff and Ready Rock C too 
The ultimate combination of strength and prestige
My crew holds the key to fun and everything you need 
To party all night, yes, it's you we will excite
The time is right, so don't fight it Suckers, please don't bite it
We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot
And no, we're not about to stop because we're takin it to the top
I really hate to brag about him
But when people doubt him I have to stand up and tell the whole world all about him 
'United we stand, divided we fall'
Is the moto of our crew and it is honored by all of us,
We pledge allegiance to the work we rehearse 
And it enables us always to come out first
We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot
Yo, Jeff, man, why don't you take it to the top? 
We succeed every time we attempt 
To rock the house, you've got to dance cause no one is exempt 
From the rules set forth by us, of course you know 
Stay out our way or behold the brute force of Me Jeff and Ready Rock C,
We're a trio, oh, you didn't know? 
That means That there's three of us, one for all and all for one
And we're taking it to the top before we get done
I'm inclined to rhyme, anytime you'll find
It ain't a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine I insist on a rise and I despise a decline 
On the day I descend, that's the day I resign I'm creating my trends and innovatin my rap 
Why is that? I don't know, I guess I got it like that!
My personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre
My advice for life is, if you want somethin, go for it
Cause there's nothin that's beyond your grasp 
Just set your mind to it, work hard, and you can have
Anything that you want, the sky is the limit 
Stop lunchin around, get up and go get it
Cause I came a long way from the past till today 
Now I'm never slowin down, ah-ah, no way! 
I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot 
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm taking it to the top

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"As we go a little somethin like this, hit it

Now let's get this party, started off the right way
Ow and ho I think the crowd might say
When we're on stage you know you can't resist
(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)
I'm the ultimate, and that's all I can say
I sat down for about eight hours a day
Tryin to figure out the proper description of me
And I came to the decision that there's no one syllable or phrase
That can adequately describe this new craze
But I'll sum it up in one sentence, let's see
Okay I've got it all praise me
Yup that's about the size of it
I know it sounds kinda strange, doesn't it
But when we're on the stage you know you can't resist
(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)

(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)

It was a Friday afternoon if I remember it correctly
But I can't quite recall the time exactly
But it was somewhere around, two or three or four
Oh forget it, let's just go on
Anyway I stepped out of school
Sneaks were Gucci shirt was Polo and my pockets were full
Blew some kisses to the girlies cause I like to tease
They started chantin my name, I said, ladies please
I grabbed my friends and hopped in my Benz
Grabbed on Martini and Rossi passed out to my posse
Things were lookin good, I had plans for later on
Plans for Donna Michelle, plans for Stacy LeShaun
Word I was ready, I wonder if Jeff's home
Let me give him a call, on my car phone
Yo Jeff, what's shakin Coolin, whassup
Girlies I'm with it, come pick me up
I caught up with Ready on the way to Jeff's
A whole carload of girlies and they all was def
We walked into Jeff's and said, Girls, you can't resist
(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)

{*Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches Slick Rick*
""As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!""}

Yo Jeff man, are you with me (Hit it)
I didn't hear you man, are you with me (Hit it)
I'm with it to get busy

(somethin like this, hit it)

Ready Rock see, give Jeff a hand!

(As we go a little somethin like this, hit it)

Throw away them jams cause you don't need em any more
Cause this hip-hop hit is gonna keep you on the floor
If you dance everyday or if you never danced before
It doesn't matter if it's (somethin like this)
Time is essential so let's make the best of it
Today we don't have a lot of time, so let's not throw it all away
Let's use this time in a very special way
Let's use it, (somethin like this)
I went outside at about 12:30
I saw a couple girlies, and they were lookin pretty good if you know what I mean
So I freshened my breath and stepped on the scene (hit it)
I walked over to em, stepped in between them
One said to the other, I think that I've seen him somewhere before
I said sweetheart, you might have
She said oh yeah it was last night at that party
I said yeah I tried to talk to you there but you were acting as if you were scared
She said I'm not scared now I said Bet, well let's go then
She said but hold up, what about my friend
I said I got a friend
So the three of us left
Went back to my crib and gave a call to Jeff
Five minutes later, Jeff walked in
And I thought to myself yeah, now the fun begins
But the girls started buggin, and they said
Now we want dinner in the best restaurant in town
We want caviar and lobster tails, both by candlelight and Don Perignon I said yeah right
Y'all must be crazy, and Jeff said you know
I really think it's time for these ladies to go
We walked em to the door and told em they were dismissed and it went a little (somethin like this)
But that was okay that was alright
Cause we still had fun that night ya know it
The moral of the story is plain and visible
We always watch out for those kind of women
But the past is the past and the present is the present
And we feel that everyone should be sitting down
(so you all don't miss)

",As We Go
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Fresh Prince] It's new, it's out of the ordinary
It's rather extraordinary,
So yo bust this commentary 
A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator
Have come together, and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty 
You wanna dance? We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk 

-Get down brand new funk-hit it

It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened
One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up 
And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said, 
""What the...? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it""
He just smiled and said, ""Yeah def ain't it?"" 
It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was 
The {brand new funk}
So we continued to listen to it 
And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it 
So I gave a hi-five to Jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette
I took it home that night, and analyzed it 
Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it
That Friday, we went to the club 
And out of my mouth I cold tore it up!
You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin and spinnin 
And clappin, while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin while on 
The microphone I was flowin 
Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, ""Yo keep goin"" So I continued to 
Rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready 
Rock 
People barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the 
Brand new funk 
Ge-Ge-Get down-hit it

Sensational, stupendous music

You're chillin I'm winnin

We went to the studio and then we made a video
We didn't make a movie though maybe the next year or so
Yo I got a message for my fans and friends
The last album was dope y'all and here we go again!

No applause, no applause, thank you, thank you
We're back again, and we're plannin on rockin you
ten times harder than any other crew can
Jeff is like Conan, I'm like Tarzan
In other words, wherever we go
Hahah! We're runnin the show, but no
seriously, it's been a while since we dropped one
But it's out now, go buy the album
If you bought the last one you know it was krush
But if you didn't man, you must not
know what you're missin friend
The last album was dope y'all, and here we go again!
A lot of people may not have bought the last album
Yo Jeff, straight up, we can't allow them
to go out like that, our music is too def
We produce hit records right and left
Daytime, nighttime, def beat, def rhyme
Chorus line, bass drum, snare drum, bassline
All of this makes our records rock til the party's end..
.. here we go again!

When we first came out, we had a smash hit song
Then people started askin, ""What's takin so long
for y'all to put another record out for the airwaves?""
I said, ""Hold up - let me explain.
When you hear a record on your radio station
it's probably getting played all throughout the nation
But we got lucky, ours was played in Germany
France, Japan, Sweden London Italy
So therefore, we had to go on tour
City after city, 'Encore encore, bravo bravo!'
Sorry we gotta go
We got another show tomorrow night in Rio""
The point I'm tryin to make is to let you all know
It takes a LONG TIME to travel the globe
But now we gotta start this whole process all over again
The last album was def, and here we go again!

Special thanks, to everyone that helped us
Without you, we would not have been able to sell
as many records, we went top ten
And got real and we'll do it again
It was a long hard road, believe me
People tryin to steal from me, and deceive me
But that's cool, you live and learn my friends
We did it before, and we'll do it agaim",Here We Go Again
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Ever since I was younger, I was into video games
Tron or whatever, it didn't matter the name
Thousands of my dollars, have been poured into all types of games, tryin to get the high score
But now I think I have a favourite
It's me against an ape, he's got my girl, I've got to save her!
Oh no, I feel an attach coming on
Yo Ready Rock see I wanna play a game of Donkey Kong

It used to be a problem this addiction I have
I would feel the urge, then I'd go stark raving mad
Break into the arcade, screaming and hollering
Anticipating putting twenty-five dollars in any machine, I was out of control
I didn't need quarters I brought, $10 bank rolls
Bags of quarters, I was insane
People thought that I worked there, and asked me for change
But I would get defensive and yell leave me alone
These are my quarters stupid, go get your own
Dude walked away with this look in his eyes like,
Yo man.. I wonder what's wrong with that guy
I was addicted, a video burn-out and I would crazy when the guy would have to turn out
The lights at midnight, I'd fall on my knees and say,
Have a heart pal, one more game please
Some nights I might sleep on the subway or outside of the arcade til it opened up the next day
And when it opened at a quarter to ten it was the same old thing all over again
I was doin bad my future was bleek
I'd rather play games than eat or sleep until one day, this guy came along
He didn't have a radio but he was playin a song
I got curious, so I said, yo what's that noise?"" (What noise? I don't know)
No fool, that noise you was makin there (What this)

That was def man, where'd you learn to do that
(Man, I don't know, I guess I always knew that I had this talent deep down inside)
You wanna hear some more man Yeah (Come on let's take a ride)
He made sounds like I never heard before and he still had more
Then he got me hyped when he played this incredible song and I lost my mind when Ready see played Donkey Kong

Yo Ready, get funky with it!
Yo Jeff man what you doing? Give Ready a hand

Now my life is wonderful and I feel great
I haven't been in an arcade since seventy eight
Thanks to Ready see I'm on an upward trail
Because he's always by my side, he never fails me
Whenever I have a video attack
He's right there by my back keeping me on track
So if I bug out and act like a lunatic
He does Donkey Kong and as soon as it gets to my eardrums from his vocal chords
I get hyped up no matter how bored I am he always comes through
Oh my fault, hold up, wait, let me tell you who
Ready Rock see, here's a brief description
Of the things that he can do in his musical position
Ready Rock see makes sounds with his mouth
Yo Ready give an example of what I'm talking about

(game over)
(Yo, Scrammy, why you still standin there)
(The game is over haha sucker)




",Human Video Game
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"I'd like to know, are you really for some super-dynamite sou
Introducing the world's greatest entertainer
The amazing Mr. Beat-Beat himself
The hardest working beatbox in show business
Ready Rock

(Ready, Ready Rock, Ready Rock C)
Tell em your name, tell em your name
(Ready Rock, Ready Rock, Ready Rock, Ready Rock C)
Ooh that was nice Ready
(Ready Rock)
Ready Rock
Hey man, hold up man
I think I wanna tell em a little about this man
Aight break it down Ready, break it down

Please pay attention, to my rhymes so I can tell you all about this pal of mine
He's my buddy, my best friend
When it's a beat I need it's a beat he'll lend
I wanna take time-out, to talk about him
Cause frankly I don't know what I would do without him
We work together like a medical crew
When I'm backin Ready up (I'm backin Prince up too)
Tryin to beat us, that doesn't make any sense
He's Ready Rock see, and I'm the Fresh Prince
In the rap industry we're ranked at first
Ain't a better combination in the whole universe
So if you wanna battle your future looks muddy
That you just can't beat, my buddy

Word, break it down break it down Ready

We've won so many battles, people think it's a trick
That when the crowd gets to judge it's US that they'll pick
They see Ready's face and then they hear my voice
To choose us as the winners is the natural choice
Because battle after battle we remain on top
Cause it's not the way we look, it's the way that we rock
So if you thought you wanted to battle, bust this rhyme
Just keep it and I'm sure that I can change your mind
There was ten wack dudes trying to play high post
One crew got bold and they began to boast
But said, y'all shut up and get back in line
But they refused (what happened now) So now there's nine
Nine wack crews tryin to rock like this
They were bitin my rhymes and just couldn't resist
I said please stop bitin, please don't imitate
But they kept on bitin, so there's now there's eight
Eight wack crews poppin big time trash
Telling us that in a battle we can't last
The battle started at 10:30 and by quarter of eleven was no longer eight crews (how many was their)
There was seven
Seven wack cruise in a football huddle
Trying to figure out their next rebuttal
They came out strong you'd think their The Ultimate but we just dissed em and dismissed, so now there's six
Six wack groups, tryin to be tough
Who the hell told em they could rock the mic like us
We got straight down the business didn't pop no jive
We just blew em out, so now there's five
Five wack crews lined up in the hallway
All perpetrating like they're read to play
My secretary walked out, she asked for one more
They got scared, and left, so now there's four
Four wack crews outside playing around
I said I'll take you wall on, now how does that sound?
Not one had heart enough to pick up that mic
I said, okay I'll let you go, psych
That's the moral, of this story
Never try to take me and Ready Rock's glory
Cause if you do your future looks muddy
Cause you just can't beat me and my buddy

Haha word, uh
Yeah Ready Rock, hold up hold up hold up
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
What man what?
C'mon man, man, I wonder, can, can I just interrupt the record for a second?



",My Buddy
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street!

[Fresh Prince]
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right because the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
We saw Elm Street and man it was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!

[Fresh Prince]
It was burnin in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin from behind
It said, "";You cut off 'Heavy Metal' and now you must die!"";
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside my drawers and screamed, "";So long, cuz!"";
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin
Then thought, "";Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin"";
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said, "";Here's what we'll do.
We gotta lotta work here, me and you.
The souls of your friends you and I will claim.
You've got the body, and I've got the brain."";
I said, "";Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong.
I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work.
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!"";
I patted him on the shoulder said, "";Thanks for stopping by."";
Then I opened up the door and said, "";Take care guy!"";
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, "";Hold up, that hurt!"";
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, "";Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here."";
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, "";Oh please do somethin with Fred!"";
He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, "";Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway."";
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street

In the place to be
DJ Jazzy Jeff and yours truly the Fresh Prince
Ay Jeff, do me a favor, give em just a lil' TOUCH of the bass
Not a lot, just a lil' touch Jeff

Word word
Ay Jeff do me a favor man, Jazz it up

Now bring it all back

Yo man now break it down and let me go for mine

When I first started out, Jeff used to come to my house
Just as soon as school let out, he used to
Come to my crib, and you know what we did?
We bugged out like two little kids, word
Jeff on the wheels, and me on the M.I.C.
A better combination there could never be
So let's go back, for old time's sake
Yo Jeff! (WHAT?) Pump up the bass!

I . like . my . music . loud!
The volume, pumpin, the kickdrum thumpin
The people jumpin, up out there seats
When this record comes on, you think something's wrong
The bass is too strong
You don't have to check your record, it's not defective
It's just the way we wanted it, pump it, get it?
We like it loud, strong like a magnum force
I am the lyricist, Jeff is the rhythm source
This combination, is virtually omnipotent
That means invincible, you know, dominant
So don't you cross our path, just stay out our face
Or we'll knock you down, pump up the bass!

Yo Jeff man, how bout a funky scratch

Now get funky with it

Now bring in the snare

Now break it down and bring it all back to me

Now pump up the bass!

I'm hyped - psyched up
And I'm flowin, so come on let's go in
To the next segment, of this hip-hop fantasy
You say this can't be happening, why can't it be?
It's an equation, mathematically correct
It's Jeff + Prince, equals, hit records
Sounds too easy? Word, I know it does
You wanna know why? Well yo it's cause
Me and Jeff, oh, Jeff and I, excuse me
Blend like Kool-Aid, and flow like an uzi
That's why we can't be taken or broken or braken, whatever
And if you think we can, you're mistaken, we're clever
Cause all we did to make this record a hit
Was turn down the treble, pump up the bass kit
At the same time the volume was increased
Adding more strength, to this masterpiece
Of poetry, by now you know it's me
Poet, creativity, pushin, to out destiny
I am on the M-I-C, Jeffery is the Disc Jockey
? keep us company, the human beat box Ready C
Backed up by a family, and that is all we need
So that we can be successful as we want to be
The future is in front of me so here is a taste
Of the future of hip-hop Jeff, pump up the bass!

Yo Jeff one more scratch man

Hey, Jazzy

He-he-ha!

(Don't stop the rock)

Now that's a record!
Now that's a record!

Go Jazzy, go Jazzy, go

I want to be remembered for the songs that I sing
Not only for the humor, but for the knowledge I bring
To broaden the horizons of others is why I rap this
Enlightening minds with my lyrical tactics
In life everything ain't always what it seems
But people are enchanted by things that gleam
You know, bright fancy cars, big yachts and mansions
On the beaches of Aruba with a girlie romancin
Now I'm about to tell you a very artistic fable
More fun than when you first got cable
The moral to be learned from this story to be told
Is that everything that glitters ain't always gold

On July 11th I was sittin at home
Talkin to my girlfriend Geena on the telephone
Flippin through the newspaper checkin the news
When I saw an advertisement for a Carribean cruise
It said, 'Sunny skies and romantic nights
On an incredible ship' - and I got hype
It said it's like the _Love Boat_, baskin in the sun
Promisin fun for you and for everyone
I said, "";That's dope! Baby, you're down?"";
She said, "";Yeah, we could leave right now!"";
The very next day I put the check in the mail
And one week later we were ready to sail
The brochure said that the boat was large
But it was nothin but a broken-down barnacle barge!
And if it wasn't for my girlfriend, I wouldn'ta went
Because the captain was a cross-eyed hunchback with a limp
The cruise was paid for and the food was free
So I said what the hell and set out to sea
It didn't take long to notice something was wrong
The ship was a mess and we were the only ones on it
I didn't wanna panic, so I chilled for a while
Till the captain pulled up to what we thought was a deserted isle
We looked on to the beach and almost went bezerk
We saw 300 natives with spears and grass skirts!
The said, "";Hung-a-dung-a-digi-dung-da-doa"";
I said, "";Hey baby, I guess that means get off the boat"";
Their chief said they needed a human sacrifice
I said, "";Well, just take my girl - he-he - syke"";
I was jokin, but things got serious
Their leader came out and he was curious
He got in my face and his breath was the worst
I said, "";Hey baby, you got some mints in your purse?"";
His breath was stinkin with filthy brown teeth
And two big crusty ashy hairy feet
The worst thing, he had no toenail on his toes
And a big Teradactyl bird bone in his nose
I tried to reason with him, he wasn't with it
He said, "";Tenga-shanko,""; that meant 'forget it'
He said, "";Gunga-shang-tang-da-bong-da-boo"";
That meant 'tonight we're having Fresh Prince stew'
Then I saw it - no, it's not
The big Indiana Jones people cooking pot!
I wanted to fight em, but there was no way to beat em
I thought to myself, 'Where's Tarzan when you need him?'
Just as they were contemplatin cookin us up
We had a major struck of luck, a Navy ship pulled up
The troops came off and they got us out of the pot
And I said to the chief, "";Yo, I get witcha, hops!"";
The guy that rescued us said, "";I hate to tell you
The captain of your ship, he had just escaped from Belview
We've been following him and finally we got him
We're sorry, there's no way that you can possibly get a refund"";
A thousand dollars and a weekend island drained
But a lesson well learned, so let me explain
There's a very important message that needs to be told
It's that everything that glitters ain't always gold
",Everything That Glitters (Ain't Always Gold)
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"(Get down)

[The Fresh Prince:]
I was.. cruisin down the avenue, early one Friday
When I saw what I thought was a lady walkin my way
I turned my back to ?????????????
And I said, ""Hm-hm, excuse me,"" and she walked past
She was about 5'6"", or maybe six and a half
With a body like a goddess, man, this girl was bad!
Tight leather pants that fit like a drum
And two big - yeah well, she had some
Anyway from behind she was fine
But when she turned around, her mustache was bigger than mine
At first I laughed, cause yo, to me that was funny
But the laughter ceased when she said: ""Hey honey!""
At first I was confused, I was somewhat spell-bound
My mouth wide open and my chin on the ground
And then it hit me, like a bolt from the sky
I thought: hold up - wait - this girl is a guy?!
I tried to get away, I said, ""Well, never mind
Maybe I'll see you some other time""
But then he grabbed me by my arm and told me I couldn't leave
And said, ""Hey boy, you look mighty cute in them jeans!""
This had to be the most embarrassing thing in the world
My whole neighborhood was watchin me get beat up by a girl
And when my homeboys came, they didn't let me explain
They said, ""Prince, you're a sucker, you should be ashamed""
My pride was busted right along with my eye
Cause my homeboys didn't realize that this girl was a guy
And in retrospect I had to laugh
I can't believe I didn't notice that this girlie had a mustache

[The Fresh Prince:]
I remember last year, the day was October 5th
And my family went away on a weekend ski trip
And they left $100 and a note by the phone
That said: 'Don't have any company till we get home'
No company? I'm 18! They must be jokin!
And by 10 my crib was smokin
All of my friends with their hands in the air
Screamin (PARTY OVER HERE, PARTY OVER THERE!)
The party was jammin till at least about 5
And as my friends were leaving, they were like ""Homes, it was live!""
I thought the party was over, but really was just beginnin
I turned around I thought I was dreamin, I saw four women
Dressed in red leather, tight to their booties
I gestured with my index finger: come here, cuties
I tried to be chill, I didn't wanna scare em
I said, ""Hi, my name's the Prince,"" they said, ""Hi Prince, we're your harem""
I didn't waste time, I started shootin the gift
I said, ""Y'all the type of girls I'd like to spend some time with""
I walked upstairs, my adrenaline was pumpin
Till one hit me in the head with a lamp or somethin
The next thing I remember is wakin up nearly dead
With another Fred Flintstone lump on my head
Of course I was mad, this type of thing can burn at you
They tied me up and they were stealin my furniture
I said, ""Yo sweetheart, what's wrong with you?
What kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do?""
She turned around and smiled and laughed
And that's the way that I noticed that the girlie had a mustache
Not four girls, four guys!
They were in disguise, it was a set up all the time
I made a complete fool of myself that day
My parents were pullin up just as the u-haul truck was pullin away
They walked in, looked like they seen a ghost
There I was, gagged and bound and tied to the bed post
My pop walked in and asked a brilliant question
""Son, where's the furniture and why is your room so messy?""
Obviously Sherlock Holmes had been arrived
I said, ""What do you think, dad, maybe we were robbed?!""
""I'm tied up, nothing's in one piece
Let's discuss the facts later, mom, please call the police""
I wanted to have a party, I thought I was clever
My pop told me I was on punishment forever!
And in retrospect I had to laugh
I can't believe I didn't notice that the girlie had a mustache

Give me your attention, stop what you're doin and listen up
Because my partner in rhyme is about to tear it up
Jeff, is if someone said that your beats don't excite
And that your cuts were wack, what would you say? (Yeah, right!)
Jeff's about to give an incredible display
And unequivocally prove that he's the best deejay
His name is Jazzy Jeff and he's preparin to shake and make you move

My deejay's swift and exciting and coming at you
To other deejays Jeff is just too much
He doesn't use the line switch as a transform crutch
Never missin beats, always on time with the rhyme
You know the scratches are fine when interwined with a bass line
Live in concert, Jeff is never Memorex
You don't believe he's def? Check the flex

I could talk forever, but still never explain
Why deejays flee when they hear Jeff's name
Jeff is number one, even though he just begun
Rulin hip-hop as if he was Attila the Hun
We make records, it all adds up a caleidoscope
We work hard, so people can't deny that it's dope

Around my way
They asked if me and Jeff would play
We said okay
We nipped out to get the hip hop apparatus
Came back with the posse in full effect status
While Jeff set up, I said ""check one two y'all""
Everybody clap lets begin to ball
I was rapping a capella but I had to stop
Because chaos broke because Jeff waz on the beat box

Just cut it up Jeff
*hip-hop*
*chance to rock*

Did you know that parties were all the same when we came up
We had to rearrange and make a change
I remember how it was people standing still
The music was wack so they chose to get ill
People started breaking and fights would start to break out
This is the reason why some people make out
Hip-hop to be bad
Because of this behaviour
Then like a miracle two musical saviours
One with a microphone
The other with tables
Both up ready both willing and able
Burst on the scene like TNT

Cant you see it's Jeff and me
We all blazed as musical scholars
Fast admiration ??? dollars
Couple of kids with a bright idea
Didn't want a 9 to 5 made rap careers
People tried to diss and make the egos shrink
But we believe in ourselves so to hell what they think
Moving like a freight train we can't be stopped

But straight up man you gotta give him his props
There's not many people who can do what he does
Marly Marl, Teddy Riley and herbie the luvebug
But other than that there's not many around
That can take that box and make it sound
Like anything that you could possibly want
Now heres a rhyme that sums it up
Jeff is diggy diggy d dope and
You DJ's out there keep hopin
His beat boxers will be broken
But you might as well just keep hopin

That's right oh yeah I've got it I remember
I was discussin when Jeff's on stage
Yeah hands clap
Ya feet tap
Ya eardrums pulsate
Ya body will move
As ya flow with the groove

Cause I wrote the script you die in the end
So throw in the towel sign off just give it up
You tried to beat me in a game that I made up
And by the time you learnt the rules and tried to change your fate
It's too little too late sorry chump check mate
I'm in the room to do my thing
You wanna battle lets go just get your butt in the ring
Ten seconds and its over I yell out who's next
I got you off guard with the lyrical suplex
I flex my lyrics so that you cant jinx
The ship that wont sink more popular than the Sphynx
I'm a cardo will strong just like a dinosaur
You want more your not scared then what your running for
Cause I'm the incredible I do the impossible
I'm known to destroy you and your crew if you follow the rules
I'm number one I'm the Prince I'm the lyrical gun

Cause I'm a weapon you heard what I said
And I should have a danger sign on my forehead
Cause I'm lethal, fatal, unstable

Waiting to blow if there's a flick or a static
To ignite the fuse in the room you feel the doom
You tried to break but there's no escape
From the jaws of death you took the bait
Wait and if I say so you may go
It's like mother mayor May It oh hell no
Go ahead and play me if you think I'm a joke
Just keep a brace around for when your neck gets broken
Cause your gambling just like craps and Trump go ahead roll
Snake eyes you lost chump
That's the way its gonna be every time you try to go rhyme for rhyme

Your rhyming is weak your rhyming is wack
Wherever you got it from I suggest that you take it back
Hold up hobbes you say you made it up
Then cut your head off because your brain sucks
You should a stayed back
You should a laid back
You Should a prayed that
I didn't come back
But I came back
Remember way back
You used to say that
I wrote wack raps
Now your screaming out somebody tame that
Lyrical cyclops yo prince please stop
Somebody call the cops go get you some eye drops
Now heres a word for the wise don't go into the light
That's how I get ya cause I'm a poetic poltergeist
Now in ya mind is a vision
That's driven by my decision
To become an imaginational figment
Which gives you the freedom to explore and roll around with your mind And
Disappear when you look behind

Now brothers and sisters
There comes a time in your life you've got to get up and get busy
Can I get a witness?
(Yes, brother, yes!)
Now I don't know if you're prepared to embark upon this journey
But the time is running out
Brother Jazzy, break it down

[ VERSE 1: The Fresh Prince ]
Liggedy-ladies and gentlemen, hello, and how are you doin all?
Now there's a problem that we really have got to solve
In our society there's a big mess
People are having entirely too much stress
And me and Jeff, yo, we've been workin on
A way to ease your everyday burdens of
Work and school, because we thought that we should
Make a record that makes people feel good
This is a remedy, simple and basic
You work too hard, come on, face it
You gotta treat yourself, you deserve it
Dance like a wild person, come on, you earned it
Young and old and old and young
Relax, come on, cool out, come and get some
You gotta let yourself go get loose, it's
Cool - dance to the music

[ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ]
Say ?J-e-f? this beat is def
Can I get a witness, Jeff? (Yes)
Are you ready to start things off yet?
(-) Aight bet
Clap your hands and dance, come on, let's do this
Here is a hip-hop track with a new twist
Designed to ignite a subliminal dance fuse
And even if you can't dance, you can't lose!
It's for everybody, you included
We hooked up a beat and a rhyme and e.q.-ed it
We put it on a tape and took it to [Name]
And then we - yo Jeff, where's my beat at?
Oh, there it is, back to the story line
The music and rhyme are designed to make you have a (good time)
At the party, or wherever you hear it pumpin
Get up and twist or breakdance or shake somethin
Yo man, this groove is all of that!
And it's different from anything we've done, in fact
I might even go as far as to say
This cut shines bright on the darkest day
And sometimes you really need some light
Like when your teacher or boss ain't actin right
This will quench your thirst to chill, it hits the spot
Give em a taste, yo Jeff, let the beat rock

( *only the beat is heard* )

[ BREAK: The Fresh Prince acting as 'The Reverend' ]
Now Brother Jazzy
Please enlighten us with a bassline
( *Jazzy Jeff lets the bassline play* )
And for all the people assembled before us
Brother Jazzy, scratch
( *Jazzy Jeff cuts* )

[ The Fresh Prince ]
We're at the top, not the bottom or the middle
We're the freshest, the deffest, the best, Jeff, cut it up a little

(Oh, I get it, you wanna dance!)

[ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ]
Ahhhh... the time is now to get up and dance and move
And clap and jump and jam and feel the groove
I want you wigglin and jigglin and stompin and shakin
And showin your approval for the records me and Jeff are makin
We got a brand new album out
And dancin and shakin and movin is what it's all about
We want everybody to get busy
You're not down with the Rev, then get with it
This is a new age, history turned a new page
They said that we would decay and I say who do they
Think they're dealing with, a couple of amateurs?
I'm willin to bet to where this jam hits
At your job and at your school dance and also on the radio
Winter inside the house, summer on the patio
Let me get out of here before I lose it
But remember the motto, y'all: dance to the music

[ OUTRO: The Fresh Prince acting as 'The Reverend' ]
Now now
Ladies and gentlemen of the congregation
We realize you are not in a position to get up and dance right now
So we'd like to ask of you, if you're in your car, honk your horn
Honk your horn to the rhythm
We'd like to ask, if you're behind the desk at your job
We'd like you to tap your pen and pencil to the rhythm
If you're walkin down the street
You can be a little discreet
And snap your fingers to the beat
But if you are in a position
To get up and dance
We'd like to ask you to wiggle and jiggle everything you got
And get involved with it

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"I was in a club, one Friday.
A lovely Lady comes walking my way.
She walked up and she said hello.
I said hi, my names Joe.
I was lyin', so was she.
She said her name was Donna,
But her shirt said Marie.
Once you get to know me,
You'll never forget me.
I said why, then she bit me.

Ouch!
That didn't hurt.
Kinda nicked me,
But she ripped my shirt.
At that point I fell asleep.
Woke up at her house,
In the back of a jeep.
A Blazer, '89
Tinted windows,
I wish it was mine.
Oh, it is,
But where are my keys?
There they are...in the ignition.

I'm at her house.
It's a Tepee.
No, a cavern
No, a skyscrapper.
No, an igloo.
No, it's a shack.
Forget it, I'll go around back.
It's a castle, with a moat
How I get Across...Boat.

(Twilight Zone noise)
Shooo...I hate that sound.

I went inside,
Looked right, looked left.
There she is.
Oh, no Thats Jeff.
He's invisible.
I went downstairs.
It's a loft.
No, it's a dungeon!
There she is, doing areobics.
No, yoga.
No, karate.

*You killed my teacher!!!*
But what a body!

No, she wasn't there.
I'm tellin you I saw her.
No, really I saw her.
She was playing checkers.
No, Nintendo.
Ok, I'm lying.

There she is,
Watching T.V.
All My Children.
No, thats Cosby.
No, Speed Racer.
No, thats Shaft.
No, thats Kimble.
My fault...the T.V.'s off.

There she is, what a doll.
No, that's Chucky from Child's play!
I kissed her,
And she told me this is home...
I entered a dimension Called The Twilight Zone....
Where anything can happen.

I'm rough like sandpaper,
Hard like algebra.
You should be glad that I was nice,
And I allowed ya to
Step on stage.
To kick your ryhmes off.
I tried to be nice,
But you mistook that for softness.
Now it's goin' to hell with your opinion!
What I say goes fom now on,
This is my dominion!
Are there any rappers to step on stage
Cause if you do You'll feel the force of my rage,
I'm on a rampage!!!!!!!

Syche just hit me.
Jeff wanted to do that,
But I didn't.
I thought that it would make the reccord dumb.
I guess I wasn't wrong.

Jack and Jill went up a hill,
To fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down,
And broke his crown....
Hickory, dickory, dock.

Got to use the bathroom now,
Sike, I was drafted.

",Too Damn Hype [*]
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Now a joke is a joke and funny games are chill
But this isn't funny y'all this is straight up ill
Now there's a limit to humor and this is goin too far
I ain't laughin no more y'all now who stole my car

Now I don't know if you ever had a car stolen before
But it's a real crazy feeling when you walk out the door
And you don't need a map or any kinda chart
To know you're standin in the spot your car used to be parked
Now you know you parked your car there but yet you keep lookin
Cause your mind didn't accept yet that somebody took it
So you're scratching your head and tryin to get things clear
And it's always some idiot saying (you're sure you parked here)
To call the police would be the move that is smart
But instead you keep lookin where you know you didn't park
Searchin for reasons like maybe tickets you owed
Something to justify that - maybe it got towed
But not stolen n-never forget it
But then you ask yourself well where the hell is it
If there was a prize you'd win dummy of the year
Cause you're lookin somewhere else when you know you parked it here
So through never-neverland you find yourself strollin
Then when you finally accept that it's stolen
You call the police and they come and say
(That's the 437th car stolen today)
As if that's somethin that he really needed to mention
Then they start askin you real dumb questions
Like (well when's the last time that you saw it)
You idiot, right before they stole it
Now you're mad this cop is talkin to you
And somebody in your car headed to kalamazoo
Officer Fool or whoever you are
Would you please get off your butt and find who stole my car?

I remember my first car, never forget it
A candy apple red I ROC, windows deep tinted
Talk about fast like a rocket to drive
Went from zero to 60 in like 5.5
Imagine red rims but that wasn't enough
It had a car phone for when I wanted to reach out and touch
An alpine stereo the straight up rock
With 12"" woofers you could hear for blocks
The first day I got it I was frontin real hard
I could hear people sayin (damn, look at that car)
I was hyped and I wanted my friends to check it out
So I went to the spot where they're usually hangin out
Just my luck nobody's standin outside
And I didn't really feel like parkin my ride
So I honked my horn and nobody was comin
I thougth what the heck, I went inside and left it runnin
I was inside for 20 seconds that's all
I found my friends, I said, ""You gotta check this out, y'all""
But when we came back out the car wasn't there
(Man you ain't buy nothin) I did, I swear!
My friends went inside, I was mad they didn't believe me
Now i'm standin outside the spot my car used to be
It's hard to figure out what to do all alone
But then I got it: call the car phone

(Fresh Prince's car?)
Yo thief, bring my car back now
Before I bust your (hold up wait a minute pal)
(Seems like you forgot who's got the keys)
I thought: he's right, ""Well, bring it back, please""
Hello Mr. Thief, don't hang up
Aw then luckily Jeff pulled up
I told him what had happened someone stole my car
I said, ""Come on Jeff, let's get him, he can't be far""
We rode around for about 20 minutes
And we were just about to say forget it
When I spotted him, I said, ""Jeff, go get it!""
We pulled up behind him and man dude jetted
He was drivin all wild and fast
Like he was gettin points for the stuff that he crashed
I called him on the car phone again and I said
Of course you realize when I catch you you're dead
All through Philly was a high speed chase and
Dude was playin around like he thought we was racin
100 miles an hour and he lost control
And slammed my car into a telephone pole
I ran to the car said man you're okay
He said yeah so I punched him in the face
The cops came up as if it was my fault
They saw me punch dude and charged me with assault
If his neck was closer I probably woulda grabbed it
He told the cops that I said he could have it
I calmed down and they got things straight
I saw half my car at 7th street the other half at 8th
I wanted to just jump in the ocean
My car looked like it was a Lego explosion
Why does life have to be so hard?
Don't laugh, next time it could be your car

This story that I'm about to tell ya
Is all about this girl named Daliah
5'7"";, a Gucci queen
With gold all over that flowed like a stream
I met her in a club on a Saturday night
The girl's jeans were tight and I got hype
I thought about talkin to this little miss
But I kept seen guy after guy gettin dissed
Every guy that cracked got flagged
But somethin kept sayin (you) (you) (you bad)
I walked up and asked her to take a ride
I whispered in her ear, said, "";My car's outside"";
At first she laughed and said, "";Nah, not yet"";
Then I told her it's a 'Vette and she said "";bet"";
"";Under one condition: you gotta let me drive it"";
She kissed me on the lips and I said (you got it)

(You got it)

[ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ]
Oh what sweet music she and I made
Only I was gettin dissed while she was gettin paid
Everything that I owned, she took it
All the way down to my foodstamp booklets
I was contemplatin her bein my wife and
All she was tryin to do was syfin
Every single dime that she could extort
She was Jane the Ripper, and she couldn't be caught
My friends tried to tell me but I stood behind her
(The girl ain't nothin but a 49er)
They tried to tell me but I couldn't be told
Because her beauty was a shovel that was diggin for gold
Diamonds and furs, I spent all I had
And took her shoppin every day at Sack's 5thve.
Visa, Mastercard and even Discover
She told me this is the way that I can show her I love her
My friends tried talkin to me, they tried stoppin me
(If she had a gun they'd arrest her for robbery!)
I knew she was playin me for every dime
But I loved when people said (Homes, your girl is fine)
But then one day, yo, I got wise
I found out she was messin with a couple of guys
She told me that she loved me but I guess she forgot it
Oh, you wanna play hardball, huh? (You got it)

(You got it)

[ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ]
The final night that I caught this girlie
I was out of town and I came home early
I caught her in a club kissin some guy Fred
Stormed up right behind her, grabbed her and I said
"";Yo Daliah! What's up, baby?
Come on, you got to be crazy
That's your cousin? You think I'm a nut?
What kinda cousin would you let put his hand on your butt?
Nah girl, you done got out of hand
And it's about to seem like I'm the repo man
You vacumed all of my funds like a rug
But you stretched the cord too far, you pulled the plug
Let's what? Come on, it's too late to talk
It's like monopoly and I bought Cedar Boardwalk
But tomorrow you'll wake up and talke a look
And think the stockmarket crashed on your pocketbook
But it's over, now I want everything
All the way from Louis Vuiton bags to earrings
Especially the solid gold earring noodles
And the diamond watch, the whole kitten kaboodle
Don't tell me I'm trippin
Oh, you got amnesia now, you're forgettin
Who did what for who, I gave my all to you
I can't seem to see why you did wrong to me
I finally figured out what you're about
But it's the bottom of the night, two strikes and two outs
You can go make a sucker of another fellow
It's 12:01, let's give it up, Cinderella
I ain't goin for it, stop cryin

Look I'm a prince I'm supposed to have a harem
Well of course I like you
But I like her and I like that other girl too
What do you mean I'm just like those other singers
Look I don't see no rings on these fingers
I ain't ready to settle down quite yet
I wanna call my name on the night set
I want a shoe box wit hundreds of love notes
I want my phone to ring till it's broke
I wanna dance in France and Italy
And girls in Egypt thinkin' just of me
I wanna be in the mix that's all

I just want to talk to you
Now, I want to know why I gotta be a dog
Why d-o-g gotta refer to me
Look, baby, I'm twenty one years old
You know, I'm makin' a little bit of money
I'm just tryin' to see the world, have some fun, you know?
And yes, okay, look, I do have a lot of ""friends""
Well, uh, associates, I like to think of them as creative date associates
I mean, Yvette is my associate, Donna's my associate
I mean, I'm just tryin' to enjoy myself, but you keep callin' me a dog
Oh, I'm a dog? (Dog)

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"We gonna do a song

Me and my crew like to play around
Me like to laugh and joke and have fun while we going down
Born and raised in philly
We go jam and jam and jam actin silly
We got a dance we do at a party
That we'd like to introduce to everybody
It ain't the humpty nor the lambada
More party pump than a damn piniata
You may have seen it on my tv show
Yeah I know I dance like a pro
Cause I get busy and I get loose g
On the dance floor cant another brother juice me
Cause I'm smooth and I move loosely
With a spin or a kick like bruce lee
Come on get on the floor and take the chance
Everybody its time to dumb dance

Now what's a dumb dance you might ask
Well let me take you to my dumb dancin class
Its called dumb dance 101
It's where we teach smart people how to be dumb
Heres the background and heres what's up
Back in philly where we grew up
We used to party all the time
Just playing around and make a soul train line
This old train line the concept changed
To put it in joint got flipped and rearranged
The line turned into a contest yo
To see who could dance not the worst but the best though
So in philly the dance caught on fast
People starting challenging me to dance
So I got busy quick as the music was played up
How you gonna beat me at a dance I made up
Now you know that I can throw that
Body of mine fine so I'm about to show that
Guy who thinks he can do it a bit better
I'm the creator originator so go and get a seat to sit down
So I can demonstrate a dance that's easy to do
And you don't have to contemplate a move at all
Just take a bit of a chance
Its time to dumb dance

Everybody in the house just (clap your hands)
Come on just (clap your hands everybody)
just (clap your hands)
Come on just (clap your hands everybody)
Say (clap your hands)
Say (clap your hands)
Say (now we come to the real thing)
Ha

Well there it is y'all the dumb dance concept
But let me break it down for those of you who haven't got it yet
It's the new craze coming across america
And I really really really don't care if you do it with a partner
Or do it alone
If you do it at a club
Or you do it at home
If you really cant dance then heres ya chance
Go for yours on the dance floor everybody dumb dance

Extra, extra read all about Fresh Prince is back
You wonder how it
Happen
I wasn't rappin'
For a long time
But now I'm back with a strong rhyme
Look, near the camera, snap my picture
I'll sign my name on it, then I get richer
Like LL said don't call it a comeback
And face the fact Jack
I'm all that

(I know ya gonna dig this)

Here I am in the flesh
(Who is)
I'm the funky, funky, funky fresh
Rhyme authority
Rhythm console
Hip-hop liaison
Rap Ambassador
Do the daring, the king of the cut
Prince of poetry and all that stuff
Sexy, sexy, making the honey's yell
Girlies passin' out, ah well
Back from the dead, like Jason
People thought I was over, they were erasin'
Me and Jeff's names out of the hit list
But ah, ah, ah not so quick
Comin' back at cha
Can't go back at cha
Catch this fast ball I'm throwin' at y'all
Wake up and smell the coffee, I'm back now
Thanks for keeping my girl warm for me, pal
The man with the cape, the crown in the center
Out for a while, but wisely kept up
Pen and paper, so when I had my
Opportunity, to rap
I set my goals and then I shot for
What I do best, funny, to hell with hardcore
Voice on radio, face on TV
Spankin' new funky rhymes on a CD
Out to attack
The whack
Full contact
It's gonna be a long night go get a knapsack
I gotta getta make ya face the fact
That I'm the best rapper on wax
I'm all that

(Get wicked)

Get up, get down, get funky, get loose
I'm the best show and I got proof
In the past there was always that kid doubted
But now I'm back and there's no doubt about it
The writing is on the wall
(Come on)
Gimme ya mic and a stage and I'm a rip it, rip it, up y'all
'Cause I can flow
Is there another rapper in the world, like me? Hell no!
No one's like me
Others try to bite me
Bad deba deba bad mike me
Someone like me somewhere
To just not hear
Where the hell they at?
Who cares?
'Cause your got the ace in the hole
The simple lover brother
Numero uno
The rapper with soul
Comin' out a little on the new tip
For those of you that thought I couldn't do this
Yo well consider it done
It's the same got the parents
just don't understand the same one
people said that I couldn't rap
ha ha ha well you can stop that
'Cause I'm a rapper and a half
and in the past I chose to make people laugh
and I was criticized for that
some called me soft, some called me wack
I gotta admit y'all I felt bad
(Who'd ya call)
so as usual I called my Dad
He's sort of a fifty-one year old Casanova
He said son, ""Yo, come on over.""
He sat me down and he told me this
Son when your all that, you're gonna get dissed
He put his arms around me and he said son
I was all that when I was young
So pump that point on
And set my sights on
Making a record that people thought was the high joint
Philly, born and raised
I've been
Gone for days
I can't wait to get back
With my new track
Rhyme like lava
Voice like a volcano
I rhyme through your radio

Verse 1:

I'm just a telephone call away
You can pick it up and call me any day
And Ima listen to all you got to say
Cause I'm the type of man that never turn a woman away
Think of this as an invitation
Your heart to mine in a conversation
So when things get to much to bare like The Jackson 5 ""I'll be there""
Just call me up on the telephone
Call me up when you're all alone
And I'll give you a verbal massage
Until your man gets home
Or if you want to you know what you could do, well
You could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell

Chorus
Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell, ring my bell) Ring my bell, ring my bell (Ring my bell) RI-I-ING!!!

Verse 2:

I hate to see you cry, tear after tear while this guy
Plays you like your life is a game
I've seen his type and there all the same
Breaking your heart without a care
Girl if I was in you shoes he'd be outta there
Your man is wak good for nothin' but flack
I'd tell him to pack and hit the road Jack
Who loves ya baby I do you know he doesn't care about you let him go
Where he at now? You don't know Layin' up under some
hold up wait just let me chill
no need for me to get ill
Cause yo I'm the best but yo time will tell
But I'll be here so ring my bell

Verse 3:

Now I know this sounds like a fairy tale
But this ain't no children's book
I'm here, for you to take me dear
Just open your eyes and look at
What the future holds for you and if you lunch then you might ruin
Something great don't make a big mistake pay attention to what you're doing
Life is full of pitfalls, ups and downs
It's sort of a mission now you're on a rocky road
But you could get up just make that decision
That you want someone to love you adore you and hold you and treat you well
So when you're ready to be treated that way baby you can ring my bell

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the base and let the alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime

Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
A back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressing less
And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your jeep or your benzos
Or in your Nissan stting on lorenzos
Back in Philly we be ou in the park
A place called the plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beeping at
It's like the summers a natural afradesiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time

Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
'Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
'Cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4
Sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise
About the days growing up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playing out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wiping your car down
It's time to cruise so you head to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't spead through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion' of summer madness

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"
You're trapped on the dance floor
It's locked there's no escape
There's no eat no drink cant take a break
No seat to sit down you gotta stand up
The record on the wheel reacts like a handcuff
Your in a cage and this groove will bound you
People in the club like bars around you
The doors open up and the people are boarding
Here are the prisoners the DJ is the warden
Your mind is useless instinct takes control
Jam to techno
Groove to soul to soul
You been arrested
Now your being tested
The beat is a sex fiend, you're being molested
Stead drum kicks like pistol in spinal
You gotta dance and get round like a Rhino
The DJ cuts with a knife like a surgery
Sayin that the slice aint nice that's perjury
The music infiltrates you mutates you
Grabs you holds you moulds you and let you
Do things you wouldn't a otherwise done
Like shake rattle roll pump twist and then some
Ain't no law here you can't protest this
Stop looking around it ain't no oasis
You can't leave till the man pulls the needle
Take that as a warning
Take heed or I'll quicken the pitch and make you dance faster
The drum is the whip, bass line is the master
The temperature's a 100 and yet you still want more
You're a slave and your trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus:]
Oh oh I'm trapped like a ???
I can't get out
Can't you see I'm trapped
Can't you see I'm so confused
I can't get out

Now your wondering lost in a jungle
You came in hyped up but now your humble
Bringing out sweat in your silky wet clothes
You scream for help, blend in with the ??? and hoes
You try to sit but their ain't know spaces
The floor is a desert, a party oasis
I know your on the tip for the rhyme I just did
And here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid
Ay a prince it's the El Sid's version
I'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon
The floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene
The strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine
You try to move no form of escape
The heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape
Party's like a ???
Girls slim and trim on the floor
Don't try to shoot for the door
This ain't the gym
The party goers every night had a scene
This mic try to respond but still trapped like in Venus
Aint a spiff or a spoof
Boy you better not goof
You about to cave in although you ain't on a roof
The rhythm track from offside's to angles
Playing the wimp fight resist ... strangle
You can't escape until the DJ's fingers up
So play like a phone or coat and just hang it up
The speakers pumping out sounds and hip words
Lines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds
You better jam we don't care if you hardcore
Cause we got you trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus 2x]

Me and prince got together just to kick our lines
No trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines
Dance floor secure, don't bother tryin to get out
You looking for the late AM this man pull red out
Nobody cause killing is mean
Got ya dancin' in the dark and dressed like Springsteen
Razzamatazz a pasazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh
Soon as I worked through the door
I got trapped on the dance floor
See this girlie that I never saw
She was looking raw
Came a little closer
Then I opposed her
Then I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her
??? planes in the damn chain
Hard to explain
I did it up like I was straight outta Soul Train
Listen as I discuss this yo bust this
Like a hammer before me you cant touch this
Trapped on the floor like a vulture
Part of my culture
You may even thought I was drived to faulter
Get live like a ???jack that fives you the window main???
Add a little mic and janet you cant understand it
Cause ??? thought I was from another planet
Way of whipping and dipping
And sliding ??? of what I'm providin
Other dancers go and hide
Like Charles ???
I'm prancin
I keep the dance all night until
The party's over the party's over
Like a cowboy at a rodeo
From mister mister dosie doe
Around the dance floor
Steppin the new hardcore
I'm Jazz Fresh and I'm trapped

[Chorus]

Max up to step up
Just to keep this rap up
The time that he possesses the best in a contest
Jeff with his right and left like Jazz Fresh
No other than the brother the lover Jazzy Jeff
I'm the one dance floor at the station
??? time around quarter to ten
Times work hard
The customers scarred
Your tickets to freedom
Yo you ain't gonna need em
Your sentence is 25 years to life
A ??? is your husband and wife
Trapped behind the steel
The steel of the wheels
Don't come to the party if you don't wanna know how business feels
I walk strong carry a big stick
Sell myself all packed and thick
When they sound the drum you know its time to roll
Might as well have fun there's no parol
I set a trap and caught you like a mouse
For times ahead no chance for a halfway house
Pump the bass in all sections
Prince, sid, and jazz my officers of correction
Cant' escape the floor cut the crime out
??? wall ain't no use tryin to climb out
Cause I'm running this show and it's live in here
You try to escape another five years
I got you trapped and I'm your savior
You dance real hard you might get out on good behavior
But if you don't I give you more
'Cause DJ Jazzy Jeff got you trapped on the dance floor

[Fresh Prince]
I Got the call about eleven fifteen
Twelve o'clock arrived on the scene
Looked around and things were ill
The party was at a dead stand still
People sittin' around no music
The situation was somewhat confusing
But I'm a detective I knew right away what happened
Somebody stole the D.J.
Who or why I had no clue
But I knew what I had to do
No eat no sleep, just work
Then walked past this fly mini-skirt
I had to dis her quick before she greeted
Come on baby I'm working, beat it
Come on I'm busy, just go away
Gotta find out who stole the D.J.
 
[Jeff]
Lets, Lets Go
 
[Fresh Prince]
This mystery needed to quickly be solved
Cause there were kids involved
Friday and Saturday nights had no songs
Why, because the D.J. was gone
Smiles you used to dance and sing around
Now were replaced by frowns
And it was up to me to solve the mystery
And get back the disc jockey
I found an eye witness
But his breath wreaked of chitlins
All I know is his breath did pound
Buddy forget it, just write it down
No fingerprints no clues
The only witness was the bad breath dude
It was up to me to save the day
And find out who stole the D.J.

Through the door this dame walked in
I swear to James Bond a perfect ten
I thought to myself I'm working just forget it
Then I thought well maybe I've got a minute
So I took her down to the station
To the back room for some interrogation
Captain doesn't like it, but I must confess
I interrogate best when I'm undressed
We were in there for hours drained
To see who would break first, me or the dame
Then she broke, and her mind was my possession
(Prince I love you)
That wasn't the question
I only want to know one thing
I've gotta make the kids dance and sing
So tell me now cause crime don't pay baby
Who stole the D.J.
 
I scarrowed the city but still no clue
Lost like a cause, what should I do
Then like a bolt of ligtening it hit me
Ah, the worst villain in the city
I wasn't prepared for what was in store
He had stolen the D.J. before
You all know this ruthless foe
To his hideout
(Let, lets go)
Tip toed up the steps
Slowly and ever so quietly I crept
But out of nowhere I was attacked
Just like in the movies, clubbed from the back
I felt like a fool
(Man, you need to go back to private eye school)
I was the dunce of the day
There I was tied up with the D.J.
 
[Jeff]
Let's Go
 
[Fresh Prince]
There we were both tied to a pole
I told the D.J. relax its under control
(Relax man, we both goin' down you can't even keep yourself untied)
Do you want to be free or not
I'm gonna get us out of this tight spot
I planned this all along cap
There a knife in my swiss army hat
With the blade I cut the rope
(Man your secret services spy hats dope)
I radio'd for back up cars
So we could put this crook behind bars
Another criminal off the streets
Another D.J. back to his beats
I walked in the club and I was happy to say
Ladies and gentlemen, here's your D.J.

Then my damn hat blew off in the wind
I got kind of mad cause it's the hat I just bought
I should of put her out it was all her fault
Day was Friday date was the tenth
My girl was looking good on her strength
She smacked my hand when I put it on her knee
I said hit me again and I'll break your wrist
That day I dressed all in white
Taking my girl to Palm Springs for the night
I was hoping I could find a short cut
I was tired plus I had a rash on my butt
There was this lady in a pinto coup
About ninety years old I could tell by the droop
Driving all fast border line insane
Glasses so thick couldn't stay in her lane
I swerved left and I swerved right
But she was still tale gating me too damn tight
To the left lane I tried to switch then
You saw my blinker bitch

We both pulled off on the side of the road
I was hot ready to explode
The only thing stopping me from breaking her nose
Was I was 21 and she was ninety years old
Then the police came turned the lights off
The lady started crying and the cop got soft
The cop said oh it'll be okay
Wrinkled old bag looking like a sharpe
I said wait what's going on cap
Her cars fine my cars all wrecked
Then I saw what happened in the crash
Her dentures came out got stuck in the dash
You hit me I didn't hit you
Stop holding your neck lady you can't sue
It's your fault you caused all this
You saw my blinker bitch

Wednesday, October the fourth
That's when we got our day in court
That lady destroyed my case
When she came in a wheelchair and a neck brace
I jumped up I said you must be joking
Come on judge her neck ain't broken
Well I'll be damned
Wrinkled old bag started crying on the stand
The bailiff grabbed me slammed me on the ground
Judge said boy you better come down
Aren't you one of them damn rap singers
Yeah, then I gave him the finger
Judge held me contempt of court
For giving him the finger and things of that sort
Anything to say before you're dismissed
Just one you saw my blinker bitch",You Saw My Blinker
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Right here, right.
(Yep)
When I was a young boy growing in Philly, I
Was sort of easy going, I
Was really a silly I
I used to mess around
I was kind of the class clown
I hate to see you frown
I hate to see people down
Cause I like it when fun flows like a faucet (uh)
But sometimes, some guys mistake it for softness
But I ain't no silly sappy singin softy
When push comes to shove, ya better back up off me
Cause I am 6'2 and I ain't no little guy
200 pounds and homie I can make the heads fly
My father told me never hit nobody first
But if they hit you son (Yeah), take them to a hearse
So throughout my life those are the rules that I've lived by
A sucker put his hands on me homie I'll give a guy
A jab, jab, jab, uppercut, jab
Get 'em a steaks slab
And put 'em in a cab (Uh)
Now I ain't the type of brother to go out and pick a fight
But man, man I really, really, hate to hear stuff like
Michael Jackson said, ""this sorta thing silly manâ?¦""
A lover not a fighter, better stay out a Philly man.
Put up your dukes, so you better start boogen
A sick upper punch when you lunchin' and ain't lookin'
An mx uppercut, aim for the mouth
Not from the north, or the east, or the west, it's comin'
From da south
And I'm throwing it hard
From da south
Right up under your guard
From da south
An uppercut with all I got
(Watch them drop!)
Put up you dukes; it's time to get loose troop
101, with me and you, and me and you're whole crew
You heard about the uppercut is that's what''s wrong fellas
You're all chickens and for doers getting jealous
Fail one bang 'em
Rumble and all buggin'
All different names but all the same buggin'
Maybe you can take me out, yeah maybe not
''Cause fly into the uppercut (Here they come) and hear you're body shout
Boom shakala laka Boom shaka laka Boom! 
Look out
It's coming at you like a Kodak zoom
No, my name ain't Roberta, don't be giving me flak
And if you step off track, Jack, 
Youâ??re taking a turn, nap
A muscle bound sucker, mean jack to Will
When I walk on by better be glad I chill 
But if yâ??all forfeit and I feel friction
The landlord is givinâ?? ya teeth dental piction
Xâ??s over eyes and birds around ya heads, flyinâ??
Limp all back
Look like I hit you with a bat
Eyes so black (diggy, diggy)
Look like ya must a got em painted
Damn!
That uppercutâ??s a mother ainâ??t it
Step in the ring
With the king
And you take a chance
â??Cause 20 seconds later yâ??all be out in a ambulance
Lookin pathetic
As you wrestle paramedic
Whatâ??s up?
Felt like a truck
But it was only an uppercut
Jus last week some fool got careless (Yeah)
So I got triflinâ??
Went right for the bare fist
After the punch the young man didnâ??t want a fight
I missed his face
But I busted the stoplight
So put up youâ??re dukes, so you better start bookinâ??
A sick upperpunch 
When you munchinâ??
And ainâ??t lookinâ??
An mx uppercut aim for your mouth
Not from the north, or the east, or the west, itâ??s cominâ??

I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)

Sitting in a hotel room
A thousand miles away from nowhere
Sloped over a chair as I stare
Out the window I sigh as I'm thinking

I take a sip of the juice I been drinking
I'm trapped inside of me
Lost in the memory
Of how things used to be

I think somebody better call a doctor quick
Oh never mind I'm just a little homesick
Thinking of my mum and my dad
And when I was young good damn I was a bad boy

I remember playing catch a girl, kiss a girl
Like a sucker getting slapped every time I pucker
But I kept on chasin'
Kept on running kept coming like Jason
Much nostalgia keeps bouncing through

[Chorus]
There's no place like home (yeah)
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
There's no place like home
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
There's no place like home

Yo there ain't no place like home
And I'm itching for the hood when I cross the states I roam
On tour getting the crowds going wild and
Stacking the honeys in a pile and putting em on file

XL a paragon on the scene
Fancy hotels and getting chauffeured in a limousine
Travel the world and yet my heart is achin
I be Yearning and burning for my mums eggs and bacon

Yo, there ain't no place like home, place like home
Ain't no place like home
Uh, I feel like Dorothy so I tries it
Kicks my heels but my Jordans wouldn't 'ize it

So back to reality
Back to Philly, get back to my family
It's fun to see strange places
But sometimes I want to see familiar faces

Like charlie mack, bam, nut and wood
Names kinda funny but as friends go real good
Ain't no place like home for true
And that's why

[Chorus: x2.5]

Sitting in an airport my mouth watering
It's thanks giving day I'm just putting my order in
I call my mum on the phone kind a demanding
Don't stop cooking mum at seven I'm landing

She just laughed and said I don't intend to
My grandma picked up and then she ran the menu
There was turkey and stuffed corn and macaroni and cheese
And sweet potato pies ooh grandma please

On the plane now my mind drifting
Thinking of the way it used to be on Christmas
My mum used to put us to bed about nine
Saying it's, ""o f t baby, ol' folks time""

That'd be down stairs laughing and jamming
But then (boo) raise ya seats back for landing
I walked in the house I felt the love
And my grandma saw me and screamed

Now here come all the hugging
I got such a feeling of emotion and love
Because can't nobody can hug you the way your grandma does
Give me a shovel and put some feed on my plate

My father said grace right before we all ate
And after he was finished I put a p.s. on
I said yo, ""there ain't no place like home
And I thank God to be here with all of you""
'Cause I was feeling

Happy Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
And all that sumthin sumthin (There's no place like home)

But we'd also like to encourage you
To take this opportunity to pause (There's no place like home)
Just take a minute and stop and look around at your family
And thank God for them (There's no place like home)

Because they not always be here with you

Buckwild, 'cause yo, that's kind of my style,
Check it,
On the town with a girl named Kay-Bee,

And a bow-wow-wow yippie-yo yippie any way,
I was straight out illin',
Why do I say so? 'cause yo, my girl was home chillin',
Fancy restaurant me and Kay frontin',

It was called Lay... um, Jay... um, somethin',
I was ready to attack her, uh,
Giving the sex look like Dracula,
A little bit of soft music playin',

And Don Perrier, it was on, know what I'm sayin',
Every thing was lovely, but then,
What the damn, my girlfriend walked in,
Oh my goodness, danger, trouble, dread,
Oh I'm dead, mayday code red

My oh my, what am I to do?
Gotta get away, cause my girlfriend's coming through,
Um Jay, I gotta, um, well, see, there's well, this, um, exscuse me,
To the back with the mucho-quickness,

My girl's gonna kill me and leave no witnesses,
I'm in the bathroom hiding like a punk,
But there's bars on the windows, I can't jump,
Exit stage left, quickly plan be	,

Gotta find a way that my girl won't see me,
Crawling on the floor, I'm feeling sick,
Like this some old Charlie Chaplin flick,
[unknown] pound and a round a mile-a-minute,

This time I really done did it,
Down on my hands and knees on the floor,
I'm looking at the front door,
Ready, set, make the dash,

Her back is turned, maybe I can get past,
I almost made it, but then, damn, she turned her head,
Code red
Break it on down

All was perfect, the ship was sailing,
But now it's sinking, so yo, I'm bailin',
I kept on runnin' even though she saw me,
And I sat and waited at home for baby to call me,

I watched a little TV,
Phone started ringing 'bout 12:23,
I picked it up real slow, and said,
""Mmm... hello?"",

She wasn't having it, she snapped, went berserk,
Girl made my head hurt,
I tried to be as cool as I could be,
I said hey, wasn't me,

You know the man ain't at all wack
The magnificent movie astoundin
The crowd goin loco, kick drum poundin
People surroundin us checkin the concept
Cuttin up a storm that's why the crowd is all wet
Other DJ's standin around Jeff
Tryin not to give up props to the worlds best
Shakin his hands tryin to say that he can't flow
Cause Jeff is a horse though that they all turn to
A mellow kinda fellow but in the past he
Been known to get a attitude and get right nasty
Snatch the wax, it's a fact not a figment
To get real and rip wheels its downright ignant
And when he step off, toss the confetti
He burn more wheels that Mario Andretti
Jeff is there anythin left you want to say to the crowd

Clap your hands, wind it up, if you're feelin' the vibe
Nod your head from side to side, as you ride the vibe
'Cause it's a party all night
You can't fight the feelin' you feelin'
'Cause you're feelin' fine wit' nothing really on your mind
It doesn't matter if you're wit' your crew
Because (they can feel the same way too)
I came to get down (you came to get down?)
You came to get down? (we came to get down)
I like that sound
'Cause it's a party over here, party over there
Party right here (hey)
Few over there (hooo)

Keep it flowin', keep it flowin', keep it flowin' now
Keep it going, 'cause this is for you
So (you can feel the same way too)

[Chorus]

You know the puck don't stop here
Fuck, the puck started here
That's why I gotta put my heart in here
To give you that old funky-funky-funky-funky-junky funk
That I know you want
So get your boom box so we can boom blocks
Or shake it up somethin' pride for life
'Cause we rockin', right?
It ain't a question 'bout bein' true
Because (you can feel the same way too)
A little somethin' for the radio (hooo)
A little somethin' for the video (hooo)
A little somethin' for the jeeps (ride-ride)
A little somethin' for the streets (hey, hey)
A little somethin' for the homies on the block
A little somethin' for the honies in the flocks
A little somethin' from me to you
So (you can feel the same way too)

[Chorus]

Nine Trey, everybody wanna be a gangsta
Buck-buck-buck-buck, but no more, thanks to me
You got somethin' you can flip on the other tip
As you get lost in the smooth rhymes I rip
Years and years my peers misunderstood
That I made cuts from my guts to make you feel good
And if you get it, this is for you
So (you can feel the same way too)
Put your hands in the air, come on now
Put your hands in the air, come on, yeah
Feel the vibe, Jazzy Jazz in the place, right
The upper-ground sound and pound to knock you outta your hide
Feelin' a'ight? You feelin' a'ight? (yeah)
You feelin' a'ight? You feelin' a'ight? (yeah)
Well next time bring a friend wit' you
So (they can feel the same way too)

[Chorus]",I'm Looking for the One (To Be With Me)
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"The F-L-why guy

About to toss some action

Here I go again with a groove to move you

Somethin' kinda smooth, you can bop your head to

Chill it, the feel, you can play it anytime

Its smooth, is the groove, play it back behind the rhyme

So please, put a freeze, on hooving and hollering

Fans deserve more, for their hip-hop dollar, man

And I'm just the rapper to deliver

The rapper that can give a

Funky rhyme, flowing like a river

Silky, silky, kind to the ear

Diction perfect, rhymes all clear

Tempo moderate, this ain't no marathon

Step back, new jack's, observe the paragon

Ha, who? what?, why?, when?

Don't be looking around clown, that's right, I'm back again

With the dopeness, you're head is bopping isn't it?

Yeah I thought so. Yo, I'm just kickin' it.



Yeah---

Just kickin' it' â??Yeah, Yeah

I'm just kickin' it



I really cannot kick it

Just kickin it

Jus watch me y'all; I'm jus kickin it â?? kickin it

Uh Just kickin it

Yeah, yo I'm just kickin' it



Just kick, and just kick it

Just kickin it -Ooh

Prepare for a voyage, just close your eyes

Who ain't ready, holler out I

Well ain't nobody hollering, 'cause all is perfect

The groove is a wave, and my rhyme's a surfing

The track design

With a rhyme in mind

Bidi budup up up, the charges will climb

Every young rapper trying to get you to jump

But when you're all done jumpin', I'm a git you what you really want

Track by track displaying my ability

The man, FP, showing true dexterity

On the Mic, no rules are lawless

Wicked, and a kicker and my rhymes are flawless

So sit back, relax and allow me to rock ya

With a hit that you're gonna get mentally locked to

A hip-hop solid and all flow, flower

I post up, together, better than Noah

A cut, to kick it too, kind to the ear drum

All true poetry, for me y'all be hearin' some

So extra, extra, read all about it

I slam a the hell out of those that doubt it

I'm rippin' every city I been in

Coast to coast, not to boast, but I'm winning

My fans are powerful, and that's the way I'm living

All about effort y'all





Yo, I'm just kickin' it

Uh Just kickin' it

Yeah, yeah, I'm just kickin' it



Just kickin' it

Come on. Come on, I'm just kickin it



Just kickin' it

Now, I'm just kickin it'



Just kickin' it â?? Just kickin' it

Let's take a trip, mellow out while I'm rappin'

Ya mind is the boat, and my rhyme's the captain

So hoist a sail, and its time to flow

To a place that other rappers don't go

Welcome, welcome, into my territory

Everbody get on up, and get busy for me

Heads are boppin hard and fast

And now I'm getting' sued 'cause my groove caused whiplash

Everytime a rhymer tried to

Say something smooth, that'll move inside you

The way that you should feel when you hear a real rap

Is trapped in the rhyme and your climbing to the climax

A lyrical painter, the fresh prince

And y'all a know of my Picasso essence

Musical passion, lovely isn't?

But ain't nothin' to it

Yo, I'm just kickin it



Just kickin' it- Just kickin'

Check me, check me, just kickin it



Just kickin' it- Just kickin it

Like Pronto y'all, I'm just kickin' it



Just kickin' it

Uh, I'm just kickin' it



Just kickin' it

Yo, I'm out



Just kickin' it

Just kickin' it

Just kickin' it

Just kickin' it

Laa-aha

Just kickin' it

He-he-he-ha

Just kickin' it

Just kickin it

Just kickin it

Just kickin' it

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Shadow dreams
Dreams of a shadow
The analogy of a shadow dream
Dreams are to shadows as your shadows are to your dreams
In the deepest of the darkness it seams as though they're gone
In the light they are visible
Yet intangible and illusive
Your shadow is the true validation of the fact that you exist
Hence shadow dreams

And here we go
Shadow dreams they seem so distant
But the light is strong and no you can't resist it
Keep on pushing, hold out your hand
But light is your friend go on in Caroline
Its always darkest before the light
Nothing's worth having if its not worth a fight
No love without labor, no labor no love
Draw on the strength bestowed from above
What can go wrong will go wrong
But if you fall off a horse just get back on

""I have a dream"" the man stated
A shadow dream that he chased to his grave
Just because a dream is lurking in the shadows
Doesn't mean that you should just forget it
I mean you work and you push and you sweat
And you toil and you strive and drive 'til you get it shadow dreams

[Chorus:]
Shadow Dreams
Dreams of a shadow (shadow dreams)
Shadow Dreams
Dreams of a shadow

Every dark cloud is hiding a silver lining
But don't forget to mobilise, keep on climbing
Do all you can to keep your shadow alive
Because your not far behind if your shadow dies
Make sure you stop and you check tonight
That your shadow is behind you when you walk through the light
'Cause a man without a shadow ain't a man at all

I mean I take it just for granted that my homies on the wall
Kids see the shadows and they want to play
But sometimes their stolen, taken away
Adults are the thieves, the kids get robbed
Throw away that shadow boy go and get a job
Just because the dream is lurking in the shadows
Doesn't mean that you should forget it
I mean you work and you push and you sweat
And you toil and you strive and drive till you get it shadow dreams

[Chorus]

Fourteen years old I used to want a Beamer
I guess you could say I was what you'd call a shadow dreamer
I told my father that I didn't think I'd ever get in
I said I might as well just forget it
My father said Son, don't be talking so dumb
Hard work and education makes anything come
And plus a shadow dream ain't as far as ya seem Son
You used to be a shadow dream

Life is a mystery but lets check history
To see how many peoples shadow dreams came true
And if the other peoples shadow dreams are equal
Then why can't the next shadow dreamer be you
That's the philosophy I live my life by
When things get hard through the stress and strife I
Keep on pushing with a full head of steam
Like a train through the tunnel to my shadow dream

[Chorus x 2]

Uh ha

Knew you left brand new on the radio

I told Jeffrey buy me a car
He don't treat me any differently

Lets take a trip down memory lane
You know back before everybody knew my name
Before all the jewelry the fame and the cheers
When i was just the kid with the big old ears
In west Philadelphi born and raised
That's the phrase you hear on Mondays
But lets get a little bit deeper than that
Back when Jeff was on the scratchback
And I was on the rap
I used to buy records at this audio store
I barely had a dime when I walked out the door
I tried to get a break but they could never seem to cut me
Now I've got the money and they wanna give me stuff for free
That's somethin that I'll never understand
Yo I can afford it give the break to the next man
You say I'm a star 'cause I'm large in the land
But excuse me what I do doesn't define who I am
Shaq, Denzel, Quincy Jones what's the category?
It's folks you look up to
The thousand dollar answer is up on the board
Um who is a star
(Buzzer) Sorry no score
People be flippin when they see me around
But yo don't trip just give me a pound
Step up and say hi it don't matter who you are
Come on what you all starin for?

[Chorus]

Out to see a movie chillin with my millie
Actin kind of silly
In downtown Phillie
You wanna see a new flick i wanna see a classic
So we flip a coin and we settle on Jurassic
Park the only thing that counts is we could do it up
Got some popcorn for the theater
Everything goin just fine
Then this girl from behind recognized me in the line
I turned around and i smiled and she laughed
She said how you doin can i please have your autograph?
I said ya and as she reached for her pen
Her boyfriend said he aint nobody f him
F me yo what did i do?
Watch your mouth man i don't even know you
I'm a peaceful man real easy
I said look you got a problem with me
He said ya I don't like the way you act
Cars and jewelry and wavin like you all that
I'm not sweatin you no matter who you are
I didn't ask you to homie

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Listen homeboys don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know

But by the way sweetheart what's your name
She said my friends like to call me exotic Elaine
I said my name is the Prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy

But enough about me yo let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine

I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me did I like her I said well kinda
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street

She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape

I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death

I was arrested charged with agrivated assault
(yo Clancy we got him)
But it wasn't my fault
Nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble

But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away
I was in a bar one Friday night

Cooling watching a Mike Tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on Tequilla
When this girl walked up she said hi my name is Sheila
I responded by saying hello

She paid for my drink and then said let's go
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses

She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing

Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move

I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin

And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb
I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go
I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm

And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were on pants back on Sheila's book case
I was done sneezing and coughing

I hope this doesn't happen to often
But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play

Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away
Jazzy: yo man you think they see your point
Prince: I don't know I don't think they really do
Jazzy: I think you should give 'em another example

Prince: awright give me a scratch let's make it funky right here
I got a ring on my phone May 5th last year
It was my girlfriend Betty I said hello dear
I was just about to call you I got a couple tickets to the Run DMC concert

(I'm wit it)
It's six o'clock now at eight will you be ready
(yeah)
Aight fine see you then Betty

I combed my hair washed and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ????
Got to Betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until Betty's mon said Betty's not ready yet

I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said I need a little longer to finish my hair

At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says let's go
Go where go to sleep I'm gone
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home

But it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme just remember my rhymes

Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away

Then you having these crazy nightmares

Today, sun high.. up in the sky
From N.Y. la la to M.I., just cruisin

Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin

Zero to sixty, flossin - 90 degrees
Sony cartridges, ten CD's each
Reach to the beach, Southside leanin
It ain't often I'm off and I'm feenin for the -
- top down, drop down got me hot now
Heated up can't stop now
What up cutie wop?  Sure sure is cookin yo
I know I'm spoken for, can't hurt lookin though
Pop CD's, B-I-G's, then Tupac's
While cruisin the blocks, hittin the hot spots
Got my celly on O-F-F
Golden Arches got my belly goin oh yes yes 
So let's just - ease on down ease on down the road
No pager roll my hip as I'm rollin my whip
Cause today I'm on the solo creep 
Man, why you think I be workin so hard all week?
I'm just cruisin

Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)

Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin

Sun settin in the S-K-Y
Must say I've had the best day I'm..
tryin to find a exit, a place to chill
Not too hectic, so I can spend some time with Will
Let the, sunshine to the moonlight clear my mind 
Soul search, see what I find
If I'm bein the best lover and friend 
Am I being the best daddy I can? 
I pray I am, and I feel good today
Reminisce as I'm cruisin around the way
Roll tight past the park where I used to play 
Can't think of a better way to spend my day
Uh, still findin my way, still growin
Petrol blowin, moon soon showin
Gots to get goin, losin the light 
And ""The Freaks Come Out at Night,"" right
Just cruisin

Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin (I'm just cruisin)
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street!

It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right because the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin! Cold havin a ball
and somethin bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent, ya know nothing real fancy
bout this guy named Fred and this girl named Nancy
But word, when it was over, I said, ""Yo! That was def!""
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!

It was burnin in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool, to quench my thirst
I thought to myself, ""Yo, this heat is the worst!""
But when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone but the TV was on!
I thought nothin' of it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You cut off 'Heavy Metal' and now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin'""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said, ""Here's what we'll do.
We gotta lotta work here, me and you.
The souls of your friends you and I will claim.
You've got the body, and I've got the brain.""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong.
I ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest man, this team won't work.
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
Fred got mad and his head started steamin'
But I thought what the hell, I'm only dreamin'
I said, ""Please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep;
or gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week.""
I patted him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street",A Nightmare on My Street [Single Version]
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind 

Here it is the groove slightly transformed 
Just a bit of a break from the norm 
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony 
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be 
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance 
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance 
Give me a soft subtle mix 
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it 
And think of the summers of the past 
Adjust the base and let the alpine blast 
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme 
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime 

Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind 
Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind 
Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz 
A back then I didn't really know what it was 
But now I see what have of this 
The way that people respond to summer madness 
The weather is hot and girls are dressing less 
And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best 
Riding around in your jeep or your benzos 
Or in your Nissan stting on lorenzos 
Back in Philly we be ou in the park 
A place called the plateau is where everybody goes 
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise 
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes 
She turn around to see what you beeping at 
It's like the summers a natural afradesiac 
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme 
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time 

Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind 
Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind 
Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind 

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet 
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set 
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair 
'Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there 
The temperature's about 88 
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake 
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more 
'Cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4 
Sitting with your friends cause y'all remincise 
About the days growing up and the first person you kiss 
And as I think back makes me wonder how 
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia 
All the kids playing out front 
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch 
While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion 
Then six o'clock rolls around 
You just finished wiping your car down 
It's time to cruise so you head to the summertime hangout 
It looks like a car show 
Everybody come lookin' real fine 
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon 
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't spead through 
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you 
There's an air of love and of happiness 
And this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion' of summer madness 

Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind 
Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind 
Summer summer summertime 
Time to sit back and unwind",Summertime [Album Version]
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"Well I was cool and sitting by the phone and waiting for
A ring with a female voice or a date or an invitation
To a nightclub for some minglin'
Then aah my phone started jinglin'

I picked it up I checked the Rolex first
I call one of my regulars worst come to worst
I said, ""Hello but the voice sounded nervous
Baby relax FP at your service""

The girl spoke up and her voice sounded very nice
""I met you last week at that club called The Paradise""
I said, ""Yeah babe I'd like to go their again
Get dressed and you better be flossy with ten""

Hung up the phone and checked the mirror
Sort of like ESP I could hear her
Heart beating engaged with the groove
And all I could say to myself was damn this boy is smooth

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

So I pulled up to the club at the gate where they let celebs in
Enter booted a Porsche 9-11 then
Girls took a look at me and started to break
Ladies come down I've already got a date

Cruised up front and I was happy to find her
Tantalizing tasty tune named Tanya
I said ay yo babe lets not go in the place yet
Come on hope in I got Luther in the tape deck

I kicked the gift and the girl was like silly putty
She said lets go some place and chill I said really honey
We went to the beach to take a little walk
I found out I was smoother than I thought

My hands like maverick started to wander
Left and right then wound up behind her
Face to face and chest to chest and ohh like a spindle of silk
Yo this boy is smooth

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

Here it is verse trace back at my place
The scene was set because I set it before I left
Girl I'm like a tool grab me and use me
Where do you want me by the fireplace or the jacuzzi

I never slipped yo I got my grip like a handle
Turn down the lights and lit up a candle
A bottle of chilled champagne right beside me
Radio booming pumpin' the isley

Maybe I'll grab her and give her a kiss
Or kick her a line on the smooth billy dee tip
Or maybe I'll take her outside where the pools at
Smack it up flip it naa I'm too cool for that

Ahh I know what I'll do
Hold her tightly and caress for a little while
Make it gentle and slow not faster
I pause for the cause and here's a word from the master

Yo I'm the JA double Z Jazzy
The smooth as self smooth than I have to be
Knowing acknowledged recognized that that's the king of the groove
And I'm the man that blessed FP is smooth

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
Ay yo J take me out of here
'Cause I don't get upset

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

'Cause I don't get upset
'Cause I don't get upset

DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince,"(Intro/Chorus)

It's just the things that you do (5x)

The way you do the things you do

(Verse 1)

8:05, the alarm clock sound

I grab my shoe and turn the damn thing down

But now it's 9 o'clock and I still ain't up up yet

Work on time, yeah I admire the concept

You got me yearnin??? and I mean anticipating

Seeing you I can't wait and so not concentrate

My mind is blind of all the time, thinking of you

And the way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)

I walk in the park for a midnight rendevous

For a slow dance, romance, my motive is see through

I wanna be with you

But I ain't hiding

A wave of love and I'm gliding and ridening

Things like that when you hear me

Sayin' sort of sounds like that same old clich??

Climbing the highest mountain and swimming the deepest sea

But I can't front, I want you to be want me

Cause baby when you grab me tightly

You send chills and tend to insight me

When you caress and fumble me lightly

Oh girl watch up cause she might be

Settin' yourself up the way that you tease me

Sooner or later you might have to please me

It's just something about you

The way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)

Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me

Be chasing one lady

It's just something about you

The way you carry yourself when you're out you

Seem to have a sort of captivating style, I've parked the feelin'

But your whip is appealing

Since this is a subject that I brought up

I just mind as well admit that I'm caught up

It ain't the clothes that you're wearin'

Your perfume or the style that that your hair's in

It ain't your body, how slim your waist is

Your new jeans and how pretty your face is

But I feel funny when it close proximity

Make it wonder what's gettin' in to me

It's just something about you

The way you do the things you do

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

It's nothing that you do (2x)

The way you do the things you do

(Verse 4)

The mystery???s of this world I ponder

Just sittin' back let my mind wonder

What the, why the, who the, how the hell is this young lady

Drive me so crazy

Reply in thought pose like the thinker

I play you with kiss or a wink

Or a smile just to show you

It's something about you

The way you do the things you do

Come here, come here

Come on out, don't worry

You want me to chase you don't you?

Just come here, I've got you now

Sss

The way you do the things you

(Chorus)

It's just the things that you do

(the way you do the things you do) (10x)

The way (repeated several times)

Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
You make me feel fine all of the time
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline
The line broke, the money get choked,
Bunbah, ganjapani, little rubber boat
Red red wine, I'm gonna hold on to you,
Hold on to you 'cause I know you love truth
Red red wine, I'm gonna love you till I die,
Love you till I die, and that's no lie
Red red wine, can't get your off my mind
Wherever you may be, I'll surely find,
I'll surely find. Make no fuss, just leave us",Red Red Wine

DJ Kane,"Voy a contarte mi triste historia
La que los hombres ya sabemos de memoria
Son las mujeres, nuestra condena
Un par de piernas que al deseo te encadenan

Ella juraba que me quería
Y que nunca jamás a mi me engañaría
Pero una noche llego muy tarde
Y me di cuenta que con otro amanecía

Y allí mismo me dejo
Con un grito y tres mentiras

Puras mentiras te besan, te olvidan
Te botan, te botan y mira lo que me hicieron a mí
(Mentirosa)
Lo harán contigo, contigo, mi amigo

Porque son puras mentiras mujeres malditas
Traidoras, bonitas, mira mo que me hicieron a mí
(Tracionera)
Mañana lo harán contigo, mi amigo te lo aseguro
(Te lo aseguro, que se seguro, que seguro)

Veras mi amigo con tendencencia
En un segundo ellas te abotan la pacencia
Tenía una que me adoraba
Pero una noche me clavo la puñalada

No hubo manera, yo le rogaba
Pero la niña igual de plano se marchaba
Una desgracia enamorase
Si las mujeres de hombres no han de burlarse

Y allí mismo me dejo
Con un grito y tres mentiras

Puras mentiras te besan, te olvidan
Te botan, te botan y mira lo que me hicieron a mí
(Mentirosa)
Lo harán contigo, contigo, mi amigo

Porque son puras mentiras mujeres malditas
Traidoras, bonitas, mira mo que me hicieron a mí
(Tracionera)
Mañana lo harán contigo, mi amigo te lo aseguro

Y se llamaba tan-taran-tan
Y la de aquel y el otro también
Y le gustaba tan-taran-tan
Ay mira tú que brava mujer

Y se paseaba en tan-taran-tan
Era en el barrio tan popular
Tenía en la espalda un lindo lunar
(¿Qué?)
Y era la misma que me engañaba

Puras mentiras te besan, te olvidan
Te botan, te botan y mira lo que me hicieron a mí
(Mentirosa)
Lo harán contigo, contigo, mi amigo

Porque son puras mentiras mujeres malditas
Traidoras, bonitas, mira mo que me hicieron a mí

That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang, thang
Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya

Say a prayer for me if you care for me 'cause I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it

Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot this
Say I'm skinny now, but I look big in the coupe-dee
My cuzin' Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans

I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh, you the black hand of death
Then why your name ain't preacher

If you a pimp like kid, why them hoes don't treat ya
If you wanna ball like Kirk
Now shorty let me teach ya
This flow's God sent, it's bound to reach ya

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

They say you can never repay the price for takin' a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit fifty
Blaaat, y'all niggas can't bang wit fifty

Say I'm born to rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
Face stone and the cross, there's a bitch I tossed
See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check CNN for the, 'War Report'

See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I do it myself, I don't need no help

Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young
Niggas jumped me 'cause they couldn't beat me one-on-one

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cause pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass

I got, ""God Understand Me"" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'ma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say, ""'Sup up, niggas get ready to duck""

My heart is a house homie, fear don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings

See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'ma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier

This is the set-off
Kay Sleezy
Take it to the streets nigga
Word up
Sauce Money
Uh, uh
Proper set-off

Don't get it fucked up 'cause Sauce calm wit his grandma
'cause I'm like baking soda bitch, I'm armed with a hammer
And when I'm strapped fool, fuck your brother
'cause like Jimmy Ivene in Virginia you in the scope like a muthafucka
Fine, niggas don't wanna let him shine
Niggas hate that fact Sauce don't give a fuckin' nine
Soon as he ran his mouth, one tre pound seven to nine
Guess who's the odd man out
I guess we got something in common
I'm just a little more calm when
I'm about to split your arm in
Put a hole so big in your noggin
That if you God body, you can fit the whole sun, moon and star in
You starvin' for more lyrics I know
Steady robbin' all them lyrics I flow
I'm Sadam-ing all you niggas fo sho
You betta know I'm a true nigga, please do nigga
Betta inquire from a few niggas
'cause bitch, I done shit on quite a few and quieted a few niggas
Get a grip, dead four-fifth in the hip
Slip, never picture me fallin' nigga don't trip

[Killer Mike]
Stoned is the way of my walk
In a mini-mack eleven, the tone when I talk
When I spray niggas pray, lay on the sidewalk
Color blood red, body outlined in chalk
My rhymes, two zigs all nines
Hard hit when they spit, split wigs double time
This eightball's a strict nine
Tear apart body parts when I spark nine
At they head hard lodged in they damn spine
Leaves emcee's like Christopher Reeves, crippled and cryin'
Shittin' in a bag and a breath away from dyin'
Nigga I'm - the epitomy of raw rhymes
The epitomy of rap rock
I make a block party bop to the sounds of a hot glock
From New York down to Georgia it don't stop
Killer Kill from Addamsville with a hot glock
Blaaat!

[Bun B]
They say murder is the case they wanna throw me
I guess these muthafuckas don't know me
O.G. rock called a yay slanger
VA's finest
Underground muthafuckin' king call me ""Your Highness""
I tear your sinus with this gun powder
Wipe your tears with the steal, no fear this is real niggas
Here is the deal: you clear in this field
And ain't stoppin' until every hater here is revealed
'cause we don't need no fuckin' clearance to peel
Or shortstoppers runnin' and the fear is revealed
So - get off this block homie handle your corner
Keep all your heroin, rocks and you mariju-wana
I'm like a - character on the Sopranos or the Wire
You'se a - big pussy lil' man, it's over, retire
'cause the - clock's tickin', your days is done
But we know all them lil' different fuckin' ways you slum
But it's trill downtown, your momma's all free
Your house is sugar-layin' with your wife and your seed
Yes indeed, Big Bun is on a home invasion
You gon' bleed on my gun from your dome abrasions
'cause my chrome is blazin', I'm naughty crunk
Got the bop gun like Sir Nose D'Voiddoffunk
Bitch, I pull a sawed-off from under the waist
Open your eyes muthafucka, you got thunder to face
Fuck rest, we gon' lay these muthafuckas to waste
You bit the pully nigga tell me, how the fuck did it taste
From my gun...
Big guns, big power
M. Woods, sixth hour
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wesson's, glocks and lugers
AK's, are 15's
Mack elevens and M-16's
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it, so you die by it
A muthafuckin' gun...

Who's the man with the strap in his hand
Homie's stolen semi-autos and contrabands
All day every day, crossin' my hood in day
In a six-trey with my nigga Kay Slay
Dub the law scan, the infrared scanner
Hangin' out the window, hittin' em up with the bandana
And I can't stand a snitch so I - clean the lid
Just in case them bitch niggas wanna sing with this
I stay on the trigger, 'cause lames hate me nigga
They can't pay me nigga, where my lay dates nigga
Where AK one-on-one so thirty shot
Nine millimeter Melindas aimed ready to send ya
So put your can on your vest like a Bible and pray slowly
'cause this'll leave your teflon holey
With the forty glock ready to ring, bring the trauma to the scene
It's the Ghetto Heisman and the Drama King

[Joe Buddens]
It's about that time nine-milli clappin'
Dude, what's really crackin'?
I been gettin' it since 'Paid In Full' was really happenin'
I gotta do it like that to keep my street name
And pride made me kill Wayne Growe when the heat came
I don't smut but stimulation is good
I keep the hammer with me, Joey's renovatin' the hood
Difference between us, I'm gettin' loot on tours
Good shoes on the Beem, you got a boot on yours
Dudes with no names wanna put an end to me
But doggs, I'm readin' between the lines, the whole game's in parenthesis
Talk about models and how you with somethin'
When you really shootin' air balls, you ain't hittin' nothin'
Nathan, through the strip, O.G.'s blazin'
Street niggas slowly hatin' on Joey so amazin'
And hood niggas knowin' what up
Either holdin' you down or holdin' you up, throwin' it up
Oh!

[Hak Ditty]
Aiiyo, fuck the dumb shit, when the guns spit
One clip'll have your whole strip laid down
Thirty-two shots to your block, I had that shit caged down
And before you blink, I let off eight rounds
This the ro-yal I ain't playin'
I'm takin' this over, so y'all either layin' or dying
And I won't hesitate to blaze the iron
You cocksuckers is chillin' with a ragin' lion
I see them dudes every day, when I'm racin' by 'em
Or on the curb poppin' bottles while they hatin' and eyein'
Uh, whether the slider or the highrider
I keep my block rocker, glock under the blue dosser
Far as Philly, it's no question to who's liver
I'm hotter, Hak Ditty, block locker
Fully prepared
I hope y'all fully aware that y'all niggas got a problem this year

Don't see Kay in these muthafuckin' streets dog
Nigga walkin' around in this muthafucka lookin' shocked and stupid, baby
We runnin' these muthafuckin' streets for real
Kay Slay, holla at God damn baby
Kay Slay, they don't want me out here
They don't want you out here, dog
This is muthafuckin' Face Mob, Kayslay, New York City
Holla at ya God damn baby, we don't rock no muthafuckin' ice, baby
We rock this real shit, dog
And if you think a nigga bullshittin', come fuck wit it
It's goin' down...

[Scarface]
Let's put an ending to chitter, nigga, see me in gloves
I'm the proof in the booth, bitch, read me in blood
It's Face at you, freezin' muthafuckas like a statue
I got a loaded Kay Slay pointed at you
The end of your beginning, before you even get it started
You fucked up, now you in the presence of a heartless
Nigga, from out the gutter, spit it and don't stutter
I'm a gangsta, raise around the dope fiends and hustlers
But silence is golden, and the streets don't talk
Don't let sheets slide, 'cause beef don't walk
We attack hoes, fuck a nigga with wack flows
I'm the last of a dying, bitch, act like you don't know
I'm the reason you niggas walk around thug
Just remember I'm the one made, you can get touched
So what you gonna put a record out, you a muthafuckin' sellout
Slay told me to knock your ass out

[Chorus 2X: Scarface]
And you was right, I never liked ya muthafuckin' ass
To start with, you know it's better get your self regardless
And Kay, bitch, you picked the right nigga to play with
Now you got a leaky' T-shirt from the kay spit

Snow white five glendin', the elevator with the crib
Blend with it kid, I feel one of them Bill Clinton's
Mills is spent, still don, still rentin'
Still yacht flyin', still killin' fish, still killin' clicks
The fifth out, don't even breathe out
And ganna with the ill thieves, slick hammers, we all fam
What, pull out the four, pop the truck, see the luxury morgue
The casket leather, the python seeks your dog
Flashback, he and them Benz's lenses
Actin' like he did ten sentences, son ain't real
He got excited, parked the truck, just leaned the lighter
Twist the blunt, sat back, son beepin', we drove off
It's money on it, until them young niggas don on it
Devour the snitches, you get on, you born with it
Make a toast for hours, for all the money and power
The right division, don't never let corns get it, drama

[Chorus 2X]

[Fat Joe]
Pass the rock, you niggas gassed a lot
I never liked ya ass, but then again, you can't be shocked
Most feared in this rap game, and ain't for frontin'
Best believe when shit pop off, I'm blazin' somethin'
It's the J to the Izzo, you know the rest
Nigga can't get a Twiz-o, but flow the best
I've been doin' this for years, ruinin' careers
Niggas never wanna listen til the toolies in the air
It's the kid that don't be givin' a fuck, I hold a shit outta grudge
The type of nigga that'll spit at the judge
Niggas gettin' gelled, they say I'm livin' it up
'cause I'm at Hollywood with Denzel, flickin' it up
I play the corner when the shit is hot, summer time in the X
Kay Slay got the shit on lock
That's where you go to find the God body
Second to none, unless you compare him to John Gotti, God...

Fuck with the kid, gotta throw ya moms over the bridge

Keep thinkin' that the god is chillin'
I'm the reason custies is comin' to the Carter Buildin
And it ain't no tellin what I do
They may find ya body on 16th smellin like a (*jew*)
I'm the number one stunna when it comes to the east
In the Jag with the .40 cal under the seat
Nigga this is my block, Name a nigga who run me out
Friday come, you and you have your money out
Son, my gun'll bring a playboy bunny out
Somebody gotta die, I'm a try ya hunny out
Send her to ER with half her tummy out
No see-section, no infants comin out
She can't have babies again
Me and Kay gettin money so its feelin like the eighties again
Holla!

[Shells]
Ayo, You boys is silly, I'm next since Pac and Biggie
And I'm Bout Major Figgas like Dutch and Gillie
Catch Shells all-star weekend down in Philly
On my hip, pack heat like a bowl of chilly
Look - I Clap milli's, act willy, you a chump
Only kid in the hood with elevators in his truck
See, I flash bucks, rock all black doors
And my watch ice'd out like Jacobs store
When you boys gon learn I got this game lock
What you got for your deal, I spent on Xbox
Keep frontin like you hungry, I'm a feed you a biscuit
I got rock and roll bullets, leave limps like bizkit
So hey, its ya life involved - act like it is
My chain light gray like trash can lids
If one of y'all take my chain - none of y'all live
You like, ""I ain't do it Shells"", One of y'all did!

[Grafh]
'Cause A lot of y'all are fakin', one minute is asolama laken
2 minutes later is where's my salamy bacon
Niggaz swear the product the makin' requires rockin a aprin
They liars cause its Betty Crocker they bakin
Not that I'm sayin that I Cook, Cause I don't
I keep it as raw as you seen it before it was put on the boat
The hookers'll open they jaw for free
Fuck being a gentleman, ya girlfriend open the door for me
When a pimp walk the beat, you shut up one day
The day the dick had ya mother next up one way
I come up one way drunk pushin a porshe
Make beef and I'm cookin the sauce - Gravy!
I be lookin like a boss
I pop at ya hood on ya snorkle til I have the fur lookin like a scarf
Lookin like I robbed 'em
Tell cops is easy to find like chinks in a nail shop
Holla, cheah!

[Cassidy]
Ayo, get back get back for I click clack click clack
Where that shit at? Get that 'for I bust shots!
Get crunk if you want to, drunk if you want to
Front if you want to, And get slumped with the gun too
Gimme mine cause any time I could run through
And put ya brains on the mini blinds in sun roof
Try run dog, you can try hide man
But when I bust the gun dog, you gon die man
I drinkin rum dog and I'm gettin high man
Say good bye man or a prayer - ""Aman""
Look It ain't hard to get at you dudes
I screw waitresses that'll slip shit in ya food
I got yay for sale and I got crazy shells
I got it locked from Illadelph to ATL
The wait is over, I'm a take it over
I'm a bubble like vinegar and baking soda
Easy!

Ayo, I'm a D-Block nigga - I don't respect wack rhymes
If you had a gat in a clock, you couldn't kill time
Y'all cowards don't want beef, why even start?
Y'all like dicks in the pool - none of y'all hard
Come through in the spit white 330 with a mean birdie
Holdin my hammer cause she know its dirty
You got questions, holla at me - I tell you what's what
Lay you on ya back and y'all chumps'll really see what's up
On the real, y'all niggaz better chill
Think ya crew spittin flames - I'll put ya hot dogs on the grill
It gotta be a conspiracy if niggaz ain't feelin me
Like a nigga with no eyes - y'all not seein me
Call me a director - I give clips to ya broad
Bullets is like gum - How they stick in ya jaw
Go 'head, call the narcs - I put a hole through ya heart
And leave you on the train tracks in a shopping cart
This ain't just beats and bars, Its things I'll do to you
In Compton fuck, I'm tryin to get through to you
The gauge'll open ya chest like vics
How you went from being soft to hard - niggaz is dicks
I don't wanna hear nothin bout ya coke and ya toast
Liars get shot in they tongue - I'll put the mack to ya throat motherfucker!

It's the ghetto godfather, priest in the hood
Cross the line that's your spine, I'm the beast in the hood
Don't consider that I rap, just consider I'm strapped
And I squeeze at your brain, face, rib and your back
Dog we can keep it brief get straight to the beef
I'm so deep they see the pain in my eyes when I'm sleep
I made a vow to the streets at a very young age
That I would always use my knife and I would let my gun blaze
Got niggaz that'll ride with me, die with me, thug with me
Bust off they hammers, still sell they drugs with me
My niggaz is real they all'll see the judge with me

Roll the windows down, get rid of the cop
I'm in the hood like boots on niggaz cars

Stankin' the speculation, you want it, you got it, baby
I'm at you a lifetime, the nigga washin' your window shorten your lifeline
You're fuckin' wit white wine, I'm fuckin' wit nitrate
I'm emotionless when I get 'em, a nigga wit ice veins
Ain't impressed wit status or jewelry, I'm on some street shit
Don't believe in sit in front of a jewelry, that's weak shit
You talk it, you gotta live it, I live it, that's why I speak it
Exposin' these niggaz weakness', Kay I got 'em sleepin'

[Ghostface Killah]
I remember bustin' out the house from police duckin' the vans
Wit them taped-up broken revolvers stuck to my pants
That was '88, around the time of Slick Rick era
Day to day, rolled chains wit them thick knit sweaters
Who gives a fuck what the D.A. say, they want to see me pay
Motherfucker this is G.F.K.!
I settle crimes wit metal 9s and I ain't gonna stop
'Til your brains all over the street like ?
Marshmellow dimes, brick be the size of cobblestones
Acknowledge the throne, it's Pretty Tone
I'm legendary and compared to my work on the strip, why'all secondary
I'm hittin' these fiends lovely, my shit be extra heavy
Like construction workers in Timbs, and plus they two box
Two glocks incase I gotta bump a few cops off
You know how we do in Staten Island, this is Gaten Island, nigga
Not a non-violence sticker

(Chorus)
[Scarface]
I gave you a chance to eat, but you chose to bite the hand that fed
You took your shit, nigga, lay in your bed
Who'd ever thought this nigga that we sat down at our table and fed
Would roll on the street and on wit the feds
I used to love this nigga
Now I roll around wit a mask and a strap and a grudge for that nigga
Fuckin' wit me, this adds the fuel to the fire
And I'm about to snap that wire!

[Ghostface Killah]
We want them new 20s and 100s, Ziplock money
why'all gon' fund it, we gon' eat big like Big Pun did
And we goin' all out like Hussein's sons did
We stickin' niggaz like New York cops wit plungers
So take some advice, there's three bears
Cashmere down wit 12 gauges under the table
Slay got the shotty, ain't that your label
And them other two bears, yo, theys the one that paid you buddy!

Catch him open when I'm kickin in the do'
Shoot up on the ceiling then I get him on the flo'

Take away your mothers and they kidnapped kids
Shoot at us then it's tit for tat

Makin money puttin workers on the tit with packs
Don't want no drama with the honorary Diplomat

Opposition hangin on a tip, make confetti galore
Thinkin I'ma let they pockets swell
It's murder when I'm fillin up the clip and I'm ready for war
Goin through bodies and drillin the wall
Dead 'em so quick then you be feelin the fall

somethin that good, to try to come back at me with
What you gon' do, try to out-rap me with that happy shit?
You motherfuckers crack me up
Talkin bout you gonna smack me up, why'all won't even back me up
Throw up your paws, you pussies can't even scratch me hard
It's like fuckin Castor Claw tryna jack me off
You think I'm afraid? What you tryna throw some fear in me?
You think I'm dumb enough to roll with no security? {*gun clicks*}
I'm doin my best to try to show maturity
But don't sit there and stare at me like hoes and sneer at me
like it's supposed to be scarin me
Like I won't leap clean over this fuckin V.I.P. rope and throw this chair
at anyone close or near me tryna approach me physically
cause he don't spit lyrically
And he knows that my flow's so sick, this hoe's on my dick
and he's so sick of hearin me, my posters is starin at him
But I don't think he knows the severity
of what it could escalate to or that it could grow so seriously
if I go hysterically; cause I guarantee
there's no one in here that would resort like a childhood
any quicker than I would, or hit you with plywood
Especially when I'm sippin on this liquor and tonic

the mark from it'll be so dark that it'll leave a scar so big
you'll be able to read a label from the motherfuckin

He done seen overseas, he's not a prototype (nah)
Nobody's protégé, Em only showed O. the way
Fuck what the media say
If you listen to music then you should know that O. Trice fused it
in a matter where he speaks how the streets views it
Choose, to translate it through the art of music
and started usin it reachin the youth influenced by the truth in it (truth!)
And as a boy, a man, I ran from boys in vans
Do the knowledge, acknowledge and try to comprehend
Hand full of contraband
A product of my environment, narcotics and violence
Inspires the content, but my intent is
to retire these tired-ass writers in si-lence (yeah!)
Cause haters they hate us cause Shady became famous
and claimed the rap game when they thought he'd be nameless (hah!)
But racist accusations won't change us
Let the truth be told, you think O. will be over here
like, ""Massa, show 'em you got soul"" ? no!

That push the breathe, for the best to colide
Better yet, I put the X in define
Never fret, when it's beef, I put the pep' in the nine

Pussy, you dealin' with crumbs, so stop actin' like you one tough cookie

Yo, I speak for the Stuy, Brooklyn is mine, get it through your head
'Fore I round these bullets up and send them through your head
Last nigga tried to stunt, left his hat full of lead
Left the picture that your see, for the inside of F.E.D.S.
I want you to think, that my gun don't burst
My tech'll make niggaz back up like cars in reverse
Definition of a thug, man, put in your work
And nigga act up, you put his work in the earth
Yeah, I'm hotter than you ever was, real? You never was
Hustle hard, nigga, we get you, whatever drugs
Bet you none of ya'll seen, machine guns rattle
So I let off, and let you feel the heat off the barrel
My dogs rocked up, and got you when you hit the gravel
Been a hard hitter, before the Mets signed Darryl
I'm your reaper, when I blast the street sweeper
You bitch niggaz'll crack up like cheap sneakers

[Chorus]
[True Life]
Yo, ya'll niggaz keep talking greasy, like I won't melt ya'll
See me in the streets, got more Smilez than Southstar
Pull your socks up, homey, you know what I'm about, yo
I was pushing rocks, you pushed the Roc, forgot yo's
Lot of niggaz thuggin', but not like me
Put the fifth to your nose, for being nosey
Fuck a throwback jersey, you trying to be Fabolous
End your career, have you resurface like Canibus
Nigga's shouldn't have let me loose
I'm well when I'm sober, imagine off Cran' and Grey Goose
I'm liable to clap the tech
Make you take that chain off, but I don't want a rash on my necklace
Shit, we ain't the same calibur, listen, your don
I treat ho's how I want to, even got a bad blonde
Got bad feet, so I hit her with her shoes on
Get this through your head, 'fore I flip over, your Yukon

Gettin' money, stop that, where the fuck ya'll rocks at
Bandana on my face, thirty nine on my waist
Shoot you if you try to run, nigga you ain't gettin' chased
You was poppin' hella shit, all that shit irrelevant
Sittin' on cake, and you waiting on the settlement
I'm a grown man, never run, never ran
And I don't play with kids, this ain't Never Never Land

You get bucked at, crew you 'fore I Dutch hat

Its one way or the either
You comin or you gonna watch another bitch leave wit me
The way this shit go, ima fuckin rap star

[Verse]
Fresh off of the plane I jets off in the Range
First class seat but this west coast ain't the same
The rap game will put stress, fortune, and fame
A slow drive-by when they aired out Kane
S55 all cleared out chain
They body me, you body them, support there out prayin
My only wish is to find ya catcher
Lay ya ass on a stretcher, betcha, getcha, ass out the hood
All I got is rap for that, I spazz out for good
That's my income, it keeps me in Paz and Hollywood
I'm hardly home, when I leave the club the party gone
And I'm pissy off patrone, tryna get ma home
My name Banks baby, I'm top rank lady
I gotta go, grab ya coat, bitch you ain't crazy
I speed off, gainin and rushin, and bend her over somethin
And I'm pumpin, devyin till the macs and I'm frontin
All of a sudden she down on the humble for a feel
And I'm driftin in and out of lane, fumblin the wheel
A couple of miles later I be cummin on her grill
Then its back to the hotel and chill

[Chorus]
Ma I give you the rush
Damn ma, ya lil outfit got my third hand high
And I need ya to understand I
Ain't really got a lot of time, bitch out ya mind its me

Of me in my city I'm a killa.

That moments ghetto (ghetto),
Got me deep in gats for you wheezly cats,

Never gone south of the border,

Ven, why luchemos por este amor
No quiero mirar atrás
Esos tiempos fueron más guerra que paz
Todavía creo en la felicidad

DJ Kep,"At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel
Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless
Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic
Stroll up in the party: titanium black car
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
You 16, you could do 20, come home young
Catch 20 years when you 40? Holmes, you're done
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies
A 360 in the streets real grizzly
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
This ain't the Truman Show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?

[Chorus]
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung? It's not love
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up

Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think
It's crazy how many brothers come where I come from
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
""Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous""
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's jungle
Now we having babies, cause growing up it was just us
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
The G is in your genes, already you tuck
Inherit your dad's swag, it's George Jefferson's strut
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist
Corona sipper, pass it out, might blow it with you
It ain't the Truman show, it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
Young brother go and get your paper, I got love

It ain't nothin' for me to spoil you

I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

I wanna be where the commas ya be
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips
And he took a couple trips, then its dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other bitch, fronting like he's slick
Cause it's levels to this shit and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin
Got a big billboard out in Madison
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin
Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston
You decide you'll be mine you can come inside
You the type that can make me prioritize
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
Hittin' my phone, it's alright
You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini
You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, baby

Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy

Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' cars too easy, poppin' bottles too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
Everything you do is brand new

Make that bad bitch my shorty, hit the club, throw forty
My hat bent like uh, my chain drip like water
Car paint like tar, I'mma sex her harder
Bitch let go my hand gave you the keys as soon as I bought it
Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years
Checked it, look here, you ain't even know, big deal
On site, act right, I shop hard, pack light
That ho chick gets you no play, all I talk is cocaine
White tee and these rope chains, blow the roof back, Kurt Cobain
Phantom cost like four dollar, flo' seats, hoes holla
Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur

Ballin' on you too easy, splurgin' on you too easy
Buyin' purses too easy, payin' bills too easy
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

Where we keep rising to the top like elevators
Hi haters I'm back of hiatus I feel just like you I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down I mean every song

And sense I got my shot like I was call and man be	
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan be	
We'll be waiting in the telli like Jamie and Fancy
Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties

When I cop it's 4 doors I'm too big for a coupe nigga
And when I go to war I don't get shot I just shoot niggas
And I don't trust a nigga far as I could saw him
Even though I'm feeling strong enough or probably can roof niggas
Yeah, ya boy back in the booth nigga
I'm off the weed but I'm back on my juice nigga
I beat the case so it's off the pursuits
Back in fatigues, black tees and Timberland boots nigga
The year is new I want my spot back
Take 2, matter fact take the whole clip
Who you know could fly by '05 then '06
When they see that new V the dope boys go crazy
Yeah, You know I still fuck with State P
Still fuck with Dame Dash still fuck with Jay-Z
Still, real still recognize real
I still feel it in the air we still kill at will

Then Big clock stop
Now something going on with the Roc

The shit people make up
I'm like damn, when will it stop
Jay and Dame ain't speaking
Game and 50 Cent beefing
Then Cease got Lil' Kim knocked
I'm hearing all this from the jail
While I'm sitting in my cell
And I'm waiting on some mail from the prof

You got a hole in you and you bleeding
So it's not like I'm just calling you pussy for no reason
Me I'm a bastard I hit the blunts 'til I gotta cough then I pass 'em
Exhaust on the Aston
That next choice you make might be your last one
Shit that I needed stuck with me from the classroom
Real talk now, who's the king of New York now
And boys got safes in the house I got a vault now
From my old grams, still with my old fams
Still getting wireless head that's with no hands
Listen, my grandma in composition
Compared to y'all is way beyond existence
D-Block daddy, new black Caddy
Coming through knocking Michael McDonald and Patty
P's a haze and still going for 8 in a natty
Rather have God arrest me than Satan embag me
Get serious I gladly involve your moms
Alkeida, Jada, I'm only involved with bombs, uh
Put my life on it
Soon as you sit it in the hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it
I've been giving it to niggas for years
I'm responsible for niggas careers, mother fucker

[Chorus]

Hold your head up Cass don't stress, weight'll come off fast
Keep to yourself, Just try not to come off ass
Cause these niggas ain't playing fair
You know stay on your square, handle the biz

Stand up and man up and never play those games

I am the definition of loyalty
I represent the G's, Beanie Sigel
We the best

All the bullshit stops here, let's get this clear
Shoot rear fresh off the top tier
What I'm about to do for you is not fair
I'm not answering questions for you that are not clear

What up to State Prop the crew, were they not there?
The moment that they heard it the verdict
When it was declared, ya boy had to sit a year
Did they really disappear, did Jay really not visit there?

Dame and Bean's are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from that same fabric
That ripped the Roc marriage straight from the scenes
Things ain't what it seems but in time do tell the truth shall prevail

Until then you dudes bite y'all nails in anticipation
Before I know you hate it
Why I got you waiting, I too am waiting
Gotta see a couple faces when I make them face it

Truth that is that your boy ain't have patience
As a matter of fact it's wearing thin
But I tell you this though when the new year begins
Pussy's ain't got nuts because I'm going all in

We are listening
Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

I'm the plot in every movie
Yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

Now let's not get this misconstrued
To say that in this record I don't diss my dudes
Out of respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew
Never in front of you, I couldn't get that rude

And I don't give a fuck but I couldn't get that cruel
It's knowing what I do I could get like, ooh
You wanna know what I do, don't ya?
Ya love it if I told you old fuckers, won't ya?

Uh, uh, scrap got to pay for this one
I'm sorry youngin', got to wait on this one
The Solution soon in stores
Date to be posted until then I'm on pause

Here's to DJ Khaled aka we the best
Beanie Sigel
(What? It ain't no more to it)
Give 'em more man, more

Well, fuck it I don't wanna stop
But you forgot the gunner pop, tell me who you wanna rock
It's crew love Rocafella 'til I die
Nigga keep it moving, don't get caught up in this drive-by

The breaks over, your boy about to take over
If that number one spot open, give it here
Give my ground, dust off my chair
And y'all niggas can kiss my ass before I sit it there

Back from the dead fresh off the prison tier
Daddy here to put the kids to bed
By the way the war's on you can't call it off
It's too late plus the boss involved

We are listening
Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

I'm the plot in every movie
Yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

We are listening

I'm sho a naked and I'm straight actin' a clown

I'm a certified D-boy, a real big nutta
A candy car strutta that be sittin' on butta
Comin' straight up out the gutta with the cordaless cutta
Man, what is that? The Chinese choppa that likens Mr. Studda
What a fucked up predicament (Damn), a scary scenario
Automatics in ya face have you preparin' ya burial
They tracin' tha weapon after you scratch off the serial
Leaves you up like cereal, there it is and there we go
Some bad Didos ridin' off in tha wind and
Ni**a we got all ya soft in ya hands so don't pretend
Like this ain't what it was (was) or we ain't what you say (say)
I'll make a high cappa or court fraud light in tha day
Cause in the middle of the street in height of tha traffic
Watch what you say when we meet cause they know might get yo ass kicked
End up in a pickle like a Vlasic, UGK nigga
We cost like a foreign but get respect like a classic motherfucker

I'm from that lone star, tippin' dime dat candy car
Get it shined on 59, Lean and tuck I'll cut some more
Hoes wanna who we are, Fathers wanna know what we get
Hatas wanna talk down a knot, but they just mad cause they ain't hot
They ain't got the cash that I got,
They don't know what my hood 'bout
They don't know about trunks that pop on Lambo's that blaze tha chop
Countin' cash and stackin' not, South victory back to Scott
Crawlin' like big crocodile, I'm diamond smile and Johnny watch
I'm with my partner, box, you and you and not with 'cho

Yeah that's what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bentley hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dog
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin' Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was lookin' for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin' for Nas

Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

Your (Monologue's) getting tired, now it's time to ride
You're print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane
Let east coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin' at the speed of sound
Tryin' to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin' their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out
Leavin 'em laid out, dead, in just a sport

And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringin' the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to (Lean Back)
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin' them Howard niggas, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book

Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doin' shit for nothin', it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas want to murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

Neva been a nigga that?s eta fucked none less than a hundred percent,
The hustle that?s in me, my thug mentality
Show me what to do to improve my salary,
Don?t nobody move cause you could be a casualty,
One a dem, maybe dey crossed paths with me
One nigga left and they thought we was done,
Thought they could get rid a? da twist of the tongue,
They thought we was finished, but we just beginning,
They want me committed, to the murder, onneee
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, competition, ready to die,
Opposition, never survive, when I get done, bustin my rhyme,
Imma criminal transformed to a lyrical bad storm,
Did I mention my fast flowin, lately its got my cash growin wit?an ass showin,
These niggas can't see Bone, they already know,
Came down with a style unfamiliar sound,
That?s how we kicked in the doo-oo-oor
What it be like, bone thug nigga,
Born ?n bred in the Cleveland street life,
And believe we ain't goin nowhere,
We permanent, posted up, like street lights
We do it, still get to it, undisputed, who wulda knew it,
We still da truest, shrooted, move it,
They ain't doin it like we do it, do it

[Chorus: 2x]
Its bone thug, we them bone thugs
Half of this industry swangin from our balls
Its bone thugs, mighty bone thugs
Bone thug, bone, bone thug

[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Nigga tell the truth when you in the booth,
You know you think about the blown flow, old hoes
And I ain?t nice, like boss, so wanna spit chya? mouth,
Better gimme that dough you owe, hoes,
Where's the respect when you cash a check, huh?
We can? break bread, we?ll bust ya head, yup
I?ll do it to the heart, rather leave em? dead,
Before my time, but I?m still ahead,
Of all ya?ll, all ya?ll,
Like a nas?y bitch, give?it nigga raw dawg, raw dawg,
Any nigga putty, hit it, catchya, sawed off, sawed off
And I?m ready, I?m ready, to-go,
What it is, nigga bow down, bow down,
Nigga show some love, ain?t no hoes in ta us
We can swing the bus, we can share some blood,
Blood blood, blood-blood-blood-blood, blood,
Let a nigga loose, I?m a smack em? like I do, do
Imma come an see you fuck tha rappin in da booth,
I ain?t no studio, nutin, my name in your mouth,
And imma show ya something, fuck it
It?s the first time, double back dumpin
Deep in the club, they some suckas, rush em,
Get it how they get it, don?t let this singin fool ya,
We gets dirty, dirty, dirty, never nervous, nah
Ain't no love dem, ain't no love us,
Watch ya mouth, or one day them thugstas, yes
They will run up on ya, on ya,
And that?s when its over, cause
We don?t play no games, so when we up on ya,
Believe we gonna let it rain, rain?

[Chorus: 2x]
Its bone thug, we them bone thugs
Half of this industry swangin from our balls

In the hood, where its good, yea we get respect,
Gonna industry, man us let us bill collect,
It?s a promise lil homie, no need for threats,
We the best in the bidniss, and we breed da nex?,
Nigga ride with a thug on a Cleveland quest,
We really ain't mad at you, clones,
You gotta give credit when credit is due,
Why wouldn?t they give it ta Bone?
If you ever gave props to the masta, thanks,
Now you thinkin how a masta thank,
Way back in ninety-foe, stage stays closed,
We open the door, nigga get that bank,
Flip that flow, city ta? city, my niggas is gritty and o boy,
Reppin that bone thug, mo? thug, thug line,
Hit em with one rhyme, they be like, o boy, o boy,

And some of the latest done did it,

From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn. holla at me
Me in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop six-fo', three-wheel then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Glock fo'-fifty, blow your head off wit' it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off it wit' it
Say you need bricks, I said I get it

If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work, to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you, unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground

Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Now they see that you know I'm from Port City

I am insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on easy streets?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like, my sprite Easter pink
And my wrist match the par but the mula's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your Medulla
That's a bullet hole, it is not a tumor
