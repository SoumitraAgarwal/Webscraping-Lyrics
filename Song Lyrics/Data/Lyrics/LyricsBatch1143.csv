Ruby Jones,"Whatcha tryin' to do to my heart
Whatcha tryin' to do to my heart
You go around, tellin' lies, and now you wanna compromise
Whatcha tryin' to do to my heart
You better run, you better hide, you better leave from my side, yeah

Whatcha tryin' to do to my soul

Well everything I had is yours, and now I'm closin' all the doors

Say whatcha tryin' to do to my head

Ruby Murray,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Ruby Murray,"Peggy O'Neil is a girl who could steal any heart
Any where, any time
And I'll put you wise how you'll recognize 
This wonderful girl of mine
 
If her eyes are blue as skies, that's Peggy O'Neil
If she's smiling all the while, that's Peggy O'Neil
If she walks like a sly little rogue
If she talks with a cute little brogue
Sweet personality full of rascality
That's Peggy O'Neil
 
Every thing's planned for a wedding so grand
In the spring I will bring her the ring
Then somewhere in town we'll both settle down 
And all through the day I'll sing
 
If her eyes are blue as skies, that's Peggy O'Neil
If she's smiling all the while, that's Peggy O'Neil
If she walks like a sly little rogue
If she talks with a cute little brogue
Sweet personality full of rascality
That's Peggy O'Neil

Ruby Murray,"It only hurts for a little while
That's what they tell me
That's what they say
It only hurts for a little while
Then all your heartaches will pass away
It's so easy to be smart
With somebody else's heart
But I don't know how to start forgetting you
What can I do
It only hurts for a little while
That's what they tell me
Just wait and see
But I will hurt till you come back to me

Ruby Page,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Ruby Page,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Ruby Page,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland
Ruby Page,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness

Ruby Paul,"Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of golden starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue

Ruby Ruby Ruby,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon
Ruby Ruby Ruby,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Ruby Starr,"I can feel a new expression on my face
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room
 
I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room
 
Baby it's a dream come true
Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel a something pounding in my brain
Just any time that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound I hear thunder boom
Every time that you walk in the room
",When You Walk in the Room
Ruby Sunday,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A Foggy Day

Will I ever be the same?

This emptiness won't let me live without you

Got me workin' like a dog all day

'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown

Memories always start 'round midnight

A nice surprise
To see the twinkle returning to your eyes
I searched my head

For some old spark
Fell around the place, stumbling in the dark
And when I feel the skies will never clear
You remind me spring is near

How you sparkle, how you shine
How you rise above the sky
And you rise, and you rise
Through the crowd

I catch your eye
Takes me back again, when we were getting high
I searched my head
For some old spark

Fell about the place, fumbling in the dark
And when I feel the skies will never clear
You remind me spring is near
How you sparkle, how you shine

How you rise above the sky
And you rise, and you rise
And nothing in this world could make me love you less
But shadows often leave perfection in a mess

Oh my love, oh my lord
How you sparkle, how you shine
How you rise above the sky

And you rise, and you rise",Sparkle

where my poor restless heart's gotta run.

Should I flee?

Rude Awakening,"You don't believe in love
You don't believe in hatred
Put your money in the bank
It's the only way to save it

You try to make a buck
But you haven't made a penny
You need a little luck
But you know you won't get any

You don't believe in God
You don't believe in glory
You've got a brother in the clinic
Tells the same kind of story

If he had another life
He'd know what would be waiting
If he had another soul
He could sell it all to Satan

You don't believe in war
You don't believe in Jesus
Got a sister in New York
She knows how she pleases

Walking the streets
On the south side of the city
Trying to make ends meet
Isn't that a pity for money?

Rude Boy Reggae Band,"Baby, I was just a young girl
When you came on the scene 10 years ago
I thought I was hip, I could deal with the trips
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

When you kissed my lips
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'

Jammin' for the first time

When you showed me the ropes 10 years ago
I thought I was cool, I could break all the rules

Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Then you kissed my lips and, ooh
I lost my cool

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

And how ironically I'm feeling crazy as an institute
I'm contemplating time you told me that I would be without you
Had an extra strategy and you were trying to see me out
We were like a part, had me at the mood swings
Couldn't get it off the ground like bruised wings
Not one, not two, but a few things
Made me question what it really was that you bring
Now that the madness over and the fog's been cleared and I'm sadly sober
I could see the break fails and the crash before us
And the heavens poured down like a last proposal

When I'm here, and I'm there, and I'm torn now
When I'm hurt and I'm bruised, and I'm torn down
And I made some mistakes, but mature now
And I've touched my regret through my pause now
And felt how it feels to be sure now
And I know what it means to deplore now
And I know what it means to endorse love
And I know when it hurts to the core now
And I've burnt every bridge that I've torn down
Then I picked up our heart from the floor now
And I want and I crave anymore now

She made a wreck of Carnegie Tech and all its engineers; 
She did the same at old Notre Dame, her line is good for years; 
Roguish eyes, telling lies, breathing sighs! 

Betty Co-ed has lips of red for Cornell, 
Betty Co-ed has eyes of Navy blue, 
Betty Co-ed, the golden haired for Amherst, 
Her dress I guess is white for Georgia, too! 

Betty Co-ed's a smile for old Northwestern, 
Her heart is Texas treasure, so 'tis said,

But I'm the one who's loved by Betty Co-ed!",Betty Co-Ed
Rudy Vallée,"If I wasn't me, but a different sort of chap
What a romeo I'd be
I'd be able to see it's an awful handicap
When a guy's as shy as me
What happiness might come my way

I'll bet I could work wonders, seems too good to be true
I could be a 'b' marvel if I had a girl like you
Single handed I'd rescue ship and captain and crew
I'd be number one hero if I had a girl like you

I'd spend my leisure finding hidden treasure
No one could measure the things that I do
In the stormiest weather I could eat a pie stew
I'd become a real sailor if I had a girl like you

I could do without moonlight and give the stars a rest too
I'd be warm in a snowstorm if I had a girl like you

They could keep their old brains trust if I had a girl like you

Rudy Vallée,"I have traveled everywhere in most every state; 
I've met girlies here and there and I think they're great.
But there's one that pleased me and squeezed me and teased me, 
Down old Missouri way.

Her name was Kitty, from Kansas City, 
Sure was a pity she wasn't pretty, 
Hey, Hey she's not hard to see,
She weighs two-forty three, 
I hope she doesn't get much fatter, 
But if she does, it doesn't matter;
Kitty from Kansas City, 
Now there's a girl that I adore,
She's so dumb, she doesn't know a thing, 
She thinks that July the Fourth is an English King! 
I love her, I love her, that's easy to see 
It's Kansas City Kitty for me.

Her name was Kitty, from Kansas City, 
Sure was a pity she wasn't pretty, 
Hey, Hey I loved her just because,
She's not the girl she was, 
How she can cook, and she can wash, 
But when she starts to love, 
Oh, Gosh! 
It's Kitty from Kansas City, 
Now there's a girl that I adore,
She's so dumb, her brain is in a whirl, 
Why she thinks that Babe Ruth, is a chorus girl!

Rudy Vallée,"[Chorus]
I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
I overlooked that point completely, 
Until the big affair began, 

Before I knew where I was at, 
I found myself upon the shelf, and that was that, 
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there, 
All that I could get was the air, 

My feet are back upon the ground, 
I've lost the one girl (man) I found, 
  
[Chorus]

I guess I'll have to change my plan, 
I should have realized there'd be another man, 
Why did I buy those blue pajamas, 
Before the big affair began, 
    
My boiling point is much to low 
For me to try to be a fly Lothario, 
I think I'll crawl right back and into my shell, 
Dwelling in my personal hell, 
    
I'll have to change my plan around, 
I've lost the one girl (man) I found",I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan (The Blue Pyjamas Song)
Rudy Vallée,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply as time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings, as time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by",As Time Goes By

All the night and day
Feeling as they never felt before
What is the thing

It plays a part in every heart
And every heart is shouting, ""Encore""

Waves are hugging the shore,

Rudy Vallée,"In Tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire to take their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultra-violet rays

The natives grieve when the White Men leave their huts
Because they're obviously....definitely....Nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one
But Englishmen detest-a siesta

In the Philippines they have lovely screens to protect you from the glare
In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englismen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a 
tree

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ho=ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
He-he-he-he-he-he-he
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The toughest Burmese bandit can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down and lie down

In a jungle town where the Sun beats down to the rage of man and beast
The English garb of the English Sahib merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The smallest Malay rabbit deplores this foolish habit
In Hong Kong they strike a gong and fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate, who's in late

In the mangrove swamps where the python romps there is peace from 
twelve till two
Even caribous lie around and snooze for there's nothing else to do
In Bengal to move at all is seldom if ever done
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday sun",Mad Dogs and Englishmen

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Rue Davis,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?

I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.

I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.

Rue Snider,"I made love to a French girl in a hotel by the Mekong Delta in Vietnam 
I tried to pretend she was you but she wasn't 
Wherever you are 
I hope you have somebody who loves you 
That's something I haven't got 

I spent a month with an English girl traveling around Cambodia 
I thought she'd be enough to erase you but she wasn't 
Whoever holds your heart 
I hope that he's really good to you 
But not as good as I was 

The streets I walk are on places you've never been 
But the stars above are the same ones we could see 
When I was beside you 

I gave my all to an LA girl while she was living in Manhattan 
I held her for a while close to my heart until she broke it 
I hope you're warm tonight and that you're not lonely 
But if you are you probably deserve it

Rue Snider,"A stripe wearing beauty queen 
We met when she was broken hearted 
We started kissing in the rain 
I was hoping I could get something started 

We both spent time in the city of brotherly love 
There wasn't a way to resist ‘cause
When I saw her I was falling in love 
When I saw her I was falling in love 

She wasn't ready for anything 
She missed a guy who four months ago left her 
But I still wanted her any way 
Although I was old enough to know better 

We both spent time believing in heaven above 
There wasn't a way to resist ‘cause
When I met her I was falling in love

Some girls take a little time 
Some girls make you feel high 
Some girls you just wanna be inside 

But this one made me wanna give her my life 
When I saw her I was falling in love 
When she smiled I thought there might be a god 
When we kissed I knew what god really was 

Wanted her near in the morning 
But the timing wasn't right and I knew it 
I still dream of her smiling 
Holding her hand is what I wanna be doing 

We both sat silent drinking whiskey in a room full of pain 
There wasn't a way to resist ‘cause

I'd like to have some answers your behavior is confusing enough
I woke up in your arms in the morning 
You were crying as the car was arriving 
We were saying our goodbying while planning for when I'd be arriving

Rue Snider,"I've been using my senses 
But I don't know what for

To just get up and walk to the door

For three days and I don't know when 
After I leave here 
It's ever going to happen again 

So I roll over and kiss her 
Tasting her breath and smelling her hair 
She leans toward me and I touch her 
I can see her we both stare 
Listening to perfect silence 
Both knowing the truth some how 
That one will start leaving

Goodbye to my ears they hear loneliness now

Never had too much money but we always had food to eat

For those he loves 
By what he does

It was a September Sunday 
Momma was baking bread 
Daddy was tending the horses 
I was really sick in bed 
I heard the kettle clack 
Momma fell to the floor 
Blood was coming from her mouth and nose 
I got up and I ran to her 
But she didn't last for very long 
She'd been losing weight for days I'm sorry that I didn't know

Daddy was so broken; he started coughing too 
But he kept working the land you know 
Because that's what a man should do 
He was angry at the Lord 
But he told me not to fret 
He said, ""you've gotta keep believin' son even if you think 
That god let you down, remember it'll pass""

Rue Snider,"""We have time"" she told me right when she was leaving 
As she kissed me and walked out for another week away 
""We have time"" she wrote me when she wasn't in a place to call me 
When her family was around her telling her to stay 

Do we have time I wonder as I stand here thinking of her 
Because having time and timing are everything 
Will there be enough time? 
Will we be ready at the right moment? 
Will our heart and minds surrender to the forces in our way? 

No way to know 
Either way she's gonna go 

If this was science fiction 
I'd get myself a Delorean 
I'd travel to where you don't need roads 
And see if all her leaving leads to returning 
If in the future she and I have a happy home 

""We have real love” she told as we were waking in the morning 
As she touched me and kissed me and took away my pain 
""We have real love"" she told me 
As we were packing her bags for traveling 
As I was getting ready to take her to the plane 

Will we ever be alone together without extenuating circumstances? 
She and I and time to be the people that we dream 
She would draw the world her mind sees 
I would sing her some bad poetry 
We would hide beneath the covers and not be afraid to sleep

Just remember when it's time to get out that I won't be found anywhere around

And post every suicide

Still we’re not happy
And we’re not satisfied
There's another demise on the horizon 
To fill up our tedious lives

Goodbye Amy
Oh I'll miss you so much
Goodbye Amy
Oh I'll miss you so much

She'll just feel so fucking used
Indisposed and broken
The heroin and the muse 
And her pipes still smoking

There never was money 
In her getting clean
So she died a hundred times 
In checkout magazines

Oh I'll miss you so much

Oh I'll miss you so much

Rue Snider,"I’m writing this song on New Years Eve 
I wrote one a year before 
It was a sad dark tune about my broken heart and snow and 
Not knowing where you were 
Another year has passed and I’m lifting a glass 
To say good bye and hello to the new 
But the only thing I wanted for Christmas was to be close to you 

Hey hey merry Christmas 
Hey hey happy New Year too 

When the ball drops in Manhattan 
And he leans his head in close to yours 
And your heart speeds up and your palms sweat honey listen 
Well he’s in your eyes and you taste his breath 
But there’s something you’re probably missing 
Cause you shouldn’t be kissing who you’re kissing 

Hey hey merry Christmas 
Hey hey happy New Year too 

I spent last year trying to make things right, but 
Sometimes I try to fight 
New York City remains a light in the dark 
I need a thread to sew my broken heart 
So much leaving and returning 
So many ambitious dreams 
Sometimes leave me empty 
Sometimes leave me stumbling 

When your mother calls to say happy New Year 
Remember all the moments we shared 
I’ll be singing in a bar with some friends quite aware 
That you’re not there 
I hear the man in your mouth isn’t in your heart 
I hope you find a way to tell him the truth 
And remember the pace of its rhythm when it was me and you 

Hey hey merry Christmas 
Hey hey happy New Year too

Rue Snider,"January 28th 1986 
I remember the newscast interrupting the TV I was watching 
At home from school my best friend was there 
If I recall correctly 
I thought, ""Oh my god Gaddafi has bombed us from a tiny country"" 
Far away though I didn't know where Libya was exactly 
But we sat there and watched the disaster 
Of the Space Shuttle Challenger 
Exploding over the Atlantic Ocean 

73 seconds it had only been gone 73 seconds 
A minute and a few 
Our lives are made of minutes made of seconds 
One day will be the last for me for you 
Give me 73 seconds of truth 

You can't escape with money or power 
Death in all its glory and profundity comes for everyone 
Could be a failed O-ring seal in a solid rocket booster and a fire 
Could be the impact of the crew compartment slamming into the water 
Could be a car wreck, a violent attack, or something genetic from your father 
But we all go one way or another 
Like those 7 brave souls in the Challenger 
Who were lost over the Atlantic Ocean

32 month hiatus of the shuttle program 
There was negligence on NASA's part sure, it's a government agency 
What did you expect, efficiency and concern for human beings?
They knew about the dangers but were corrupted by ""go fever"" 
Like a bride who's not in love but really really really really wants a wedding 
I watched it on TV 
Christa McAuliffe I remember when you gave your life 
Snuffed out over the Atlantic Ocean 

73 seconds it had only been gone 73 seconds

No more, no more 
Bounce baby, bounce baby 
You can move, uh

Baby, relax, sit back and chill (yeah) 
Just give me a second 
And let me tell you how I feel 
Cause all around town you've been steppin' out 
Runnin' your mouth about 
What made you think I wouldn't find out? 
Wasn't I there for you? 
Truly cared for you 
Maybe my love was just too good

No more late night creeps 
No more VIP's 
No more dough 
We can't even kick it no more 

I saw you on the Ave in the Nav 
In the backseat deep spilling Henney in his lap 
Thought it was me you was all about 
But I'm having doubts 
Cause I see you try-na play me out 
But when the brother called the crib with beef 
Didn't I represent you? 
When I caught him in the streets 
So let me get the keys to Lex and then my checks 
And no more hanging begets around your neck, babe

Ruff Endz,"Gonna tell you a story,
Where does love go, where does love go, baby.
Say you want to find love in her.
Listen love, listen closely,
So I'll tell you something.

I've been thinking to myself, what the hell I did wrong.
Always in a relationship that, that never last long.
Let me tell you a little story, about someone I met.
A situation so trifling that, that I'd never forget.

So I met this girl and, she seemed so right.
I got so caught up by, what was on outside.
As time went on, I really got to know.
That the girl I thought was an angel, was nuttin' but a hoe.
My homie tried to warn me, but I was too caught up.
I started tripping on my best friend, I told him shut the fuck up.
I said ""You don't know what yer talkin' 'bout, this girl loves me.""
But as quiet as kept, she was lovin' everybody else.

Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Somebody now tell me now, baby.
Cause I can't seem to find true love no more.
I can't seem to find baby,
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Cause I can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.

Listen to this,
I still wasn't trying to hear,
What my man was kickin' in my ear.
Heard the same gossip, down in a barber shop,
But I still didn't hear.
I had to find out, found out the hard way,
Til my man called me up on phone, this is,
This is was what he said.
""You remember what I told ya, about your girlfriend
Saw her down at Kiesha's party,
Drove off with a nigga named Ronnie.""
""Uh un, this can't be true.""
""But this what is I, been trying to tell you,
That the woman you love, just trying to play you all day!""

So I left work early, trying catch this girl.
Driving all over town, I couldn't find my girl.
I finally gave up, and, I took my ass home.
That's when I found my girl, laying with Ronnie,
They was getting it on, tell me.

Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Somebody now tell me now, baby.
Cause I can't seem to find true love no more.
I can't seem to find baby,
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Cause I can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.

Somebody tell me, tell me, I said tell me.
Somebody show me, show me, you gotta show me.
Somebody tell me, tell me.
Where does love go from here, where does love go.
Somebody tell me, tell me, I said tell me.
Somebody show me, show me,
Somebody tell me, tell me.
Where does love go from here, somebody sing it.

Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Somebody now tell me now, baby.
Cause I can't seem to find true love no more.
I can't seem to find baby,
Can't somebody tell me where the love goes from here.
Cause I can't seem to find true love and peace of mind.

Can't somebody tell me, somebody show me,
I want to find, I need to find true love and peace of mind.
Somebody tell me baby, I need to know.
I want to find,
True love, true love, true love, true love.
I need to know, I need to know, I need to know.
I'm searching long, I'm searching long to find.
Somebody, anybody, they treat me right,

Ruff Endz,"I'm sitting here crying in the dark
I'm trying to mend the wounds of my broken heart
It's hard to believe that your really gone
It's hard to really accept it and move on

There's times I feel all hope is gone
I'm wanting embrace from your loving arms
But I must try and start all over again
And know that within myself I have strength

Look to the hills, look to the mountains
From you in the storm, you can find strength
I know the hurt and pain that you cry
And no matter what goes on the sun will shine

There's a lot of things I wanted to tell you
A lot of more getting to know you
But through God, I believe I can talk to you
And tell you that I'm always missing you

Sometimes I get so lonely
And it seems like life ain't worth living for
When hurt and pain is all you feel inside
You go to look to the hills and say ""I will survive""

Look to the hills, look to the mountains
From you in the storm, you can find strength
I know the hurt and pain that you cry
And no matter what goes on the sun will shine

When you're down and out and there's no way out
And you think that hope is gone
Lift your head up high and be strong and

Look to the hills, look to the mountains
From you in the storm, you can find strength
I know the hurt and pain that you cry
And no matter what goes on the sun will shine

Look to the hills, look to the mountains
From you in the storm, you can find strength
I know the hurt and pain that you cry
And no matter what goes on the sun will shine

Look to the hills, look to the mountains
From you in the storm, you can find strength
I know the hurt and pain that you cry
And no matter what goes on the sun will shine

Ruff Endz,"Baby Love, I think its time now 
To share with you these feelings that I'm feeling now 
It's been three years since I've known you 
Nothing but happiness since I've found you 

Its been a long time coming still going strong 
Through good and bad we've been holding on 
Within my soul its been overdue 
'Cause my hearts been longing to ask you 

[Chorus]
Will you be mine on this day 
Will you be the sun shining may 
Will you be the stars and my nights 
Will you be the joy, the joy in my life 
Will you be my everything 
Will you be the happy every song I sing 
Will you be the love I can't deny 
Will you be the love, the love of all time 
Will you be mine 

When I think about how it all began 
I was looking for fun but somehow we became 
Good friends 
We couldn't see this fate that lied ahead 
Or that we would ever bond like we did 

I praise the day my fate was revealed 
Now I know that destiny is real 
Is it a sin for love to feel this good 
I don't think but I'm asking you 

[Chorus] 

I'm down on my knees to vow to you 
My everlasting love because its overdue 
For all the times we shared and those to come 
Is ever still coming 
This ring is a token of my love with you 

[Chorus]",Will You Be Mine
Ruff Endz,"Chorus
You, it doesn't matter what I say or do
Cause every step I take leads to you
And now I realize it's true
The only love for me is you
It doesn't matter how far I roam
Cause every road I take leads back home
And now the fact is absolute
The only love for me is you

I thought I needed time and space
But baby that was just a front
I never knew how much we had
Until I almost gave it up

I was so blind that I could not see
It was all in our history
Everything I wanted love to be
Had been given to me by

Chorus

Thank you for being a friend
And giving me one more chance
I'm so glad you wouldn't let it end
And I'm lost within your sweet romance

I was a fool to ever let you go
Being away made the feeling grow
Now all I want to do is show you
How much I'm in love with

Chorus

You opened up the door
Showed me what my heart is for
And now you're the one I want to be with forever more
Baby, baby oh baby it's you, it's you

It's plain to see that you're the one
Every moment I'm around you, I fall
Cause everything you say and do
It always comes straight from the heart
And there's no mistaking
You make me the best I can be
They can keep the stars and mountains and seas

You are the world to me
You are the world to me
For all the rest of my life
And heaven can see
You are the world to me

Oh you are, oh yeah baby
I'm better off when you light the way
It doesn't matter if there's no move at all
The reason I live everyday
Oh I felt the home in your heart
And it makes no difference
The rivers can run where they please
They can keep the stars and mountains and seas
Cause you are the world to me, baby

How can I let go?

Verse One: 

Couldn't live the life I live 
Why's that 
I could die any minute  I get high every minute 
Fuckin' with snake niggas  and sleepin' with foul bitches 
Came through on the lightest whip with two pounds in it 
Pull over where the hustlers be 
Why's that 
Cause I get chills when you talk of hustlin' Gs 
So I'm always where the powder be at 
What it mean 
I can blow five bricks to ten in an hour if that 
Stay away from where the cowards be at 
Why's that 
Time is money god, and you can't get an hour back 
Or I would do it again to get the power back 
Have godfather status, make niggas bow to that 
You can all shine and glitter and keep the ones 
Fives and tens, for twenties and up, we dummy it up 
Make a lot of money, and look bummy and what 
Cause money ain't shit, respect is everything 
So if I kill niggas dead, don't ask me shit 
I take blunts to the head, so don't pass me shit 
I'd rather die from a bullet, than a nasty bitch 
If the good die young, all that mean to me 
is that the hood die young/ We call it the last days 
What you know about coppin a house to fight pits in 
Or blowin' weed smoke on the cops that write tickets 
Henny and what, shit we can semi it up 
With your picture on the wall, in memory of 
Stay in sync with the hood, gray minks with the hood 
We tryin' to get money like chinks in the hood 
They ask me how I'm doing now 
I tell 'em better than them 
And if your man front 
He can get eleven in him 
And if you told them once 
Then you better tell him again 
Ay yo, now let's see 
Who you know fuckin with Sheek Luc, Jadakiss, 
And S' paper

We hit the ?wreek? of law, Run and hide niggas (Let's go) 
Death is the only thing that might divide niggas (C'mon) 
So don't fuck around with them Ryde or Die niggas (Let's go) 

Verse Two: 
So we speakin', all I know your face will be leakin' 
I rap full time and still pump bass on the weekend 
A nigga hoppin' all over the map 
And what you learn 
That niggas with long paper take longer to crap 
That's why every chance I me a gat 
And why you rather buy you a chain 
I aim at your brain 
Nigga, robbery is all we know, so how we gon go broke 
When we can just take all y'all dough 
And then fly out to Cuba, and get in the coke fields 
Die off the buddha, fifty and fifty mill 
Bring drama cause Gianconna got Kennedy killed 
If you come through in a jet, you frontin' wit us 
Cause when the coke price was up 
It was nuthin to us 
We got blocks full of heroin 
Weed and dust/ Seen bullets pop off 
Cause of greed and lust 
And when the big dogs die 
Who gon feed the pups 
My niggas is here, so you know the circle is tight 
I circle the block, and cut off the lights 
Pray to Christ 
Cause when the cops come in, we carry shotguns 
Dem niggas with the most ice, get the hot ones 
Stay on your job, nigga I'ma stay on mine 
And if I lose my voice nigga, I'ma flow online 
And by next year, we should have a thousand guns

To keep our love stable

Sold the crack when I was down in AC
Back on the block Jay-Z mother fucker from the, the, the Roc
Went solo on that ass but it's still the same
Brooklyn be the place where I serve them thangs
Be my niggas was struggling, to the 'burbs they came
And then we got to hustling, mudering thangs
I dipped in my stash, splurged on a chain
Now I'm Titianic, Iceberg's the name
Leave players on injured reserve, hurt the game
The best way to describe me in the word, insane
I dick down chicks all emerged in my fame
Jigga been dope since Slick Rick's first chain
The God, send you back to the earth from which you came
I'm baking soda, waterfire, merged with 'cane

See I scrambled with priests, hustle with nuns
I got the mind capacity of a young Butch Cassidy
Niggas get fly, let 'em defy gravity
Four-five rapidly lift your chest cavity
Streets won't let me chill
Always been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill
Mother fuckers wanna wet me still, I remain ya'll
Raw, the one, like five divided by four

Reciprocated and multiplied by more

I don't give a fuck if I sold one or one million, but I think you should
Cause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood
The all black, in the gloves, the outcome ain't good
Them niggas act like wolves, how come? They could
Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash
Till the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass
All I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn de'Glass
Let me sit up in they whip till I launch it back
Snap they neck, then shoot 'em till they aren't sent back
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back
Monster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that
And everybody sing-a-long to the track, Come on

Yo 



[Verse 1] 

I'm like the Dow Jones of rap  my stocks is high 

And it never was all of  so stop the lies 

Mothafuckas'll blow your brains out  and watch you bleed 

The same niggaz that you trust, let 'em watch your seed 

You got a dead niggaz, money don't stop the greed 

That's why now I gotta rock my vest, pop my 3 

And whoever die first, may god forgive 

the nigga who lives, sometimes you gotta handle your biz 

To my niggaz when I die, keep inhalin' the lye 

And come to my wake high, when your tellin' me bye 

What goes around comes around, am I comin' or goin'? 

All i'm tryin' to do is leave you numb, gunnin' or flowin' 

I might cock-back the gauge, and start shootin' at 'cha people 

I'm lookin for the devil 'cause money's the root of evil 

And 'Kiss won't be happy 'til my bezel look see-through 

Until I flood N-why with pediquo and diesle 

Catch me with the top, off my whip 

Bust my gun while it's still tucked so you could hop, off my dick 

I run with a few parolees, all thieves, that rocks ice 

Blue pacholies and rolies 

At the mob meetin', keep quite when the God speakin' 

Squeeze my joint, 'til my mothafuckin' palm squeakin' 

And nevermind who the lox'll sign to (that's right) 

What difference do it make nigga? 

Just listen to the tape nigga (c'mon)

[Verse 2] 

Yeah, Yo, Yo 

I want to know, is the promise land heaven or hell? 

'cause the niggaz that made promises, most of them fell 

If you hungry, then I got some niggaz servin' the shells 

With no sauce, and they silver, only take one to kill you 

It's a small world, so you better guard your secrets 

And it's easy to get money, but it's hard to keep it 

Never was the one that like to hound no bitch 

All I do is try to keep niggaz around me rich 

Screw all-a-y'all cowards, I consider you lames 

Had to save my lunch money just to get in the game 

That was back when I used-ta have a mean back-spin 

And no mack-10, it was just bats then 

you know, beat a nigga down, take his rope 

Now we-a, heat a nigga down, take his coke 

And you can call me if you want to bye them thangs 

I get 'em half-price 'cause papi know my name 

Call me, Jay to the mmwwaa 

And everything you got in your livin room, I got in my car 

'Cept for the bar 

I try to put a little money away 

'cause you know they say, tomorrow ain't promised today 

Either bubblin' or strugglin', nuttin between

Cause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got

From the days in school, now a motherfucker rule
And I could drop my chain in court, yeah, keeps ya cool

And I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest
My bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk

But if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag
So you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag
Must I brag?  My shit paid for, yours tagged
And every bitch you grabbed, Sheek bend em back

Ayo I hope you aint tongue-kissin your spouse
Cause I be fuckin her in the mouth

In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry
Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin to touch me,  what type of shit you on? 
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon
Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggaz is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a backdraft
cause my fire retirin, aight then

Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a I love a slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I cant control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I
Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, one niggaz shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

Ruff Ryder Nigga, Volume 2
We show niggas the meaning of ryde or die
So all that bullshit you talking, go head nigga

(Jadakiss)
You don't gotta slap me five or give me a hug 
And it hurts when you gotta kill a nigga you love
But I'm gone deal wit my enemies sooner
Cause I got'em looking for my solo album like Kennedy Jr.
Fuck crush ice, go head and get your shine on
I'm bout to cop rocks that why'all niggas can climb on
Don't worry bout why I ain't got mine on
I want some new shit, I don't want nothing that you can tell time on
Things ain't all good right now 
Cause some more niggas die an turn all you in the hood right now
why'all can stop acting like that nigga J gone squeeze
Cause all I got is misdeameanors and some ACD's
why'all gon make me lay something down I promise
And Puff wear scarmas and listen to Carl Thomas
Fuck runnin and hidin, we copping more guns
An we coming outside cause somebody gotta die

(Chorus)
Go head you know we getting plenty of Dough
Go head you know we lighting plenty of dro
Go head you know we coming from why-O
Go head truly though Go head really though
Go Head you know we hitting plenty of hos
Go head you know we ripping plenty of shows
Go head you know we coming from why-O
Go head truly though Go head really though

(Sheek)
Now I warned why'all niggas that Sheek was the one
Now I'm warning why'all niggas that I got my gun
Read' to kill, don't worry bout no doctor bill
It ain't gone be one of those, just yo' casket closed
LOX, nah you rather fuck wit the cops
cause I'll pop and turn why'all like the optimum box
Mo pay-per-view, this trey-eight will do
some'in ugly and let the morgue zip up your crew
want to hope on our dicks and go Willie yo bikes
and wear Ruff Ryder tees, motherfucker please
You a Pocanos nigga, why don't you stick to the skis
And I don't hear a nigga raps no more
So I don't bother to go in the store an cop why'all shit
Only time I cop why'all shit if Lox on it
I shoot you in yo mouth ain't no calling the cops
I want my shit back like Castro and Elian's pop

Chorus 
(Styles)
I'm always that, I'm always this
But the floor stay nasty like hallway piss
If you here the P spitting it's a deep ass song
When I die mama bury me wit street clothes on
Cause drama be the threapy, the beef goes on
should've been speaking out of it makes it a lot
But I was fucking wit the savages, kicking the drop
Live for the money, die for my niggas, run from the law
Catch me smoking my weed or fucking your whore
Push my whip to the limit kind of hoping it flip
Throw my clip to the tip kind of hoping you flip
I feel sorry for the crackheads, but happy for myself
So I got mixed feelings about this hussling shit
I keep saying I'm gone quit after a couple of bricks
But I can't stop building and I don't pop children
But I got no problem kidnapping a bitch

Man, I hear you niggas talkin
But you walkin the wrong way to really mean it
I done heard it, I done seen it, don't get caught up in between it

It's a dark road you walkin on, same street that I be stalkin on
Suppose to be quiet, but you keep talkin on
Now ya mouth got you in some shit
So we goin' let everybody see your gangsta ass get smaked like a bitch

Guess I'll remind y'all niggas, I can find y'all niggas
Click click, what's up, walk up right behind y'all niggas
Once the four four hit' you
You ain't going no where but out the door on a stretcher

Boy, I'm a get you
Wet y'all niggas up like a pool
'Cause I done told you, y'all goin' MAKE ME LOSE MY COOL
Yo Knock get the glock, these bitch niggas is actin

All that yappin, that them niggas is gettin away with
Take it easy my friend, let 'em know, dog ain't to be played with

A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back

I'm fuckin with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad

Uh, uh, uh
Most of these hard rocks turn out to be soft as wet dog shit
Talkin shit, but when the fog spits, dog they all split
Then all hit the ground around the same time

In the same frame of mind, 'things up in the nine' 
left them bitches blind, hit 'em up from behind
Yeah, that's how you do that
And he had such a good head up on his shoulders, but I blew that

Fuck you black, you new cats don't know somethin important
You die quick fuckin' with my shit, and my shits extortin'
House rules, when I speak, y'all niggas listen
I drop jewels that y'all cats can't afford to keep missin'

Drinkin ??? fueled by drugs
Shits about to get real out of hand dog, betta get ya man dog
Rap shit comes second, I'm a show you what a robber do
Mention ice one more time and I'm robbin you

Tie you up for a week starvin' you
Beatin' the shit out of you everyday, 'cause yo, these niggas gotta pay

[Chorus]

[DMX]
Uh, uh, uh
Dog it ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste

'Cause he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, YES
Ain't a whole lot to braking a nigga down fast

They call me black 'Cause that's how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin thing going down 'til I eat
So can I beef? You betta while you still got teeth

'Cause they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Popped out, through a you know what
'Cause you know why, and you know my

Motherfuckin' name up in this game
And bitch, you know I
Will never be crossed flippin', but on some east coast terms

You heard it from the P, you oughta know it's the truth
I get you kidnapped and raped and thrown off a roof
You could nod your head to this like it's only a rap
'Cause when these bullets hit yo' ass I'm like it's only a gat

I need a funeral to feel good, I'm hopin it's yours
Think he religious? Heard he got shot in the cross
Holiday Styles, bitch I broke most of the laws
Fuck with the Porsche or flip to the boots, stick to the truth

Do anything it takes just to get me this loot
And missin' a tooth, but both of 'em chipped, toaster is gripped
You heard about the trouble, I start most of the shit
When I squeeze ain't no controllin' the wrist

And niggas leave the room when they hear the P flowin to Swizz
I'm an ignorant and negative nigga
I sell crack, bust guns, pop shit, and say I'm better than niggas
You think not, I'll look at your man and level a nigga

If you think a rapper's better why don't you give me his name
So I can run up on him, tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets, I'm the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters, but I'm bigger than why'all

If I left the gun home, I'ma give you the sword
I'm the devil in the flesh, I can't give you the Lord
It don't make no sense for you to pray for your life
I got my niggas in the crib, you oughta pray for your wife

[Chorus: Jadakiss and Styles]
Jadakiss: Uh huh, HOLIDAY
Styles: I gotta make it to heaven for goin through hell
J: HOLIDAY
S: And I don't care if I sell, why'all know what I sell
J: HOLIDAY
S: I use my left hand when I'm loadin the shells
J: HOLIDAY
S: 'cause I know it ain't right, that's why I'm blowin a L

[Styles Paniro]
Yo..
I do it all for my niggas, even ride wit a bomb
Get shot, die in his arm, and give him my last
It's a million dollar bail, I'ma get it in cash

I sell crack like it's '88, I live in the past
You know the P carry the gun, live in the Maz'
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash
I like Malibu and pineapple, fifties of hash

Hundreds of 'dro, wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor, catch me right next to the dog
I'm Holiday Styles, and that's what the weaponry for
And I probably won't blow for the fact that I'm hard

But I'm good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Gettin' jewels from the old timers, stashin the cards
But jail ain't part of the plans

I keep weight on the scale 'cause I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars, I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash 'em up, the boy mighta went platinum but don't gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut

I don't deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes, I don't make mistakes
Double are now bitch you oughta know I'ma ghost
Blow up your face, blow up the coke, and blow up the smoke

[Chorus]",Holiday
Ruff Ryders,"Yo, yo, I know niggas wit honor and will
That'll still crush the blow up and then pass they mama the bill
So I'm a always be able to burn my strip
'Cause my bags be stuffed and I burn my tips

And it ain't no tellin' what the snub'll do
So when y'all go and cop vests cop one for your mother too
And I'm way better than them other dudes
But I'm stuck wit, what I'm stuck wit, cause I don't suck dick

Sat with the players and I stood with the coaches
And I'm a always be in the hood like roaches
Flow is ferocious, dough is ferocious
Two guns by each lung with no holsters

And I control all the fish scale in the city
And still make your first week sales look pretty
I come through, all you hear is chip in the muffler
And you could ask anybody if the Kiss is a hustler

[Chorus]
Styles: He's a hustler
Jadakiss: I hustle anywhere, any town, any borough, any strip, uh
S: He's a gambler
J: I always hold it down, gettin bankroll in 4, 5, 6 in trips
S: He's a gangster
J: I always make the paper and the FBI got me on they list, that's why
S: He's a Ruff Ryder nigga, Ryde or Die nigga
J: By the way, did I tell you that my name is Kiss?

And I don't understand how a broke nigga could chill
When a two liter'll dust you so get you a mil
Yes I got loose ends, poppin out the sunroof of the blue M
I'm like Lou Sims

And I'm a make sure they hit you wit both shotties
I think this summer's gon be the most bodies
You never ask a nigga in jail if he chillin
Just make sure you make all the sales in the building

'Cause now niggas think it's all right to tell
And you could put out some garbage and it might could sell
A lot of niggas be petty and sheist
But that's only til you treat 'em like a video and edit they life

This is a threat, when I talk you listen to death
And if I run out of money then my wrist is a bet
And the streets said they wanted more Kiss
Up north niggas pop me in, and do a hundred more dips

[Chorus]

Yo, whether it's dope money or rap money, gamble the shit
Trey pounds of Mauseburgs, handle the shit
Got too big for the city, cops brought in the feds
So we moved across the map and brought in the bread

Niggas chill for a month and a half, no ruckus
Got the pictures of baggers and all of the gun busters
And you know how it go, 'cause it rarely'll change
Everybody got a license and a alias name

We don't smoke when we hustle and none of us talk
Back to back til we home, we can front in New York
'Cause some of us is runnin' from court
Smokin' weed, mumblin' thoughts

Tryin' to stay humble for shorts
We could do this the mob way and kiss you on both cheeks
Or do it the hard way and shoot through your gold teeth
Stand on any block, play cee-lo and craps
And break niggas for they pack money, then give it back, uh

[Chorus: x2]",My Name Is Kiss
Ruff Ryders,"I'm pushin for the single yo, c'mon
Yo lock the door, uh huh
Ya heard, uh, uh
C'mon, yeah
Y'all know who it is, or should I say what it is
Uh, uh
[Verse 1]
All Drag do is fuck bitches, and drain his body
Kickin bitches out the bed and sleep next to a shottie
A bitch'll never get me pump, I make niggas pump IV
I'm the type to follow the cops wit a midget drivin me
Make them think the car drivin itself, and I'm in the passenger seat
Signal lights, stashbox, a package of D
Drag dash, I'm happy to be
On, this rap shit is like a jacket to me
I wear it with cracks in my sleeves
So I keep it on, don't never take my jacket off cuz my shit be gone
What are you, lost your mind?
It took my time to cut these dimes
So I could dump drug a few minds, so don't make me bust a few nines
Dip the T T in polish watch the shoe shine
Slip in the Tunnel with a banger in my bootline
All it takes is the finger to make a sour sit, linger
Double R is hard, the rest of y'all is R & B singers
CHORUS 2X:
WEED
That's what we smokin up
HOES
That's what we pokin up
DOUGH
That's what we foldin up
That's all we know about
[Verse 2]
I got more bullets in my clip, than chocolate got in chip
I got more bitches suckin dick, than niggas smokin niks
I got more shit up in my whip, than most niggas got in cribs
I got more, blocks of raw while y'all tryin to stop wars
Coward nigga lock your doors
I'll come through with the locksmith and pop it
With the glock 4 and show y'all what a mouth's for
I got black steel, blue steel, wheels, I mean wheelchair
Cuz Drag is real fair, it's all real here
I own more buildings on my block, than real estate, philly ave
Hit ten niggas I'm tryin to see mils like Billy Gates
Cuz me in Philly rollin dutches
Me and Eve, stuck off the trees, got her laughin off bitches' weaves
Double R, pop niggas, make niggas bleed
Fiends come to me my top rock's been asleep
Seven foot bouncers bout to be six feet, under me
Now that's a foot left, you shouldn't have took that step
CHORUS
[Verse 3]
I know y'all wish y'all woulda, shoulda, coulda
Didda, getta, gotta, guns we cock it then pop it
Make 'em holler and swallow
Niggas stop it, catch it, all up in his jacket
I'm not a stingy nigga, I'll let a nigga have it
Hate chips that go away, lookin like white coke
Sit in the sun long, come back like french toast
Hair was up, now is down, eyes are black, now is brown
Used to frown, now you smile, nigga must have left you now
Went from bikes to the car, from the cars to the boat
Went from keys to the coke, went from coke to the dope
Went from cracks to the raps, went from bats to the gats
Went from slums to the stats, been to London and back
Me change cuz I rap, I can't do it
I went from muggin y'all to payin niggas to do it
It's all the same stupid
I got cake on cake, cuz I went from pow to pow
Wit my family, two R's, Ryde or Die

Look what the cat dragged in
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror
Scoop a high yellow Cinderella, Meth forever
Never rush a rhyme, hope to never bust my nine
But if I have to, I have to, it's all in the mind
I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind
Tryin to relight ya lime
It's a crime when I drop bomb lines designed
To tick, tick, boom blow your mind
Yeah me, M-E-T, H, the O, the D
Can't be done, like tryin to find a penny in the sea
Nigga run for cover son go and get them guns
Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around here gettin' ones

Pull my dart gun and bust sixteen until it's dead

Come on, huh
Come on, yo, yo, yo
Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
Twenty steps ahead of the rest they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title ""hard""
Me pick of the litter
I was born to bubble why'all
Born to change game shit born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless
Nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve
Eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden
You better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes!
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough ryde you niggas hard head, soft spine
Pass the word
Must have the stacks to cross lines
Come on

Now don't start flippin' it
Everybody know
We've been had dough

Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home
And make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo I got it all too
A four, five, and a six and they all blue
And I don't care what she think

Yo, yo ay yo
One touch will make a nigga blush on site
Grown men create a crush, nails they bite
It's a game try to catch me but only if you can
It takes a lot to impress the bombshell to want a man
And it ain't about your dough baby Eve alright
Cause if Eve want to fly away, Eve take a flight
Eve hungry for a meal baby Eve get a bite
You nice and you might get to see it daddy, tight

Yo, yo, yo
I'm glad that you got it all
That's more for me
And I ain't gotta pay for the puss I score for free
And the same thing I pulled on them
I pulled on you
Come on now how you think I pulled your crew?
Got my own crib so you can't kick me out
I'll call one of your friends to come twist me out
If you know Jada then you know what Kiss be 'bout

Keep the heat up in jeeps, in case y'all creep up on me 
I run up on y'all in a cab with a meter on me 
And the only on leavin' is me

Ain't shit sweet, pile 'em in here
All my thugs in the clubs start wildin' in here
Now put your bottles in the air, then light your dutches 
Me and Busta keep it tight like liposucion
Niggas that don't like me get the knife for frontin'
Cause one night in the club gets your life on crutches
You got that whodie, I'll cock that forty
Flyin' in the 5 with the top back on it 
Stop that shorty, I know you love me
Probably sample one of my beats then owe me money
Plus you don't know me money, so stop the rumors
Before you need the janitors to come mop the room up
Ryde or Die Volume two, smash the charts
Now put your hands in the air for the black Mozart, OH!

For the Ruff Ryder, and my nigga Swizz
And we gonna be here to present
Y'all niggas with some other shit to bang in the street
And block the fuck out, bang the fuckin' floor with your feet
Before we bang y'all niggas all with the heat
Feed y'all niggas more gutters like a mutherfuckin' all you can eat
And make you bounce how poncho will play the congo
And bang on the bongo, free to bounce on the bongo
From New York to Colorado, so just follow
I'm living for today and livin' tomorrow
Open up your mouth, I got somethin' big for you to swallow
Blow you through the chest with a hollow
Like the foul shit you waste and transpired right infront the impalo 
Yo, the general Busta Busta shock and memorable 
You know we precious like minerals, and deadly like burials

Swizz Beats:

Listen, Flipmode and Ruff Ryders bang out hits
S-W-I two Z's bang out clips 
Bang out chicks, for fun we bang out whips 
Y'all go to war with revolvers that bang out flicks 
Now find me on two-fifth in the summer when it starts 
And iced up, nice cut, new pair of Jordans
Thinkin' of extortin, nigga your life ain't important 
Your camp hotter than ours?, the fuck y'all snortin'
My thugs bang out bricks, swing, mix, throw dem grams 
Hash smokers, hopin' more and out of soda cans 
(Yo Swizz, I heard you stole), Whoa! listen man
Mindin' my business will make you a missin' man
See the wrist and hand?, got plaques on the wall
And a fifth in hand, I'll put your back on the wall
Nigga don't ask me no more about nuttin' you hear
Just scream and shout and just wild in here

And if you ever go to jail, they'll rape and beat'cha
Hold up, take a breather, I'm way too tough
Got kicked outta pre-school, played to rough

Used to take your lunch money now I steal your jewelry

Clear blocks outs, hop out the family van
Lookin like a handy man, with tools on the waist
Put'choo in the ambulance with two's in your face
You'se a disgrace, you've never been hot
And I can tell how you talkin you ain't never been shot
Yo, it's whatever or not, if you want it, it's war
You can choose what I'ma use, the pump or the four
Then decide where you gon' die, trunk of the floor

D-Block

Hey yo, it's jay hood bitch respect my bars
The doctors had to piece together your face like a collage
Niggas always talk breezy till the steel come out
And slugs rip through their gums and their grill come out
Motherfuck you and fuck your mans
If I don't clap you in the dome
I'm a leave clips in your diaphragm
I'm the hood prophet
Puff purple instead of chocolate
Stay from around chumps and cowards cause they gossip
And I'm a stay on the corner like stop signs
With a pack of them creamy colored rocks and the glock nine
When you speaking of the hardest nigga
Bring hood's name up
D Block bitch, we about to have the game chained up
My words too strong, bars too powerful
And your towel can't dry you when the dumdums shower you
Your mad because your garbage and your lyrics is boring
And your whip was made that same year you was born in

Listen man, Don't worry how many gats this crook has
Just know I stay strapped like book bags
Bitch is shook ass
You just getting off the porch
And me? I'm just getting off in court
I could make sure your coffin bought
Why would you mention a burner?
There is a difference between rap and attempting to murder
Talking the shit you living and the shit you heard of
You said fuck Larceny?
What is you crazy, bitch?
Before you walk the streets, here's a few safety tips
Watch who you speaking bout and watch who you speaking to
The cats you speaking bout could show you what the heat could do
A respirator is what you'll be breathing through
And you got beef with who that you need toast
The closest you came to beef was meat loaf
When we pose with bats and pea coats
Y'all niggas better be close

To fuck with Cam, y'all bitches better hope and dream
Every gun that I own got a scope and beam
When I approach the things shake the dice, rook the team
Best bitch on the east coast since Queen
Latifah, buy reefer, fly diva
Ride deeper, four pound bump louder than five speaker
Spit fire, hot lava flow
Don't get twisted, I'm not one of them prada hoe's
Catch me in Escada clothes, with a lot of dough
That's not mine, it's his
I need a lot more to live
You got to get the king before the kid
How you think a bitch like me afford to live motherfucker?

That's a bad bitch, shit you a bad ass nigga,
It's the younger generation, killing y'all, live, get busy on these niggas

Hey look, I'm trying to sell mad gravy
So I get birds from my crew and make Erykah Badu my ""Bag Lady""
You that crazy? Squeeze, I know you ain't spitting shells
Your hand shake so much it shows up on the Richter scale
I made the huskiest niggas look like they had sickle cell
I don't just sell bricks, dog I got a bitch for sale
So let me find the nigga that hate us a lot
No coffin, he get buried in the refrigerator box
God damn, I'm a hot man
I'm telling you straight up, I got my weight up
I'm calling my wrists Roxanne
Cause if I wore it in a dark room
You and your man would hate how I look animated like a cartoon
Bottom line, I'm telling you that you ain't fucking with me
Hard, nobody guards, you want a shot, come and get me
I'm not a sucker, nor is any nigga running with me
And why are y'all balling with wheels if they under fifty
nigga

Lock and blocks the motto
Got more slow than Dr. Zhivago
Same mind state that makes a poem rock in Chicago
But I don't get my gangster from movies
I'm a rock star, 5 star tellies, running with gangsters and groupies
Come through and leave a voice sick
Cause my S-type steers with a joystick
I'm the heart in my era
Listen, I lead an autistic life
Paint pictures with my actions, ain't no margin for error
My innate features, leave niggas dismayed, speechless
And please don't mistake weakness for kindness
I fuck with old timers
So don't make me forget that you real and catch Alzheimer's
Motherfucking hoes I spoil them
Remember, I'm known to break a bitch for reckless eyeballing
The top dog, nigga, I'm the bear truth
You want to get math?
Nigga I'm the square root
The rock star

I got mean stash
You seen case get his thug on
I strip my bitch and we get our hug on
She what I put drugs on and get my grub on
And dog, when you park your car, put your club on
The next cat I put the snub on
I'm a clap the gat till it get too hot, and that's with gloves on
You love drawing, you should go to an art school
I get my club on with the glow in the dark jewels
Trees in my shoes, polo in the dark blues
And I spark tools that the po and the narcs use
Fuckers, y'all stupid or something
What's the point in pulling your joint if you ain't shootin at nothing
Dude, fronting will get you banged in the face
If you have braces then you know how the banger will taste
I'm near anything pertaining to cake
Just copped the blue lighting with the rectangular face
Easy

Easy niggas, matter of fact fuck that go hard,
Cass' show these niggas how you built,
grab your guns and bust off, my nigga

Yeah my nigga, it's Cassidy bitch, get the name clear
I'm what you lame steer got the game near
Buy 'caine by the square, sell it by the o
I run through snow like a reindeer
The cool kid, got the coke heads nose red like Rudolf
I grind on the strip so hard I got blue balls
I'd rather knock a q off then get blue off
That's how I stay on my toes like my shoes off
You dudes are soft, really bitch like Ra Paul
When's it's war I move out like U-hauls
I'm a true boss
I send eight balls to the corner
My strip like a pool hall
And I ball like I been in the sport
My trigger finger itching like it got genital warts
Don't play around with him boy (why's that)
Cause Cass is a pain in the ass like hemorrhoids

Hell yeah, A-town, LUDA
Ahh, whoo!

She said she was a stripper but she wanted to rhyme
And if I gave her a deal she make her legs stretch back to her spine
I told her hit the treadmill, 'til she run out of time
And in the eve no doubt, she was blowin my mind

I'm from the A-town, put 'em through a GA course
'Cause ""it's all in the game"" like EA Sports
From scams and money grams, there's unions that want to wire me
""You think you know but really don't"" - put it in your ""Diary""

I'm quick to knock 'em out, they comin in three spurts
I do like Spielberg and see that yo' +DreamWorks+
My weed is all lavender, my drink is blue
My gat'll, +Poke-a-Man+, it's the Pikachu

Luda give 'em new perm, now they hair is wet
And they don't want to get on top, cause they scared of heights
So if you Wonderwoman BITCH I'm the Wondermack pro
So shut up and gimme that Thundercat HOOOO

[Chorus: x 2]
When you fuckin with Ryders, in the ""are"" we trust
If you make a false move then these things gon' bust
And when it comes to these bitches, you know how it goes
We don't trust these hooooes

[Fiend]
She said she won't, take it off unless there's money involved
I told why'all hold the stack and give hundred a call
I referred to when you pissy drunk, blunted and all
Tellin me she humpin harder than why'aaaall

Got got - three niggaz just diggin these balls
And all three really won't see why'all
Outside, in the burgandy Bird
Ruff Rydin puffin the herb, discussin the curb

She said she from B.K.
And I did it ""my way, all day"" like B.K., no more need say
So Fiend playa, you know I'm busy countin some cash
Then bouncin up on some ass

Better yet, think I'm on some extendable hash
You really want to fall in ya glass
She chose me, pimp nigga like we chose to be rich
Double-are then stole ya bitch

[Chorus]

[Yung Wun]
Hah, I say you better move now for a week in Montana
Then slick 'em without drinks for I drink in Colorado
This chick yesterday said she leavin tomorrow
I'm tryin to fuck her mouth tonight cause she leavin tomorrow

The only thing she act stupid's bout my lady at home
Lie to my lady at home, got my baby at home
Man, I was on some shit like 'Kiss, is we ""Fuckin' or What?""
If you don't want to get a room, we can fuck in the truck

We can cut to a bitch, but don't piss me off
You don't mean that to me shorty, I'll piss in your mouth
I'm a violent - boy, whylin boy

Real bouncy, hood shit, double are, shit, nigga
The best of the best street team
You know what it is or how it is

Motherfuckers want to act now
Keep toast by the waist now
Got a block full of crack now
Still got to hold the hood down

Little chickens want to run around dig dig down
Got a clip for the full pound
That will put your ass under the ground
With a thunderous sound

Send heat through your goose down
Then I'm blow cool day
All over your body
Ride or die with me today

And when I cook that shook that
Ran a roll back
In an all black
360 doing 160

Head like sticking move manually
She want to know what my stamina be
Told the chick real gangstas hard to please
Stash hard in the Honda seats

You got to know how the game will freeze
Especially when you pimp the heat
You got to pop that thing
Put an ass to sleep
Better cock that thing 'cause the walls will creep

Niggas think they hot ain't felt the heat

Three o'clock on the dot when I plan to plot
Ran up in the smoke spot wanna buy a lot
Hurry up, shit is hot
Can't fuck with me

Kill drama with M3's company for bumping me
All my niggas own real estate
My money can't estimate
On the roll you can't tell the time or the day, and date

Have your bitch in the back of the Escalade
We can make things escalate
Pull out, make his man run on him and he had a gun on him
Busted you then make the right

To cut through the gas station and take the light
Can't tell me Ruff Ryders don't make it tight
Got to wonder what a Harlem, niggas life is like
And I transport keys if the price is right

Then ride back through your hood on a mountain bike
Got bullets that will go through your stomach
Then come out your head
I'm Infrared, you ain't know, I'm about this bread

And I wonder what your family gonna do
When they pronounce you dead
Then come through your hood with Gucci rims on
In the six with the rims on
Getting head from a bad redbone, bitch
That don't mind switching like to fuck with her timbs on

You don't want to fuck with me

Pull out and pop your top

On my block there won't be no coping the bank
And depositing the shit, you get my drift?
Anything sold I want to get a bank roll
You motherfuckers don't want to see these things blow

Hanging like Neptunes, oh, no
When I pull the four-four
Look at the hole that you fell in
I got to spin around to keep the shells in
I ma blast to keep the smell in

Bet you know now, when I rap fast
I might as well slow down
I mean I love when I spin Porsche to hold my horse like
Whooa, now

How many niggas think they can ruff ryde

Watch where this bullet go, past niggas

Nowhere next to ready for this stainless
It's no helpin' you when them thangs melt in you
and way down in Athens, Jada's a bell ringer
I'ma bring the hood to the farm
Bless 'em with some purple hay
Remove the wood from the barn
Introduce them to the yak and cranberry

Took a minute to adjust, but right now this big shit is workin'
I'm white just by chance, but I'm country by God's graces
Nowadays I find myself doin' laundry in odd places
But still, I keep it Bubba even into Mr. Kiss and them
Brought 'em down to Athens, let 'em cut with my sister's friend
Now we gettin' blist again, back on the block in Yonkers
and Tim done laced a track, man this shit is hot as bonkers
Kiss, not to flaunt ya, but just tell 'em Bed has come here
I'm doin' for my family, but why'all are really done here
But Bubba is the truth and perhaps this is discussion
Of wither I'm that deal or a product of Tim's percussion
why'all know to him is bustin', so just dap me up and frown on
Me and Kiss is necessary, that much you can count on, yeah

How did him and Bubba rise from this dirt and this cow feces?
To show you folks the hope for this changin' shall be me

See I was rydin' ruff only when me and D became aquatinted

Keep my dick sucked like, straws in soda

Cause when I ride, I put a heart in them niggaz and get 'em live
Then let my toast, put the ghost in niggaz and watch it rise
Yeah I look out for my niggaz, but I'm not a town hero
When I walk, I set fire to the floor like ground zero
I'm the reason niggaz jumpin out of buildings, shit
They better let that hard ground kill 'em then they run down sizzlin
Got a hundred hidden guns in the wall where I live
So the only way I'm fightin for the wall is they comin to my crib

So if you a thug - throw these slugs!
And not at my vest, throw it at my mug
Cause my niggaz'll get why'all back, love is love
Cause we all family and nigga blood is blood
I never back down, I put backs on grounds
That'll make your mother pull out that all-black gown
Man fuck this track, listen to how I sound

Shortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down

Now I'm on the block like the strip is a marathon
The hood ain't been the same since Malcolm and King gone
Tales from the hood is what I sing on a rap song

Everybody petrified ever since 9/11
The hood was under attack before 9/11
Tell me how we got crack and automatic weapons?
My worst nightmare is Bush getting re-elected

The jails is packed, everybody stressed out
Gimme the key and I'm letting all the lifers out
So they could rebuild and work for a dollar bill
Take the shackles off ya mind, we running outta time

To all my hustlers pumping cracks behind the buildings
Ghetto children this is how we living
All my gangsta soldiers in the prison
Don't worry it's a totally new beginning

How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 

How many blacks gotta die by the hands of another 
Don't you understand that man's the same color so that man is your brother 
That's what happens when that man is from the gutter 
And that man is a hustler trying to survive, moving grams of that butter 
See, his momma was a dope fiend, poppa was a rolling stone 
He never knew what family was he grew up in a broken home 
Ever since twelve years old he was known as grown 
'cause ever since twelve years old he was on his own 
And even though it seemed like school was the best plan 
His only choice was distributing the rock like Def-jam 
While everybody else was getting diplomas 
He graduated from the middle of the strip to the corner 
But I don't knock him cause he tryin' to bubble 
There's no food on the table, the rents past due and that's why he hustles 
And I ain't sayin' that its right to be dealin'
All I'm sayin' is I feel him I guess 
I just see eye 2 eye wit his struggle you know 

How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets 
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way

Now baby girl's got a promising future 
But her moms passed away while she was younger and her father's a loser 
He'd always abused her but what else you expect from a coward 
He wasn't even proud when she got accepted to Howard 
And even though she loves college everyday it would stress her 
But it wasn't cause of exams or she hate her professor 
It was her financial situation here she couldn't pay a semester 
And the only means of making it better was totally reversing the role 
Lap dancing working that pole even though deep down its hurting her soul 
And even if it meant taking off her clothes 
She was down for what ever to help her accomplish her personal goals 
And I ain't trippin' off a-how shortie livin'
She gotta pay her tuition put food in the kitchen and that's why she strippin'
And I ain't sayin' I agree with her job but shit times is hard 
I guess I just see eye to eye with her vision you know 

How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets 
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 

Now see the moral of the story is this 
If you ain't tryin' to help stop our troubles then don't knock our hustle 
Cause really at the end of the day its not ya'll struggle 
But you always got something to say 
Well hear this fuck you 
Yeah that's right I'm talking to you come try to sleep in our beds 
Eat off our plates, take a walk in our shoes 
Look at the world from our view try to live by our rules 
Drink the same water we do, put your kids in our schools 
I guarantee you won't maintain your health you'll probably try to end it all 
And hang yourself or bang yourself 
You couldn't possibly understand all pain we felt 
And without folding your hands play the games we dealt 
I'm being real I ain't tryin' to be evil 
Look how we live, look how y'all live 
C'mon be serious how is we equal 
Matter fact I feel I'm wasting my time 
I'm finished writing this rhyme 
Y'all never gonna see eye to eye with my people you know

Ruffians,"There's a crystal view from my window
And I can see years to come
I live for the burn and the sting of pleasure
I live for the sword, the steel, and the gun
I can tear down the walls, storm them barricades
Run to the place where the frightened crawl
Desire lurks beyond good and evil
So dance on the graves where the hammer falls

[Chorus]
Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

You can touch, but please keep your distance
You're innocent and pure and with no shame
The spirit is willing, and the flesh is great
Your teasing your torment with the pleasure of pain

Heaven and Hell, I know them well
But I haven't yet made my choice
I'm feeling dead 'cause I'm shouting loud
And no one can hear my voice

Strung out high, above you all
Faithful wind blows through this land
Howls my name, Hell is my fall.

My stomach full of butterflies
The thought of you gone, it tears me apart

I remember you and me, when we used to laugh all night
Until we fell asleep
And I know we're through
But I've still got thoughts of you left inside my head

But you're still here in my head

Paving the golden road back home

Rufus,"I'll ask you once
Look in my eyes
Is it gonna work
Is my advice

Have a little trust in me
I love you
Baby, can't you see?
It's a lie and I don't care

Have a little faith
It's only fair
That you trust in me
I love you

And you'll always be here
A piece of my heart
My peace of mind
That's for sure

'till you close the door to giving
To giving
Don't call it quits
It would be a shame

Our little fits
Would be to blame
I'd give all of me
And my precious time

I'm not afraid to give
And what's mine is mine
I'll ask you once
Look in my eyes

Is it gonna work
Is my advice
Have a little trust in me
I love you

And you'll always be
A piece of my heart
My peace of mind
That's for sure

'till you close the door to giving",Close the Door

How can I thank you
You've warmed my heart and soul
You've made my body brown and smooth
Washed away the cold

You've made a dreamer out of me
I can see, and I think I can feel it when you
Change your face
Please forgive me if I turn away

I know that you watch my dreams
You're my heavenly keeper

Heavenly keeper

Just a sleeper
Heavenly keeper, oh ¨c

What a mystical woman that you made me
I've seen of times before the human race
As long as I'm breathing
As long as I can move
I'll be strong
Cause I know you've always been in the place
Please forgive me if I turn away
I'm just a sleeper
I know that you watch my dreams
You're my heavenly keeper

Here's to, to a long forgotten dream
Enshrouded by, by a history so clean
In a place still the same, so rich with time
I remain in my heart, my soul, my mind

So clear is the mystery to me
So majestic, yet electric, dose of age I see
There remains a sparkle in the sand
Can't restrain these feelings of my ancient land

Here is a melody for you
Sky of white and nylon blue
Let me hurry home to you
To sing, to dance, to laugh

Embrace
So vague is this picture I am seeing

Yet so clear, and so dear my soul is singin'
To belong is this feelin' I am missin'

To embrace this memory I been kissin'
So clear is this mystery to me
So majestic, yet electric, guest of age I see
There remains a sparkle in the sand

Can?t restrain these feelings of my ancient land

Rufus,"Take it from me, I've had the experience
Finding the right love ain't easy to do
I've been looking and looking and searching around since
Nature started teaching me just what to do

I can feel it bubbling up
All this love needs somewhere to live
Come and take a drink from my cup
I have a heart with so much to give

All the love is here so take it
Darlin' you know we can make it

I knew the minute I saw you
You were the one who'd be
Sharin' the love
I have the feeling inside me
You'll be beside me
Sharin' the love

I never believed in love at first sight
it's a foolish dreamer's fantasy
But one look at you showed me the light
And made a foolish dreamer of me

I can feel it bubbling up
All this love needs somewhere to live
Come and take a drink from my cup
I have a heart with so much to give

All the love is here so take it
It would be a sin to waste it

You were the one who'd be

You'll be beside me

Your lover's lovely eyes
And you're not sure of what you're seein'
And you're thinkin' all the time
Of the tings you should have said and done
And what it all could really mean
Remember that...

[Chorus:]
True love never looks back on heartache
True love never looks back on sorrow
True love only looks to tomorrow
True love never fades

When you're lookin' for some lies
To build a new disguise
So you can run away again
Usin' anger as a fuel
You go breakin' every rule in sight
Thinkin' that this might be the end
Remember that...

[Chorus:]

Is there really any wonder why you're feelin' this way
Livin' with a dream can cut just like a knife
Is there really any wonder why you're lonely today
When you're givin' up livin' up your live
Remember that...

Why do lies make my love stronger

Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy

The closer we get with every minute just tickin' away
Our love has come to see maturity
And from the very day we said hello
I washed out our love for all
One million kisses later
Our love is so much greater
One million kisses after
We share more love than laughter

we've been through a lot together ? you and I

So many tomorrows we have left behind

Worry won't lead to change
Cause I know something better to do
Won't you?

Try a little understanding baby
Try to understand me
Try a little understanding baby
Try to understand me

I admit that I am living in the past
'cause' I like it that way
But the happiness I know of giving
Equalize or I'd go insane

Now I know that I may have cause some sorrow
Will nothing cause I'm living that way
So before you reach any conclusions
Or judge me in a negative way
Won't you?

Try a little understanding baby
Try to understand me
Try a little understanding baby
Try to understand me

I know that this may sound crazy
Unconscience and it's insanity (?)
This is for the record
But you don't have to worry 'bout me

Try a little understanding baby
Try to understand me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Rufus Reid,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

I'll rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man.

Come up and take my hand.
As soon as I leave you go, you'll cry
""Oh yeah, he's a sixty-minute man!""

There'll be fifteen minutes of kissing,
And then you'll holler, ""Danny boy, please don't stop!""
There'll be fifteen minutes of teasing, fifteen minutes of pleasing,
Fifteen minutes of blowing my top (mop! mop! mop!)

Well, if your man ain't treating you right, 
Come up and see your Dan.
I'll rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man.

Rufus Wainwright,"Nothing so bright
Nothing so smooth
Nothing so pure
As my baby

All of my life
Days into night
All I did dream was my baby

Until the day
Darkness entwined
With silver eyes
Was my baby staring at me

And since then I can't see straight
And since then my smile's been fake
Funny I know, the troubles I've seen
But through one eye only that's clear

If you bring along your needles
Then I'll bring my sharpened pencils
And draw one more comic tragedy
My baby
So call up the child players
From madam we'll rent the parlor
And dance to death
Till I can't see
My baby",Baby
Rufus Wainwright,"California, California
You're such a wonder that I think I'll stay in bed
Big time rollers, part time models
So much to plunder
That I think I'll sleep instead

I don't know this sea of neon
Thousand surfers, whiffs of freon
And big nights back east with Rhoda
California please

There's a moment
I've been saving
A kind of crucifix around this munchkin land
Up north freezing, little me drooling
'That's Entertainment's' on at eight
Come on Ginger slam
I don't know this sea of neon
Thousand suffers, whiffs of freon
And my new grandma Bea Arthur
Come on over

Ain't it a shame that at the top
Peanut butter and jam they served you
Ain't it a shame that at the top
Still those soft skin boys can bruise you
Yes I fell for a streaker

I don't know this sea of neon
Thousand surfers, whiffs of freon

That all the world can't enjoy your mad traditions
Ain't it a shame that all the world

Rufus Wainwright,"Cigarettes and chocolate milk
These are just a couple of my cravings
Everything it seems I like's a little bit stronger
A little bit thicker, a little bit harmful for me

If I should buy jellybeans
Have to eat them all in just one sitting
Everything it seems I like's a little bit sweeter
A little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me

And then there's those other things
Which for several reasons we won't mention
Everything about 'em is a little bit stranger
A little bit harder, a little bit deadly

It isn't very smart
Tends to make one part
So brokenhearted

Sitting here remembering me
Always been a shoe made for the city
Go ahead accuse me of just singing about places
With scrappy boys faces, have general run of the town

Playing with prodigal sons
Takes a lot of sentimental valiums
Can't expect the world to be your Raggedy Andy
While running on empty, you little old doll with a frown

You got to keep in the game
Retaining mystique while facing forward
I suggest a reading of a lesson in tightropes
Or surfing your high hopes or adios Kansas

It isn't very smart
Tends to make one part
So brokenhearted

Still there's not a show on my back
Holes or a friendly intervention
I'm just a little bit heiress, a little bit Irish, a little bit

Rufus Wainwright,"I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street

Those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Ah, but you got away, didn't you babe
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say

I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception

And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself and said, ""Well, never mind
We are ugly but we have the music""

And then you got away, yeah, didn't you babe
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say

I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin

Played aces, lost cases, my place is fine let the bulls run
There's one, little Lord Bosie cut from the daisy chain
Plain to see little Lord Bosie and to suppose he's heading for Hades
I know the way, birds and the bees
No need to say please, because I'm in with the ladies

First, must get Mustang, just dust won't go bang with the grand dame, dang!
I've a Mustang, aw shucks!, now you're in with the old gang

No need to say please, because I'm in with the ladies
Please! Now, in with the ladies!

Now that you're in with the ladies, nothing that you can't do
My, how you're in with the ladies, drinking from that one shoe
Man, how your Tancho pomade is bewitching the whole swooning crew
And how the macho brigade is now bitching and wanting some too

Get me new faces, new faces, I'm tired of the old ones
There's one, little Lord Bosie cut from the daisy chain
Plain to see little Lord Bosie is hanging up poses and packing in posies

Rufus Wainwright,"Woke up this morning a 11:11
Wasn't in Portland and I wasn't in heaven
Could have been either by the way I was feeling
But I was alive, I was alive
Woke up this morning at 11:11
John was half-naked and Lulu was crying
Over a baby that will never go crazy
But I was alive
And kicking through this cruel world
Holding a notion of you at 11:11
Tell me what else can I do
What else can I do?
Woke up this morning and something was burning
Realized that everything really does
Happen in Manhattan
Thoughts were of characters and afternoons lying
And you, you were alive
Oh the hours we are separate
11:11 is just precious time we've wasted
So patch up you bleeding hearts
And put away your posies
I'm gonna have a drink
Before we ring around the rosies with you",11:11
Rufus Wainwright,"You've got my lost brother's soul
My dear mother's eyes
A brown horse's mane
And my uncle's name
You walked me down 14th Street
For the doctor to meet after thoughts of the grave
In the home of the brave and of the weak

But why'd you have to break all my heart
Couldn't you have saved a little bit of it?
Why'd you have to break all my heart?
Couldn't you have saved a minor part?

I could have clipped and saved and planted in the garden
Damn you guess I'll have to get a new one

I'd love to sit and watch you drink
With the reins to the world, gripping a smoke
Vaguely missing link
Don't ever change you hungry little bashful hound
I got the sheep, poor little Bo Peep
Has lost and filed for grounds.

But why'd you have to break all my heart
I could have ripped apart and thrown into the river
Wonder if there's hearts that will deliver

Don't ever change, don't ever worry
Because I'm coming back home tomorrow
To 14th Street where I won't hurry
And where I'll learn how to save, not just borrow
And they'll be rainbows and we will finally know",14th Street

And there's no reason for my mind to be still

Such a beautiful child again

When I have finally found my room filled with toys
Be banging on my crib excited by noise

Oh, how I'll feel like a beautiful child
Such a beautiful child again

And when there's nothing to gain
Or bring me pain or pin the blame

I'm going to take you down with one little stone
I'm going to break you down and see what you're worth
What you're really worth to me

Dinner at eight was o.k. before the toasts full of gleams
It was great until those old magazines
Got us started up again
Actually it was probably me again
But why is it so
That I've always been the one who must go
That I've always been the one told to flee
When in fact you were the one
Long ago, actually in the drifting white snow
Who left me?

So put up your fists and I'll put up mine
No running away from the scene of the crime
God's chosen a place
Somewhere near the end of the world
Somewhere near the end of our lives
But till then no daddy don't be surprised
If I want to see the tears in your eyes
Then I know it had to be
Long ago, actually in the drifting white snow
You loved me",Dinner at Eight
Rufus Wainwright,"Thank you for the bitter knowledge
Guardian angels who left me stranded
It was worth it, feeling abandoned
Makes one hardened but what has happened to love

You got me writing lyrics on postcards
Then in the evening looking at the stars
But the brightest of the planets is Mars

Then what has happened to love
So I will opt for the big white limo
Vanity fairgrounds and rebel angels
You can't be trusted with feathers so hollow
Your heaven's inventions, steel eyed vampires of love

You see over me, I'll never know
What you have shown to other eyes
Go or go ahead and surprise me
Say you've lead the way to a mirage

Go or go ahead and just try me
Nowhere's now here smelling of junipers
Fell off the hay bales, I'm over the rainbows

But oh Medusa kiss me and crucify
This unholy notion of the mythic power of love
Look in her eyes, look in her eyes

Forget about the ones that are crying
Look in her eyes, look in her eyes
Forget about the ones that are crying

Still I find it hard to get an answer
From the harvester of hearts
Always find it hard to get an answer
From the harvester of hearts
If a person should ever like a person

How funny that would be
If a person should ever like me
Not that I have that much to offer
God knows I have so much to gain
From the harvester of hearts
From the harvester of pain

If a person should ever like a person
Then a person should be free

But you got to do it
I don't know where to go
But you got to be there
I don't know where to fall
But I know that it's comfortable where
I don't know where it is
Putting all of my time in learning to care
And a bucket of rhymes I threw up somewhere

Want a locket of who made me lose
My perfunctory view of all that is around
And of all that I do
So I knock on the door, take a step that is new

Never been here before
Is there anyone else who's too
In love with beauty
Playing all of the games
And thinks three's company

Is there anyone else who has slightly mysterious bruises
I don't know what it is
Sick of looking around at friendly faces

All declaring a war on far off places
Is there anyone else who is through
With complaining about what's been done unto us

So I knock on the door
And I am on a train
Going god knows where to
To get me over, to get me over

Get me heaven or hell, Calais or Dover
I was hoping the train was my big number
Taking the Santa Fe and the Atchison Topeka
But we're chugging along, Dunaway by the crossing

And could be heading for Poland or limbo or Lower Manhattan
Find myself running around
I don't know what it is
To get me over",I Don't Know What It Is

Put that old dog down, stop me making movies of myself
Bring the carriage 'round, get me to the garden of sleep
Make that high gate speak, Perrier out of a paper bag

Looking like a hag
And start giving me something
A love that is longer than a day
Start making my heart sing something that it doesn't want to say

I'm handing it over, I'm saying that you're the only one
Don't run for the border, turn that corner
Already you've run in movies of myself
Darling don't you ever let me go
Wrap your loving arms around me
While the cold winds blow

Tell me what I really want to know
â??Cause I'm looking for a reason, a person, a painting
A Saturday Evening Post Edition by Jesus
An old piece of bacon never eaten by Elvis

So I'll say start giving me something
A love that is longer than a day
Start making my heart say something it doesn't want to say

In the shadow of love
Under the trees of happiness

But do you really know how scary
This is for you and is for me?
Oh do you really know?
Do you really know?

Oh Natasha, all I can do
Is write a song for you
Natasha, oh Natasha for you

I sit alone on the cozy ground floor
On a bench by the garden waiting also
Waiting for love

A kind of crucifix around this munchkin land
Up north freezing, little me drooling
That's Entertainment's on at eight
Come on Ginger slam
I don't know this sea of neon
Thousand sufers, whiffs of freon
And my new grandma Bea Arthur
Come on over

Ain't it a shame
That all the world can't enjoy your mad traditions
Ain't it a shame that all the world
don't got keys to their own ignitions 
Life is the longest death in California

So much to plunder that I think I'll sleep instead

Rufus Wainwright,"Maybe in you I'll believe
Maybe I'll believe in you
The future of my understanding of love
Many a time I've before
Before I've many a time
Knocked a stranger's door
Discretion hardly I'm known for
Probably has nothing to, nothing at all in the world to do with you
Just your lower lip on the floor

But baby I gotta get through
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Maybe in you I'll believe 
Maybe I'll believe in you

Suddenly I'm not myself
Behind the facade is a lonely fountain, here
Suddenly you are the one
Who opens the gates to this unruly garden
Come and let this man go, you

'Cause baby I got to get through
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Maybe in you I'll believe
Maybe I'll believe in you

Suddenly you're not yourself
Behind the facade is a lonely angel, still
Suddenly I am the one who opens the gates to this now gloomy garden

Dinner at eight was okay
Before the toast full of gleams
It was great until those old magazines
Got us started up again
Actually it was probably me again

Why is it so
That I've always been the one who must go
That I've always been the one told to flee
When it fact you were the one long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You left me

So put up your fists and I'll put up mine
No running away from the scene of the crime
God's chosen a place
Somewhere near the end of the world
Somewhere near the end of our lives

But 'til then no, Daddy, don't be surprised
If I wanna see the tears in your eyes
Then I know it had to be long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You loved me

No matter how strong
I'm gonna take you down
With one little stone
I'm gonna break you down
And see what you're worth
What you're really worth to me",Dinner at Eight [DVD][Live]

From 1970's porn

Rufus Wainwright,"I've heard there was
A secret chord
That David played, and
It pleased the Lord

For music, do you?
It goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king
Composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong
But you needed proof
You saw her bathing
On the roof
Her beauty and the
Moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne
And she cut your hair
And from your lips
She drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe I've been here before
I know this room
I've walked this floor
I used to live alone
Before I knew you
I've seen your flag
On the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and
It's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time
You let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show
It to me, do you?
I remember when
I moved in, you
Your holy dark
Was moving too
And every breath we drew
Was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever
Learned from love
Was how to shoot
At someone
Who outdrew you

It's not somebody
Who's seen the light

So I'm tearing up these tarot cards and Venetians clowns

On Ontario Street looking up
Maybe I'll catch him on his way to the show

Everything operates on the unattainable's
And then you hear your mother laugh attached to the phone

Ever ever ever fly away?

Ever ever ever find a way?",Hometown Waltz

Feet that hardly reach the pedal
Sewn to a tremendous shadow

Ave, ave, history is on my side
So complain have no shame
And remember that your brother is a boy

Though it seems the stakes contain some integrity
We all feel it still is based on good old intrigue
Just for a while, just for a while, just for a while
You may have to use your hips as fodder
Still putting your best foot forward
Madame didn't stack the cupboard ended up like Mother Hubbard
Ave, but hey, history is still a game
So complain have no shame and remember that round one has just been played

And you are poised for centuries to claim

Turn back the wheels of time

Or being held in the month of May

There I will be, will be until you come and get me

Cause I'm so tired of waiting in restaurants
Reading the critics and comics alone
With a waiter with a face made for currency

Yesterday I heard they cloned a baby
Now can I finally sleep with me?

But in turning back the brackish waters will not reflect you

And everybody's packing up their station wagons
There's a number you can call, like a breast that you can suckle
And we quietly will exit as it all is happening

Again, I'm afraid of one thing
Will I walk away from love knowing nothing, wearing my heart between my legs?
But when I know you're naked, lying on the bed while I'm at the piano

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town
Had me low, had me down

Rufus Wainwright,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Medley: Almost Like Being in Love/This Can't Be Love
Rufus Wainwright,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over that rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star,
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Birds fly over that rainbow
Why, oh why, can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why, can't I?",Over the Rainbow

Why don't you go where fashion sits?

And swing it from Virginia to Tennessee

You'll let nobody wait outside your door
San Francisco, here comes your wandering one
Saying, ""I'll wander no more""

Other places only make me love you best
Say that you're the one in all the Golden West

Right when I arrive, I really come alive
And you will laugh to see me perpendicular, hanging on a cable car

Let me beat my feet up and down Market Street
I'm gonna climb Nob Hill, just to watch it get dark from the top of the mark

There's Brooklyn Bridge, London Bridge and the Bridge of San Luis Rey
But the only bridge that's a real 'gone bridge, is the bridge across the bay

Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time... The time...
So weary all the time

The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away

Rufus Wainwright,"A clown with his pants falling down
Or the dance that's a dream of romance
Or the scene where the villain is mean
That's entertainment

The lights on the lady in tights
Or the bride with the guy on the side
Or the ball where she gives it her all
That's entertainment

The plot could be hot, simply teeming with sex
A gay divorce who is after her ex
It could be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his father and causes lots of bother

The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for a loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt
The world is a stage, the stage is a world of entertainment

It might be a scene like you see on the screen
A swain being slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene
Where a ghost and a prince meet, and everything ends in mincemeat

The guy could be waving the flag
That began with the mystical hand
Hip hooray, the American way
The world is a stage, the stage is a world of entertainment",That's Entertainment
Rufus Wainwright,"When you're smiling, when you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughing, when you're laughing
The sun comes shining through

But when you're crying, you bring on the rain
So stop that sighing, be happy again
When you're smiling, keep on smiling
The whole world smiles with you

If you suddenly find out you've been deceived, don't get peeved
If your husband bluntly tells you you're too stout, don't you pout
And for Heaven's sakes, retain a calm demeanor
If a cop walks up and hands you a subpoena
If the groom should take a powder while you're marching down the aisle
Don't weep and moan because he's blown, just face the world and smile

'Cause when you're crying, don't you know, that your make-up starts to run?
And your eyes get red and scrappy
Forget your troubles, have yourself a little fun
Have a ball, forget it all

Rufus Wainwright,"You go to my head, and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head, like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea,
Casts a spell over me
And I say to myself, ""get ahold of yourself!""
Can't you see that this never will be?

You go to my head, (and I forgot the god-darn words)
[incomprehensible lyrics, scat singing]
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head, you go to my head

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea,
Casts a spell over me
And I say to myself, ""get ahold of yourself!""
Can't you see that it never can be?

Like a summer with a thousand Julys

Nearer than the wind is to the willow

For I love you so",You're Nearer
Rufus Wainwright,"Dear, when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start

All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony

What else could I do again?
But keep repeating through and through

I still recall the thrill, I guess I always will
I hope we'll never depart

Somewhere over that rainbow, skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me

Who for thy self art so unprovident.
Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many
But that thou none lov'st is most evident
For thou art so possessed with murderous hate
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O! change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove
Make thee another self for love of me

Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
A man in hue all hues in his controlling
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth
And for a woman wert thou first created
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting
And by addition me of thee defeated
By adding one thing to my purpose, nothing
But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure

How would thy shadow's form, form happy show
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so

How would, I say mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay

All days are nights to see till I see thee
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me",Sonnet 43

Rufus Wainwright,"One day you will come to Montauk
And you will see your dad wearing a kimono
And see your other dad pruning roses
Hope you won’t turn around and go
One day you will come to Montauk
And see your dad playing the piano
And see your other dad wearing glasses
Hope that you will want to stay
For a while
Don’t worry, I know you'll have to go

One day you will come to Montauk
And see your dad trying to be funny
And see your other dad seeing through me
Hope that you will protect your dad

One day you will come to Montauk
And see your dad trying to be evil
And see your other dad feeling lonely
Hope that you will protect him

You have stayed
Don’t worry, I know you have to go

One day years ago in Montauk
Lived a woman, now a shadow
But she does wait for us in the ocean
And although you want to stay
For a while
Don’t worry, we all have to go

One day you will come to Montauk",Montauk

Rufus Wainwright,"After another production of “The Flying Dutchman”
I landed in Berlin
Thinking over it over it how can I get over it
And wonder what state I’m in
Sissi was the anarchist empress of Austria
And I was in the same state that she was in
Thinking over it over it how can I get over it
And where the hell’s that fan

After another induction to the hall of famine
I closed the magazine
Thinking over and over it how can I get over it
And be German and mean
Jenny was a pirate and Jane was beheaded and Nina was a sweet nymphomaniac
And with them in my corner I’m sure that it’s a tall order
To find that perfect man

I’m doing all that I can
Trying to make all the roses bloom in unison
Say I’m gonna blow you away
Making all of the roses bloom so step away
Making all of the roses bloom

After another unveiling of the bright red herring
I walked down Rufus Street
Thinking over it over it how can I get over it
And where in the world will I meet
That literary, lean, stripe suited lover
I’ve read about all of my life
Which I fear is a ruse and explains
All the walks through all the parks of Europe
And why I never will tell you “I love you”
And why there is just but
A vision of perfect man

I’m doing all that I can
Making all of the roses bloom in unison
Say I’m gonna blow you away
Making all of the roses bloom so step away
And be dazzled
Making all of the roses bloom",Perfect Man

And I’d like to thank you Rashida
It’s been a while since I have gone a begging

On the somewhat safe street
And have a beer
We’ve both kept our eyes on the ball
We know the lyrics to them all
These songs of fear

And baby I love you
And I do not want to lose you
But I’m not able to put my cards on the table
And if you only knew of the hand that I’m holding
You would be blushing
And I am so far from bluffing
In this respectable dive

I know that we never play cards or write postcards
When we’re both in the same town
But still I remember some notes on the kitchen counter
Back from work I’ve found

And baby I love you
And I do not want to lose you

Sometimes you need to go to the observatory
Sometimes a movie star's eye

Sometimes you need a stranger to walk with
Sometimes you need to go to the dark park
Sometimes a movie star's spark
Gets you through the dark

Sometimes a movie star's bar
Paints your heart the pitch of the love
I'm so tired of running out of cities
Guess that you too, guess which one this is

I will never come undone
I will never know the way it feels to be just anyone
I will never fall just as you all fall around me so
I will never know

Nor will I have to be the one who’s walking out the door
When the hour has struck you will receive
A note addressed from me
I will never be
Be the one you see

Don’t worry all about nothing at all
I don’t know how you made it in
But since you have arrived
Let it begin

'Cause something in your eyes has made this room a much more brighter place
The chandeliers and fireplaces all seem jealous of your face
Something in your smile has left a light that has left a trace
Come and take my hand and let you lead me to the promise land
That no one could have ever been promised
I don’t know if you feel it and I don’t really care
'Cause long ago when I was young and innocent they brought me here
Far from my mothers home
I was all alone

We didn't need much back then, just a smile
And daddy would sing
And buy us ice cream

And I'd stand behind
And imitate him
And she would laugh

I wouldn't rush the growing old
I'd take the flu, the measles, and the blues
And I guess I'd do as I was told

Kathy would walk up ahead, and I'd follow
She seemed so big back then, and me so small
And mommy would give
Me one dime, and her two nickels
And I would cry
'cause she got more

And if I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't rush the growing old
I'd take the flu, the measles, and the blues

The ayatollah's dead, but he made really great coffee
With my rifle in my arms I feel really swell
I wanna join the army and kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill

May your uncle rest well in his cell tonight
I never liked him much but he took me down to Tijuana
We drank tequila
And watched your mom dance
At the bambi club

But I was bored
So I prayed to the lord
Ha, give me a war
'Cause I'm so bored
And I want more

I called you twenty-seven times from blythe
While I was out on the road
Your stupid sister always picks up the phone
And says that you're not at home
I drink ensure to try and make me look healthy
But I feel like a lightweight
I try to talk real cool, try to act proud
But I still can't get a date

You're so busy

And now I'm feeling real foolish
The ghosts of all my loves are coming back to haunt me
Now it feels really ghoulish
I read the art of war to try to get a battle plan
But I didn't get it
I watch the talk shows and I listen to my therapist
But I still feel like shit

Then you couldn't ignore me
Or take a swan dive from twenty-seven stories
Could finally set me free
You give me one touch then you cast me aside

Under October skies

Eso es lo que siento yo

Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

No lo ha podido el saber

Ni el más ancho pensamiento

De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros

Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

Se abrió como por encanto

Harry Allen on you bitch, I believe no hype
Closer to the edge than even we want to admit
If this don't go right
Then assholes like myself are proven so right
All I got is this rap shit
All I want is a castle
And to move like a man with a minimum of harassment
The company of women with opinions and fat asses
That's my list of demands
You don't answer them, get the Gatling

I'm stuck in a time capsule
When rap was actually factual
Meanest shit you spit might cause killers to come and clap at you
Stupid, goofy, stooly
The gooch in Gucci will slap you
And that go for the cop kissing cats that's in the back of you
They all sweet as Little Richard damn
Good God Molly
It make a nigga like me go ""Woo!"" and rob the party
I exit stepping with my weapon with the Jefferson walk
If you expressing any objections you can get left in chalk
So my suggestion's let a G be
Forgive my transgressions
Or I'mma be in Catholic confessions professing depression

We're here to tell you all your false idols are just pretenders
They're corporation slaves indentured to all the lenders
So even if you got seven figures, you still a nigga

Some men aren't meant for the light to be shined on their shitty talking
Y'all better off trying to hide like the yay in a little pocket

Dolphins prone to rape, will hear the tape and start to think about it
Monks won't immolate themselves until the record hits the shelves
Yetis walk right out the woods to cop it without thinkin' 'bout it
Workers at the sweatshop kill they boss to how the vets drop
Worker ants surround their queen and chew the bitch's head off
Drug dogs bark at the tour bus when it park
Priests take the cock out of their mouths to hum along when the chorus drop
At the least we are the most beef and broc on your fuckin' block
The bass make a whale off of the coast scream ""Ya'll gotta stop!""

Fell to the earth, lost each other, died and we came back sister and brother

I’m Shaka Zulu, Mansa Musa, my money buku
My beats is bangin’, fuck what you rappin’, who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got and Run The Jewels you

A little prickly, dick on display for Winter swimming
Look at these kitties, Mike, I'mma rat-a-tat 'em for living
I deal in dirty work, do the deed and then dash, ditch 'em
I'd lend a hand but they stuck in a fist and gun position
We run our brand where destruction's the number one commitment
It’s all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear in the smoke like we're fuckin' magicians

No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the morning, my fist to your face is fucking Folgers
We might be giants, standing on little dandy shoulders
You punks is pussy proverbial pansy panty holders
I Jake the Snake ‘em, DDT ‘em in mausoleums
Macabre massacres killing cunts in my colosseum
They all actors, giving top in back of a BM
I’d fall back if the casting calls are ending in semen

I'm the foulest, no need for any evaluations
I'm a phallus for Johnson and Jimmy spraying faces
Any cow that is sacred will get deface'd
Like any tyrant murderer gets replaced, face it
The fellows at the top are likely rapists
But you like ""Mellow out man, just relax, it's really not that complicated""
Well pardon me, I guess I'm just as sane as you explain'ed
Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is derange'd

This Run The Jewels is, murder, mayhem, melodic music
Psychotics use it then lose it, junkies simply abuse it
That's word to Phillip Seymour Hoffman, I'm pushin coffin
I probably smell like a pound when they put me in a coffin
The gates of hell are pugnaciously pacin', waitin'

Or take over a jail, give those COs hell

I listened, tatted a sentence on my dick last summer

I'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey
The cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin'

A dirty boy who come down on a side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison

My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Go mane and missin' my misses, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is givin' vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious

Like every day I’m in a fight for my soul
Could it be that my medicine’s the evidence
For pigs to stop and frisk me when they rollin' round on patrol?
And ask “why you’re here?” I just tell 'em cause it is what it is
I live here and that’s what it is
He chimed “you got a dime?
I said “Man, I’m tryin' to smoke and chill
Please don’t lock me up in front of my kids
And in front of my wife, man, I ain't got a gun or a knife
You do this and you ruin my life
And I apologize if it seems like I got out of line, sir
'Cause I respect the badge and the gun
And I pray today ain't the day that you drag me away
Right in front of my beautiful son”
And he still put my hands in cuffs, put me in the truck
When my woman screamed, said “shut up”
Witness with the camera phone on
Saw the copper pull a gun and put it on my gorgeous queen
As I peered out the window
I could see my other kinfolk and hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
'Cause he had her face down on the ground
And I’d be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

You want cash or hope, no clash, matter fact get both
Go without get turnt to ghosts
You know that's the law, deal done by the shake of claws
It ain't a game if the shit don’t pause
And I find you odd, so convinced in the truth of y’all
That the true truth’s truly gone
And yes there's a they, any time a man say there's not
Then you know that he lost the plot, what can I say?
Truth’s truth when denied or not, like its true crews ride the cock
Fair enough, the way that the beat bump do sound tough
I made it in the dark like Civil War surgery
Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o’clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording
But didn't record cop when he shot, no warning
Heard it go pop, might have been two blocks
Heard a kid plus pops watched, cop make girl bleed

Coming live at five, we got new news breaking
You heard here first if you don't die waiting
Hard to review the scene I just seen
I'ma try to convey, but it defies explaining
Started with folks just crying
Nothing but broken hearts, sobs, and the shriek of the sirens
Right at the spot where the blood's still drying
(My God) I saw it, the dead began rising
I don't know much about science
But I seen an army of armed men stop and get quiet
Mist hung low like a prayer from a tyrant
Sky became black like the stars aren't aligning
So many years of this violence
Now we're surrounded by the souls of the dead and defiant
Saying, ""Look what you've done, you designed it""
When the bough breaks, hear the wraith scream, ""Riot!""

No more moms and dads crying
No more arms in the air
We put firearms in the air
Molotov cocktails thrown in the air
Cnn got dummy Don on the air
Talking 'bout he smell that ganj in the air
Dummy don't know and dummy don't care
Get that punk motherfucker outta here
Aye, ghosts are walking
Ghosts are talking
Everything gon' be different, mane
Shh, karma's coming
Ain't no runnin'
Death gon' deal with the guilty, mane
The universe curses the killers, mane
Can't keep killin' God's children, mane
A pound of flesh is what you owe
Your debt is due, give up your ghost

I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air
Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be 
Condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots
But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard
Thieves!",Theives! (Screamed the Ghost)
Run the Jewels,"Right for a right, wrong for a wrong
This is clearly not life's design
Figure out quickly that nothing gets answered
When you ask the universe why
Life is a journey, to live is to worry
To love is to lose your damn mind
But living's a blessing so I am not stressing
'Cause some of my friends ain't survived
That's the release, but in much bigger pieces, I'm living on limited time
Like how do you look in the eyes of a friend and not cry when you know that they're dying?
How do you feel 'bout yourself when you know that sometimes you had wished they were gone?
Not because you didn't love 'em but just because you felt too weak to be strong
You couldn't bear to see someone who prided themselves on the strength to feel weak
The cruelty of randomness, hold it for ransom, that life will not fade in your dreams
You see that they're fighting and know that they're losing but still you make jokes and you laugh
'Cause you know despite all the sadness that you better get the good times while they last
Now every new word that they speak you are already feeling like it’s in the past
And when they all gone you just try to move on 'cause the memory's hurting too bad
Grown up so much and I wonder who you'd've become if you stuck for a while
Just know that I love you, good friend, ain't forget you, and when I remember I smile

And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon
But the truth is that I see you now
Still talk to you like you're around
And I guess I say you left too soon
But the truth is that you never left
'Cause I never let myself forget

An eye for an eye, and a tooth for the tooth
Will leave us all mumbling and blind
So we stumble blind through depths of the dark
Looking for something divine
Life is a journey, to live is to suffer
And I have been suffering through mine
But living's a blessing so I ain't no stressing
'Cause some of my niggas ain't 'round
And he got no drama but his baby mama is still on my line and she cryin'
I searched for the words to give her some comfort for her soul and spirit and mind
I tell her that it'll be fine
But deep down I know that I'm lying
The family came took rings and his chains
The bank took the house and the rights
The only thing left was his child, and she had a smile in his eyes
So much to the soul, when the grandmama kept her, she'd look at her sometime and cry
The very next day she cried
And day after day she cried
Then called baby mama and told her ""I'm sorry, can't keep her no more, I have tried""
No killer was captured, but I know he listening
So I'd like to tell you in song
The streets was a jungle, I pray that you made it, I hope that you righted your wrongs
I hope that you learn, I hope that you changed so your mama won't know this pain
So my homie's name will mean something more than a nigga got killed for a chain

And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon
But the truth is that I see you now
Still talk to you like you're around
And I guess I say you left too soon
But the truth is that you never left
'Cause I never let myself forget",Thursday in the Danger Room

Run-D.M.C.,"Two years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some emcee rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say,
The rhyme was Def and it went this way

Took a test to become an emcee
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac,
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

Dave cut the record down to the bone,
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
And then we're talking autographs, years of laughs,
Champagne, caviar, and bubble baths

You see, that's the life that I lead, and
You sucker MC, this is who I be
So take that and move back, catch a heart attack
Because there's nothing in the world, that Run will ever lack

I cold chill at a party in a be	-boy's stance,
And rock on the mike and make the girls want to dance
Fly like a dove, they come from up above,
I'm rockin on the mike and you can call me Run Love.

I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see me cruisin' girls just move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride

It's on a, ah first come, first serve basis
Coolin out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight
And for you sucker emcee, you just ain't right

Because you're bitin all your life, you're cheatin on your wife
You're walkin round town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin on the ave, chillin' with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through

Ah with the one two three, three to two one
My man Larry Larr, my name DJ Run
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass
I'm rockin to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face

Go Uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker emcee's, you sad face clown
You're a five-dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man
You're a sucker emcee, and you're my fan

You try to bite rhymes, all lines are mine
You're a sucker emcee in a pair of Calvin Kleins
Comin' from the wackest part of town,
Tryin to rap but you can't get down

You don't even know your English, your verbs or noun
You're just a sucker emcee you sad-faced clown
So DMC if you're ready, the people rockin' steady
You're drivin big cars, get your gas from Getty

I'm DMC in the place to be, I go to St. John's University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge,
And after 12th grade I went straight to college
I'm light skinned, I live in Queens

And I love eatin chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill, I love to style
I'm the emcee you know who's versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards

Got my name not numbers on my credit cards
I go Uptown, I come back home
With who? me myself and my microphone
All my rhymes are street delight

So here's another one for why'all to bite
When I rhyme I never quit,
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it
'Cause it takes a lot to entertain,

And sucker emcee's can be a pain
You can't rock a party with a hip and a hop
You gotta let em know you'll never stop

And I'm never drinkin' beer, it's champagne at the tap
And I'm cold makin' money on a regular basis
Pullin' out, knockin' sucker MC faces
Travel round the world with my mind at ease
No Calvin Klein, just wearin' Lee's
Got credit in countries I've never been
Cause the records I write are in the top ten
The top of the chart, is where I stay
But I also chill, around the way
In Hollis, Queeens, is where I stop
On the streets with the beats is where I walk

When I perform, many hearts I warm
I'm better known, as the Quiet Storm
I don't talk too much but I got beef
When I kill MC's, I cause grief
Devastating mic control is my main goal
My name is Darryl, and his name is (Joe)
The Master of music his name is Jay
Leave us alone, and let us play
We give it up, and turn it loose
We're not like Dr. Seuss or Mother Goose
Sucker MC's like punks who are picking flowers
Go for yours, we went for ours!

Start at three, end at six
Jam Master Jay is on the mix
For all the young ladies
And all the chicks
We got all of the girls
on our tips
Don't buy gold lighters
Only Bic's
Rock all microphones
Just for kicks

Sucker MC's I will be snuffin'
In my pocket I'll keep on stuffin'
When I say I'll beat em up I won't be bluffin'
They can't beef cause that ain't nothin'
But it don't matter, my pocket gets fatter
I got more hats than the Mad Hatter

Well I'm the rapper with the mic, drive a Caddy not a bike
Drop a rhyme in your face, and you'll damn sure like
He's an MC with the rhyme know the day and the time
Never ever goin' low, cause he only climb
(And Jay's the DJ with the) cut (move your arm) and your butt
So D take the mic, huh hah

Say what?  I will not stop, I will not quit
Because some at the top but I'm on the tip
That's as high on the top as you can get
And you best believe, I'll be on it
So before you decide, to try me out
I'm gonna let you all know what I'm all about
I'm a fresh MC, who's on his way
To be an MC with the most to say
And to all those out there, that don't know me
I go by the name of D. M. C.
In the place to be, I will MC
The Master of the Ceremony cause it's easy to D
Control of the mic, is so devastating
That all other rappers you will soon be hating
No matter what race, creed or color

The golden key, to prosperity
Never have a grip on reality

Trumpin' your fate, never peepin' the card

Of self-destruction, total corruption
You better get out or die from consumption
Sweat for a dollar, to get nothin' back
Cause at the end of the week, you still get taxed
You'd even sell your soul to make your life correct
But with the rate of inflation you should eat your check
So you try to make a hustle, to get ahead
But the only thing you manage is to stay in the red
Coppin' from John, to sell to Rex

But if you only knew the crew called you freak's delight

Wearin' the tightest jeans, and shortest skirt

Run-D.M.C.,"Now Peter Piper picked peppers, but Run rapped rhymes
Humpty Dumpty fell down, that's his hard time
Jack B. Nimble, what, nimble, and he was quick
But Jam Master was faster, Jack saw Jay's dick
Now little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice stilled her hunger in Wonderland
Jack Jill busta in his hand
And Jam Master Jay is making out our sound
The turntables might wobble but they don't fall down

I got the juice and Mother Goose both did that thing
Jam Master's gettin' loose and DMC's the king
Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator
Jam Master Jay, king of the crossfader
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest
Perfect timin' when I'm climbin', I'm a rhymin' apparatus
When he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts
And on the mix, real quick, and I'd like to say
He's not fat, but he's fast and his name is Jay

It goes a one, two, three and

Jay's like King Midas, as I was told
Everything that he touched, turned to gold
He's the greatest of the great, get it straight he's great
Playing fame cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay to see him play will make you say
""Goddamn, that DJ made my day!""
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were his, he would be you
I'm not lying, y'all, he's the best I know
And if I lie, my nose will grow
Like the little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story goes!

Tricks are for kids he plays much gigs
He's the big bad wolf and you're the three pigs
He's the big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good!

There it is

We're Run-DMC, got a beat to settle
D's not Hansel, he's not Gretel
Jay's a winner, not a beginner
His pocket gets fat, other get thinner
Jump on Jay like cows on moons
People take Jay like dish and spoon
Hands like all, first hails aim
You'll see Jay again my friend!
Huh!",Peter Piper
Run-D.M.C.,"You know I'm proud to be black y'all

I take it back y'all - it's like that

Licki-licki-licki-licki-licki-licki-licki-licki-
Listen party people here's a serious song
It's right not wrong, I should say right on
I gotta tell you somethin' that you all should know
It's not a mystery it's history and here's how it go
Now Hariett Tubman, was born a slave
She was a tiny black woman, when she was raised
She was livin' to be givin' there's a lot that she gave
There's not a slave, in this day and age
I'm proud to be

Black, god damn, I'm tired my man
Don't worry bout what color I am
Because I'll show you how ill, this man can act
It could never be fiction cause it is all fact
And if you get in my way, I will not turn back
I'm proud of my name, my name is Darryl Mack
I'm black and I'm proud, and I'll say it out loud
I'll share my story with the whole crowd, augghh!

You know I'm proud to be black y'all
And that's a fact y'all
And if you try to take what's mine
I take it back y'all, it's like that

DJ Run, and I run these things
You can hear it loud and clear like when the school bell rings
Like Martin Luther King, I will do my thing
I'll say it in a rap cause I do not sing

D.M.C., the man, that's causin' the beef
I got a message for the world so listen up it's brief
Like Malcolm X said I won't turn the right cheek
Got the strength to go the length, if you want to start beef
Start beef!

You know I'm proud to be black y'all
And real brave y'all
And motherfucker I could never be a slave y'all
So take that!!""

We're gonna tell ya somethin' put your mind in a swirl
God bless the next baby that comes in this world
The world's full of hate discrimination and sin
People judgin' other people by the color of skin
I'll attack this matter, in my own way
Man, I ain't no slave, I ain't reelin' no hay
Written a deposition, in any condition
Don't get in my way cause I'm full of ambition
I'm proud to be black (and I ain't takin' no crap)
I'm fresh out the pack (and I'm proud to be black)
So take that!!

There was a man, an inventor, who invented so well
He invented a fortune, for a man named Bell
George Washington Carver, made the peanut great
Showed any man with a mind, could create
You read about Malcolm X, in the history text
Jesse Owens broke records, Ali broke necks

Run-D.M.C.,"Kings from Queens from Queens come Kings
We're raisin hell like a class when the lunchbell rings

Your High-ness, or His Majesty!
Now you can debate, c-c-c-concentrate
But you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great!

Dissin' all devils, causin' havoc in hell
At a very high level base and treble shall yell
Heard in the heavens are the sounds supreme
So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen
So loud like a cloud with thunder and lightening!
So proud to the crowd it is somewhat frightening!
No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed
There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin' cannot cease, break!

You see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft
Courageous and contagious so you better break North
Not a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough?
Just listen while I'm dissin' cause you're pissin' me off
Cold bedding is spreading all across your face
You can't take when I break and if that's the case
I'll go on, and on, and kick the bass
So back up off the cup while I take my taste

It's highly appraised when the hell is raised
So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed
The unbelieving receiving prophecy so true
I cut the head off the Devil and I throw it at you
My mighty mic control, already brought his soul
The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll
A black hat is my crown, symbolizin' the sound
Signifyin', we won't play around, bust it!

Rappin' and climbin' beat-makin' every day
No synthesizer sound, so silence when I say
I am great, get it straight, 'cause that's my fate
My name is Run I'm number one, that's how I rate
He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace
His name is J he's here to play, and win this race
He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D
Kind of tall yes y'all, he's down with me

From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea
The word is heard as told by D
I don't sing I bring, much delight
Like a star shinin' bright in the darkest night
If you are cold, I'll bring you heat
Like I brought the whole world my funky beat
Mysterious and serious I ain't no joke
Fire from the depths of hell and you can smell the smoke

Kickin' and tickin' while you're havin a ball
Like chicken finger lickin' I'll be vickin' you all
So do The Bird, have you heard, did they give you a call
Just me and D.M.C., cold shakin' the walls

There's no fearin' when hearin' sound of this kind
Across the land every man is goin' out of his mind
On the face of the earth spreadin' like disease
Contaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees

Lord of lyrics, duke of discussion
Ruler of rock, your king at cold-crushin'
Puller of people, controller of crowds
Lingering lyrics all lasting and loud

So rhymers speak your peace
Why? Cause you can't touch (Jam Master Jay)

To his friends he lends, lotta joy he sends
Jay lose today, this is what I say
(Dick in your mouth all day)

My beats were played and laid rhymes made
Jay DJ'ed and I got paid
Made something out of nothing (Yo D that's true)
Yes my brother I would do it for you
I roam in the zone of the microphone
And I'm on the throne but I'm not alone
Got bones of steel and not of stone
I'm known to be prone and make your momma moan

Time for the rhyme so let the stars shine
Shame for the fame and the name combined
Run for the fun but you can gimme your ring
Show I gotta go so now a word from the King

Run-D.M.C.,"I, woke up this morning got ready to roll
Put on my green bomber it was, freezing cold
Applied long johns with Adidas not matching
I called up Jam Master cause I knew he was scratching
(What up?)  Jay to the telly music, loud as hell
He said, ""Hold up Run,"" ""it's the bell!""
Jay to the door as he leaves the cut
For his eyes a surprise, ""D.M.C. whats up?""

I need a little help Jay, I got a little problem
A guy like yourself, maybe you can help me solve em
I only want to know why this happens all the time
(What?)  Everywhere I go, I start to rap and rhyme
I rock them in the day (yeah you rock em every night)
I rock em when I left so def I knew something was wrong (alright)
I rhyme when I am sleeping, I rhyme when I'm awake
When I was nine I said a rhyme by putting candles on my cake
I just came from the bank (you said a rhyme?) A rhyme so funny
A song about the line so long they all gave me their money
That's why I came to you, you're my friend (yes that is true)
Said maybe Jay knows what to say, he'll tell me what to do

Hm, yo you go get Joe, and all the rhymes you made
And we'll go to the bank, and we call get paid!

That we can't do our thing on a positive tip

It's been a long time we need a change
Time for things to be rearranged
Time to get our act together
Whoever's clever or better never let
Another brother or sister get dissed cause they missed the
Knowledge and wisdom and damn I wish ya
Get with the stop the violence move
Won'tcha hear me say peace, and it's not just another groove

Come inside, the time is fine and I'm
Really ready to drop a heavy baseline
On the crowd that's loud and proud the rhyme
Is mine and the jam of party time
We're well equipped to flip and trip you out
I never slip but I rip the jam no doubt
So grab a girl until then I know you want to play
The funky jam I never quit until the break of day
Here we go on a Afrolistic journey
Here come the jam but don't forget to bring attorney (attorney)
To make sure the beat is upheld
The beat is raw and Run's banged it well
To make it take you to your destination
It's just the jam that slam across the nation
I gotta rock, you know I gotta good rhyme
So grab a girl, and listen to the good times
Now sweat til you're wet and get done

You gotta mingle, single girls allowed
So round em up, get a cutie in the spot
Look at the booty, do me, time to rock
And make all the girls give up the play
Get on the floor and make your day
So you're illin, still it's four o'clock
You won't leave till you see em close the spot
You gotta stay till they play the last song
Till the night gives light to the early morn'
Check the place and the taste of the bass is on the case
A negative thought that you brought just erased
Put away the nine and keep in mind
That the jam'll slam when it's party time

Pause for the cause, cause broken laws
Are just like broken jaws
They take a long time to heal
I'm for real, and I know the deal
Look it over, investigate

Well if it's dope, I hope it's not crack
Or coke, or nuttin like somethin you EVER smoke
And if they offer you some say NO
Or pause
The reason I wrote this rhyme, is not to climb
But just to tell all mankind
That the use and abuse of drugs -- will what?
Will, blow, your, mind

Like dough makes bread, it goes straight to your head
You're misled and then you're dead
Now that's not fly, when you die
On a high

You don't have to be a vic
Life is like a flick, so pause

My man Run never ran
I'm gonna take this mic yo my hand
And hand this to the one man band

Now pause, now pause

I'm Jay, I make up the trey
Now check out the dance that I display
It's called the pause
A new thing, on the dancefloor
First you move, then you stop
Combine the hustle, foxtrot, pop and lock
Put em all together why because
It's called the pause

Slammin, the dance is slammin
Pause, the people are jammin
Stop again, back to the groove
I show you how to move
        pause
It's simple, just like stop and go
You can pause on the fast or slow

The black or white that Friday night
In those racist places, let's get it right
Ah to the maximum, and keep askin' 'um
When the city gonna fix where the blacks are from
And every day around the way another one got
Bucked in his head, from a gunshot
No chance in advance for the ambulance
Cause he was just another victim of the circumstance
A brother died, the mother cried, it was a pity
But that's how it goes down when you're livin' in the city

Just a hard rock, call him a hard rock
In the metropolis there's no stoppin' this
Can't agree with society poppin' this
Disagree with the plea when they coppin' it
Some men pretend the end will come soon
They gather what they can and them BOOM

The deal was dealt, now your health is in question

Pollution, prostitution, In God We 
Need a solution, revolution, substitution
For the thing's that we're abusing

There's no progress for the rest

Run-D.M.C.,"Two years ago a friend of mine 
Asked me to say some MC rhymes 
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say 
The rhyme was Def a then it went this way 
Took a test to become an MC 
And Orange Krush became amazed at me 
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac 
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back 
Dave cut the record down to the bone 
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone 
And then we talkin' autograph, and here's the laugh 
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath 
But see ahh, ah that's the life, ah that I lead 
And you sucker MC's is who I please 
So take that and move back catch a heart attack 
Because there's nothin' in the world, that Run'll ever lack 
I cold chill at a party in a be	-boy stance 
And rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance 
Fly like a Dove, that come from up above 
I'm rockin' on the mic and you can call me Run-Love 

I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville 
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill' 
So if you see me cruisin' girls just a-move or step aside 
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride 
It's on a, ah first come, first serve basis 
Coolin' out girl, take you to the def places 
One of a kind and for your people's delight 
And for you sucker MC, you just ain't right 
Because you're bitin' all your life, you're cheatin' on your wife 
You're walkin' round town like a hoodlum with a knife 
You're hangin' on the ave, chillin' with the crew 
And everybody know what you've been through 

Ah with the one two three, three to two one 
My man Larry Larr, my name DJ Run 
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass 
I'm rockin' to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face 
Go Uptown and come down to the ground 
You sucker MC's, you bad face clown 
You five dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man 
Youse a sucker MC, and you're my fan 
You try to bite lines, but rhymes are mine 
Youse a sucker MC in a pair of Calvin Klein 
Comin' from the wackest, part of town 
Tryin' to rap up but you can't get down 
You don't even know your English, your verb or noun 
You're just a sucker MC you sad face clown 
So D.M.C. and if you're ready 
The people rockin' steady 
You're drivin' big cars get your gas from Getti 

I'm D.M.C. in the place to be 
I go to St. John's University 
And since kindegarten I acquired the knowledge 
And after 12th grade I went straight to college 
I'm light skinned, I live in Queens 
And I love eatin' chicken and collard greens 
I dress to kill, I love the style 
I'm an MC you know who's versatile 
Say I got good credit in your regards 
Got my name not numbers on my credit cards 
I go Uptown, I come back home 
With who me myself and my microphone 
All my rhymes are sweet delight 
So here's another one for y'all to bite 
When I rhyme, I never quit 
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it 
Cause it takes a lot, to entertain 
And sucker MC's can be a pain 
You can't rock a party with the hip in hop 
You gotta let em know you'll never stop 
The rhymes have to make (a lot of sense)

Lyrical law, never seen before
And I am, D.M.C.
And for all of y'all
This is the way, we reckless for rhymes

You got to save it for David and wave it if you think that I gave it
I never gave a damn about a critic so save it
I run amuk demanding my opinion you make it
The critic'll get the didick and if you got it then stay with it
You never knew me but you flew me to your town see
By kickin' dollars straight to Hollis I'm off the ground B
I never heard of such where niggaz stand and I fell
I'm doin' years with this career like Patti La-Belle
And if I ever was to fall I fell upon ya
Like ?? I made my mind I come to con ya
I see females I tell them yo my word is bond huh
Like Terri Teresa Tammi Tawana Tarena and Tonya
I'm comin' hard I got your head and yeah the lock's on
I threw you up, why did your daddy ?? cock strong
I rock I wreck I rip a rhyme I ??
My rap is right I write a rip-and-ready rock song

Call on the brother to come and get dumb
Until the def drum come as they come, when they come
I said I rip some, tearin' them up, a big up
A whattup? A nigga, a so what, yeah put your bricks up
I knock down the walls because I got to
The rock sound because I hip-hop new
Not the old, gold, from around the neck
And when I grab ahold you give me nuff respect
In a black BM, with my contact lens
When the track begins, I'm setting new rap trends
Lettin' lyrics I lay down
You play loud I stay proud with Jay down you stay down
Get up on the truck song, the one you put your buck on
You're stuck on, you're luck on, you're sucked on
A lollipop sucka!
I snuck ya, I struck ya, you stupid mother

I gotta come my name is Run and me and D we been appointed
I'm ever so clever you never touch the anointed
I'm Born Again I got a friend the Lord I rearrange
But other than that I'm livin' fat and ain't nuthin' changed
Big Willie still in your grilly, you better block son
I bust you up and then I blast you with my Bop Gun
A million times rhyme risin' to the prime
While another nigga's cuts get bucks, like it's a dope rhyme
Be instead I'd rather leave another brother dead
Cause yet another brother deaded from the slow dread
I'm makin' papers, brothers catchin' vapors
Try to lick shot, you get got, catch you later
This ain't The Cosby Show you know what it's like A Different World
We're livin' inside a world where you get the cash, you hit the girl
So check the hypness, I'm not livin' like this
I'm the type of guy to bust your eye, you lose your whiteness
You comin' butt when you wish upon a star
But I could never be butt, so yo, bust the guitar

Heads up my brother, here comes another
Word to the verb the urge to discover
A lover, you hover, you smother, my brother
You can't do nothin' other than take the record out the cover
You get the song at it's strong and random flow
You sing along cause the words you heard you know
Hostile the style that style is wild
The penile is where I goes and smile
Because I pop a lot, they try to lock me up
Because I rock the block, they try to stop me up
But I'm sly as a fox I can rocks
I got smarts when they starts tradin' shots they get dropped
I pull my card I pull my card I pull my card not
I use the rock to be hard, I'm a hard rock
You get a speedknot, and then you bleed a lot
You better read a lot because you really need a lot of
Information, and some education
Cause I'm replacin' what you hearin' on your station

Cause I'm the man with the hand that rocked the cradle, uhh
A lot of punk for the chunk baby that's a bet
Album number seven and we still ain't finished yet
I didn't get old, I got better at the craft
Sat back and watched you try to kick it but you made us laugh
So get back, you already had your chance to dance
You proved you had no waist to fit in this man's pants
Word to God, I'm back fo' sho'
Hollis Queens gettin' wreck so act like you know

You want to ask me, can't be now or later

Darryl Mack got the knack to put the H in heart
(And it ain't no fun, to step to D and Run
But if you want to step up, step up and get that ass - done)
A reporter with recorder was recordin' the slaughter
As I'm peepin' 'cross the border leapin' water keepin' order
Lit it up like a spliff, get a whiff of this hit
Cause I flick em like bits, and I bust 'em like zits
Dippin' down to grip this microphone I rip this
I'm glad not sad I flipped this, now can I get a witness

Don't play like I'm bitter, when you come with your best

From a harder core, I'm kickin' the raw

This is what Run-D.M.C.'ll be about y'all
I make the party people want to scream and shout y'all
I'm just a be	-boy, so watch me destroy
You best believe in you're receivin' D.M.C. boy
I used to explode, I never let go
I let the tec go back because I said so
Yeah I'm a hoodlum, but I'm a good one
So punks gunnin' for my run I wish they would come
So back up, Mr. Softy cause you're not hard
You're never comin' off because I got God
Just ?? ?? and get a beat down
Never weak kid, I come up with more street sounds
Rhymes galore and soarin' 'cross the floor an'
Some more is pourin', knockin' down your door an'

[Chorus]

C'mon and jump to the rhythm I give em is what I give 'em
When I get 'em I just hit 'em and split 'em
And when I split 'em lit 'em up like a bulb in the dark
I made you blink you figure out, cause I know you're the mark
I gotta lotta what I gotta, that'll be what I got
So step to me or D.M.C and it'll be in your heart
Now ease up back off the bo-zack, you know that you bite
You think you're doin me or D?  Nigga please (what?)

So I'ma pull my jammy out and I'ma murder the man
Bust a rap like a cap, put a hole in your soul
Take the trigger then you figured that I'm losin' control
I go loco with the vocals, yo goes the chokehold
And I broke those pros with the dope flows
I slow rolls, NO I don't smoke those
Leave the blunts for the punks in front rows

You see redline, here comes your bedtime

Like Kris-One said, I fly a head you better duck down
I sold good and then plenty like ? Charlie said
Like Mike I glove it you love it and now it's for my bread
It's goin' down on the mound watch a nigga pitch
Bang your thang and hang your damn necks, now you gettin' it
I see them go, and come, cause what they pumpin' weak
And now I'm flippin' the script and they can hardly speak

I said there's none as cute as you now which way you go?
Into my rap now won't you check out my flow

Keep it truck diesel for the sake of the ave
Never bring no witness cause I freak this with uniqueness

Uh-huh, yeah, what? Yo, yo
Aiyyo I seen Run with the chrome spinnin
Watchin the Knicks in the back of the 6
Pulled up on the side like, ""Who's winnin?""
Nigga said, ""Me since eighty-three, get it right""
Politely flashed his Roley, then dipped to the light
Next night seen him on stage with some platinum shells
with baguettes on the side that spelled ""Raising Hell""
I said, ""Run the crowd yell like you paid 'em well""
Then he said to ask Bertha Dell, who the hell?
Oh well - I thought I was done bein impressed
until my man called me up and told me listen to Flex
(""Yo yo yo, turn on Flex""0 I ain't know what to do
It was like Run was sunnin everybody but then again the shit was true
MC's must want him gone, hoppin on chrome
sayin they the kings, please, you kept the seat warm
Ain't nobody better than this twenty year veteran
Even as a Reverand, hotter than you ever been
It don't really matter who the hell you are

Run laps around wack cats, I hate DAT's
Since way back, made great tracks, I lace raps
Yo face that, before you catch aluminum bats
from numerous cats with Run-D.M.C. on they hats
You ain't gettin no show 'til your album out
The label don't want to spend money yo what's THAT about?
No clout, had to settle for a fake amount
While my catalogue bigger than your bank account
No doubt, I'm the greatest all time fo' sho'
Rev. Run comin through and leavin niggaz in awe

Why cause I'm a star now? Buy out the bar now?
Or I press one button, start up my car now?

Come right here in the middle of the stage, grab yo' {shit}
And say what you gotta say"" - and you know what D used to say?
He used to say..
""Party people! Your dreams have now been fulfilled

Yo, yeah, DMC man

Yo, this song is dedicated to (word)
(whether good days, happy or sad)
To all of those that's been down with each other since day one
Aha, let's keep it together

[Run]
Now we've been all around the world
From the corner of the block to the top of the world and back
We're the royalty on the ave, ain't nobody ever have
And the brand new jet black Cadillac
We've been down since day one
And no matter where I go people want to see him next to me
They say ""what's up with d?"" I used to jam all across the land
The coliseum, even message, when raising hell were cassettes
In the shelves, and the plush hotel after every show
We were just kissing the mic, living the life
Of MTV and the radio
And so you jay and me said ""it's 83'""
We're living and sticking together like a family
And no matter what, the rule must be
That it's guaranteed that I'm for you, and you for me
So

[Chorus]
Let's stay together let's stay together
Loving you whether, love is good and bad
And happy or sad

Yo, my love of the mic, can't touch my love for my wife
Baby I ain't going nowhere, specially the way you smile
When you have my child, or when I rock the crowd
Can't wait to be right there
Even my kids that ain't yours is still yours
Cause you love him and treat him like your very own
We be holding hands and I be holding doors
And when my mother in-law spend time alone
Call her about five hundred times a day
When I'm often gone cause I'm on the road
And when I'm on the phone, you know I want to be home
Cause that's the one and only spot where I really belong
You know our love, called you the preachers' wife
But the keys to bed lead living it up
And everybody would know, them seen us in the video
On the dance floor straight cutting it up
I love you baby

[Chorus]

To me, you mean the world
No matter what it is you say or do
I always I will be there for you
So no, no matter what, let's stay together

In the good life, happy or sad
You mean the world, no matter what is it you say or do
I always will be there for you
So no, no matter what, let's stay together
In the good life, happy or sad
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, love is good or bad, and or happy or sad

Ain't no beats to lead somebody you love
Best thing in life, is to have somebody ya heard
So keep it together
Good days, happy or sad",Let's Stay Together (Together Forever)

Yo
From the days of arm call niggas hung around blocks and corner stores 
Herringbone chains and fantasies rushin the door 
Niggas from Rastel poppin shells, snatchin rings 
Fly from shirt kings, from Queensbridge to 118 
I had my eyes open, steppin out into the world 
So fiendish, Ol' English 'til I url, growing pains 
A young kid, learnin early how to know the game 
USA Roller Skate rink, mobs and crews would take minks 
Clean streets, hustlers, crack cocaine 
Gave back by throwin block parties and basketball games 
A lotta cash made on Hollis Ave., fast and change 
High rollers was livin, until the Task Force came 
A lotta ghost towns and memories, bad blooded enemies 
So many died with the same gangsta pride that entered me 
Peace to them old timers, they who taught us 
How to stand strong and pass it on to the sons and daughters 
We all glow, and I'm proud to be all that I know 
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga, who I die for 
Survi-val, how we came a long way in solidarity 
Don't let nothin try an spoil this day 
To Run, D and Jay it's love and my thug salute 
'Cause real love's the only thing that comes above this loot 
Carhart jeans, it makes me think of LL's troops 
Let's celebrate, it's Queens Day, this one's for you

But three teens from Queens took over the world and never let go 
Just regular cats you know that just happened to blow 
Not anonymous with Hollis, Jake, Darrell and Joe 
Ay yo, we made so that others could grow 
Look at LL, A Tribe Called Quest, Mobb and Nas Esco 
Ain't takin credit, we showin pride, look at us now 
Got haters mouths all open wide, wonderin how 
In some cases the only thing that father and son 
Have in common is they love for Run 
Been the illest since day one, I'm too advanced to ever be caught 
Who's more legendary than me...that's what I thought 
And if somebody wanna test mine, yo, watch this 
Peter Piper picked peppers...... 
And see I knew you knew the next line, and I bet you said it 
It's been a minute, I'm still the king of the world so don't forget it

We grew up on Old English 
Summertime Broyal Wilders Park used to be the shit, 
why'd it have to stop 
On the Ave. niggas blew on all the jewelry spots 
Kicked the shirt kings for an ill airbrush top 
That'll match my cortez Nike's 
Niggas gettin robbed at the back door comin out with bags 
We used to get our gold fronts, from Eddie's gold caps 
What y'all know about that 
I bet the whole Queens do, around '86 with the chrome bass crew 
The young guns and lost boys made the news
Queensbridge is story in two 
The story is true

How you think it feel to be a Simmons
Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving
People want to know why I ain't on my brother's label

If I did this whole rap game be unstable
Went over to Arista wit Mr. Davis, for the change of neighbors
It's only fair that we share those naked papers
You can tell a cat serious about rap and it ain't luck

A few ladies in my den, fondlin
A few ladies in the den, so bring some Jello in
And a mighty fine fellow in like myself
to organize the panties on the shelf

 I like 'em sweet or fine, a genuine divine

I like all the girls, bustin dirty call girls

Listen to the Jam Master as he starts to rock
His name is Jay and he's on his way
To be the best DJ in the US of A

J-A-Y are the letters of his name
Cutting and scratching are the aspects of his game
So check out the Master as he cuts these jams
And look at us with the mics in our hands
Then take a count, 1 2 3
Jam Master Jay, Run-D.M.C.

He's Jam Master Jay, the big beat blaster
He gets better cause he knows he has to
In '84 he'll be a little faster
And only practice makes a real Jam Master

We're live as can be but we're not singing the blues
We got to tell all y'all the good news
The good news is that there is a crew
Not 5, not 4, not 3, just 2
2 MC's who are claiming the fame
And all other things won't be the same
Beacause it's about time for a brand new group
Run-D.M.C. to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstacy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay that is his name
And all wild DJ's he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's the best, y'all should say:
""Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay""

Jam Master Jay is the one in charge
It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs
So won't you move your butt

We're not talking ground, we're not talking sky
We're not talking low, we're not talking high
We're not talking big, we're not talking small
We want all of you on and off the wall
We're not talking night, we're not talking day

Hey!  You over there, I know about your kind
You're like the Independent Network News on Channel 9
Everywhere that you go, no matter where you at
I said you talk about this, and you talk about that
When the cat took your tongue, I say you took it right back
Your mouth is so big, one bite would kill a Big Mac

You talk too much               You never shut up
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never shut up

You talk about people, you don't even know
And you talk about places, you NEVER go
You talk about your girl, from head to toe
I said your mouth's moving fast, and your brain's moving slow

You talk too much               You never shut up!!
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never shut up

You're the instigator, the orator of the town
You're the worst when you converse, just a big mouth clown
You talk when you're awake, I heard you talk when you sleep
Has anyone ever told you, that talk is cheap

You talk too much               You never shut, up!!
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

Talking is the one thing, that you can do best
You told the cavity creeps, to watch out for Crest
You never have the story, right and exact
And then you always try to bore me, with your yakkity yak

You talk too much               And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

Everyday you are out fighting someone in the street
And you're always fighting someone you know ya can't beat
Then you wonder how, you got in this mess
Just think of what you said, then take a guess

You talk too much               You never shut up!
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

You're always spreading rumors, whether bad or good
You're the damn Walter Cronkite of the neighborhood
The Barbara Walters, and the Howard Cosell
You always come around, with a story to tell

You talk too much               And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

Said it's everybody's business that you love to mind
And talkin to you, is like dropping a dime
You're spreading the word, like it is your job
You should be a stool pigeon, who works for the mob

You talk too much               And you never shut up
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never shut up!

A big blabbermouth, that's what you are
If you were a talk show host, you'd be a star
I said your mouth is big, size extra large
And when you open it, it's like my garage

You talk too much               And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much        Homeboy you never shut up

You always like to gossip, just like a girl
You talk so damn much, it's outta this world
When you're reincarnated, in your second life
You won't be a man, you'll be a nagging wife

You talk too much               Then you never shut up
He said you talk too much       Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

SHUT UP!!!
SHUT UP!!!

Twenty-five hours, eight days a week
Thirteen months outta year, is when you speak
I'm tired of listening to the garbage you talk
Why don't you find a short pier, and take a long walk

Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

People in the world try to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard to want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups and your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Bills fly higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Huh!

War's going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
What ever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that that's the way it is

Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Huh!

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You notice one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

You should've gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Run-D.M.C.,"[Chorus]
Down with the king for years, about ten of 'em
Recruiting suckers, Mac and Mike, and makin' men of 'em
Tears and fears for my peers, they rippin'
You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't

Race for the border my daughter, 'cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out
Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
'Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd

Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown

(CL Smooth)
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way

Wrecka lecka mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to fortee better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather

Swing another Rodney King thing in our right
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, 'cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Becon, now your dumb ass is leakin'

C.L. and Run DMC so rush it
Big time way before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces

And I'm....

[Chorus]

I'm takin' the tours, I'm wreckin' the land
I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not mean for a hoe like a slow jam, check it

Sucker emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be

The microphone is granted when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society

I rages on the stages with a tune of verse
I get praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

[Chorus]

I'm the man you see, in the place to be
I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after twelve grade I went straight to college

Down with the kings on the mic, a full swinger
The P to the are, not an R&B singer
The are to the you-N-D-MC'n
The fly human beings, tonight I hold the key and

Flowin' with the funk track, here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black ??? on in to the early mornin'

Keeping nothing back but its position and that only,
Because the major part of the treasure has not been lifted yet.

What would happen and that some of us would never return,
Having lost their lives. Sometimes the whole story haunts dreams
And brings me the worst nightmares I ever had.

Running Wild,"The question that is on man's mind since the beginning of time is
""Where do we come from, where do we go?""
Well, let me tell you a story which took place a long, long time ago.
450.000 years before our time, when the atmosphere on ""Nibiru""
the 12th planet was getting worse and worse and when ""Alalu"" the
sovereign of the ""Annunaki-race"" was dethroned and dislodged by
his opponent ""Anu"".
""Alalu"" had to flee in his ""Vimana"" to save his life and he came down
to Earth and found something the ""Annunaki"" could use to filter the
solar radiation to save their atmosphere from destruction: ""GOLD""!!
And ""Alalu"" revealed his discovery to ""Anu"" and as a reward for it
he could return to his own planet.

AND THEN IT ALL BEGAN!!

A reef of gold was the right offering
For soothing with a gift of right size
He handed it over to Anu the King
Alalu's return had its price
Enki the scientist the son of Anu
Came down and dug for gold
Building a haven called Eridu
He mastered his task truly bold

No more gold, the volume decreased
The heir to the throne came down
Enlil brought Edin to seize
Ripping the gold of the ground
Annunaki men dug really hard
They worked their hands to the bone
A serious revolt for setting a mark
Cause the rage and discontent had grown

Hellbound, poisoned souls, in pain they'll burn, no return
Mankind will never learn, their blinded pride, the evil side

The firestorm will rage on the day of the falling
Armageddon's near it's the end of the genesis
Dying by the flood, no way back, no recalling
The malice and the pride is the death and fall of man

A daring test in the hour of need
An artificial bio-robot
Annunaki-essence for an exogamy
A fertilized ovum they had
An Annunaki woman was the one who gave birth
Adapa received his science
But Adapa was banned, he wasn't its worth
Cause of malice and evil defiance

Hellbound, poisoned souls, in pain they'll burn, no return
Mankind will never learn, their blinded pride, the evil side

The firestorm will rage on the day of the falling
Armageddon's near it's the end of the genesis
Dying by the flood, no way back, no recalling
The malice and the pride is the death and fall of man

The gods created animals and plants
Adapa's daughters they took their chance
They got married to Annunaki men
Enlil got furious from this wicked sin
He knew a huge tidal wave would come
His command, no warning to none
He wanted to wipe out man from this place
He wanted to stop this conceited and evil race

As the conspirator Enki took part
Noah was charged to build up the arche
The water came deluging the spot
So, death flowed with the swallowing waves of the flood !!

Sodom and Gomorrah they fell from grace
But the gods, they had to see for themselves
Mankind was spreading demanding more space
Claiming the throne and its wealth

The gods had to prove, who was right, who was not
Who followed the laws that they gave
Only one called ""Lot"" at the unholy spot
They saved him and his children from grave

Firewind blew that unleashed the storm
Atomic explosions that raged
No more warning, no arousing alarm
Their power set an end to this age

A few good souls were sent by the gods
They tried to save mankind from fall
But the ""Men In Black"" were hatching a plot
Defiance and malice's their call
Grinding the earth, turning good into bad
They raged like a maniac beast
Exploiting the being, the evil did spread
Souls made for hellfire's feast

Hellbound, poisoned souls, in pain they'll burn, no return
Mankind will never learn, their blinded pride, the evil side

The firestorm will rage on the day of the falling
Armageddon's near it's the end of the genesis
Dying by the flood, no way back, no recalling
The malice and the pride is the death and fall of man
The firestorm will rage on the day of the falling

In the 7th month of the year 1999 an ancient god of wrath will return
bringing fire, water, death and destruction.
That is the day when man will be judged for all evil he has done
and he will be commanded into the eternal fire.
Only the good and righteous souls will be saved to live in eternal peace.

The lords testified, their unholy lies, to save their own heads from the gallows
They sacrificed Kidd, they took him for a ride, that conspirational fellows

They judged him and they found him guilty of piracy of the high seas
