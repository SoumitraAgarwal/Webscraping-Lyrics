Dave Phillips,"I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-di-di-di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.",I've Just Seen a Face
Dave Pietro,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair",All in Love Is Fair

For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see 
For you
There might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody 
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two 
For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray 
For you
Love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday 
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two 
For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see 
For you
There might be another song
But in my heart your melody will stay with me",Another Star
Dave Pietro,"Her parents said, girl don't leave home
But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man, steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home 

Long days, short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so who'll pay your fare
She said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word 

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home 

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word, my final word 

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home
She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home
Go home baby, you better go home right now
Go home, little girl you better go home",Go Home

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
Now I see there's joy inside your arms

Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life

Dave Pietro,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you",Overjoyed

Dave Pike,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Dave Pike,"Sunny, ce matin encore c'était l'hiver
Sunny, depuis que tu es là le ciel est plus clair
Il y a du soleil dans les rues sur les toits
Le printemps est revenu avec toi
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Sunny, c'est déjà la fin de ma longue nuit
Sunny, à nouveau pour moi le soleil luit
J'ai eu des mauvais jours dans le vent et la pluie
J'avais si peur que tu m'oublies
Mais tu m'aimes toujours, mon amour

Sunny, tu m'as ramené tant de soleil
Sunny, le ciel est si bleu quand je m'éveille
Je me vois déjà aux vacances d'été
Les beaux jours durent toute l'année
Et je t'aime toujours, mon amour

Sunny, merci pour toutes les choses que je te dois
Sunny, pour tout le bonheur d'être avec toi
Oh merci pour le regard que tu poses sur moi
Et pour les images que j'y vois

Dave Pike,"I see that worried look upon your face
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

Now just like you, I sit and wonder why
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You need some sympathy, well so do I
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

She used to love me, that I know
And it don't seem so long ago

That we were walking
And we were talking
The way that lovers do

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

And so forgive me if I seem unkind (I ain't got no pity for you)
You've got your troubles, I've got mine (I lost, I lost, I lost my little girl

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Take a walk down any street now
Every one of us in our own little world
Looking for a heart with whom to beat now

What's worth nothing else but love
I'm prepared to take the heat now
What's worth more than anything else at all
To keep you firmly on your feet now

So fake cool image should be over
?Cause I long for a feeling of home
Real life, depicted in song
A loving memory
After long, home is a place where I yearn to belong

Where the land meets the sea
She'll be smiling so sweetly now
I hope that she'll be here much longer than I will
My heart loves her with every beat now

After long, home is a place where I yearn to belong",Home

Dave Rave,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You

No hell below us

And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head

Standin' all alone lookin' sad and shy
We began to dance, swaying' to and fro
And soon I knew I'd never let him go

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface

Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control

Has fallen apart right in front of you

no one's gonna make me hurt again

Why'd I play the fool
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't want to cry no more

No more pain (no more pain)
No more game (no more game messin with my mind)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
Nooone's gonna make me hurt again
No more tears (no more tears, I'm tired of cryin everynight)
No more fears (no more fears, I really don't want to cry)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
I don't ever want to hurt again
want to speak my mind, want to speak my mind

Uh, it feel so good
When you let go
Avoid these drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain
Free from all the game
Free from all the stress
So find your happiness
I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or loose
And I choose to win

No more pain (no more pain)
No more game (tired of your playin' game with my mind)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
No more, no more, No more, no more
No more tears (no more tears, no more cryin every night)
No more fears (no more waking be up in the morning)
No drama, no more in my life 

No more drama, no more drama
No more drama, no more drama
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA
No more drama in my life

And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""

Dave Stewart," When he found her
He stayed down there
With his velvet pills
And her purple hair
In a room so dark
They could barely crawl
With orange posters
On Victorian walls
It was Saturday night
And he felt like death
She just wanted to be loved
Like anybody else
Saturday night
And the clock never stopped
She felt like a loser
On top or the pops
The Chelsea lovers
With guillotine lips
Mascara egos
Doing a magazine strip
Chelsea lovers
In a vicious town
With lipstick futures
Like a couple of clowns
Strange creatures
In the eider down
Teenage oblivion
Waiting to be crowned
Holes in the mattress
Where these beasts have lain
Awake until morning
With ice in their veins
Facing each other
Their eyes never met
He just wanted to be straight
It never happened to him yet
Both of them laughing
But they can't understand
What it is about friendship
Makes you hold your own hand
The Chelsea lovers
Oh how they can talk
With their tongues connected
And their skin like chalk
Chelsea lovers
They're joined at the hip
With the power of madness
At their fingertips
Chelsea lovers
With their limbs entwined
Making moon sized promises
From their molecule minds
Stardust lovers
In a Ziggy cartoon
Two solemn lovers
In a Chelsea room.

Through obstacles and icicles, keeping my mind on its lead
Keeping it warm, with chemicals and therapy
Turn it on take me over crazy sister
Digging a hole in your heart
Watching you breathe, punishment and oxygen
Letting my mind off its lead
I watched it disappear, to somewhere dark and reassuring
Turn it on (can you believe it)
Take me over (it's psychomazingly true)
Turn it on crazy sister
And when I feel it (it's psychomazing it's you)

Kissing the screen, being a god
Staying at home, screwing it in

Rivers in sand running out to sea
Nobody slept on the night of the crash
We were all covered in devil grey ash

I could have been underground

Hey, look into my eyes, you'll see I'm strong and I'm proud
You are all the sweetness of my life, you see
You have brought heaven right here on earth to me
No man of wealth, I know I'll ever be
But I'll be satisfied just knowing you love me

Something always happens to bring the curtain down

But when your love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world so warm and sweet, I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me, I'm in a different world

Each time you speak my name or put your hand in mine
The empty life I knew, I leave it far behind
'Cause you gave me the love that I truly felt
Most of all you made me believe in myself
You're more than a love to me, you're my way of life
I'll forever cherish you, more each day and night

Oh,
I'm in a different world

A world that's warm, a world that's sweet
A world that's every bit complete
A world that's real, you've made me see
All the beauty surrounding me
Oh, look what you've done for me
Oh, look what you've done for me
I'm in a different world, now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world, and that's where I want to be
I'm in a different world, now that you've been loving me...",I'm in a Different World

And you always remind me that my baby's gone

Every minute seems just like an hour, now that my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

I travel over the sea and ride the rolling sky
For that's the way it is, that is my fortune
There are many ears to please, many people's love to try
And every day's begun rising for the moon
There's a heart in every place, there's a tear for each farewell
For that's the way it is, that is my fortune
I'll lure you as the lace that the wayward gypsies sell
With the sinking of the sun, rising of the moon
Chorus:
Rising for the moon, the sun has set and it is dark
But the star of the enchanted tune is bright as any spark
The chorus of the dusk regail the evening lark
Whose every day does start rising for the moon

For that's the way it is, that is our fortune
There are many ears to please, many people's love to try

Oh the last words he said, just before he dropped dead,
Were ""we'll meet on that beautiful shore""

She laughed at everything she saw 'til she nearly broke her jaw
Nearby I saw a big balloon which proved to be my friend
I threw her in, I cut the rope, and up she did ascend
And she never came back, she never came back,

Had no friend for to go my bail

I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Ah, and he coughed as he cleared his throat

Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read murder in the first degree
I hollered Lawdy Lawdy, have a mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

Come on you've gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be",Cocaine Blues

Of poetry and poses,
And each man knows hell be alone
When the sacred ginmill closes.

And so well drink the final glass
Each to his joy and sorrow
And hope the numbing drink will last
Til opening tomorrow.

And when we stumble back again
Like paralytic dancers
Each knows the question he must ask
And each man knows the answer.

And so well drink the final drink

that cuts the brain in sections
Where answers do not signify
And there arent any questions.

I broke my heart the other day.
It will mend again tomorrow.
If Id been drunk when I was born
Id be ignorant of sorrow.

And so well drink the final toast
That never can be spoken:
Heres to the heart that is wise enough
To know when its better off broken.",Last Call

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high,
All these things that won't change, come what may.
Well our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on.
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

Think I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall.
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for.
Yet I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more.

[Chorus]

If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good.
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare,
But by then it would be winter, not much for you to do.
And the winds can sure blow cold way up there.

So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Walkin' a road other men have gone down.

Hey, hey Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
'Bout a funny ol' world that's a-comin' along.
Seems sick an' it's hungry, it's tired an' it's torn,
It looks like it's a-dyin' an' it's hardly been born.

Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things that I'm a-sayin' an' a-many times more.
I'm a-singin' you the song, but I can't sing enough,
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.

Here's to Cisco an' Sonny an' Leadbelly too,
An' to all the good people that traveled with you.
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.

I'm a-leaving' tomorrow, but I could leave today,
Somewhere down the road someday.
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Is to say I've been hittin' some hard travelin' too.

Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Combed my hair in a thousand ways, but I came out lookin' just the same

I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing, don't lose your head to a woman that'll spend your bread

French police wouldn't give me no peace, they claimed I was a nasty person

I was accused

Down in rome I wasn't getting enough 
Of the things that keep a young man alive
My body stunk, but I kept my funk at a time when I was right out of luck
Getting desperate, indeed I was looking like a tourist attraction
Oh, my dear, I better get out of here for the vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no, no
 
I moved right out east, yeah
On the peking ferry I was feeling merry, sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slant-eyed lady by the light of an eastern moon
Shanghai lil never used the pill, she claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh, people, I was glad I found her
Oh, yeah, I was glad I found here
 
I firmly believed that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete  
Look how wrong you can be
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe 
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slant-eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God, I was glad I found her
 
And if they had the words I could tell to you 
To help you on your way down the road
I couldn't quote you no dickens, shelley or keats

And all my daydreams have gone astray

Freedom the lesson we must learn

Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
",Love Song
Davi,"Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

She was born in a handbag
Love left
On a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
Nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey
Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo

First thing she learns is
She's a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Something rings a bell
And it's all over
She's going out her way
Stealing for that one good rush

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

She could use a little money
She's hangin' on his arms
Like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey
She's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town
Police, shake down

Oo Oo
Oo Oo
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Oo Oo
Oo Oo
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

She's got a ticket to nowhere
She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name

She's in the pocket of a home boy
Oo she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
Spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
She's an angry gal

Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out

Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin her with video-drugs-bullets and promises",Day in Day Out
Davi,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good, bet the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine

Wait till the warm-up's underway, wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day, you ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine, we're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but you ain't left the ground

Wait till you're locked in my embrace, wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place, ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum",The Best Is Yet to Come
Davi,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what you're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one that I'd never switch

David,"Jane, oh now Jane
You got me like a dog, oh now Jane
It's hard biding my time
You're sitting pretty in the light
For your word know when I'm gone you'll cry for me

Cause oh, since I see those lonely eyes of fire in your skin
Well all the world I had known, turned into shadow, into stone
For your word know when I'm gone you'll cry for me
And oh when I'm gone you'll cry

All the things you used to tell me
Make me feel so sure
Now I don't know what's wrong or what's right anymore

Gave you my ring and you smile to receive it
Down at the station you said goodbye
That our love be lost, who am I to believe it
Now I can't find no easy summer
That's why

These three months are gone
Wait by the door and no letter come
Today I walk in a dream
Through the streets, out to the stream
Where we lay, I know when I'm gone you'll cry for me

Now tongues they can talk
Just how they want I know in my heart
What's true but oh when I stings
I'm terrified of all the things
I might do, and oh when I'm gone you'll cry for me
And oh when I'm gone you'll cry

All the things you used to tell me
Make me feel so sure
Now I don't know what's wrong or what's right anymore

Gave you my ring and you smile to receive it
Down at the station you said goodbye
That our love be lost, who am I to believe it
Now I can't find no easy summer
That's why

David,"It isn't very hard to see from where I stand
There's no one to blame
I opened up my eyes to see a world
With so much pleasure not pain
As she looked into my eyes
I knew I might not see her again
We're changing and it's hard for me
To stay the same

She, answers all the questions
Things I find so very hard to say
She, as I closed my eyes
I heard her whisper goodbye
All these questions that I'm asking
Feel very foolish anyway, goodbye
As I turned the corner I heard her whisper again
Goodbye is what she said

I loved her from the first time we kissed
She taste so great
She lit another candle and slowly
Fell into the flame

She, answers all the questions
Things I find so very hard to say
She, as I closed my eyes
I heard her whisper goodbye
All these questions that I'm asking
Feel very foolish anyway, goodbye
As I turned the corner I heard her whisper again
Goodbye is what she said",Goodbye
David,"The sun shines high above
The sounds of laughter
The birds swoop down upon
The crosses of old grey churches
We say that we're in love
While secretly wishing for rain
Sipping coke and playing games

September's here again
September's here again",September
David,"To all that came before me
To all that left their mark
To all that tried and failed so
To all that now are gone
I see myself in your words
I see you in my smile
Your wisdom's like a lighthouse
That guides me when I'm lost...

I find myself at this crossroad, broken dreams
And I don't know what tomorrow might bring

I'm like a ball of clay
That you molded with your hands
Raised me without shadows
And baptized me in the light
To those that came before me
I know I'll see you soon
And like a distant star in the night
I'm reaching out for you...

I find myself at this crossroad, broken dreams
And I don't know what tomorrow might bring

David,"High, high flames and boiling water
Still nobody knew
Stare at the ceiling, make way for something
Still nobody moves
Oh my goodness, oh my god I fear
Oh my goodness, oh my god I fear
I fear I'm cracking up

One million feelings is this for real I ask
Nobody knows
Somebody's daughter made me walk on water
Don't let me sink
I think I'm stupid, luxury problems still
I think I'm stupid, luxury problems still
It's more than I can take

Crying in the basement, what can I say
But I am so very sorry
Who would've thought that it would ever dry

David,"I'm falling by the wayside
I'm sinking with the sun
Everything I do
Is wrong, wrong, wrong
Gazing at the billboards
Staring down the broken lines
Sleeping on the backseat
I could not believe
You were right up there beside me
Tugging at my sleeve
And putting on your lipstick
Just like you did a thousand times
And something in your eyes that
Makes me smile, oh yeah
Something in your eyes that
Makes me smile, oh yeah
I wake up in the darkness
Its more than I can stand
I'm reaching out to touch it
It breaks up in my hand
I've never known the headlights
To shine so cold
I'm waiting for the morning
To steal over the hills
I'm urging for the road
To speed these wheels
I'm watching for the sunrise
Turning all the teardrops cold
Cause something in your eyes that
Makes me smile, oh yeah
Something in your eyes that
Makes me smile, oh yeah
Something in your eyes that
Makes me smile, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah",Smile
David,"Today I'm gonna make a couple changes Do some things I've never done before Today I'm gonna try a little harder To set my sights on a different shore 
Today I'm gonna laugh a little longer Gonna turn my dream into a plan Today I'm gonna sing a little louder Even if nobody understands 
Today I'm gonna make myself a promise And keep it no matter what the cost Today I'm gonna count all of my blessings And let go of everything I lost 
Today is gonna be a little better Than yesterday ever hoped to be No time to waste ? too much to touch and taste Tomorrow is too far away for me 
Today I'm gonna find another reason To make my children glad that they are here Today I'm gonna listen to the season Tell me all about the coming year 
Today I'm gonna start another journey Find the things I never thought I?d lose Make a couple choices and disregard the voices That tell me I'm not strong enough to choose 
Today I'm gonna live a little longer Make the hours equal 25 Today I'm gonna love a little stronger And celebrate that love is still alive 
Today already started But it hasn't ended yet Today will be a day I never will forget 
And when tomorrow comes, I?ll sing this song again. And again. And again?",Today

You alone are all I have in this world
You alone, you`re my girl
You, only you can understand
You, you say I`m your only man

That I`ve never told to anyone before
Not to anyone: I love you - and I will always love you

Oh, what a world we both go through
One thing is true, my only love is you, is you, is you
I can`t explain the things you mean to me
Words, they are just not enough

David,"Feels like my life's been passing by
With happiness just bein' a lie
How did I get here, where am I going?
One more day without knowing
Struggling for one more breath
As I'm drowning in a painful death
Can someone reach out for me?
In this dark and dreary sea

'Cause it seems like no one can
Hear the voice that's calling
Try to take the most I can stand
But I keep falling

I try to chase the memories away
But they haunt me everyday
I hope I get over this phase
'Cause I'm stuck inside this haze
All I need is a simple lift
Such a sweet and precious gift
So I don't lose it all before
What I have left is nothing more

In my isolating misery
I feel like the epitome
Of darkness and despair
Just leading onto nowhere
Will I be able to win this race?
I'm runnin' at a slow pace
Trying hard to press on
But the motivation's gone

'Cause it seems like no one can
Hear the voice that's calling
Try to take the most I can stand
But I keep falling

Oh

I try to chase the memories away
But they haunt me everyday
I hope I get over this phase
'Cause I'm stuck inside this haze
All I need is a simple lift
Such a sweet and precious gift
So I don't lose it all before
What I have left is nothing more

It may not have to be this way
Waiting for me they could be a new day
Maybe I can revise
And escape from the lies

I try to chase the memories away
But they haunt me everyday
I hope I get over this phase
'Cause I'm stuck inside this haze
All I need is a simple lift
Such a sweet and precious gift
So I don't lose it all before
What I have left is nothing more

There could be something more
To what my life may have in store
I'll move from where I began
Keep on pressing through to the end",Falling
David,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it

David,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

David,"Oh, thinking about our younger years. There was only you and me.
We were young and wild and free.

Now nothing can take you away from me. We been down that road before
But that's over now. You keep me coming back for more.

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms.
I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven.
And love is all that I need.
And I found it there in your heart.
It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven.

David,"This story is about love
The woman I loved is dead

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy

They say he wandered very far
Very far over land and sea

A little child and sailed about
But very wise, was he

And then one day, one magic day he passed my way 
While we spoke of many things fools and kings, this he said to me

The greatest thing, you'll ever learn
Is just to love, and be loved in return",Nature Boy

"David ""Dudu"" Fisher","Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Music of the Night [From Phantom of the Opera]

David & Jonathan,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air.

in a day of gold coloured by the glow of new love

But I'm still lucky
Some live inside it
They wake up early with their bellies full of butterflies,
But not the good kind

And it's growing bigger faster than you see
Some live inside it, an eternal daydream
Today at the store as the light was fading
I heard a song and I asked myself:

Is this all we get, is it never getting better than this?

I wake up early because I have to
I can't be late for the daily boredom
That keeps me dreaming, that keeps me wishing
That keeps me pushing everything in front of me
But oh, what a pretty day to choose

When you're so far away from me

With Christmas trees and two thousand light bulbs
To beat the darkness and make it leave us
Clear a path for spring and summer, it doesn't help
Cause I always connect it to you
And I saw space on a summer morning
But I'm still lucky, since I wasn't born into it

Alarm clocks screaming out loud
A warning

And dance through the rooms 
Of the house of your dreams
There's not much 'round here that's half

As pretty as it seems
But it gets bigger
And it gets better
So put that record on and dance until

And they say sister
They say all is fine
Truth or lie, sister, they say all is fine

Fine
Fine
Well here's the laughter
And here's the sore throat

And here's another one of the only kind
That will ever grow here
And the air is full of...
Mark my words and sleep

The air holds nothing
So ten years of falling down is nothing, now?
Ten years of feeling sick is nothing?
Well I spy an eye for an eye and

A tooth for a tooth in you
And I spy clear skies all over
And I spy a life repeating itself in you
So he might say ""- I remember a feverish night 

When she would cling to the walls 
And talk like a child
And that car travel under the beautiful sky
That car travel into the longest of nights

And the air was full of
Poisoned words
And the record's broken
And as I walk through every room of my life,

Thinking I can never take the edge of anything
And shape it to a perfect ball
And let it roll down the hall
To knock all this shit out of my way,

The sun brakes through,
The sun brakes through
And I see you
I see you like always
Like every day

And still I dance through the rooms
Of the house of my dreams
Nothing 'round here is 
Half as pretty as it seems

And it won't get bigger
It won't get better

Pretending that my mind is clear
A rock for the forgotten 
But when I pour they smile 
And say to me that I'm 
A rock for the forgotten 
A bottle got broke 
In a fight over dope 
And the mean old man 
Washed his hands 
All the troubles he's seen 
Seems like a dream 
While he washes away his sorrow 
But either way I can tell that he prays 
There will never be another tomorrow 
While me I never change 
I try to keep things just the same 
A rock for the forgotten 
And when I pour their smiles 
Say to me that I'm 
A rock for the forgotten 
Maybe they'll come alive 
See the soapbox man 
Is at it again 
And the girls pass by avoiding his eye 
He's the best there is 
In the hellfire biz 
A black belt in the art of babble 
Came from Vera Cruz 
When a bottle of booze 
Told him he had to rouse the rabble 
While me I'm hiding here 
Pretending that my mind is clear 
A rock for the forgotten 
But when I pour they smile 
And say to me that I'm a rock for 
The forgotten 
Maybe they'll come alive",A Rock for the Forgotten
David + David,"I once was a dancer 
I was young once like you 
Though I know I don't look it 
Jumped high as the sky 

Had fire in my eyes 
And legs like a stallion 
And I had a girl and I loved her 
My best friend was her brother 

We were on top of the mountain that summer 
Thought we'd never be swallowed by the cracks 
Fallen so far down 
Like the rest of those clowns begging bus fare back 

Swallowed by the cracks
Our pride worn down talking times gone by 
Like everybody else 
Swallowed by the cracks 

We would never be swallowed by the cracks 
We would talk through the night 
About what we would do 
If we just could get started 

I would choreograph 
Eileen she would act while 
Steve was a writer 
Then stevie ran away and get bored 

Eileen took a job in a store 
Me I became this drunken old whore 
'Cause you see we'd be swallowed by the cracks 
Fallen so far down 

Like the rest of those clowns begging bus fare back 
Swallowed by the cracks our pride worn down 
Talking times gone by like everybody else

Swallowed by the cracks 
You see we'd be swallowed by the cracks 
Maybe it ain't over I can see it's up to me 

You only out when you stay out you stay out when you don't 
Believe we could drive around in circles getting nowhere 
All night long getting drunk with strangers telling lies 
And singing along with the jukebox baby

I'll watch from above 
The too-late rites

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me

Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same

And her heart is breaking in front of me

Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

And you wonder: will it last forever?
And you try to keep tomorrow locked away,

And love's enough for anyone today.

Every time you fall in love,
That's the only time it's read;
And that girl is the only girl
Who shares the way you feel.
And you wonder how you lived without her,
And you tell yourself she'll never go away,
'Cause tomorrow is forever 
And love's enough for anyone today.

Love's enough to find your heart and lose it
To see the doubt and choose it over knowing how or when;
Love's enough to know if she'd refuse it,
You'd take what's left and try your luck again.

'Cause every time you fall in love
That's the one and only time.
It's living through the final verse
Of a one and lonely rhyme.

And you turn and watch tomorrow drift away,

Trying hard to keep from dealing drugs

She's taken to sleeping all night in his chair
Together they both had a reason for living
Back when the felling of loving was there

Then she took to dreaming when he wasn't looking
And he took to looking for moments alone
Together they drifted apart from each other
Together they both knew the felling was gone

Gone like the sparrow south for the winter
Gone like the river out to the sea
Gone like the leaves from the trees when its snowing
Gone like the love that they once gave so free

Till he took to starring at his lonesome shadow
And she took to humming the words to some song
They both felt it slipping that feeling of giving
Leaving the feeling of being alone

Each of them reach out for the other
Together they go though the motions alone
Trying to pretend that nothing else matters
Making believe that their love isn't gone

Now she's just a lady that I used to know

I lost her eyes to a whole bunch of Pena Coladas
After a few margaritas I took all the blame
For drinking Manhattans at tree in the morning I lost her
Between the vodka and gin and the beer and champagne

I lost her lips late one night on a strawberry daiquiri
Jack Daniels, whiskey and rum couldn't help me that time
I lost her arms and her hands to a glass of tequila
I lost her heart and her soul to a bottle of wine

I lost a bet that our love would last forever
Sloe gin and tonic was making my heart hard to find
With two bloody Mary's I ran out of vodka this morning
Losing my chances of drinking her off of my mind",Lost

Never thinking wed be put in jail
You might say that we were green, I was barely seventeen
When they put those bars between old Merle and me

Late one night we hit the wall, twenty feet we had to fall
To the ground where we could craw into the weeds
Waiting for that shotgun blast, never thinking we could last
We sure had to grow up fast, old Merle and me

We were young and crazy then, it was easy to pretend
Acting like wed never been in reform school
Looking danger in the eye, walking with our heads held high
We were not afraid to die, old Merle and me

We were living by the gun, never caring what wed done
Swearing it was all just fun and games you know
We would die and go to hell before we broke our vow to tell
How we escaped that prison cell, old Merle and me

How was Merle or me to know, we would end up on death row
Waiting for our turn in the electric chair
Shot down in a grocery store, we got busted at the door
Praying wasn't easy for old Merle and me",Merle and Me

David Allan Coe,"I never meant to leave her my intentions were to stay
It wasn't nothing she had done or nothing she could say
To change this old familiar feeling that makes chills run through my skin
Less she read my mind and saw the sings that point around the bend
My toothbrush never leaves my pocket there's no anchor on my feet
If my sleepin' bag gets dusty and there's not enough to eat
I may stay an extra day till I find another town
You can bet there's not a lady that can show this freight train down
And I'll be moving in the morning leaving you behind
If anyone should ask you you can tell them they will find
Somebody walking down the highway with a guitar in his hand
And I'll always be remembered as a free born rambling man
[ guitar ]
Lord tell the children when they find me that I died but not in vain
They can find reincarnation in the whistle of a train
And each time they hear the whistle blow through the stillness of the land
They'll know that I was happy as a free born rambling man
And I'll be moving...",Free Born Rambling Man
David Allan Coe,"I painted quite a picture for the girls in her hometown
And she was no exception to the rule
Singing all them songs about the places that I've been
Made a body feel just like a fool
She was like the paper bag that once had held the wine
Thrown without no caution to the wind
I left her like the empty bottle lyin' on the ground
Swearin' I'd pick her up again
She was greener than the grass we laid on underneath that Alabama sun
I guess she should have known that ol' highway was my home
To-do-do-to-do-do do-do-do

I said she was prettier than Paris in the rain
Lord I filled her full of gypsy lies
Swearin' I'd be coming back to fetch her in the spring
Too ashamed to look her in the eye
She looked about as simple as the cotton dress I've torn
Sneakin' in her house at 3 a.m.
Her mama liked to question me the day after and I was sure
Her intuition told her where we'd been
She was greener than the grass we laid on underneath that Alabama sun
I guess she should have known that ol' highway was my home
She should have never listened to my songs to my songs

And if you'd come with me we'd leave here today

And I've got to have you as soon as I can

And I know you're worried about where you stand
The ring that he gave you is still on your hand
You want to be faithful you want to believe
He's easy to lie to but hard to deceive
And you say it's over between you and him
He tells you he needs you but chances are slim
That he even wants you as much as I do

David Allan Coe,"There's a stack of daily papers on her doorstep
And the grass has grown up more than she'd allow
Yes it looks to me to be a little more than a vacation
Never knew that I'd miss her until now
From both ends the candle seemed to burn much brighter
I guess she saw the flame I tried so hard to die
Looks like I'm the one that got caught in the middle burnt my finger
I got there just in time to watch love die
Yes I got there just in time to watch love die mhm mhm

There's a change of address blank inside her mailbox
And the key she usually left for me is not here
Yes it's plain to see that she no longer needs an explanation
Guess I should have known I would not find her here

David Allan Coe,"She packed her bags and moved to Florida 
I've been blue since she's been gone
And this bowling green motel room 
Is now my old Kentucky home
All she left me was some whiskey 
And these funny cigarettes she rolled
It must have been her main intention 
To watch our dreams go up in smoke
It's another blue grass morning 
I'm gonna blow my mind away
In this smoke old motel room looks 
Like it's gonna be another blue grass day
She's soakin' up the sun in Florida

David Allan Coe,"You know when I first started doing this album I thought
All these songs about just gettin' the divorce
And there was one thing I wanted to tell you darlin' darlin'
Before the music stops for me and you and that's what you meant to me
And even thought the divorce is final now
I wanted to sing you this one last love song

Your precious love means more to me than any love could ever be
For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue
For that's what love will do
And darlin' (I'm so surprised) oh when I first realized
That you weren't fooling me
And darlin' they say that our love won't grow
But I just want to tell them that they don't know
For as long as you're in love with me our love will grow wider depper than any sea
And of all the things all the things that I want in this whole wide world
Is just for you to say that you'll be my girl
Oooh (wanting you) I'm wanting you (I'm so blue) oh that's what live will do

I gave it a hundred and ten percent of my soul
And I tried everything I could to hold it together
But now that it's over I just wanted you to know
That anytime you have sunshine you're gonna have bad weather
Some people they can handle that and some people can't

Have enjoyed us half as much as we did then

I don't have to worry if I'll spend the night alone

You're not there to hear me if I cry

There's no way to say how much your leavin' turned me on
I get so excited when I realize you're gone
You're just like another verse in some old country song
I got tired of singin' long ago
I don't even miss you when I go to bed at night
Gee it's great to know that I'll win each and every fight
No one's arms to hold me after I turn out the light
And I don't even miss you anymore
I don't have to feed the dog or take the garbage out
It don't matter if the neighbors hear me when I shout

On the window of the car
It looked like a tombstone 
Parked beside the local bar
Once he'd drove it crazy 
Now he's driven it too far

Someone wrote in soap 
It's over right across the hood
On the door it said good riddance 
Boy, I feel good
On the fender were the words 
I won't be home tonight
And the jukebox in the bar played 
If you're gonna do me wrong do it right
Laughed so hard I thought now 
There's a guy who's got some spunk
What a sense of humor 
It said goodbye on the trunk
Tin cans tied with paper streamers

David Allan Coe,"It was too cold to stay in the north 
And LA seemed the most likely place I could be
Those Malibu nights and those Hollywood lights
Were blinding me
I longed for a lover to help me discover 
The key that would unlock love's door
While diving the reefs 
Lord, she changed my beliefs
As we made love on the ocean's floor
And she whispered

Divers do it deeper 
Jockeys do it shorter
Bricklayers always make it just a little bit stronger (stronger)
Sailors do it wetter 
Soldiers do it better
But cowboys stay in the saddle just a little bit longer

I moved from LA for a good job with pay 
Riding range for the Double Bar Jay
Till the rodeo came and I put in my name 
For the bull riding contest that day
The judges were watching 
But they never noticed
The girl standing close to my chute
She'd picked me to win 
I could tell by her grin 
As she reached out and platted my boot
And she said

Divers do it deeper 
Pilots do it higher
Bricklayers always make it just a little bit stronger (stronger)
Doctors do it cleaner
Bikers do it meaner
Cowboys stay in the saddle just a little bit longer

Divers do it deeper 
Jockeys do it shorter
Bricklayers always make it just a little bit stronger (stronger)
Sailors do it wetter 
Soldiers do it better
But cowboys stay in the saddle just a little bit longer

Knock me to my knees
You're the only friend 
There has ever been that didn't do me wrong
Jack Daniels, if you please 
Knock me to my knees
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane 
Since my baby's gone

Cigarettes and whiskey 
Calm my shaking hands
I just lost a lover to a one night stand
Something temporary too late I had to learn
Someone from her past 
Said it couldn't last a bridge she could burn

Knock me to my knees
You're the only friend 
There has ever been that didn't do me wrong
Jack Daniels, if you please

Dreams were left to die
Empty words were spoken 
Tears were in our eyes
Something temporary those tears will fade away
Do the best you can, help me understand
These games that people play

Till the thought of you is more than I can stand
Just to think of having you is music to my soul
You make me feel as though the world is in my hands

Jody like a melody

I can't believe the sun will rise
Without me looking in your eyes
And knowing that your love has made me strong
Why you left I'll never know
The fire you built will always glow
I only know I woke to find you gone

You warm me and then leave me with a chill, oh, ooh
Jody, I can't keep my thoughts about me in the daytime 
When your memory is enough to make me blind
And late at night I lie awake
And wait for you to come and when you don't
You know I almost lose my mind

David Allan Coe,"Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know

She's the best thing in this life
Why she worships the ground that he walks on
She waits up for him at night and worries
Until he's safely home
And she always believes his stories about working overtime
And in twenty years beside him, cheating's never crossed her mind

Aw but it crossed his
Early last summer
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall 
He gave in
And now he wishes he could stop himself
But theres no easy way
So he lays down with his lover
And silently he prays

Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know

In his heart and soul
He knew that he was playing a game he could never win
But you know, forbidden fruit is sweet
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again
And now he's giving up on looking for a way to fight the feeling
So he prays this simple pray
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling

On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets

Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him, be proud of him

Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to 
When nights are cold and lonely
 
Stand by your man
And tell the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can

Well honey, that's the only way that daddy knows how to answer your question
I knew when your mama passed away that someday I have to explain the things to you
That might make me and you both feel uncomfortable
So I thought that the best thing to do is just sing you this song 
Which your mama used to sing
And I hope that you will understand 
'Cause she did stand by her man

Liquor was the only love I'd known

You're as warm as a glass of Brandy

And to clean the house and cook for him was not her kind of bag

Because he hadn't said anything at all about mama
Or trains, or trucks, or prison, or getting' drunk
Well, he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me
And after reading it I realized that my friend had written the perfect country & western song
And I felt obliged to include it on this album

Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain

David Allan Coe,"You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall

He only had a dollar to live on ?till next Monday
But he spent it all on comfort for his mind
Did you say you think he's blind?

Someone should call his parents or a sister or a brother
And they'll come and take him back home on a bus
But he?ll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother
And he?ll always be another one of us

He said he wanted heaven but prayin? was too slow
So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin? low

You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall

David Allan Coe,"Love Is A Never Ending War (D. Blackwell)

Well I dozed off in the back of the bus
To the groan of the Greyhounds throttle
And I woke to crack of a paper sack
And a cork poppin' from a bottle
I tell you son the old man said
It was hell in world war two
As he rolled up his pant leg
I saw the wood that filled his shoe
The younger man who followed him in opened up his vest
Showed the older soldier where he caught one in the chest
Both of them had purple hearts for the hell that they've been through
Well I don't have no purple heart mine's just black and blue

Chorus:
Oh love is a never ending war
March me into action
And we'll train for what's in store
You win some and you lose some
But I believe in what I'm fightin' for
Oh love is a never ending war

They where half-way through that bottle
And they where gettin' high
I never fought in those two wars
But Lord my throat was dry
So I showed them scars and stitches
Inflicted by Maria
But I didn't think that would give me a drink
So I blamed it on Korea
I parted my hair and I showed them where
I got shrapnel from a grenade
I just couldn't tell it was where Annabelle
Put a glas of lemonade
How that I've been tortured by the blade of a bajonet
And I never forget that hot August night
And the fingernails of Jeanet

Chorus

As I neared my destination I saw tears well in their eyes
Partly from the drinkin' but mostly from my lies
And they stood up to salute me
As I stepped down from the bus
And out of the open window they yelled
Give her hell for us

Chorus

Even though I know what all his daddy done before
Hank weighs close to two hundred pounds and he stands about six foot four
And it's hard to call Hank Williams Jr Jr anymore

But old Tex Ritter rode his horse and that was hell to pay

Jimmie Rodgers is the only reason that I'm standin' here today
And I ain't gonna call Hank Williams...

David Allan Coe,"Well I'm finally gettin' used to the water
The way the tarantulas bite

I only came here to watch the bulls fight

Tell my mother, ""I need a good lawyer""
Tell my father, ""I'm getting a tan""
My sleepy siesta down south of the border
Is taking more time than I planned

Oh Juanita somebody betrayed me
They've given me ten years to life
Juanita I need you to save me
I promise I'll make you my wife

I got a big house in Milwaukee
With a color TV and a pool
A Naugahyde bar and a Cadillac car
Juanita they're waiting for you

Tie the burro up down in the courtyard
To keep the guard busy tonight
When you bring my dinner make sure the tortilla
Is filled with a gun or a knife

Wisconsin is gonna love you
Yes, all of Milwaukee speaks Spanish
Of course you're gonna wear American shoes

You can say adios to the pigs and the goats
If you'll just do this one thing for me

But Juanita somebody betrayed me

Juanita I need you to save me
I promise I'll make you my wife

Juanita, I, I swear it was all a mistake
You see I was drowning out there in the ocean
And I saw this bale coming by man
So I grabbed it and I climbed up on top of it
And I found this stick and I rowed myself into shore

And when I got there
The border patrol was waiting for me
At the I didn't know what it was
I promise you if you'll just marry me
So I can become a citizen of Mexico

I'll take you to Milwaukee
You can meet all my friends
They got these big shiny motorcycles
And you can ride on the back of 'em with 'em

David Allan Coe,"Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know

She's the best thing in this life
Why she worships the ground that he walks on
She waits up for him at night and worries
Until he's safely home
And she always believes his stories about working overtime
And in twenty years beside him, cheating's never crossed her mind

Aw but it crossed his
Early last summer
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall 
He gave in
And now he wishes he could stop himself
But theres no easy way
So he lays down with his lover
And silently he prays

Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know

In his heart and soul
He knew that he was playing a game he could never win
But you know, forbidden fruit is sweet
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again
And now he's giving up on looking for a way to fight the feeling
So he prays this simple pray
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling

Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know",Now I Lay Me Down to Cheat

I felt a true love
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it

And I knew I wanted her for me

Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing

But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and he called me to his side

Take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

But it looks like every thing's gonna turn out all right
But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand

She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling

I had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dressed like 1950
Half drunk and hollow eyed
He said it's a long walk to Nashville 
Would you like a ride? Son

Well, I sat down in the front seat
He turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale 
When I asked him for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride

He said, ""Mister, can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues? Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?""
He said, ""Boy, can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
'Cause if you're big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride""

Then he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said, ""This is where you get off, boy
'Cause I'm goin' back to Alabam""
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac
I said, ""Mister, many thanks""
He said, ""You don't have to call me mister, mister

With a price tag on her body and a tombstone in her eye
You could tell she was not happy by the way she kept on staring
Past the other side of nowhere at a man she'd like to try
And the makeup she had painted could not hide the youthful motions
Of her body fom the music or the crowd
I started like all the others with my right hand in the pocket
While she showed us everything the law allowed

Twenty bucks an hour later my one bedroom apartment
I was feeling weak from all the seeds I'd sown
She was sweet she was gentle as she introduced my body
To some pleasures it had never ever known
When I woke up in the morning she was a laying there beside me
Like a kitten with her face turned to the sun
And a look of satisfaction on her lips that make me wonder
If she ever felt ashamed of what we'd done
So I left her in Atlanta...",Atlanta Song

And I don't believe I'd tell you if I knew
I'll be gone when the sun comes up tomorrow
I believe it's time to say goodbye to you
And it sure smells like snow in Bossier City

Than to spend another lonely night with you

Lives next door to the cemetery
How many lovers have you buried 
We would shout running scared
Along the green and golden paths 
That took us home away from Crazy Mary

In the lamplight burning low 
Dimly through enchanted woods
She rocks beside the fire 
That was never lit and as we ran on by
Pretending to be frightened 
We'd shout and laugh at Crazy Mary

She would never answer us 
Smiled through the window softly
Wild eyed and wild haired but we were sure 
That in the dark of night
She cursed us soundly casting spells 
And such to run us into donkeys
Crazy Mary from Londonderry...

So it seems that older now 
We stand upon this wind swept moor
The lonely grave before us testifies 
That Crazy Mary sings and dreams
Her dreams somewhere but not 
Where little kids can follow after

And on the stone these words dear friend 
Please write me down as one who loved
The raven haired and laughing lads 
That swore that they would marry me
And soon their sons came running by 
And here I lie forgotten Crazy Mary

Cussin' at my long hair 
And my talk of bein' free

David Allan Coe,"Last night she made it plain she didn't want me today I woke later and alone
Tomorrow I'll be turnin' to the bottle tonight I'll be cold and all alone
She only broke my heart Lord not my spirit she only took my body not my soul
My skin still burns in places where she touched me
And when she touched me Lord I lost my self-control
When she's got me where she wants me she don't want me
I'm just another game she likes to play
I don't think I can make it through tomorrow

Steep grade up ahead, slow me down, makin' no time,

Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio,
But I got to keep rollin'.

Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away, lookin' for a better way
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away, lookin' for a sunny day.

Well; the truck stop cutie comin' on to me,
Tried to talk me into a ride;
Said I wouldn't be sorry, but she was just a baby.

Busting broncos is more than just a way to make a living

And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry
Run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
Wonder Lord has every well I drilled ran dry
We were friends me and that old man
Like desperados waiting for the train 
Like desperados waiting for the train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells 
And an old school man of the world
Taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives was like some old western movie
Like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train

From the time that I could walk he take me with him
To a place called the Green Frog Cafe
There was old men with beer guts and dominos
Lyin' bout their lives while they'd play
And I was just a kid that they all called his sidekick
Like desperados waiting for the train 
Like desperados waiting for the train

Now I looked up and he was pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like some old men
Drinking beer and playing moon and 42
Like desperados waiting for the train 
Like desperados waiting for the train

Then just before he died I went to see him 
I was grown and he was almost gone
We just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
(Don't cry Jack it's only Jesus comin')

And just like you I wish that he would save me

Long before I turned into a man
Buried with our flag across his casket

David Allan Coe,"It's a fairytale morning, the ocean looks turquoise
As if it was painted that way
The waves how they rush from the shore or the island
It carries my vision away

The sun seems to blind that part of my mind
That's searching for yesterday's rhymes
It's the first day of something
And I wonder if it could be love

She lays there and tosses her head on the pillow
She peeks from the blanket to see
She looks like a child but acts like a woman
Whenever she reaches for me

Her touch burns my skin and that makes me frightened
She looks like a photograph there
Its the first day of something
And I wonder if it could be love

Yes, it's hard to believe I spent all this time here alone
Trying to forget the heartaches that broke up our home
Now they're gone

Why, she's seen it all, from the start to the fall
She knew I'd need some place to hide
My wife, she had taking the baby and left me
With all of this hatred inside

She's been my friend, she helped me get over
And now that I'm better I see
The first day of something
And I wonder if it could be love
",Fairytale Morning
David Allan Coe,"If I ever needed love, I need it now
Honey, why can't you see me through me
When I pretend that I'm to strong to bend?
This heart can mend a lover or a friend
Stop acting like you never knew me

How you fantasize, telling little lies
Fairy tales are all you ever see
Don't you realize how you hypnotize
Anyone who's fool enough to look back into your eyes?
And fall in love with you

If I ever wanted someone babe I need you now
Please don't place your self above me
Just out of reach when you could learn to teach
Me to begin loving you again
Why are you doing this to me?
",Fall in Love With You
David Allan Coe,"Hey, California you don't know me, New York City you can't show me
Anything I haven't seen at least a hundred times before
I still love you, New Orleans, Mississippi River Queen
?Cause when it comes to lovin' you beat all I've ever seen

And I've seen a lot of ladies in my time
I've had me a few women that were fine
Ah, but I don't need no city woman messin' with my mind
So goodbye San Francisco girl, I'm leavin' you behind

And I've had some senoritas down in Mexico
I met a few potatoes up in Idaho
I've had a few peaches in Georgia and that San Antoine rose
If the good Lord made any better that you
He's the only one who knows

I SPENT A LIFETIME IN PRISON BELIEVING ID NEVER GET OVER THE FALL

BUSTED FOR FIRST DEGREE I WAS TO BLIND TO SEE WHO WAS TO BLAME FOR IT ALL

SOME SAID THE DEVIL, BUT GOD ONLY KNOWS IF I PUT MY FUTURE IN HIM

OTHER FOLKS BET THAT ID NEVER GET ON MY FEET AGAIN



RUNNING AND JUMPING FREE AS A BIRD JUST LIKE A CHILD LEFT TO PLAY

FREEDOM WAS ONE MORE THING I TOOK FOR GRANTED UNTIL THEY TOOK IT AWAY



MARRIAGES BREAKUP AND SOME PEOPLE TAKE UP DRINKING TO MAKE THEM FORGET

BOTH OF THEM SWEARING, NEITHER ONE CARING WISHING THAT THEY NEVER MET

TAKING THE CHILD AWAY, WHO CARES WHAT CHILDREN SAY UNTIL THEY TURN INTO MEN

SOMEDAY YOU'LL SEE I'm GONNA BE ON MY FEET AGAIN



AND I LEFT MY STOMACH IN HOUSTON ON SOME SURGEONS KNIFE BUT I SLEEP THOUGH IT ALL

IN THE RECOVERY ROOM FATE DEALT THE CARDS TO SOON TAKING MY LEGS IN THE FALL

WHEEL CHAIRS TURN INTO CANES TILL I LEARNED TO WALK PLACES THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN

NOW THAT I'm FREE ITS GOOD TO BE ON MY FEET AGAIN




",On My Feet Again
David Allan Coe,"You know as a child, he heard tell of the seven mile bridge
That connected on marathon shore
Yes and it was the gateway key west his grandpa
Had told him ten times or more

The stories of some sailors curse on the bridge
Where it opens to let the boats through
But the natives all laugh at grandpas old stories
And swear that it just isn't true

Now most of them sail across to Miami
From the edge of the blue water line
With craw fish and snappers to sell at the market
For money to spend on some wine

They always cross through at the seven mile bridge
Except when the moon comes out full
They're not superstitious they tell you as they are
Repeating that old seaman's rule

Watch out for those outlaws and pirates
Lord knows that they'll steal you blind
Don't mess around with those cutthroats and thieves
They're robbers and killers of time

And there's nothing worse than an old sailors curse
On the seven mile bridge where you find
They're stealing the future and making believe
The past is still somewhere behind

The seven mile bridge, the seven mile bridge
And he found a woman who'd come here from Cuba
She gave him a son and a dream
They lived in a conch house somewhere on stock island

With the seven mile bridge in between
She'd spent her nights on the window walk wondering
If he'd safely pull through the storm
While he spent his money on painted up women

And whiskey to keep his blood warm
Then he'd gamble on crab races till he was broke
While she sat up waiting all night
Then felling too guilty to face her and tell her

He'd look for some bully to fight
At the end of the rainbow where the sun always shines
Just south of the seven mile bridge
She waits at the window for signs of his sailboat

And tries not to worried the kids
She sneaks a few drinks from the bottle she hides
From a husband that's to tired to think
With feelings of guilt she picks up the bottle

And pours the remains in the sink
Now she thinks of the men that stare at her boldly
They know she's a woman alone

With fingers that tremble she touches her body
And wishes her man would come home
Now the years pass so quickly for time is a thief
His skin looks like leather by now

His woman's got fat and lost all he
But, Lord, she's lived up to her vow
She looks at her son that's going on twenty
He's ready to live his own life

She hopes he can find a sea worthy woman
A sailor sure needs a good wife
Why he's just like his daddy
She thinks as she watches
Him weaving those fish nets all day

Knowing that some time the seven mile bridge
Will take him and lead him astray
He might return his woman would learn
Broke like his daddy and drunk

She wrote down some words on an old piece of sail cloth
Nailed it over his bunk
Why then, she packed his sea bag and filled up his trunk
His new wife would want it that way

Just before the old man shook the younger lads hand
These are the words he did say
",Seven Mile Bridge
David Allan Coe,"Sudden death, that's what you are
Loving you is like riding in a speeding car
They're fun to drive until you drive 'em to far
Sudden death, that's what you are

The way you love me, my heart starts to pumping
Just like a rabbit, hon, you really got me jumping
You must be out for blood the way that you've been humping
I'm just like putty in your hands

Your kiss of love still lingers here on my lips
You've got electric, honey, in your fingertips
I like the way your hair hangs down to your hips
I'm just like putty in your hands

David Allan Coe,"Standing in the bathroom with a gun in my hand
Pulling on the trigger just as fast as I can
I can hear her scream as she reaches for the lover beside her
Married by the Bible, she was only sixteen

I was fresh from prison trying to follow my dream
Who'd ever thought I'd be the judge and the jury that tried her?
Blood splattered all over the wall
The gun still smoking as I watch it fall

I run through the door while the sirens blow out on the highway
Maybe they'll catch me and maybe they won't
It really doesn't matter I just had to do things my way
Yeah, yeah, I might just commit suicide, yeah, yeah

He's the only man that I trusted with my life
I can't understand why he ran off with my wife
Now that they're dead what's gonna happen to the baby?
The state will have to raise her just the way they did me

Her mother wanted freedom and I just set her free
She should have never let me see that she was no longer a lady
She called out my name just before she died
She swore she loved me and I almost cried

With trembling hands I reached out and tried to save her

It's hard to get high when your feeling so low
And tomorrow is another day

Well, the mainsail broke on my fishing boat
And it's almost time for my rum and Coke
I'll fix it as soon as I have a smoke
Tomorrow is another day, yeah

So you go at night with your lantern bright
And you sit on the bridge and you get half tight
Ah, tonight you can't get the fish to bite
But tomorrow's another day, yeah, yeah

But by the time I got to Phoenix

Could it be you?
Hey vie got so much inside me to give

You'll have to burn

So you're on your way to Texas, girl
You're Amarillo bound
You told me when I picked you up someday
You'd let me down

If you ever think to write me
If you ever think to call
If you ever think of me at all
If you ever think of me at all

But you won't think about me much
And you won't even miss my touch
And you won't ever see my face at night

You are so intent on losing
That's the kind of life you're choosing
Now you've got me much too weak to fight

So you're on your way to Texas, girl
You're Amarillo bound
You told me when I picked you up someday

Play it for the shrimpers and the pirates out to sea
Play it for the hippies down in Mallory Square
If I'm not there, won't you play a song for me?

We all called her Little Orphan Annie at the playground
Merry go, merry go, merry go round
Till she picked her fiddle up, we always put her down
When she picked her fiddle up
They come for miles around to hear her play

David Allan Coe,"I told you from the start I couldn't give you my heart it belonged to someone else
I tried like hell but still we fell I guess we could not help ourselves
You sure felt good in my world little girl but it's time to draw the line
Cause there's a lady who's mine and she's not the kind to just die upon the vine
Rose knows something's going on Rose knows she's spending too much time alone
I suppose better get myself back home Rose knows something's going on

I'd love to stay here and lay down with you dear and hold you one more time
I wish it could be but unfortunately I've got roses on my mind
Rose knows something's going on

David Allan Coe,"The lady you see me with now and again in this dimly lit hideway place
With eyes deep as midnight and smooth golden skin
And that warm look of love on her face
And you say ain't he lucky just look at those eyes
She's worth any price you can name
And you think that she's mine but you don't realize
I'm just someplace to come when it rains
Someplace to hide when she's tired of the ride just someone to soften my pain
Lord knows where she plays on her warm sunny days
I'm just someplace to come when she can't find the sun
Just someplace to come when it rains

The lady she dances so close in your arms you swear she can float you away
And gives you the feeling you're safe from all harm
Just as long as she holds you that way
And I can't say it's wrong cause I've known all along
That her lovin' is worth all the pain
So whenever she leads I'll be there when she needs someplace to come when it rains
Someplace to hide when she's tired...

David Allan Coe,"Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised
Bought a motorcycle in his younger days
Rode into Kentucky to join the outlaw band
Fuzzy taught me how to make a livin' off the land
Fuzzy ran a tractor in the early mornin' dew
Taught me how to plant the crops, and showed me what to do
Stitch and Stew sat on the porch while Debbie fixed a meal
Turpentine my old brown horse was grazin' in the field

Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised

Fuzzy's hair was longer than the outlaws that I knew
Dirty blond and curly wearing pants of faded blue
A barefoot bearded swamp rat
But a man above all others
Never was the kind to turn his back upon his brothers

David Allan Coe,"I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said

He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

[Chorus]
Give my love to Rose please won't you mister
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
For it ain't right that she should live alone

Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

David Allan Coe,"Say I'm easy come
Easy go 
And easy to love when I stay

This old highway
Is hotter than nine kinds of hell
And the rice is as scarce as the rain
When you're down to you last shuck
With nothing to sell
And you're too far away from the train

It's been a good month of Sundays 
And a guitar ago
I had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a long line of friends
Some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind

Hey ride me down easy Lord
Ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come
Easy go 
And easy to love when I stay

Alright

I've seen fire on the mountain
I raised hell on the hill
I locked horns with the devil himself
I've been a rodeo bum
I'm a son of a gun
And a hobo with stars in his crown

So won't you ride me down easy Lord
Ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come
Easy go 
And easy to love when I stay

David Allan Coe,"You've painted up your lips
And rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating
Going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall
Tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

It wasn't me
That started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go
And do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that
I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby I still need some company

Its hard to love a man 
Whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age 
Ruby I realize,
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I not around
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

She's leaving now cause
I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it
Some hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun
And put her in the ground

David Allan Coe,"How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find
Once rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was winning in fortune and fame
Everything I could wish for to get a start in life's game
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money won't buy back your youth when you're old
A friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

My friends and my loved ones will weep, there's no doubt
But one things for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind",A Satisfied Mind

Draws circles around the block

If hell make it till it gets dark

That old time feelin'
Comes and goes in the rain
Like an old man with his checkers
Dying to find him a game

That old time fellin'
Plays for beer in a bar
Like an old blues time picker
Who don't recall who you are

That old time fellin'
Limps through the light on a crutch
Like an old soldier a wonderin'

David Allan Coe,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

David Allan Coe,"Used to go with my grandpa up to the town square
Set him down up there on a picnic bench
And he used to play checkers with them other old menup there
They used to tell stories bout when they were kids
Grandpa says he shot the Chief of Police when he was nine years old
I believe it
Cause they tell me Harlan Knetucky was the baddest place in the world
Why they say they used to sit out there on their front porch
Shoot them revenuers when they'd come down the hollow
Said they was so young took two of them boys
To hold the rifle and one to pull the trigger
Well grandpa he'd lie a little bit
But I'll tell you there's a lot of stories in Harlan County

Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord they knew that we were poor
They always called my daddy Preacher Dan
But daddy weren't no preacher least ways I don't recallect
Never hear of papa talk of nothin' but the land
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer yes he was
Could not read nor write Lord he could barely sign his name
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer all his life someday when I'm grown I'll be the same

Well he always grew tobacco though he did not smoke himself
He had the best tobacco crop around
And he never touched a drop of liquor that I can recall
Papa made his livin' on the ground
Yes Sunday go to meetin' called for more than he could stand
I guess he felt at home in his old clothes
But he never missed a Sunday takin' mama to the church
Maybe it was habit Lord but heaven only knows
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer...

David Allan Coe,"On Sunday after church there'd always be a picnic
There'd be kinfolks callin' until dawn
Me I'd play the guitar and my Uncle Merle would sing
And grandpa he'd play that fiddle all night long
Now the women folk they would work out in the kitchen
You could smell that food for miles and miles around
Paw he was prayin' my brother Jack would bring him down some moonshine
Just so's that he could warsh those viddle down
As soon as all the kids got tired of playin' horseshoes
Mama she'd call me over to her side
You know she'd say I'd like to take some pictures
You could see her face light up with pride
And then she'd bring out that worn out family album
Its faded pictures some with corners torn
She'd laugh and poin and tell me funny stories
And look she'd say why that's the day that you were born
And I'd sit and reminisce each picture with her
And I'd listen to her laughter and her sighs
But underneath I knew how much I'd hurt her
For I'd put teardrops in my mama's eyes

In my mama's eyes I've never done a wrong thing
I was still a baby in my mama's eyes
That old family album she'll keep on her night stand
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies

Through all those years in prison she stuck by me
And she came to visit anytime she could
Well I remember at my trial when she testified she loved me
And she told the judge I'd always been so good
Then later through the fame she watched me blossom
From just a local country singer to a great big star
She listened to all my records for the hidden meanings
And she came to hear me sing in all those dim lit bars
And she read all the things they wrote about me
But she knew deep in her heart that it was lies
No she don't hide her head in shame when someone says my name
You'll find no teardrops in my mama's eyes
In my mama's eyes...
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies",Family Album
David Allan Coe,"If grandpa was alive right now there ain't no tellin' what he'd have to say
Why he had fifteen wives a living with him all when he finally passed away
And though I've just got two now mama that's enough to keep me satisfied
I haven't had a son yet but the good Lord knows the three of us have tried
Cause the Pennsylvania Dutch that we once spoke has been forgotten
And the Mormon way of life is almost gone
But now and then we gather down in Salt Lake City to raise our voices in a joyful song
And we sing Heavenly Father Holy Mother keeper of our children tiller of the land
Take us to the river in a horse and buggy
Give us our salvation help us make our stand

No ma'am I did not go to see the Reverend Brigham Young while I was there
But I'm sure glad to know you wanted him to mention my name in a prayer
I hope he did not preach about the young folks that refused to make the change
Cause if he did I'm sure I got a little more than my share of the blame
Cause the Pennsylvania Dutch...

Once a week is all it takes to make the music play
Melody is just some childhood lullaby her mother used to sing to her
And the road down to the city goes right by Maria's door
I often walk right by her house on my way to the store
Up there where those Italian mothers dress their shivering bambinos for the rain
She tells me about Jesus and all his gallant men I tell her about fantasy
Maria she's this lady on my way down to the river Maria she's a mystery

David Allan Coe,"My daddy was an honest man, just a redneck Georgia farm boy
My momma spent her short life, raisin' kids and bailin' hay
And I was just fifteen when I ached inside to wonder
So I hoped a freight in Waycross and I rode it to L.A.

Well, I met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Maybel Joy
Destitution's child, born on a L.A. street called Shane
And sleep came and left this little Waycross Georgia country boy
Maybel Joy was gone, Lord, I'd never see her again

Growin' up came quietly in the arms of Maybel Joy
Laughter found our morning's, brought new meaning to my life
I woke up one day, Lord to find that I was by myself
With dreams of Georgia cotton and California wine

Sunday mornin' found me standin' 'neath the red-light of her door
Right 'cross sent me reelin', laid me face down on the floor
In place of Maybel Joy I found a merchant mad marine
Who said, ""Your Georgia neck is red but son you're still green""

Well, I turned twenty one in gray rock federal prison
The judge, he had no mercy on this Waycross, Georgia boy
Sometimes at night in silence, Lord, I'd listen
That same old freight to take me back to Maybel Joy

Cold nights had no pity on this Waycross, Georgia farm boy
Springtime turned to summer and then the winter came
Starin' at those four gray walls in silence, Lord, I'd listen
Somewhere in the distance to the whistle of the train

Sunday morning found me lying 'neath the red light of her door
With a bullet in my side I cried, ""Have you seen Maybel Joy?""
Stunned and shaken someone said, ""Son, she don't live here no more""
She left this town ten years ago, I heard she's looking for

And I will spend them all with you
Then beyond forever, I will wait for you

Just can't wait to get on the road again

And I cant wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way, is on the road again

Just cant wait to get on the road again

There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you (How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung 'round her by the score
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store

Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train (Left it all and caught a train)

I think you only live to see the lights of town.
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
When the lights have lost their glow, you're gonna cry, cry, cry.

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: ""Bye, bye, bye,""
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you.
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
I'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me there,
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.",Cry Cry Cry
David Allan Coe,"I hear that train a-commin', it's rollin' around the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me

Well if that freed me from this prison
and that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away",Folsom Prison Blues
David Allan Coe,"Hey porter! Hey porter! Would you tell me the time
How much longer will it be 'til we cross
That Mason--Dixon Line
At daylight would ya tell that engineer
To slow it down
Or better still just stop the train
'Cause I wanna look around
Hey porter! Hey porter! What time did ya say
How much longer will it be till I can
See the light of day?
When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer
To ring his bell
And ask everybody that ain't asleep
To stand right up and yell

Hey porter! Hey porter! It's getting light outside
This old train is puffin' smoke
And I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he will 
Blow his whistle please
'Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
And I feel that Southern breeze

Hey porter! Hey porter! Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now
That we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make that
Lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home 
So take it easy on the steam

Hey porter! Hey porter! Please open up the door
When they stop the train I'm gonna get off first

And I didn't mind the fare

David Allan Coe,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Where the buffalo roam,
Where the deer and the antelope play.
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

Home, home on the range,
Where the deer and the antelope play.
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

How often at night,
When the heavens are bright
With lights from the glittering stars,
Have I stood here amazed
And asked, as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of ours.

Oh give me a land
Where the bright diamond sand
Flows leisurely down the stream;
Where the graceful white swan
Goes gliding along
Like a maid in a heavenly dream.

Then I would not exchange
My home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play.
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
David Allyn,"I sit alone in the golden daylight,
But all I see is a silver sky,
For in my fancy I sweep away light,
And keep my image of the sky,
Just the way we like it, you and I.

All through the day I dream about the night,
I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,
Until the time when I'm here with you.

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you,
The evening mist melts away,
Down smiles the moon, And soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day.",All Through the Day
David Allyn,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be

David Allyn,"It all comes back to me now, 
A starry summer sky,
A laughing you and I, alone.
It all comes back to me now, 
A sea of midnight blue,
Your face uplifted to my own.

We called it a thrill of the moment, 
And blamed the moon up above,
We didn't know what the glow meant,
We never dreamed it might be love.
It all comes back to me now, 
The love I threw away,
And now each lonely night I pray, 
That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now
David Allyn,"Only last Saturday,
Or was it yesterday?
I was rehearsing a speech,
Really, I think it's a peach!
Hope you don't think it's a breach
Of recognized etiquette,
(I'm from Connecticut!)
You see the state I'm in,
I mean I'm in a mess!
What was that speech?
Oh yes, yes!

I like the likes of you,
I like the things you do,
I mean I like the likes of you!

I like you're eyes of blue,
I think they're blue, don't you?
I mean I like your eyes of blue!

Oh dear, if I could only say what I mean,
I mean if I could mean what I say,
That is, I mean to say that I mean to say that,

I like the likes of you,
You're looks are pure de-luxe,
Looks like I like the likes of you!

Oh dear, if I could only say what I mean,

David Allyn,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
David Allyn,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
David Alvarado,"Turning towards a time so free
Justice has finally escaped
The dripping words of yesterday
Set my feeble mind astray
I yearn to see
The glow of her eyes as I appear
A sign of satisfaction
Could be the sweetest sound
The staircase has one too many steps
I've already started back down
Come on
I love the caterpillars
Munching on the leaves
Pitter patter
Makes me forget my disease
Bugs have feelers just like me
And I'm feelin' oh so lonely
Disturbed in every sense of grace
The lady wouldn't give me a taste
Of the joy that means that much
It lives within her touch
Why won't you be my friend
I would love to hold you tonight
Even if we just pretend
Why won't you be my friend
Why
Why won't you be my friend
I would love to hold you tonight
Even if we just pretend
Why won't you be my friend
Be my friend
I'd love to meet the one
Who broke my heart
I know she'd melt me with her dance
Her subtle colors, her sweet smile
But it's a shame
She'll never get that chance",The Quest
David Amaya,"Si tan solo pudiera volver

Soy aquel que grita en silencio y con angustia por amor 
Si es tu imagen la que viene a mi cabeza 
Y si de algo en mi alma pesa 
Saber que he decidido que este amor termino 

Se que anduve un poco loco, casi pierdo la razón 
Como un mar que ya no encuentra ni la tierra 
Hoy la vida me condena 
Los días son tan grises para mi 
Y es así

Volver el tiempo atrás para poder volver a sentir 
Y llenar el calendario 
De cosas que a diario nos hicieron tan feliz 

Se que fui el arquitecto del fracaso de este amor 
Construyendo un abismo infinito de mentiras 
Y traiciones Llenando de rencores el perdón de los dos 

Fuimos jueces y abogados de esta causa sin razón 
Un verdugo despiadado en su condena 
Si han dictado la sentencia 
El castigo en la conciencia vivirá y quedara 

Volver el tiempo atrás para poder volver a sentir 
Y llenar el calendario 
De cosas que a diario nos hicieron tan feliz 

Volver, si el tiempo nunca sabe comprender que es perder 
Y si en todos estos años, 
Seguro te hice daño y te mentí por no sufrir

David Archuleta,"I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time deep inside
It was a rush, what a rush

'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
It's just too much, just too much

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I've just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying and trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy
Goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl, are we just friends?
Is there more, is there more?

And do they know, the places where we go
When we're grey and old
'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed

And I feel that love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

We were apart, but your heart never let go
So thank you for showing me with one look
What used to be and still is a possibility...

I can see it in your eyes
You feel the same about us as I
There is no way the truth can be disguised
You're still in love with me
You were never really out of love with me
Your eyes don't lie
Your eyes don't lie",Your Eyes Don't Lie

If I just had one more
Dollar in my pocket
Know that I've felt the same

How many times have you dreamed

Wishing my life was a little bit clearer

That it's just not your day
Like the world is against you

I didn't know which floor to get off on, hey

At least I took a chance
I had to let it go

Until your feet are back on the ground

It's an endless ride
Sometimes it takes you up
Sometimes it tears you down inside
But it's the butterflies
That keep you feeling so alive, so alive
You gotta get back that high

And in my dream last night
The doors they finally shut and I was there, somewhere
Alone in my reality inside an empty box
That's filled with air
But I don't care, no

Next time I'll get it right
Next time I'll be okay
I'll have a different dream tonight
Tomorrow's another day

What you don't expect will come and find you

If you run and hide

I know it's gonna find me
I've got nothing to win, I've got nothing to lose
Just trying to walk in my own two shoes
Gotta take some time now
It's time for me to find out who I am

Something happened for the first time deep inside
It was a rush, what a rush

'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
It's just too much, just too much

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I've just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying and trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy
Goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl, are we just friends?
Is there more, is there more?

See it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe that we can make this into something that will last
Last forever, forever

Tear apart the weakest of hearts, up here you'll be safe in my arms.

Reaching heights like never before.
Nothing can touch us, we're everything, we're everything and more.

Let's try holding each other, found a love to last forever.
Up here gives you wings to stay strong, ooh.
The air is pure that we're breathing.
We're something to believe in, 'cause I feel it's where we both belong.

David Archuleta,"Tell me what you did to me
Just there beneath my feet
Didn't even notice we were miles above the ground

I'm not afraid of heights
We crashed into the sky
Didn't know that I could feel the way that I do now

I'm not asking for an explanation
All I know is that you take me away
And you show me how to fly

Nothing brings me down when you're around
It's like zero gravity
The world just disappears when you're here
It's zero gravity

When things get messed up
You lift my head up
And I get lost in the clouds
There's no sense of time with you and I
It's zero gravity

The edges fade away
'Til there's no more shades of gray
You only have to whisper anything at all

You opened up my eyes
You turned my lows to highs
And that's the only way that I know how to fall

Not gonna analyze or try to fight it
Don't even care if it makes no sense at all
'Cause with you I can fly

Nothing brings me down when you're around
It's like zero gravity
The world just disappears when you're here
It's zero gravity

When things get messed up, you lift my head up
And I get lost in the clouds
There's no sense of time with you and I
It's zero gravity

You make it so easy to just drift away
I can't imagine being without you

Don't think about it, don't think about
Don't think about, don't think about

Don't think about it

Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake
To guide the future, as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know
His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.

Be still, my soul: the hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord.
When disappointment, grief and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.

Do your eyes continue sparkling?

And I-I never want to open up your eyes, everything's broken.

Or what reason there is to be strong.

Doing what's right is so wrong.

Across the sand so I may keep

David Arkenstone,"Once upon a long night after a hard cry
Somewhere in Bethlehem
A baby graced the silence sweetly he's crying
I am Emmanuel

Then angels gave him music, shepherds gave reverence
And a message to the land
A widow held him cherish the God
Who became a man

But oh, Lamb of God, oh, Prince of peace
What tribute shall I bring to worship Thee
I have no gold to lay at Your feet
So Lamb of God I offer me

Can You see the wise men? A star did guide them
Searching all the earth
Till they found the one child the very godchild
Who ruled the universe

Did they know the lady's little baby
Was God in fully man
And everything they gave him he himself
Had made with his hands

But oh, Lamb of God, oh, Prince of peace
What tribute shall I bring to worship Thee
I have no gold to lay at Your feet
So Lamb of God I offer me

I bring You all my hopes
I bring You all my dreams
I give You all my soul

David Arnold,"All I wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two
Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one

We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight, let the flight begin

I don't want to waste a waking moment; I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you
In my time I've said these words before, but now I realize
My heart was telling me lies, for you they're true

They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?

Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
 
Nobody does it better sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do

It whistled through the pines

And she told me goodbye

And like smoke up the chimney

I wonder, if you're happy now or sad like me
Living in the shadows of what used to be

[Chorus]

You don't have to worry, if I still love you
Just give me a second chance, I'll prove I do
Didn't take my heart too long to realize
I was such a fool to let you say goodbye

[Chorus]

Yeah, the door is always open, just walk on through
There'll always be somebody, waiting here for you",Don't Think Twice
David Ball,"I was sitting on top of the world
Deep in love with a blue-eyed girl
But the blue-eyed girl told me goodbye
I fell like rain drops out of the sky

Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart

I took my love for Sally Ann
And I buried if deeper than a chinaman
Where no one goes and no one can see
There ain't nobody here but me

Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart

One day true love's gonna set me free
But till then i'll be here deep in misery

Down at the bottom of a broken heart
You will find her name
Written on a block of stone
That once was a burning flame
Now it's cold, lonely and dark
Way down here at the bottom of a broken heart

David Ball,"I did some honky tonk healin' to get me over you
It took some neon nurses around the clock to pull me through

Well thank you for callin' is all I can say

David Ball,"I made my plans to leave you far behind
To put you in my past and get you off my mind
So I took your memory on a midnight ride
Down a dark and long back road and left it there to die
But

Look what followed me home
I thought I was here all alone
But your memory is coming back to me
I thought I'd left it behind
And had you off my mind
But I see I was wrong, wrong, wrong
Look what followed me home

I walked down to the river at the break of dawn
With a picture of you darling up underneath my arm
I said, ""The heartache's over, today is your last day""
And I thanked that muddy water as it carried you away

Look what followed me home
I thought I was here all alone
But your memory is coming back to me
I thought I'd left it behind

But baby don't forget how I get when I get lonely
Well I ain't strayed a little bit

That little red Corvette with a for sale sign
Laid my money down and walked out the door
Wondering what a pickup man wants a convertible for

For you blue eyes five foot two
For you I do the crazy things I know I really shouldn't oughta do
I've either lost touch with reality or I've found a dream come true
I'd climb the Himalayas swim a river full of gators for you

I got a fishing rod and a set of golf clubs
Just sittin' in a corner collecting dust
I'm a certified lunatic some might say
It wouldn't mean a thing to me to give them all away

Somewhere far away from here by train or plane or ship

No it's not for pleasure but I'll tell you since you asked
I'm going someplace to forget someplace her memory won't show up
So far everywhere I've been hasn't been quite far enough
Is there a rocket to the moon I haven't been there yet
I just need to leave real soon I'm going someplace to forget

No there's not much luggage just this old suitcase of mine
Things that make me think of her I've got to leave behind

Thought if you never own nothing much, nothing ever owns you
Until I looked at you I swear I never gave one thought to forever

Comes up behind my chair
Helps me with a hand or two

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

Sippin' Hiptnoiq and Hennessy, yeah we call it Incredible Hulk
Cause I gotta' get that bud, when I'm up in the club

Sick, with a little dro', sick, with a little dough
Sick, with a little flow make you love it a lot
Quick cause I gotta' do it
And I gotta' rep for the rich and the little po' ho tuggin' on the block
Chicks in the mink sit in the back seat when I'm on a strip and I roll in the drop
Sip a little bit of 'gac dip a little when I whip the Cadillac truck throwin' it up
And we gotta' put it down and keep it pimpin' 'til they cannot deny
Just grab yo' bottles and keep sippin', throw your hands in the sky

Better get it, better grip if you ain't know that we only messin' with the hoes
Better know wassup, better pour a little 'gac in my glass
While I'm watchin all the bitches like a pimp while I'm holdin' my cup
Now watch me pour just a little bit of 'gac out for my homies
Throw it back OUT, with a little shorty, blow her back OUT, like a PIMP, playa

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Helps to make the season bright, yeah
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

While you yap bout yo gold

That bitch bought me a boat
See she bought me a car
And it's lookin' like yours
Only difference is my nigga, I got wood on the doors
I got wood on my wheel
And I'm bustin' my steel

David Banner,"[Intro: David Banner talking]
Yo mo' (more)
I went to see a friend of mine the other day
Ya know what I'm talkin' bout? (huh, I'm drunk)
She said, ""Banner, you need to harmonize (harmonize) and hide""
Yeah, okay
But I asked her I was like, ""How can a nigga be a fucking snitch?!""
Fucking snitch, bitch-ass
You don't even snitch on yo' fucking enemies, you coward-ass nigga
Kill those niggaz (I'm really, really high)
Ain't no respect to the game no mo' (more)
Niggaz is bitches (niggaz is bitches)

[Chorus: David Banner] - (Repeat 2X)
I done lost my love for the game
Shit'll never be the same
I'll never lose my love for the streets (the streets)
The streets got love for me
Might of lost my love for the game (game)
Niggaz don't even act the same
I'll never lose my love for the streets
Cause the streets got love for me (me)


[Verse 1: David Banner]
I hit the block before it's sunrise
I want to know where you bitch niggaz went and hide (yeh)
Went to sleep, open my eyes then I realize (yeh!)
Time to serve em weak, clock her ass and mash out
Get ya cash out, why ya motherfuckers sleep and ya passed out?
I'm in the hood tryin' to make a G before nine (9:00)
Five thirty (5:30) took a break, and I'm back on the grind
Four ten (4:10)
Put some dro in the wind then
Let it go cause ya know that a nigga gone
Tell she if a nigga get busted
Niggaz can't be trusted in the game cause shit ain't the same
Motherfuckers want me to blow out they brain (I done lost)
Shit cocked and blast
Put some lead in a motherfucker fast
Never play wit a gun, if ya can't stop that (stop that)
Or get that in ya motherfucking ass

[Chorus: David Banner] - (Repeat 2X)

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Took a chance when I came in
Did my time if I got caught
If I lost, it was my fault
Took the blame for the whole thing
And it was the work, it was my walk
To do or double wit the plot then
Let a nigga fellin' boxed in
I was slangin' in my socks then
On the corner flippin' 20's
Tryin' to turn em into 50's
On the ten speed right in front of walk in
It's no hood where I came from
Where a nigga got his game from
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm the same one
To pull a strap out my backpack
Cock the hammer back (clack!)
Duck and get ya brains hung
And shake the cop up when the block clear
Cause the drama doesn't stop here
Gotta watch for ya own peers
Nigga damn near ain't knowin' who the fuck I am
And you ain't knowin' how I got here
See we don't speak and we don't do nothin'
It's on you if you slang things
Get your money, homie, maintain
Keep yo' motherfucking mouth shut, dawg
Or you'll get offset and this a cold game
And snitch-niggaz never last long
So snitch-niggaz get yo' ass on
A snitch-nigga get yo' mask on
Took the pledge on my own hand
Then killed a rose motherfucker in my last song

Ain't no tellin' where I'll end up
I got shows to rock and hoes to fuck
Ain't no tellin' where I might go
Coast to Coast or just next do' (door)

Eh, eh, (I gots to go) eh (go), eh, eh, eh (gotta go)

[Verse 1: David Banner]
Roll up on that tour bus, smokin' a blunt
Then heard a (dunn dunn dunn dunn dunn!) what yo' baby momma want?
Nothin' but good fuckin' dick suckin' train runnin'
She lickin' on my nuts, talk to her if she hear me comin'
Watchin' me go
She swallowed cum, you kissed a hoe
Tongue and lip, all
Man you really lickin' my balls
Heard you for my baby momma last night nigga, nah
But she did bring weed, no seeds, sticks all
I'm lyin' when she come over, cock lyin' in her jaw
Niggaz all up in her drawers
And that's yo' baby mother
If it makes you feel better, she's a good dick sucker (sucker)

My Job takes me out of town on all-expense paid
Wakin' up with a hangover 2,000 miles away
It seems easy: weed, women, and wine
Four hours of sleep is all you get - now it's time
To tally hoe to the show, a yo, yo let it go
Bust through the do' (door), rag & flow and grab my hoe
And get back in the van with some titties in hand
Let her meet ya new friend, who's willing to spend
The whole night? Another flight another gig another city
Touchin' on somebody's baby momma's titties
Niggaz in the lobby wonderin' where their women are
Third floor havin' a ""Let's Become a Bitch Seminar""
Can't get attached, I got a plane to catch
I wish I could a hit that but I'll be back

I'm paper chasin' and rap hustlin' it ain't no synonym
My money ain't a game so I ain't worried bout winnin' it
I'm worried bout makin' it, stackin' it and spendin' it (and spendin' it)
Ain't no pretendin' it don't make the world move
Same way you can't pretend my shit don't make yo' girl groove
See, God work in myterious ways but I don't (don't)
And the devil will make a deal wit yo' ass but I won't (won't)
Now you can have the cleanest paint job on ya trucks
Six T.V.s, wood wit leather seats, stitched and tucked
The biggest chrome rims, playa, I don't give a fuck
If I holla at yo' bitch, guarantee she gettin' buck
You can yell and you can scream and you can fuss and you can fight
Like it's the worst night in yo' life, to me it's just another night

When I did that bullshit and got caught you got my ass out
You was that girl that would set that nigga up
I was the man that would wet that nigga up now fuck with me
And you did when they came to the crib
You grabbed the tech and started bussin' at a bitch aww shit, baby
You was my lady when the laughed at my clothes
In the front row when them hoes boo'd at my shows
And its cool cause you helped me through school
'95 selling weed in baton rough
And you stayed strong with a pimp trick
Whipped it out and sucked a niggaz dirty dick, aww shit
Baby I'm sorry lets start brand new
The world against us all along us two
All the shit I done took you through
I'm a grown man now

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: David Banner]
The second verse is for my momma you could truly serve a bowl
You were strong when daddy was gone
Fuck a nice home
When I was dying as a baby, momma boo you stay true
I heard you whisper to the lord, let my child make it through
And I did I walked up in this bitch first born kid
Tell 'em fuck it billy went and hit a lick (Ha ha ha)
You were there when the times were hard
You're a blessing from the heavens not a breed by god
And if I die momma swallow the pain
I leave this earth with your blood up in my veins
Let it flow free, let it kill me
But its on, and the way we ridding caddies
Screaming out lil jones

You murdered, up in Texas where killin' is such a sin
The first month you in office you started killin' again
But shit, we just some niggas and that's how the game go

Y'all took us up out the state moved us straight out to Death Row
Y'all may of, made us slaves but never make us your hoe
God, you my pimp so let's start exposin' these hoes
y'all judges some weak pussies, y'all preaches some rapin' fags

God I know that we pimp
God I know that we wrong
God I know why she talk about Moet all of my songs
I know these kids are listening
I know I'm here for a mission
But it's so hard to get 'em wit 22 rims all glisten
I know these balls are talking
Lord I want to do right
I tried to fight but these demons they comp at me at night
Like my momma, my daddy, my girl and all my boys
I lost Rachelle but I guess I still got the whining Roy
My couzins sweet, momma lay that Jason
Lord I'm praying for swacking my heart is still impatient
Keep 'em off them drugs, far away from thugs
He's still my hero but just a shell bed or what it was
Yeah smoking get a buzz, but God I hear ya calling
And shit wrong wit balling
But my soul is just stelly [steadily] balling
And the sex and the dead, and the other jail
God I'm stacking my mail but will I end up in hell?

Lord they hum Andre Jones
Lord they hum Reynold Johnson
Lord I want to fight back but I'm just so sick of bouncing
Lord I'm sick of jumping, Lord just please tell me something
My folks still dumping my music, bumping but I feel nothing
My heart is stelly pumping
My heart is stelly breaking
Sometimes I feel like I'm faking, man
I'm so sick of taking
Maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn
Maybe Earth is telling just a place for us to learn
Bout yo love, yo will and grace
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born in the first place
Maybe this first base, God knocked the ball up out the park
So we can come home this world right here is feeling so dark
Feeling so cold, Lord I'm feeling so old
I dunno if I can take this world right here no more

That you were gonna give me some

Hey baby girl what's your name who you with?
Do you do wanna get down with this pimpin' lil' trick

Choose me big banner the back beater
The dubz can't fit on the truck they caught fevers
25 inches I can clear the benches
Or we can go up and down like them rug bitches
Let them hatin' witches they gonna wish for hate
But they all scream damn while you masturbate

The worm on the hook, I can whip and cook
Hit the block with chunky socks while you hit the books
I make that sacrifice like Jesus preachers on them lames
I'm true with how I feel, no fingers crossed this ain't no game
But you a pimp mayn, I promise you'll that I can change
Like a chameleon the colors on your rings n' thangs

You can have what you want
(You can have what you want)
If you give me what I need

I know you have a lot of options
(So many other ways)
But baby you belong with me

Poke your girl up in the throat
And make her swallow the nut

Song: So Trill
Album: Mississippi:The Album

Bread and water..This what it comes down to

[Verse 1]
I remember when these kids got killed up in Pearl
Is it the end of the world? Grown men acting like bitches
Bitches actin' like men, and it's all good
As long as all these records keep sellin'
Niggaz time cut so these snitches keep tellin'
Y'all know it ain't right..
And I ain't bending for these hoes
Is this the part when my God comes back and starts throwin' elbows?
Man these children gone astray, and no daddies in the home
So they turn to gun play, or they just turn gay
Half-bit like they rich broke, niggaz swisha sweet
So I sit, in a lac and just smoke,stayin' down in the street
Vernon Dixon? Georgetown in the hills
The subs and the boys in Hattiesburg so trill
The delta and coast, the queens is what I boast
But these kids in the south is what a nigga love the most

{Bridge}
Damn, the kids is what a nigga loves most
Fuck, so trill..

[Hook 2x]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)

[Verse 2]
I remember when the twin towers fell
Did the boys in the G know, or just didn't tell?
I ain't forgot about Gore, and them trick ass ballots
Numbers tossed around in the mix like a salad
Or a bird in the Bush
Or a brother up in office tryna give a big push
Y'all don't try to praise God now
He been watchin from the jump, I'ma crunk
Quick to pull the sawed pump, skull and bones y'all can kill me
I'ma G, and the world is gon' feel me
Bet you neva thought the truth would come straight from the middle of Mississippi
So P-Boy keep pushin'..
We some big ones,life would street, man we all on a mission

[Hook 2x]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)

[Verse 3]
This for my boys in the pen and my thugs on the county farms
If it's war then I swear I'm gonna raise them arms
And come and getcha, send me a kite...
And I promise that I'll write ya back or smoke a fat sack in ya name
I ain't no bitch or no hoe or no trick
Tryna ride a nigga dick just to make a quick hit
I ain't writin' love songs for prissy bitches
I make songs for the queens who lost sight in the hood
Mayne I made some bullshit but it's good
And if ya see me then you see this shit across my chest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest

[Hook until fade]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)

David Banner,"See, all we need is a couple, let's go act up

Quarter backin', mackin' hoes pullin' ass from the bars
Run it back to the truck, let her suck on a swish
That got me runnin' on the duck, give a fuck, she's a sista

Let her play her position and my mission is to cut
Dat really be blunt man get my dick sucked
Hut one, Hut two then she hiking my balls
Send her back to the club with your bitch on the wall, fuck boy

But he don't really want 'em he got bitches in L.A.
And he's like I can fuck 'em [unverified] every other day

So come and get your lotion let's do some oil of olay
Girl come out to the truck or scurry yo' ass away

You whinin' and you moanin', I'm never given her no slack
You run around the corner, I run her out on the track

Or bring her nigga money and make up 100 stash
When she gets to all that chick I came to [unverified] push her packs
Everyday, till I day I'm a Mississippi mad mack

Got mine, got wine to make 'em act up

(David Banner)
I'm hittin you bitches,
With choppas, running from helicopters and duckin the feds,
Thirsting for blood, ready for war, I'm wanting you dead.
I want that nigga to come that shit, so I can get it back and go beat that bitch.
Teach that snitch, about that south; the place where we woulda putta bullet in your mouth.
Take your doe, take your cash, and let the grim reaper come and take your ass,
Imma slow it down cause I'm goin to fast, Imma slow it down to fast.
This the last time that I'm gonna remind you niggas, Imma cock back and put a hot dime in you niggas.
That's ten shots, ten pops from a fucking glock, I wanted peace, but now my piece is clearing out the block.
Knock, Knock. Who is it? Bitch, call me David Ban.
The man with a plan to put your ass in some land.
Bitch!!!

Chorus

Verse 2
(B.G.)
Nigga, where I'm from,
All we do is kill and hustle,
If you come slippin without that pistol, you in trouble.
I'd insult niggas, on a block that got they're stash took,
The niggas who took it turned around and got his ass busted.
I'm out here, half the time I don't sleep.
How Imma sleep when I'm in the streets and I got beef.
On my block it's war; we live like we in Pakistan,
I got the mac in my pants, and I got crack in my hands.
I give it how you want it; I take it how it come.
They say you live by the gun, and you die by the gun
I been a little soldier; I been a little beast.
I'm even wilder, I got Soldier Slim livin through me.

Chorus

Verse 3
(David Banner)
When I pray, I don't know what to say.
Just beg to the Lord to let me see another day.
A AK totter, 1st quarter, 50 through *****
Sweat on my palms, bomb ass weedwill keep me calm.
Strap on my arm, the streets is feeling like Vietnam,
Murdering Uncle Toms, I'm crunk like I'm Lil' John
Imma wizard waving a wand, your bodies up in my palm
If you kill me flex, hit the block and go take care of my moms nigga.
(B.G.)
My mom ashamed of me, I'm in the game now.
I tell her momma don't trip, it's too late to change now.
I'm on the block with it, I'm in the club with it.
Wherever you catch me at I'm ready to bust with it.

David Banner,"I'm from a place
Where you gotta let yo' nutz hang
Where them crakas used to cut your stomach open
Just to let your fuckin' guts hang

Right there in front of the kids
I might as well split your wig
'Cause that's just what the master did

But now I'm the new Nat Turner
Spreadin' something to the kids
Like Sojourner, man, the truth

Fuck a 'Creek, I care
But you in doubts and go ""Woof""
He ain't dead, what pledge
There's a stank up in the Bush

Or a stank up in the White House
Shootin' board bullshit, man, it's dead props
Here in Chicago but hit this hi-lo
Warriors come play, click the bottles

Cock them AK's, bust on KK's
With the knuckle boy or the other two and the Stic-Man
Given dead on your shirt like a wristband
You a grown man, nigga, stand tall

Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?
Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?
Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog?

Country boys, city boys
Cadillacs, Rolly Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, now that we ridin'

Yo, niggas is not original
Niggas follow the radio
Niggas think if you blow
Then you gotta be on the TV show

Crackas is hypocritical
Crackas will rob and shit on you
'Cause see you do what they do
They know freedom is powerful

Niggas is very visual
If we see it, we think it's true
Very few niggas make a move
And even less'll see it through

Crackas make up the chemicals
Then they call us the criminals
Crackas make all the loot
And we just get the residuals

Niggas will rob and shoot on you
Crackas will drop a bomb on you
Niggas is having funerals
Crackas is having barbecues

Niggas sing the blues
That's reminicin' the spiritual
But when you say gawd is you
Niggas ain't really hearing you

Crackas like to capitalize
Them crackas a lie
They say if you don't unionize
Then you'll probably die

I hate callin' niggas, niggas
So I'ma take it backwards
But I got now love for Whithey
I love callin 'em crackas

Country boys, city boys
Cadillacs, Rolly Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long a walk, now that we ridin'

Yeah, I call myself real N I G G A
'Cause Kweli be showin' on the floor
And they policies, my philosophies
Show you that the block is a part of me

Freedom fighter like Richard Carter be
It's deep how the street knowledge beef
'Cause it ran like a code inside of me
It's practical, not scholarly

Now why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me
Who's got my back when the cops harass me
New York, L.A or Cincinnati
Can ride the train or with the Caddie

When they call you, nigga they scared of you
They fearin' you so actually
If crack is gone, be fearing niggas
Then that's what the fuck I have to be now

It's a badge of honor
And some say that shit's absurd
It's more than just a word
We flip the shit like it's a bird

Pass it down through generations
Then cuss you out and say it loud
The first generation of muthafuckas
To grab our nuts and say it proud

Country niggas or city niggas
Tupac niggas or biggie niggas
In the corridor, floor or door
And all my Mississippi niggas

We connected all throughout
The north, the east, the west, the south
And if a white boy say the shit
He'll still get punched right in the mouth

Country boys, city boys
Cadillacs, Rolly Royce
Whatever, long as we ridin'
Pretty girls, ghetto boos
On the boulevard, in the avenue
It's a long walk, now that we ridin'

All they got for you is a cell, my nigga
They want you dead or in jail without rebel, my nigga
In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga
But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga

You see, all they got for you is a cell, my nigga
They want you dead or in jail without rebel, my nigga
In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga
But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga

I can tell she a pro. She must have had a lot of practice
Kept her back on the mattress. Either I'm fuckin her good, or she's a damn good actress
All that screamin and hollerin, man she need to go home
I told her cum, take ya slutty ass and leave me alone. Punk bitch!

I put that dick in her mouth, you put love in ya heart
Throw somethin at ya boy in tha clique
But the truth is you sick, 'cause I fucked yo bitch!
Shot cum in her mouth, a nigga ask her for a kiss
The golden shower is the only time that yo bitch get this
Got (?) got da gat, head to ya crib

Man the truth is ya girl like to swallow dat dick!
So bow down to a pimp when a nigga come through
And you betta hide ya grandma 'cause I'll fuck her too
Crippled nieces, blind aunt, and you slut-ass cousins
Man I love a dirty ass, 'cause you never see me comin' dumb bitch!

[Chorus:]

Well I was comin down Candy wit dem twenty six inch rims
Rippin' da (?) just mindin my own business
Pull up in the parking lot at da twenty four hour Wendy's
Smokin weed in front of (?) laughin at broke bitches
And bam!
God is my witness, she tapped on my window
I thought it was da ""5-0"", sweatin us for that endo
But naw, it was ya wife, da neighborhood Bimbo
She lookin right, not too thick or too slim though
""What you ova here fo'? I don't understand
I don't know you from (?), is you lookin for yo man?
'Cause I don't fuck wit dat nigga, so don't ask me about him
And I don't smoke wit hoes if I don't know where they mouth been""
Told her to move around, but she wouldn't leave
""Ho, you gone bow down to this (?) and let a pimp breathe""
She got down on her knees, begging me, please, to break her off
I ain't even want yo bitch homeboy, but I'll take her

I know I'm here for a mission
But it's so hard to get 'em wit twenty two rims all glisten
I know these balls are talking
Lord I wanna do right
I tried to fight but these demons they comp at me at night
Like my momma, my daddy, my girl and all my boys
I lost Rachelle but I guess I still got the whining Roy
My cousins sweet, momma lay that Jason
Lord I'm praying for swacking my heart is still impatient
Keep 'em off them drugs, far away from thugs
He's still my hero but just a shell bed or what it was
Yeah smoking get a buzz, but God I hear ya calling
And shit wrong wit balling
But my soul is just steadily falling
And the sex and the dead, and the other jail
God I'm stacking my mail but will I end up in hell?

[Chorus:]

Lord they hung Andre Jones
Lord they hung Reynold Johnson
Lord I wanna fight back but I'm just so sick of bouncing
Lord I'm sick of jumping, Lord just please tell me something
My folks still dumping my music, bumping but I feel nothing
My heart is steadily pumping
My heart is steadily breaking
Sometimes I feel like I'm faking, man
I'm so sick of taking
Maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn
Maybe Earth is telling just a place for us to learn
Bout yo love, yo will and grace
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born in the first place
Maybe this first base, God knocked the ball up out the park
So we can come home this world right here is feeling so dark
Feeling so cold, Lord I'm feeling so old
I dunno if I can take this world right here no more

Mississippi nigga with a 50 sack of weed
I told them I got that Cali but this here from Tennessee
Sick of leavin' over knees so I had to move quick
I ain't tryin' to ball pimp I'm just tryin' to hit a lick
Then I met this young miss it was back in 96
At a house party rollin' up some dolja in a swiss
Really thought she was a trick so I hit her with my pimp game
Step out to my lac and I'ma show you how to grip grain
I'ma show you how to mix them sprite with them eights
Show you how to ride rock steady on them skates
At the time I never knew this girl would be my soul mate
She said keep me close and ill keep your ass safe
Then I taught country slang and we rolled from my estate
Gave her an AR and started bustin' on them fakes
Then she whispered in my ear no matter how long it takes
You can make it, every myth about your home and your state
We can break it, and no matter what you do let them boys know you smart
Stand up for the poor and keep God in your heart
Now matter what you do let them boys know you smart
Stand up for the poor and keep God in your heart

[Chorus]

I remember falling to my knees asking God for some tracks
He said, make your own son you ain't gotta sell crack
Cut them sappers like they raw and let them fiends smoke that
Go to N-Y-C on faith, im thinking to myself my Lord is that safe?
Uncle Swac gave me a pistol and I left the next day
Homies in Manhattan till I met Mrs. D-A-Y 
In her home she let me stay, studio to studio
Me I'm on my grind, everybody at the crib thought I lost my damn mind
The Noreaga bossed up and bought a beat
This put me on feet, I found a damn way to eat my Lord

[Chorus]

Two years later I'm in the A pimp
But in my soul I feel I need to move back to the Simp
A town they showed me love, they put me on the map
But if I love mississippi I gotta move back
So stop in Birmingham man just for a minute
Niggas stole my red van man and everything in it
Drum machine keyboard and all of my clothes
But I had my pistol with me I'ma kill these hoes
When I left I was with little homie in the Regal
So I grabbed my cell phone and I called Big Siegel
I said, ""Meet me in the Ham big boy it's going down""
God yelled, ""Stop my son and turn around!""
They took your possessions but your souls on safe ground
2 months later I was riding through the Ham
Gotta ten million dollar deal yall, damn! 
Haha thats faith my nigga,
Thank you Lord, thank you",Faith

David Banner,"The same people in the year 1606
Enslaved black folks in the same of the crucifix
And gave us a Jesus with light blue eyes
Hell on earth but heaven in the skies
While they eat they pie now, 
Native Americans got slaughtered layin' passed out
I wanna mash out, but I feel alone
African American, but Africa she ain't our home
Man listen they look at us as cotton pickers
They might as well cause we love to call ourselves niggas
And George Bush is apart of a bigger problem
All America loves hate they will never stop it 
And every rapper that I see has a key but not a key to be free
If God is only one how could she be three
Maybe the key to hell lies in the trinity
Theres no divinity in politics

David Banner,"I think for the most part our generation is 
Filled with a bunch of motherfucking cowards
And I say that man cause we beef with amongst each other
We kill and we shoot each other in our own hoods
And we bang each other, we won't bang cops, you know what im sayin
And one thing theses motherfuckers in America know 
They know we wont do shit

I'm grippin' the neena
Visions of 911, visions of three 6's no 7's
This is bushanomics, George is a modern day Ronald Reagan
I pray to god and I miss the prayers, niggas I'm just sayin'
When do we stop playin', when do we stop pimpin' and start sprayin'
50 shots for every cop that popped sean bell, his body layin'
But they don't quit cause they know that our generation wont do shit
Nothin', nada, but every rapper is a shotta or a don dotta
Or a killer but you ain't killin' nothin' in this piece unless its another nigga
Tryin to raise boys to supermen, 
And while I'm at it fuck Arthur J. Cooperman
Its never just-ice for blacks but they send just-us to Iraq
With poor whites and Latinos I pray to God that you hear this single
This is Banners middle finger yall, yeah!

[Chorus: x2]
I've been waitin' in the hood for so long (so long)
I've been waitin' in the hood for so long (so long)
For some niggas to stand up in here
We some soldiers and we have no fear

Mrs. Catherin Johnson was murdered by police
In north-west Atlanta but I don't hear it in the streets
With a anger in the hood for this old lady dying
DC 6 aint shit but cops lying 
Ain't shit but bullets flyin' 39 slugs from under-covers
Fuck the law! this was somebody's damn grandmother
And she died over crack sales, crooked ass cops
Or some nigga tryin' to flip yay, yeah
You ain't have to sell it in her yard
You aint trappin  bitch you yappin to the motherfucking Gods  
And I got a damn question, why the city ain't pissed off?
When I know yall heard shots and little lady got hauled off yall, yeah

[Chorus]

I don't understand if you don't ride for something dog
Fight for something, fight anybody but your motherfucking self nigga
We sell drugs, but we only sell drugs to ourself 
We bang and we only bang on ourselves
We do every fucking negative thing and niggas is so hard
Niggas on the radio, on cities, on tapes, in movies 
They got guns, they got pistols, 
But ain't nobody shooting at nothing but they self
Fear is the only thing that people respect
We forget everybody but ourself
These cops gonna have to fear something
Something gonna have to happen
Yall goin' to march, march to the motherfucking cops house my nigga
Make these motherfuckers fear something 
Cause make us, they got us scared
They got niggas scared to go strip clubs nigga
You know shit my nigga like,
Somethin' gotta happen I say it
Cause I ain't scared I ain't scared of shit
I'm scared of god I'm scared of god first
And I'm scared of takin' the blessing that god has given me

But I want to go home
Mmmm, I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I want to come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not 
Come along with me
But this was not your dream
But you always believe in me

Another winter day has come 
And gone away
And even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home
Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
Oh, let go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I gotta go home
Let me go home
It will all right
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home",Home
David Bazan,"A white ghost, making his way up the west coast
Trying to focus his high hopes on a vagina or two
He's taking his chances
Meanwhile, back in his living room
Bright smiles are watching his toddler run speed trials
Over a grandmother's rug
And nature advances

Up the interstate
He's been awake
And pretty drunk for three whole days
No one wants to stop
Until they get to where they're going
I'll get to where I'm going pretty soon

So he takes another drink
'Cause watching the scenery bleed
Into each similar scene
Isn't as sweet as it had been in his dreams

It's faster to buy cigarettes and some cold beer
If you don't rattle the cashier
By asking her back to your room
She's calling security

Our car's on fire in the parking lot
And nobody wants it to rain
But God isn't listening
So all of the windshields glisten
The water and oil mix
Causing the fire to spread
To five or six innocent automobiles
Waiting in their nearby spots
What a cruel God we've got

Right on, right on, right on
Right on, right on
Right on, right on, right on
Right on, right on

So he takes another drink
'Cause watching the formula bleed
Into each similar thing
Isn't as sweet as it had been in his dreams",Cold Beer and Cigarettes
David Bazan,"If you make a reference
To some trouble that you know
Can it help you keep it under control
Or should I really reconsider?

My reasons for going solo
David Byrne on Bob Costas
Puts it pretty well
But I put it better

I still run the show
Don't you forget it
So I had to let some go
Don't think I don't regret it
Because I do and I don't
Think I'm better off alone

Man, I could have made a big sound
But I love to let me friends down

Fewer moving parts
Means fewer broken pieces
When every other start
Requires a brand new thesis

One good friend remarks
With a rightfully angry
Jesus dude, none of us know
What to do with you

To which I in pride responded
I've got news for you
None of you have to 'cause

I still run the show
Don't you forget it
So I had to let some go

David Bazan,"You're so creative with your reviews
Of what other people do
How satisfying that must be for you

Am I a Christian?
Are you a Jew?
Did you kill my Lord?
Must I forgive you?

I know it's hard to be original
In fact, nothing scares me more
Because Jesus only lets me do
What has been done before

The path of least resistance
Ancient holy wars
The same old easy targets
Yeah, we've all been there before

So if it starts to get you down
Just pretend
That you don't make your living
From selling advertising

Tracking trends
Coraling demographics
And maximizing traffic

Then if you get tired
Of making tapes for free
You can always start a band
With me or anybody

For not letting them decide where they should fall
And not letting them refuse to fall at all

Your appetite returned so fast
And just in time for supper

You smoked cigarettes like I knew you would

Was it heaven or hell that you saw when your eyes closed?
You smiled at us floating high above the question
Like you knew something we didn't know

Virginia I had a dream we were closer than brothers
Singing ""Pictures of You"", crashing cars, skipping school
We drove all over town as the days blurred around us
We wore out your cassettes, we were nobody's fools

They read us a poem, ""Oh The Places You'll Go!""

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

And happiness is five different crayons
Knowing a secret, climbing a tree

Happiness is finding a nickel
Catching a firefly, setting it free

And happiness is being alone every now and then
And happiness is coming home again

Happiness is singing together when day is through

Thank anybody you're gonna do it again

The way that you walk 
It's just the way that you talk like it ain't no thing 
And every single day is just a fling 
Then the morning comes 

Take your knocks shake them off 
Duck everybody you're gonna take them again 
You are your foe, your friend 
You are the paparazzi 

You are the tragedian 
And the world's a craze 
And the world's a faze and the end is near 
So push rewind just in time 

Thank anybody you're gonna do it again

And when it comes it moves so slow 
Kind of like it's saying ""I told you so"" 
Looking back before she goes 
Tomorrow's gonna hurt 

And the world's a stage 
And the world's a faze and the end is near 
So push rewind just in time 
Thank anybody

David Benoit,"I waited 'till I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Something has to make you run

But it's time to go

Go on and do as you please, yeah

Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue

David Bisbal,"Amores del sur con ritmo latino
Tus besos de vino aceleran mi corazón
Amores del sur dos cuerpos unidos
Tus bailes prohibidos me hacen perder la razón
Amores del sur
Cuantas noches he soñando con un paraíso así
Donde el arte del amor
Es la esencia de vivir
Al llegar quede atrapado por tu hechizado de mujer
En un viaje sin retorno como nunca imaginé
Abrázame
Dame calor
Te cuidaré
Como un regalo de dios

Para hacer me enloquecer
Y las curvas de tu cuerpo
Es desafío que soñé
Este movimiento tuyo
Me esta haciendo revivir
Ahora que tengo tus labios

David Bisbal,"Solo, perdido en la noche
Arrancando sueños a un cafe
Se quiebra el aire de anhelos perdidos
Me sabe a nada impregnado de olvido
Plena, cual playa serena
Bella como nadie nunca vi
Voy descubriendo su justa medida
Mientras la noche desfila en su honor
Y me encuentro atrapado en su pelo
Cayendo en un abismo de ardiente deseo
Decidido a enfrentar mi destino
Decidido a morirme de amor
Ángel de la noche
Déjame llevarte a mi locura
Te daré mi amor bajo la luna
Solos tu y yo
En la noche oscura

Déjame llevarte a mi locura
Te daré mi amor bajo la luna
Solos tu y yo
En la noche oscura
Duelo, de instinto y de miedo
Voy a sobreviviendo a la ansiedad
Cuestión de impulso
Sopresa y anhelo
De no creerme que cerca la tengo
Ruedo
Del vino a sus labios
En el juego incierto del amor
Se escapa el mundo por esos ojazos
Se ha confirmado que el cielo es de dos
Su figura mi arrojo y las horas
Conspiran con las ganas de hallarnos a solas
No habrá nada que rompa el embrujo
No habrá forma de hallar salvacion
Ángel de la noche
Déjame llevarte a mi locura

Te daré mi amor bajo la luna

Si el amor es un sueño de locos
Que me acusen de loco de atar

Es la sangre de la tierra en que naci
Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

Ven, como loco por la vida
Con el corazón latiendo
Porque sabe que tu estas

Ay vida, que palpita de alegria
Que me embriaga el sentimiento
Con tus besos mas y mas

Ay pieles, el embrujo de la luna
La belleza de una rosa
Y la tibieza del mar

Ay eres, vino dulce de las uvas
Donde bebo con tus labios
De la fuente para amar

Buleria, buleria, tan dentro del alma mia
Es la sangre de la tierra en que nací
Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

Ganas, de vivir aqui a tu lado
A tu cuerpo encadenado
Hechizado de pasion

Ay nada, sin tu amor yo no soy nada
Soy un barco a la deriva
Que naufraga de dolor

El perfume de tu aliento quiero respirar
Y esa magia que hay en tu mirar
Ser el hero de tus sueños todo y mucho mas
Quiero ser tu calma y tempestad

Buleria, buleria, tan dentro del alma mia
Es la sangre de la tierra en que naci
Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

Buleria, buleria, tan dentro del alma mia
Es la sangre de la tierra en que naci
Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

Acercate muy lento dejate sentir
Enciende ya este fuego que hay dentro de mi

Ay, ay, ay, no me dejes sin tu amor
Sin tus besos soy un pobre corazon
Ay, ay, ay, no me dejes sin tu amor
A tu lado no hay pesares no hay dolor
Ay, ay, ay, no me dejes sin tu amor
Que tu recuerdo siempre va por donde voy

Ay virgencita del cielo como la quiero
Ella es la luna, ella es la luna, sin ella muero

De rodillas yo te lo pido
Dile que yo la estoy amando
Ya no quiero vivir solito
Dime hasta cuando

Buleria, buleria, tan dentro del alma mia
Es la sangre de la tierra en que naci
Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

Buleria, buleria, tan dentro del alma mia

Buleria, buleria, mas te quiero cada dia
De ti vivo enamorado desde que te vi

David Bisbal,"Era una tarde de verano que anochecía en la ciudad
Entre el flamenco, el vino tinto y una canción de Serrat

Me hechizó aquella mirada llena de alma y picardía
La alegría de su cuerpo despertaba un huracán

Con una flecha aquí en mi pecho
Quedó grabado su misterio
El conjuro de sus besos encendió la tentación

Dime gitana adonde fuiste 
Que me he perdido en éste sueño
Y hasta el día en que te encuentre me resisto a despertar

Por ti, por el deseo abandonado en ésta piel
Juro que algún día yo te encontraré

Cómo olvidar tus ojos verdes esmeralda
Que me robaron hasta el alma
Que me han dejado el corazón en soledad
Cómo olvidar tu canto de sirena 
Que ahora corre por mis venas y me puede envenenar

Es rogar por las horas perdidas en mi habitación
Recordar cada lagrima que fue tan nuestra
Me desangra el alma, me desangra el alma

Es andar el sendero que escribimos juntos
Es tocar un silencio profundo en el corazon
Escapar por las brechas de un amor profundo
Es mentir de nuevo por negar tu ausencia

Esta ausencia tan grande
tan dura, tan honda
Que quiebra en pedazos
Mi razón.

Esta ausencia desnuda
De dudas y sombras
Me clava tu amor

En el fondo del alma
Que quema por dentro 
Mi sueño y mi calma

De piel, de silencio
Que corta las horas sin piedad

Esta ausencia infinita 
De noches y días
No tiene final

Fue tan fácil decir 
Que el adiós sanaría
Las espinas clavadas 
En tu alma y la mía

Esta ausencia me grita
Que se acaba la vida
Porque no volverás, volverás.

Ya lo ves, tu partida no condujo a nada
Porque nada haré el tiempo a la sombra de mi soledad
Ya lo ves, derrotado y sin hallar la calma
Que daría por verte y olvidarle todo.

Hiciste cambiar hoy por estar contigo, la gente a

Maldita ansiedad, me niego a recordar

Perdido en la oscuridad
Cómo vivir así, si el aire huele a ti
Como me duele mi amor la distancia
No quiero otra vez, amanecer sin ti

Acariciarte el alma hasta el cansancio
Sin tener que imaginarte y en mi cama 
No encontrarte y en mis brazos dibujarte, loco por volver

David Bisbal,"Lluvia de error me caerá una maldición
Lluvia de amores rotos, ya llega el dolor
Lluvia de error me caerá una maldición
Lluvia de amores rotos, soledad

Si, fue hace algún tiempo atrás entre unas copas
De más, uuna de aquellas historias que se suelen
Olvidar, cuento o imaginación, fantasía o realidad
Nunca lo sabré no lo puedo negar

Y fue aquella que tomó mi mano, me la leyó y me dijo
Hermano, a ella a la que tu le das el corazón no es
Para ti, entre cubos diferentes y murmurará la gente
Sin saber que te esperaba al fin el verdadero amor

Y verás lo que es tener a quien te quiera de verdad
No dudes más, lo que te digo se hará pronto realidad
Será tu luz, será quien te abra el corazón de par en par
Es tiempo ya para olvidar, serás feliz ya lo verás
Escucha ya, lo que la gente diga no te ha de importar

Lluvia de error me caerá una maldición
Lluvia de amores rotos, ya llega el dolor
Lluvia de error me caerá una maldición
Lluvia de amores rotos, soledad

No, saber si fue un juego de azar o saber si estaba
Escrito ya, pero bébete hasta el fondo el trago de la
Decepción, embrujo o premonición, destino o casualidad
Así son las cosas del misterio del amor

Y hoy tengo a la que he soñaba, la mujer que me
Esperaba, alguien que me llena el alma y me devuelve
La ilusión, aun recuerdo a esa gitana, con la luz en su
Mirada, que en mi mano dibujaba el rumbo de mi corazón

Y puede hallar a la mujer a quien yo quiero de verdad
No dudo más, con su conjuro se hizo pronto realidad
Ella es mi luz, ella es quien me abre el corazón de par en par
Ahora su amor es lo más grande que me pude imaginar
Lo que ocurrió, lo que pasó fue por que tubo que pasar

Ves que he sufrido en el pasado, con las cosas
Que dicen y hacen daño de verdad, pero también
Tengo lo que había soñado, la que pinta de alegrías
El paisaje que una vez fue el de mi soledad

Y verás lo que es tener a quien te quiera de verdad
No dudes más, lo que te digo se hará pronto realidad
Será tu luz, será quien te abra el corazón de par en par
Es tiempo ya para olvidar, serás feliz ya lo verás
Escucha ya, lo que la gente diga no te ha de importar

But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so

One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

David Bisbal,"why era un día en la ciudad. Entre el flamenco, el vino tinto why una canción de Serrat. 
Me hechizó aquella mirada llena de alma why picardía. 
La alegría de su cuerpo despertaba un huracán. 
Con una flecha aquí en mi pecho, quedó grabado su misterio. 
El conjuro de sus besos encendió la tentación. 

Dime gitana adonde fuíste que me he perdido en éste sueño. 
why hasta el día en que te encuentre me resisto a despertar. 
Por tí, por el deseo abandonado en ésta piel. 
Juro que algún día yo te encontraré. 

Como olvidar tus ojos verdes esmeralda, que me robaron hasta el alma. 
Que me han dejado el corazón en soledad. 
Como olvidar tu canto de sirena que ahora corre por mis venas why me puede envenenar.

Soñadores que yo amé

La dejé por conquistar una ilusión
Y perdí su rastro
Y ahora sé que es ella
Todo lo que yo buscaba

Y ahora estoy aquí
Buscándola de nuevo y ya no está
Se fue

Tal vez usted la ha visto

Que yo siempre la adoré
Y que nunca la olvidé
Que mi vida es un desierto
Y muero yo de sed

Y dígale también
Que sólo junto a ella puedo respirar

No hay brillo en las estrellas
Ya ni el sol me calienta
Y estoy muy solo aquí
No sé a dónde fue

Fueron tantos los momentos que la amé
Que siento sus caricias
Y su olor está en mi piel
Cada noche la abrazaba junto a mí
La cubría de besos
Y entre mil caricias
La llevaba a la locura

David Bisbal,"Despertar en el frio abismo de tu ausencia
Es rogar por las horas perdidas en mi habitacion
Recordar cada lagrima que fue tan nuestra
Me desangra el alma, me desangra el alma

Es andar el sendero que escribimos juntos
Es tocar un silencio profundo en el corazon
Escapar por las brechas de un amor profundo
Es mentir de nuevo por negar tu ausencia

Coro:
Esta ausencia tan grande
tan dura, tan honda
Que quiebra en pedazos
Mi razon.

Esta ausencia desnuda
De dudas why sombras
Me clava tu amor

Esta ausencia que duele 
En el fondo del alma
Que quema por dentro 
Mi sueño why mi calma

Coro 2:
Esta ausencia de hielo
De piel, de silencio
Que corta las horas sin piedad

Esta ausencia infinita 
De noches why dias
No tiene final

Fue tan facil decir 
Que el adios sanaria
Las espinas clavadas 
En tu alma why la mia

Esta ausencia me grita
Que se acaba la vida
Porque no volveras, volveras.

Ya lo ves, tu partida no condujo a nada
Porque nada hare el tiempo a la sombra de mi soledad
Ya lo ves, derrotado why sin hallar la calma
Que daria por verte why olvidarlo todo.

Esta ausencia me grita
Que se acaba la vida

A veces la nombro por casualidad
Y es que aún la recuerdo
Y es que aún llevo dentro su forma de amar

Para no desterrarla

Yo soy así, y seguiré
Vagando errante por tu piel

Perdón si te busco, y lloro en tu cara
Perdón si una cita te echado a perder
Nos dimos un tiempo, y sigo aquí esperando
Dijiste mi niño te prometo, que vamos a volver

Si no te abrazo en 24 horas soy un hombre muerto
Me urge que me digas que me amas y me beses lento

Si no te abrazo en 24 horas mi mundo termina
Si te retractas a olvidar que existo me alargas la vida

Si te demoras a decir que sí, vas a volver junto a mi
Será letal para mi corazón, y no vuelve a latir

Perdón por las rosas que no recibiste
Perdón si hoy demuestro sensibilidad
De lunes a lunes, te he estado extrañando
Te amo y me muero, por otra oportunidad

Si no te abrazo en 24 horas soy un hombre muerto

David Bisbal,"Ésta es la historia de una diosa como nunca hubo ninguna
Corría el arte en su mirada de color verde aceituna
De padre moro y de mujer cristiana
Con piel de reina y cuerpo de sultana
Movía sus manos como una gitana
Y su embrujo te robaba el alma

Cuentan que hubo muchos que intentaron conquistarla
Y otros tantos se quedaron hechizados solo con mirarla

Y que en la Ria de Huelva se lavó la cara
Luego que si en la Giralda
La oyeron cantando camino a Jaen

Y una malagueña le contó que la buscaba
Y a una cordobesa confundí con su mirada
En Cádiz supe que yo la quería
Y en Almería yo la hice mía

David Bisbal,"Ella, se desliza y me atropella
Y, aunque a veces no me importe
Se, que el da que la pierda,
Volver a sufrir por
Ella, que aparece y que se esconde;
Que se marcha y que se queda;
Que es pregunta y es respuesta;
Que es mi oscuridad, mi estrella
Ella, me peina el alma y me la enreda;
Va conmigo pero no se donde va
Mi rival, mi compañera;
Que esté tan dentro de mi vida y,
A la vez, esté tan fuera,
Se que volver a perderme y,
La encontrar de nuevo
Pero con otro rostro y otro
Nombre diferente y otro cuerpo
Pero sigue siendo ella, que otra vez me lleva;
Nunca me responde si, al girar la rueda

Ella, se hace fría y se hace eterna;
Un suspiro en la tormenta,
A la que tantas veces le cambió la voz
Gente que va y que viene y, siempre es
Ella, que me miente y me lo niega;
Que me olvida y me recuerda
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca,
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca y,
Al llamarla nombro a otra,
A veces siente compasión por este loco,
Ciego y loco corazón

Sea lo que quiera dios que sea
Mi delito es la torpeza de ignorar
Que hay quien no tiene corazón
Y va quemando, va quemándome y me quema
Y, si fuera ella?
Ella me peina el alma y me la enreda;
Va conmigo digo yo,
Mi rival, mi compañera; esa es ella
Pero me cuesta, cuando otro adiós se ve tan cerca
Y, la perder de nuevo, y otra vez preguntar,
Mientras se va y, no habrá respuesta
Y, si esa que se aleja
La que estoy perdiendo
Y, si fuera ella? y, si fuera ella?

Sea lo que quiera dios que sea
Mi delito es la torpeza de ignorar
Que hay quien no tiene corazón
Y va quemando, va quemándome y me quema
Y, si fuera ella?",Y Si Fuera Ella

Dónde está el mar que me prometiste?

Me quema el hielo de tus manos

Que me ensuciaste y me rompiste
Y aún te refugio aquí a mi lado
Mírame y dime de una vez
Que sientes al rozar mi piel
Dile al olvido que
Que esta agonía se la lleva el viento

Porque en tus brazos doy la vida
Porque te encuentro cuando no hay salida
Porque me encierro entre tus labios
Aunque me sangre a mares esta herida

Que no es culpable la rutina
De que este amor se apague en cada esquina
Que no he sabido acariciar, quizá
qué debo hacer para volver atrás?
No puedo amarte más,
Solo amarte más
Tan blanca el alma que no puedo
Dejarme amar por otros besos
Que mueran cada madrugada
Y se disfrazan de recuerdos
De lunas muertas por el tiempo
Que no enterré bajo tu almohada

Mírame y dime de una vez
Que sientes al tocar mi piel
Dile al olvido que
Que esta agonía se la lleva el viento

Donde tengo la pena 
Que me dejo tu adiós, 
En un rincón del alma 
Se aburre aquél poema 
Que nuestro amor creo 

En un rincón del alma 
Me falta tu presencia 
Que el tiempo me robó, 
Tu cara, tus cabellos 
Que tantas noches 
Mi mano acaricio

Siempre serás mi amor

Como he querido yo, 
Me parece mentira

Le sigue un gran dolor 
Me parece mentira

David Bisbal,"Hoy me levanto como quien naufraga
Solo y empapado con perfume a mar
Como si estuvieras en otro hemisferio
Y yo no alcanzara a navegarte más

Y me he asomado a mi ventana
Como si fuera mio lo que veo detrás
Pero los paisajes, amor no tienen dueño
Por mucho que te mire mía no serás

Tan sólo lo confesaré una vez
Hay algo en ti que declarar
Algo se me escapa en la melancolía
La ola que aprendió a volar

Y es que el amor, no es perfecto
Es un pasillo incierto
Con su sombra y con su luz
Así es nuestro amor de pequeño
Es un paisaje incierto
Con su cara y con su cruz
No estamos preparados para esto
Lo estábamos, pero ya no
Hoy nuestro amor, sin prospecto
Es como un verso suelto
Incierto, con su sombra y con su luz

Hoy me he levantado como quien naufraga
Pero hay latitudes donde brilla el sol
Se apaga otro farol, y se enciende el alba
Sola está la luna, fuera en el balcón

Y entonces me doy cuenta de una vez
Que solo quiero navegar
Y algo se me enciende dentro de mi anatomía
Las olas no saben nadar

Porque el amor no es perfecto
Es un pasillo incierto
Con su sombra y con su luz
Y es que el amor va en el viento
Va siempre mar abierto
Con su sombra y con su luz

No estamos preparados para todo esto
Lo estábamos pero ya no
Hoy nuestro amor ya no es nuestro
Es un pasillo incierto
Con su sombra y con su luz

Y es que el amor que yo quiero
Es bello como un puerto
En medio de la sombra y de la luz

Que callas el vacío en mi interior
Hoy tengo en mis manos el alma rogando
Que sientas lo que estoy sintiendo yo

Escúchame, que el amor es como es
Llega en silencio y descalzo
Entiéndeme, yo no descansaré

David Bisbal,"Vale, no esta claro
Pero hoy vamos del revés
Con la lista interminable de reproches
Con la habitación pintada de veneno
Con la rabia que nos deja sin aliento
En la niebla donde no se ve horizonte

Vale no esta claro
Pero hoy vamos otra vez
Con el sueño convertido en pesadilla
Masticando las palabras con cristales
Lastimando, provocando tempestades
Separados y tan juntos en la huida
Vida que locura aun te quiero en la tortura
Están sueltas las palabras y la noche no descansa
El latido a contratiempo
Quien lo ha dicho que no es cierto
Corazones sin caricias, desertores en ceniza, vida

Vale no esta claro pero hoy vamos sin saber
En la noche de los lobos eclipsando a las estrellas
Tan unidos tan atados, tan nosotros dos diablos
Que son buenos en el fondo
Absorbiendonos esta obsesión necesitados

Vida que locura, mas te quiero no hay tortura
Nos hablamos sin palabras
Y la noche se desata en latidos
Cuando es nuestro siempre evitas, nunca es cierto
Corazones que se aman, desertores que se extrañan
Vida que locura aun te quiero en la tortura
Están sueltas las palabras y la noche no descansa
El latido a contratiempo quien lo ha dicho que no es cierto

Tus miradas y tus gestos
Sera por el misterio de vivir
De vivir, vivir, vivir otra vida
Olvidándonos del miedo de la duda del no puedo
Invente otros ojos para ti
Para mi, para mirarte a escondidas
Para ver crecer esta locura, ya lo ves
Hoy se rinden los soldados de mi piel

Lo pensamos en alto
Y dejamos caer un te quiero callado los dos abrazados
Nuestras frentes pegadas y sobre el tejado una luna
Y allí te amé y así se ven, dos almas en una, burbuja

Inventamos palabras y códigos nuevos
Abriéndole paso al amor
Para si dar rienda libre a este sueño
Resguardamos palomas detrás del sombrero
Fue magia de lluvia y abril
Abril, mientras te echaba de menos
No quiero ser amante en la penumbra
Quiero ser la luz, la sal, tu despertar

Lo pensamos en alto
Y dejamos caer un te quiero callado los dos abrazados
Nuestras frentes pegadas y sobre el tejado una luna
Y allí te amé y así se ven, dos almas en una, burbuja

David Bisbal,"Preguntas cómo hemos llegado a esta situación
De odiarnos y de avasallarnos con tanto rencor

Incrédulos ante el abismo que nos parte en dos
Afanas toda la indulgencia nunca das un yo
¿Por qué?, insistes ¿por qué? ¿por qué?

Renaces embriagada en ira por el que dirán
Me increpas, consternada y lloras que no puedes más
¿Por qué?, me gritas ¿por qué? ¿por qué?
Y me empiezo a preguntar si la respuesta te valdrá

Culpable de decir ya basta
Cuanto me desgastas con cada porqué
Culpable de quererte tanto que me equivoqué
Culpable de pedir perdón, de no saber cuál fue mi error
Culpable de seguir tratando de calmar tu voz

Tu, una estrella fugaz

Sobra tanto con lo que arroparse que hasta el frio se queja
Y por mas que sigo alerta nunca encuentro una caricia de vuelta
Y en lugar de abandonar reclamare tu luz.

Y el alma que se va 
Donde el amor es único 
Donde me arrastrarás 
Camino a la verdad 
Camino a la verdad 

Un paso, un beso sin respirar 
Ahogándonos de felicidad 
Hacer al sol desaparecer 
Estar en deuda con la razón 
Perder la cuenta de nuestra adicción 
Y no querernos salvar 

Mis manos encendidas 
Tu boca con la mía 
Las líneas de la eternidad 
Donde la noche es humedad 
Donde el suspiro es lágrima 

Tus piernas que me abrazan 
Tu sed que me amordaza 
Y el alma que se va 
Donde el amor es único 
Donde me arrastrarás 
Camino a la verdad 

Voy volando voy y nada pesa 
Nadando sobre sábanas 
Flotando junto a tu belleza 
Tu cuerpo regresa 

Mis manos encendidas 
Tu boca con la mía 
Las líneas de la eternidad 
Donde la noche es humedad 
Donde el suspiro es lágrima 

Tus piernas que me abrazan 
Tu sed que me amordaza 
Y el alma que se va 
Donde el amor es único 
Donde me arrastrarás

David Bisbal,"No preguntes si te extraño, sabes como soy 
Quieres que te cuente como estoy
Cómo calcular los daños en su dimensión 
Cómo puedo explicarte lo que se rompió 

Nuestra historia fue perfecta pues me transformó 
Fui por vidrios rotos y dolió 
Me cegó tu luz directa, ahora veo mejor 
Y vivir cayendo me cansó 

Fue nuestro amor, mi máximo maestro de dolor 
El cielo y el infierno en oposición 
El fuego y el papel en colisión 
Salto mortal del corazón 

Nunca te mentí, eterno fue mientras duró 
Da lo mismo quién lo decidió 
Fui por ciclos de silencio pero ha vuelto mi voz 
Sabes que es mejor para los dos 

Fue nuestro amor, mi máximo maestro de dolor 
El cielo y el infierno en oposición 
El fuego y el papel en colisión 
Salto mortal del corazón

David Blue,"The room it was lit up me too I couldn't sit up
Engaged was my time in studying the wall
And all the poets kept getting louder
Even though they weren't needed any longer
The strapless high heeled street walker
Believes every day that she goes younger

Ah I wish I could be her lover
And go with her as she makes her rounds
And fall with her hair as it comes down

The poets would keep on all night with their come ons
One would say something another'd say more
Looking for contracts but finding the soap
Well I know she'd take them all for a joke
Ah but she'd take them all no doubt
And they never knowing what it was about

Ah I wish I could be her lover 
And go with her as she makes her rounds
And fall with her hair as it comes down

With burning candle and the store window
Hard to believe there could be more
And all the poets complained of the cold
But they only did what they were told
Searching so hard for a satisfied mind
While she walked by with a satisfied soul

Ah I wish I could be her lover
And go with her as she makes her rounds
And fall with her hair as it comes down

A radio played on to almost no one
Attention was paid only to the dawn
As she stopped and bent to touch her nylons
And felt in the air for a post to lean on
No one could ever know her outside
In the take of an instant she had passed by

Well I wish I could be her lover
Go with her as she makes her rounds
And fall with her hair as it comes down

Symbols and motives were again promoted
Hard to believe there could be more
As she moved on and then faded out
To the songs of the poet still keeping it up
The sidewalks cleared themselves for a new touch
And it all disappeared into the face of the clock.",Midnight Through Morning
David Blue,"I loved Marianne in the winter
In the loft of her favorite lover
She was growing older
The winter nights were cold
She told me I'm frightened
I said yes I know.

Her eyes held me to her
They burned with such a fire
For the saints on the walls
Holy candles in the halls
For those who had left her
I held her and cried.

[Chorus]
Oh, Marianne you are beautiful
To be this friend
To a stranger who
Leaves you only to fall
Do not cry you have helped me
I will not say goodbye.

I know her from another song
Her older poet wrote before
We played it in the morning laughing on the floor
Till he came knocking on the lower East Side door.

Yes you know I miss her
Her and her stories of the night
I called her a rabbit
She gave me back my life
I haven't heard her voice since the Isle of Wight.

[Chorus]",Marianne
David Blue,"I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son 
The highway is my legacy 
On the highway I will run 
In one hand I've a Bible 

In the other I've got a gun 
Well, don' you know me 
I'm the man who won 
Woman don't try to love me 

Don't try to understand 
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man 

First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe 
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day 
All of my friends are strangers
They quickly come and go 

And all my love's in danger
'Cause I steal hearts and souls 
Woman, don't try to love me 
Don't try to understand a life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man 
Ooh

Woman, don't try to love me 
Don't try to understand

Some men call me Cain, 
Some men call me sinner, Lord 
Some men call me saint

Then there's nothin' left to gain

David Bowie,"Between the dead ring ash of extreme defense
The lonely groups of company boys snapping pics
Of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
As he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable

He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls
A small black someone jumps over the crazy white god
Cranking up the volume on a Michael Jackson song

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable

Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
That's a mighty big word for a nine year old

Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable

Made of nothing but loneliness

For he promises to come running, guided by the truth

Look to the stars and see his eyes
He`ll show you tomorrow, he`ll show you the sorrows

Of what you did today
You can call him foe, you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn to the road ahead

When I live my dream",When I Live My Dream
David Bowie,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here","When I Live My Dream [BBC ""Top Gear"" 18/12/67 Mono] [#]"
David Bowie,"I bless you madly,
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly,
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you
That sets the test

So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

""I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...Dry
I crushed my heart
To ease their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can they spare
What of me?
Who praised their efforts
To be free?
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked their way
I braved their cause to guide,
For little pay

I ravaged at my finance just for those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""

I bless you madly,
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time,
At times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you
That sets the test

So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me,
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word

""We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but ours

We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill our needs
Now we are strong

And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage

Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt

Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through our sleeves
Yea, and we slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as

'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

And we know the flag of love is from above
And we can force you to be free
And we can force you to believe""

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
""I believe in the power of good
I believe in the state of love
I will fight for the right to be right
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right""

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I want to believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live
Oh, we want to live

We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live

I want to live

David Bowie,"Was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder

And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
""God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today""

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly
For her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling
Wooden floor

Crying
""God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look
The other way

David Bowie,"The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean.
So rest your head and read a treasured dream.
I care for no one else but you.
I tear my soul to cease the pain.
I think maybe you feel the same,
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do.
So I've been writing just for you.

They say your life is going very well.
They say you sparkle like a different girl.
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired.
You cry a little in the dark,
Well so do I.
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say,
But I can see it's not okay.

He brings you out in style.
He treats you well

He's strong for you.

Just by mistake?

David Bowie,"The children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass,
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land.
It was ragged and naive.
It was Heaven.

Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life.
We claimed the very source of joy ran through.
It didn't, but it seemed that way.
I kissed a lot of people that day.

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon,
To paint that love upon a white balloon,
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his 
Brain.
Satoria must be something just the same.

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size.
We talked with tall Venusians passing through.
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared,
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud.
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd.
And we walked back to the road, unchained.

On the corner of a bed

Of hessian and wood

I see you see me through your window.
Don't turn your nose up,
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or the last.
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house,
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you.
I'm the cream
Of the great Utopia dream.
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen.
I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose,
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones,
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain.
I keep having this brainstorm
About twelve times a day.
So now,You could spend the morning walking with me,quite amazed
As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed.
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread.
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen.
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream.
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed.
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl.
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor.
And the braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly.
It's very catching.
So now,you should spend the mornings lying to your father quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed",Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed
David Bowie,"Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh ""It's the madness in his eyes""
As he breaks the night to cry:

""It's really Me
Really You
And really Me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
You'll lose me though I'm always 
Really free""

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy
From Freecloud

And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy 
From Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

And the magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
""Stop, Freecloud 
They won't think to cut me down""
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles

And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with super fear their tragic endless lives
Heaves nor sighs in solemn, perverse serenity
wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a super god cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power is weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes

The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah, and you can know it all
If you choose
Just remember, lovers never lose
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind and makes you free

Free, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

If you stay you won't be sorry

Soon you'll grow so take a chance

Hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

We bought a lot of things
To keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people
When they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance

Hung up on romancing

And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up
This old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry

David Bowie,"Oh yeah
I'm up on the eleventh floor and I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street and he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement, my weekend's at an all-time low
'Cause she's hoping to score, so I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart, walk out of her mind, oh not her

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador of sweet-talking, night-walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it, then she can do it, she don't make false claims
But she's a queen and such are queens that your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on, and she'll lay him right down
Yes, she's leading him on, and she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me, yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh, the cot is so cold it don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while and I look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street, so I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab 'cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth and it's no taste at all
It could have been me, oh yeah it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

David Bowie,"I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality
I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No, I ain't got the power anymore

I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies, I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets, divine symmetry
Should I kiss the viper's fang?
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself, don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Aah-aah, aah-aah, aah-aah, aah-aah

I'm not a prophet or a stone-age man
Just a mortal with the potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith
If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself, don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Aah-aah, aah-aah, aah-aah, aah-aah

Don't believe in yourself, don't deceive with belief

David Bowie,"Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
Some words had truthful vengeance
That could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
Couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Gave your heart to every bedsit room, at least a
Picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
Your paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising, we'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Now hear this, Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Ah, couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes
Here she comes, and here she comes",Song for Bob Dylan

David Bowie,"I tried to break away from you
From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs
By the faggy parks and the burnt out vans
I've got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark and I'm far too young to lie
I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play 
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and come ball
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head

I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine years of murder called life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town they're going to claim me if I fall

[CHORUS]
Sweet head, give you sweet head
(spoken: while ya down there)

See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all

Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had god

You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud
I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd

David Bowie,"Oh
Oooh yeah
Ah
Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with weird and gilly
And the spiders from mars. he played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls
Just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Oh
Ooh oh

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass, he was the naz
With god given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man i had to break up the band.

Oh yeah

David Bowie,"Pushing through the market square,
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over,
We had five years left to cry in

News guy wept and told us,
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet,
Then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head,
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off,
I think she would have killed them

A soldier with a broken arm,
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest,
And a queer threw up at the sight of that

I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor,
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine,
Don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot

Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Well all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a hoochie koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something too

Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace

Jumped up on the stage

Of darkness and disgrace

And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
Yes he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love
I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, his song went on forever

And the clocks waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Chevy brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind

You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if i could only
Make you care

David Bowie,"Stone love, she kneels before the grave
A brave son, who gave his life
To save the slogans
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love, a boy and girl are talking
New words, that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning

Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love, and how my God on high is
All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion

David Bowie,"A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

Keep her comin'
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him, she love him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

He's so simple-minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

David Bowie,"She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky odor
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear
Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room

Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my

David Bowie,"Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace, child
I moved up to take a place
Near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heat
In pieces

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past?
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

Staying back in your memory

He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boys

Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy

Time, in quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Oh, well, I look at my watch, it say nine twenty-five
And I think ""oh God, I'm still alive""

You are not evicting time

Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming

David Bowie,"Shaky threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better it was so-so
Yeah it was time to unfreeze
When the reverend alabaster danced on his knees
Slam so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

Watch that man oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So shaky hung him up to dry
The pundits were hoking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played the tiger rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah I ran to the street, looking for information

Watch that man oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

David Bowie,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping 
By a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked, why not, and I replied, I don't know
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Kahlil Gibran
And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

Ho
Oh I said so long and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply

Don't let the milk float ride your mind

The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!

[CHORUS (x3)]",Rock & Roll With Me
David Bowie,"It's safe in the city, to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screens from the door
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?

Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says

[Chorus]
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap
Thing

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment

If his trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...

[Chorus]",Sweet Thing
David Bowie,"He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van 
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man 
The only survivor of the National People's Gang 
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph 
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone 
Panic in Detroit 

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom 
The police had warned of repercussions 
They followed none too soon 
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive 
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph 
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone 
Panic in Detroit 

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school 
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls 
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine 
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights 

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home 
Found him slumped across the table. A gun and me alone 
I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two 
Panic in Detroit. He'd left me an autograph 
""Let me collect dust."" I wish someone would phone

Well on the street where you live
I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor in the back of a car
In the cellar like a church with the door ajar
Well I guess we've must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying till we break up our minds
Till the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights

As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy
Thoroughfare,
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building,
High on Poacher's Hill.
And red, mutant, eyes gaze down on Hunger City.
No more big wheels.

Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats,
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes,
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers,
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue.
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now leg-warmers.
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald.

People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today

We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard

Yet now
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me ""Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far""
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead

One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theater of financiers
Count them, fifty 'round a table
White and dressed to kill

Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs

I make it a thing, when I gazelle on stage to believe in myself
I make it a thing, to glance in window panes and look pleased with myself
Yeah, and pretend I'm walking home

I took it so bad, I sat in the correction room

Hunt you to the ground, they will, mannequins with kill appeal

Now Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, go Tarzie, go man, go

Meets his sweetest little hussy with his ghost town approach
His face is sans feature but she wears a diamond broach
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to wear
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sable-ized

Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says, I'm somebody
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says, don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me
He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use (somebody)
He's so divine, his soul shines (somebody)
Breaks the night, sleep tight (somebody out there, somebody)
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race (somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody out there)

He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
He says, don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) 
Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen (what they look like)
Where they've been

He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says, don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me
That given time, the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell
Can they walk and hold you as well as a
Smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?
Keep your eyes on your soul, keep your hand on your heart

He says, don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) (somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) (somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody somebody)

Yeah, can't remember (somebody) peace so well

Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to boogie

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)
Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)
Somebody, somebody, somebody

Yeah, can't remember, peace so well
Can't remember peace so well
Can't remember peace so well
Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
Soul shine
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)
Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)",Somebody Up There Likes Me
David Bowie,"(Hey, it ain't over)
Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Oh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied, I say it's hip
To be alive

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
That's all you gotta do (ooh, it ain't over)

Me, I'm fresh on your pages 
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
That's all you gotta do (ooh, it ain't over)

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
That's all you gotta do (all you got to do is win)

Now your smile is spreading thin (seek and believe in you)
Seems you're trying not to lose (it ain't over, no no)
Since I'm not supposed to grin (that's all you got to do)
All you've got to do is win (it ain't over, no, oh)
(Seek and believe in you)
All you've got to do is win (it ain't over, no, no)
Woo hooh, all you've got
Is all you've got
