Of Mice & Men,"You all have something to say, or something to ask, I don't live in a cage
It's none of your you all have something to say, or something to ask
I don't live in a cage

It's none of your business

Gonna say this clear so you can get it straight
You don't know a thing about me
Who I am from what I read, oh, I sound so sickening
Your attempts to bring me down, fuel my fire and build my sound
I can't believe all the things I hear

You all have something to say about me
How can you stop and listen, when all you do is talk?
You all have something you want to take from me
And I can't hold my tongue anymore

Shut up

You all have something that you want to say to me
You all have something to ask
It's none of your business

I'm well aware I did three days alone in a cell
A simple, easy price to pay for something that I felt
Towards someone so deserving
I hate those who prey on the weak
If asked to do it all again, I would if needed be

All of these people talking about my story
As if they've lived it before
All of these people they don't even know me
But I love how you think you know me better than I know myself

You know me better than myself

You all have something to say, or something to ask
I don't live in a cage, it's none of your business

All of these people, talking about my story
Just keep talking, just keep talking
It's none of your business

You all have something to say about me
You all have something to ask
It's none of your business",Public Service Announcement
Of Mice & Men,"What do you see when you close your eyes?
How do you feel when you see it?
Who is to say that it isn't real?
And why can't we learn to believe in, to believe in something?

Look into the emptiness and step into the cold.
Gravitate your body and your soul.
Deep inside of all of us there's something left to hold.
Even when we give up all hope, there's space enough to grow.

I know that we are all terminal.
We sail on borrowed time.
It's never about what we live without,
It's how we live out our lives.

Look into the emptiness and step into the cold.
Gravitate your body and your soul.
Deep inside of all of us there's something left to hold.
Even when we give up all hope, there's space enough to grow.

What do you see when you close your eyes?",Space Enough to Grow
Of Mice & Men,"If I could find the words, if I could shake the world
If I could turn back time would you still be there

I can't stop thinking about the way
I left you sinking with no escape
Now there's no love light, no way to save
But maybe next time I won't throw it all away

I ask myself everyday

If I could find the words, if I could shake the world
If I could turn back time would you still be there
If I could stop the words you say
If I could shake the world way you take
Then would you still be there

Would you still be there
Would you still be there

Dislocating, I lie awake
Suffocating in my mistakes
I lost my halo when I fell from grace
But maybe next time I won't throw it all away

I ask myself everyday

If I could find the words, if I could shake the world
If I could turn back time would you still be there
If I could stop the words you say
If I could shake the world way you take
Then would you still be there

There's no chance for you round here
I'd crawl into the fire, fan the flames
Don't keep missing, don't be missing
I don't have to say that to your face

If I could find the words, if I could shake the world
If I could turn back time would you still be there

If I could find the words, if I could shake the world
If I could turn back time would you still be there
If I could stop the words you say
If I could shake the world way you take
Then would you still be there",Would You Still Be There
Of Mice & Men,"I want you to stop
To sit and think of all the times you tried to steal from me
I might go down, choose my name your smiles your smiles on your face
Your photo its all thats running
Spilling from your mouth
I suggest you bind it up and keep it
Keep it to yourself

You make me sick, just go away
You're exposing all of your fangs
Your tongue is poisoning
You serpent, you snake
You make me sick, sick

Do not proclaim your mouth from the riches made for me
Keep it, eat it, have your fill
I hope you choke
Watch your sacred life fall out your head
Don't want you dead, need you alive, to feel every moment
When I crush it

You disgust me!

You make me sick, just go away
You're exposing all of your fangs
Your tongue is poisoning
You serpent, you snake
You make me sick, sick

I'm nauseous, you're wretched, with false power you've gone mad
Unhinged and disgusting
I'm nauseous, you're wretched, with false power you've gone mad
Unhinged and disgusting, you're gruesome and you're grim
All you do is make me feel exactly what you are
All you do is make me feel exactly what you are, you make me sick

You serpent, you lying snake
You make me sick",You Make Me Sick
Of Mice & Men,"When your reflection in the mirror smiles back it lies, you know it.

When you lay your head to sleep at night it's filled with every moment
Every chance you miss to be something, well learn from your mistakes

You're not alone you're with me
You're not alone you're with me

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over, you're not alone anymore

When it feels like all is lost and there's no guide that's left to prove it
Take a look inside, cherish your life
And live before you lose it

You're all waiting for the answer
Keep on searching, strength in numbers

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over, you're not alone anymore

At the end of the day, what will you choose?
Will you keep moving on, or be forced to lose
Look inside of yourself, 'cause the power's in you
There is always hope, you're not alone

Anymore

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over, you're not alone anymore

Don't let the world bring you down
Don't let the world bring you down
You're not alone
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over, we're not alone anymore",You're Not Alone
Of Mice & Men,"I can't believe what you tell me so I just look away
When you realize you feel me climbing right through your teeth
Anything I see in you, everything I thought I knew goes away
With every word you say

You betrayed me!

Can you see?
(The other side of things)
Can we be?
(Whatever we have become)
I can see that you've got something to hide
Something to hide
Behind those eyes

I, I sleep when they're open so that they keep you awake
Can't refix what is broken
We will, we work from mistakes
Anything I see in you, everything I know it goes away
I know I don't mean it, I won't be defeated, I won't be
It's you I believed in, but you're keeping secrets

You betrayed! (You betrayed!)

Of Mice & Men,"He sits and he waits,
Feeling broken and hollow
Hands held close to his face

And feeling so hollow.
Can't find love in this place,
Left alone with her sorrow

When you stood by her side were so broken
When you threw it away

What did you expect when common sense is your enemy?
I'd rather burn alive than drown inside your reality

Of Mice & Men,"Even though I can see it in your face
I can't really explain
Just how broken and empty and disgraced
You seem to be (to be)

Pulled me all the way to the bottom

What no one else would do for the fallen

One day
When nothing ever feels the same
Just like every other time before
(You hit the wall and lost it all)

To wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to

On you, on you

You'll never know just how hard it
Is for me
To see you this way (this way)
It tears me up, drags me down
Trying to pull you up from the bottom

I'll see you through
When you're on your knees and crawling (crawling!)

It's easy to sleep when you're dead though it's too late to say the words you wanted them to hear When you didn't have the nerve.

You get to spend eternity thinking about your life.
Think of all the time that is. Eternity is forever, is forever, is forever. What will I do forever?
At this time there is nothing you can change. You can only sit and watch and hope they understand
It's easy to sleep when you're dead. Cause there isn't anything else to do but sleep.

Of Montreal,"Miniature woodwinds whistle underwater
While electric eels make the ocean warm in summer
Olives that were left on the sand become bathing beach bunnies
Being wooed by seashells singing elegant choruses

Little viola hidden in the orchestra, 
How I love to pretend the sounds you make are flowers that slowly encircle the band.
That curl around each note that's played. 
The audience charmed by the floating garden of music giddily pick musical floral bouquets.

And now its time for the play...

The actor in the center of the stage looks sadly at a teacup, 
Reads a poem off the teacup and covers his face with a page of a poem on the teacup and sings, 
""What a terrible lie you told me. That you're heart was mine to buy. 
All those feelings you implied, it all was just terrible lies...oh what a terrible lie..""

That our life together is over and its best that you find someone new
Because my darling, I've forgotten what I saw in you.

I seem to recall some vague memory of feeling happy, when we were young and in love.
But that was a long time ago.
Now I'm lost, Never in a million years what I have dreamt that about you I'd become indifferent.
But sweetheart, incredibly it's true, that your cutie pie has forgotten what he saw in you.

He wanted to touch them
But was afraid she might be taken aback

When it was empty after dark
Then spread out a blanket
And laid down and a voice said

""No one else could hear?

""Although, I can't sing it now, be still

And be careful to avoid
Chocolate hearts
Keep distant from romantic notions

And mink coats are most certainly out too
For if she goes in for that kind of thing
Just might fall then what you will do

And who will never be satisfied

With a wife's constant nagging
For things that you can't provide
Who no longer bears resemblance
To that soft spoken flower
You were so desperate to have for your bride

Too much conversing with a woman
Tends to dull a man's wit

Who claim that love if it's pure will never fade
Though love may last all right in a bibliotheque
In the real world man its too easily unmade

I make sure to pull out all the weeds
And to help myself along

I sang in my army days when I was young

A hot air balloon I will float away
At times I'm holding you

To stay with me once a year
And on New Years I drive down to be with them

He longs to give his life
Saving a nice old man and his wife

Jacques Lamure is a foreman
At a clock factory
He wishes he were boss
So he could fire that scoundrel William Moss
Who always puts him down

That when springtime was here
He would suddenly appear at Meg's door
He'd rent a mariachi band and respectfully demand
His dear Meg to take his hand
And to be his forever more
But of course he didn't dare
And pretended not to care
About the insult or the loss
When he found out she'd married William Moss

Every other Friday night
He likes the westerns best
He'd rather be a sheriff with a gold star on his chest

And when spoken to pretends he hadn't heard

He realized one day that he didn't have to stay
That he could move as far away as planes could fly
He chuckled as he mused
About the people who had rused him
And how shocked and confused that they would be
When he says goodbye and never turns around
Never returns to that miserable town

Then as weeks passed he soon did find
This move had greatly improved his state of mind",Jacques Lamure

Of Montreal,"Nickee Coco woke up early one Tuesday morning 
And decided to go for a walk in the tomato field behind her house. 
As she was walking along she saw a magnificently tall invisible tree 
And decided to climb up on it. 
She found the foliage covered branches 
So comfortable that she fell fast asleep. 
She was still asleep when nightfall came 
And her mother became frantic with worry. 
She ran from house to house asking everyone she saw 
If they had seen Nickee or knew where she was. 
Soon the whole town was aware of Nickee's disappearance 
And they immediately started the search.

And so the search began
Everybody was looking for Nickee Coco
They looked on rooftops and in trees in the park
Mr. Temboley even shouted down the well
""Nickee Coco if you are down there give a yell""
But he didn't hear a yell
And so the search went on

Everybody was still looking for Nickee Coco
They asked the stuttering organ grinder in the square
Who said ""No no no no
I hav-hav-haven't heard a thi-thing
But the second that I-I-I d-d-do I'll gi-gi-give a ring
Oh-oh-oh the poor poor poor little thing""

All the while Nickee was curled up fast asleep
Very peaceful in her invisible tree
Eating mangos in a dream
And so the search went on

All the while Nickee was curled up fast asleep
No longer peaceful in her invisible tree
Being chased by antelopes in a dream
And so the search went on

They're wondering if they'll ever find Nickee Coco
Nickee's mother asked Miss Colvendom in tears
""Margaret tell me what on earth I've done
To deserve losing my sweet beloved one?
What could I have possibly done?""

Many weeks passed 
And though some people were beginning to lose hope 
They all kept searching and never did Nickee leave their thoughts. 
One day an owl happened to fly past Nickee 
Still sleeping soundly up in the invisible tree 
And rushed back to tell the townspeople. 
After an owl translator was called in 
And the owl's wonderful message was understood 
The whole town joyously followed the owl back to the invisible tree 
Where little Nickee was still fast asleep. 
They all cheered when they saw her 
And Nickee finally awoke as they lifted her above their heads 
And marched victoriously back into town where they had a huge party 
In honor of her return and sang this song

Approach the nest of the speckled salamander
Who with utmost care is knitting thermal underwear
She smiles and hollers up
""These are for my grandchildren to wear""


Joseph and Alexander feeling tuckered
Now decide to meander back into their beds
And kiss their swanis on the head
But before going to sleepy land
Joseph turned and said
""Aggats, I love you""
Alexander yawned and said
""Joseph me too I love you""

Of you not loving me
It doesn't help me to complain
I just have to feel it
And hope it goes away

And no longer feel anything anymore


It's such a strange need to be deprived of
To just want love and feel happy

What kind of suit my mom buries me in

To send my body down
I'll jump out of the box and tap dance

The three legged hyena cicadas migrated to the small northern sea port village called Durschfuch. The horrible insects congregated above the Durschfuch elementary school and would spend an indecent amount of time circling the playground. The citizens of the village were very alarmed by these new visitors, but since they were a God fearing community and were not allowed to bring any harm to any of God's creations, they had to pretend to ignore the large grotesque arthropods and continue on with their lives as if there weren't any menacing predators swooping over their offspring. In time the hyena cicadas became hungry and this in when the real terror ensued. As I stated earlier, the adults of the village, thought the best course of action was to pretend the insects didn't exist and continued to send the children out to the playground for recess. Every day the same thing occurred; the children would stand apprehensively at the threshold of the front gate until the teachers ordered them outside to ""play"", then the children would run terrified towards the shelter of the banyan trees that formed an oval around the perimeter of the school yard. There they would spend the duration of recess huddling together under the trees, shaking with fear. For the first few weeks the children managed each day to narrowly cheat death by hiding below the trees. Eventually the hyena cicadas became mad with hunger and resolved to become more aggressive in their attempt to eat the children. One of the more intelligent cicadas, who happened to be the most famished of all of them, had the idea that some of the flock should hide among the foliage of the banyan trees while the others swooped over the children as usual. Then when all of the children were in their normal positions under the trees, the hyena cicadas hiding in the branches would descend upon them and kill them. After that all of the flonk could gather under the trees for a delicious feast. His plan worked perfectly and the adults of the village watched helplessly as the hyena cicadas ravenously devoured their beloved young ones",Lechithin's Tale of a DNA Experiment That Went Horribly Awry

It proved to be the most important finding in the case 
And where as detectives slocks and slovits

""excuse me aren't you so and so?"" 
""oh so and so since you left I have been eating only sweets cause they remind me of you."" 

He felt this surely was a clue. 
So he climbed into the tub wearing his underwear and overcoat,

""did you think that you'd stay young forever?"" 
""but at least you're still together""
The two detectives held hands in the moonlight. 
The butterflies flew away which prompted slovit's to say,""l miss them already"". 
Slocks removed a fountain pen from his breast pocket, 
Drove it deep into slovit's throat and began screeching 
""death to the parchment whale, the robot I am lasaile"". 
While in prison, slocks wrote one of the most revered exercises in free verse titled 
""the cause of gauze"". ""oh the cause of gauze,

So he wanted to ride his bike
Blindfolded into traffic
Cause he hated his bike and he hated his life
His heart was consumed with guilt
From the knowledge he had not
Become a successful man
He was an unsuccessful man
And his heart was blank
Don't we know what blank people are good for
What they are good for?

Till one day my Auntie introduced him
To her friend named Gwendoline
And she must have made a stunning first impression
Because he left my Auntie
And never came back again leaving with Gwendoline
But my Auntie didn't care
She knew she could find
Another blank husband anywhere
By God they're everywhere

I want to dance to the rhythm of owls

The unrequited kind is all I have procured
And it was nothing at all like what I've heard about love

Devoid of memories, nothing to record
Wishing the one that we adore

Man it was a miracle that nobody died

Performing with the Apples
and then crashing at the Wrights
Bitching because Steven booked us
on such early flights
Always in a foggy haze
because we hadn't slept for days

The most truly repellent techno music ever made

And nothing can defeat you
No death, no ugly world

You've lived so brightly
You've altered everything
I find myself searching for old selves
While speeding forward through the plate glass of maturing cells

I've played the unraveler, the parhelion
But even apocalypse is fleeting
There's no death, no ugly world

Sometimes I wonder if you're mythologizing me like I do you
Mythologizing me like I do you

We want our film to be beautiful, not realistic
Perceive me in the radiance of terror dreams
And you can betray me
You can, you can betray me

But teach me something wonderful
Crown my head, crowd my head
With your lilting effects
Project your fears on to me, I need to view them
See, there's nothing to them
I promise you, there's nothing to them

I'm so touched by your goodness
You make me feel so criminal
How do you keep it together?
I'm all, all unraveled

But you know, no matter where we are
We're always touching by underground wires

I've explored you with the detachment of an analyst
But most nights we've raided the same kingdoms
And none of our secrets are physical
None of our secrets are physical
None of our secrets are physical now",The Past Is a Grotesque Animal

Opaque fading eyes stumble in my face, Through the crowd I forsake
Demised I'm aside weaked by the lonely haze, Of no point, no aim

'Cause no one's there to hold my head up high, No one's there to peace my mind

Alone, I'm afraid, To find hollow life, Sleepless nights, empty days

Alone...",Alone

Lives in a dream

Where do they all come from?

Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near

In the night when there's nobody there

Ofra Harnoy,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There & Everywhere"

Endless rain into a paper cup

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Shines around me like a million suns,

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

Towering over your head.

And she's gone.

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

Just a few more dials connected
And the smiles are coming back again and again and again
Ooh, electrons connecting and tuning

Out in the streets, I hear the crack of thunder.
People keeping low, people searching for some cover,
But in my room, I hear the sound of trumpets,
Meeting me through the field that keeps us in.

In my voice, in my voice, it's trembling so they say but is this it
I was born a nervous wreck
With my heart in my stomach and a devil on my back
And I was born with runner's legs
Chills running down my spine all the time

It's stronger if you cry into the phone
Am I vain, am I vain
To think that you could never let me go
I grew up with curtain falls
And applauding when the lovers rose from deaths to bow
Oh
And we would leave with tears and smiles
Thinking this is how we want to feel all the time

So how can I tell, how can I tell
Close your eyes and if it is real, if it is real
It's gonna feel like daylight

And how will I know, how will I know
When in doubt, they say it's a no, say it's a no

And no one seems to know
Should I go in?
No poetry helps the cause
And all the advice people tend to throw
It doesn't help no 'cause I'm on my own

Close your eyes and if it is real, if it is real
It's gonna feel like daylight

Let loose your glow

Dreaming you were back home

Can't pick up the phone without you

Houses on stilts grow out of the sea
Everything's growin' there, it's growin' for me

You gotta go there, everything grows there
When you get high on a mountain it snows there
Everything's groovy like in a movie
Sausalito is the place to go to

Sunnin' all day, lovin' all night
Write a bit, fight a bit got it just right
Music and flowers the sight and the sound
Fish a bit, wish a bit magic's all 'round

You gotta go there, everything grows there
When you get high on a mountain it snows there
Everything's groovy like in a movie
Sausalito is the place to go to, now

You gotta go there, everything grows there
When you get high on a mountain it snows there
Everything's groovy like in a movie
You gotta go there
You gotta go there",Sausalito (Is the Place to Go)

Our love I could never live without it
Our love call my name and I'll be there
Our love no one here could ever doubt it
Our love your heart our love

Time has said that when we're together
There won't be a never to keep us apart
I believe this love will grow stronger
Our days will grow longer
Your love's in my heart
There were times when I thought that we would never be
Two hearts that beat as one
Now I know that it's real
The way that I feel
And baby I want to say that you make my life a joy

[Chorus]

Now I know that we'll be together
Forever and ever 'till the end of time
Here's a love that burns like a fire
Yet filled with desire
And sweeter than wine
Could it be that we are living in a fantasy
Some say it can't be true
Now I just can't conceal
All this passion the thrill
Come let me show me that I love you
It's true I do

[Chorus]

My love and your love
I said together not without it
Not anyone could ever doubt it
Said our love together forever and ever
In love the sky I fly above
And I can't fly without our love",Your Love

Da seh ich einen Rastamann
Ick steh da so am Straßenrand (zu Fuß)
Und halt den Daumen raus aus meiner Hand, yo!
Ick halt ma an der Straße an und frag „Ey, Mann, wo lang?""
Ick will (ja?), zum chillen, (alles klar) ins Freiheiheitsgefühl
Ick bin (wo?) schon drin (achso) uffem Weg direkt dahin
Na fein, da steig ick ein, da komm ick mit 'n kleenet Stück
Setz dich rein, dreh wat ein, lehn dich zurück auf diesem Trip
Und wohin fahren wa?
Aus der Fata Morgana
Durch jedes Panaroma ins Nirvana und davor zum Dalai Lama

Einmal um den Globus
2 oder 3 oder 5 mal um die Welt
Und wenn einer auf Klo muss
Dann gibt's 'n Klo im Bus
Kein Grund dass man anhält

Denn das Leben ist wie eine große Autobahn
Lass uns nicht lange überlegen, sondern los fahren
Wohin is egal und wo lang werden wa sehen
Es wird immer weiter gehen

Wir düsten durch Wüsten
Steppten durch Felder
Checkten die Wälder
Endeckten Buchten
Versteckt in tiefen Schluchten
Und bei den Pyramiden
Da wären wa fast geblieben
Wir ham uns umentschieden
Und stiegen in Täler in Korea
Und besuchten die Hebräer
Und in Alabama killten wir den Kilometerzähler
Als wa in Taiwan waren
Wollten wir inn Sudan fahren
Doch hatten wir kein Plan man
So kamen wir nach Japan
Mit Ruder-fest in Budapest, man, det war echt der hammer
Alle rauchen Blunts mit Gras aus Kingston und Zigarren aus Havanna
So völlig high
Durch die Mongolei
Surfen auf Hawaii
In Shanghai gabs Stress mit Polizei
Das war voll krass, wa?
Und dann in Madagaskar
War 'n Freak aus Alaska
Der macht die beste Pasta, Basta!

Denn das Leben ist wie eine große Autobahn
Lass uns nicht lange überlegen, sondern los fahren
Wohin is egal und wo lang werd'n wa sehen
Es wird immer weiter gehen

Das Leben ist wie eine große Autobahn
Lass uns nicht lange überlegen, sondern los fahren
Wohin is egal und wo lang werd'n wa sehen
Es wird immer weiter gehen

Sämtliche Länder erobert
Mit allen Völkern gechillt
Jedes Wesen bewundert
Genug Input gefüllt
Und was wolln wa jetz noch machen?
Hm, lass ma überlegen
Ick fang ma an zu hämmern
Und ick fang an zu sägen
Bock zu zerlegen, abwägen und neu zusammenkleben
""Ey, wat baun wir überhaupt hier?""
Ich würd sagen 'n U-Boot
Auf jeden!
Luke schließen abtauchen
In den tiefsten Ecken der Meeresbecken
Wo unentdeckte Welten sich bis heute noch verstecken
Wir erforschen alle Winkel der Länder und der Meere
Was wäre da noch übrig? Na is doch klar die Atmosphäre
Also baun wa wieder
Schrauben wa wieder
Wiegen und schmieden Platinen
Kabelsalat, programmieren Maschinen
Und starten auf zu Planeten
Mit Lichtgeschwindigkeits- Raketen
Segelten mit Kometen zu Intergalaktischen Feten
Wir treten ein in die nächste Dimension
Und es gibt keine Endstation denn wir bleiben in Bewegung

Denn das Leben ist wie eine große Autobahn
Lass uns nicht lange überlegen, sondern los fahren
Wohin is' egal und wo lang werd'n wa sehen
Es wird immer weiter gehen

Das Leben ist wie eine große Autobahn
Lass uns nicht lange überlegen, sondern los fahren
Wohin is egal und wo lang werd'n wa sehen

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

This is where I lie at night 
Staring at a light bulb hanging on the ceiling 
Waiting for a dream to 
Come and get me out of here 

Here in my humble room at night 
I often wonder what goes on out there 
What makes them runs o scared 
I often stare at the people passing by 
But they can't see me through my window shades 
Just like I'm not even there

Everyone says we've come such a long, long way
We're civilized, isn't that nice?
We've gotten so smart
We know how to blow the whole world apart
But when it comes to the simple things
(like living together) . . . ha!

Verse
Why'd we have to come all this way
Is anything any easier to understand
Why'd we have to come all this way
Are we any smarter than primitive men
We still fall in love though we know better
Anything at all just to stay together
Stop wasting all my time

Chorus
Why did we come all this way
Why did we come all this way
Why did we come all this way

Verse
Why'd we have to come all this way
We could have quit while we were way ahead
Why'd we have to come all this way
We could have just stayed home instead
The road was long and the journey was hard
We never even dreamed that we'd come so far

I work so hard trying to make a few bucks 
I pass the hours in a dream 
The sweat keeps rolling off the tip of my nose 
There's only one thing keeps me on my feet 

And I may be greasing the wheels of a noisy factory
And I may be hunched over metal machines
Watching the gears as they move
Just reminds me of bodies in motion
The sweat and the sound

Makes me think of...
Wild sex in the working class
After five it's a gas
Wild sex in the working class
Counting minutes gonna get home fast

Thinking of your warm skin
While I touch cold steel
The days go by to the pounding beat
My back is aching so bad
But I'm grinning inside
Thinking of you keeps me on my feet

And I may be greasing the wheels of a noisy factory
And I may be hunched over metal machines
Watching the gears as they move
Just reminds me of bodies in motion

His skin is peeling off, his bones are sticking out

when you came to my house 
You'd been lost in a crowd, said you had to get out 
You were covered with tears and you said you were sad 
So you wanted to play 
Yes, you wanted to play 
Well you touched me and smiled, as you let yourself go 
Oh, but something was wrong, 'cause your touch was so cold 
Like you'd been in the ground and you asked if you could

With the moon in your eyes, on that cold winter night 
When your lips were so soft, that I though they would 
Melt, 
And the sound of your breath and the way that you felt 
And I said yes 
And I said yes 
It's just pictures of you with a knife in your hand 
With a rose in your teeth lying nude in the sand 
It's just pictures of you, standing high on a cliff 
With the wind in your hair, and a smile on your lips 
And your eyes were so wild, when you started to laugh 
Blending in with the wind, sounded just like a scream

Like a fly in a spider's web, is it true more is less 
Herded like a happy flock to the big T.V. slaughter

It's a new generation 
It's a hallucination 
It's a mystic vibration 
It's just intimidation 
It's the will of the people 
It's the church with the steeple 
It's the sacred devotion

People raise your voices, don't get into that trap 
If your friends and your neighbors push 
Why don't you push them back

To stand up and be heard 
Ain't no use to try and wait 
For the magic word

It's an infatuation 
It's a beautiful body 
Both erotic and deadly 
It's the fear of the future 
It's just surgeons and sutures 
It's a spandex obsession 
It's a lasting impression

Do you feel the power 
Baptized in electronic water 
Prodigal sons and beautiful daughters 
With smiles and bows and rosy cheeks 
And the righteous bath 
Death to the freaks

Do you feel the power

Completely firm and so alluring, Like's he's lived a thousand times before 
And seen the world from shore to shore

With the wisdom and the confidence that seem to scream out common sense

Daddy holding you tight and safe

From religion to cosmology to the end of a democracy

Ever willing to swallow

Of a tranquilized nation

You rationalize everything that you do

And everybody is crazy but you

From a suburban family and you never really had to work 
And you tell me that we've got to get back

In a fast car--on a highway 
Burnin' tracks--towards the sunset 
No turning back--and no regrets 
I'll think of you . . . (if I don't forget) 

Run away from the church--run away from guilt 
Runaway from (your) dream--everything you built 
Run into the light . . . 

CHORUS 

Run away from the office, from your old work shoes 
Run away from crime, and the big city blues 
Run away from money, and the jaws of death 
Run away from lawyers, and the government 
Run away from your friends, and your family too 
Run away from yourself, run away from you 
Run away from here . . . 


",Run Away (The Escape Song)
Oingo Boingo,"Well I wish real hard when I close my eyes 
 If I could change the world--would I even try 
 If I found a reason to regain my pride 
 Oh if I try to believe--try to believe 
 
 [CHORUS] 
 It's so hard to find an answer 
 It's so hard to stand alone 
 It's so hard to find a feeling 
 That was buried long ago 
 It's so hard to trust another 
 When it's easier to hide 
 It's so hard to believe 
 Unless we try baby try 
 
 If I had a dream and it got away 
 If I found the words would I know what to say 
 If I had a chance to be someone else 
 Yeah if I try to believe, try to believe 
 
 [CHORUS] 
 
 If I found a door I've never been through 
 Would I have the courage to go in without you 
 (Try To Believe) 
 And if time runs short would I recognize 
 The things I couldn't see 
 If I try to believe--try to believe 
 
 If we listen to the voices that were silent for so long 
 If you thought they went away, well you couldn't be more wrong 
 If I tell you there is something that we've lost but can retrieve 
 If I tell you there is hope, if we try to believe 
 You remember there's a dream that we long since put aside 
 With the toys that we discarded 
 And the tears we never cried 
 We could have had it once again, if we try baby try",Try to Believe

In the teeth of a dog that bites.

Oingo Boingo,"There's life underground...

I feel it all around,
I feel it in my bones,
My life is on the line,
When I'm away from home.
When I step out the door,
The jungle is alive...
I do not trust my ears,
I don't believe my eyes.
I will not fall in love,
I cannot risk the bet,
Cause hearts are fragile toys,
So easy to forget.

It's just another day,
There's murder in the air...
It drags me when I walk,
I smell it everywhere.
It's just another day,
Where people cling to light,
To drive away the fear,
That comes with every night...

It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another day,
It's just another day...
It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another day,
It's just another day...

It's just another day,
When people wake from dreams,
With voices in their ears,
That will not go away...

I had a dream last night,
The world was set on fire.
And everywhere I ran,
There wasn't any water...
The temperature increased,
The sky was crimson red,
The clouds turned into smoke,
And everyone was dead.

But there's a smile on my face,
For everyone...
There's a golden coin,
That reflects the sun...
There's a lonely place,
That's always cold...
There's a place in the stars,
For when you get old.

Oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another
It's just another day...
Oh...

There's razors in my bed,
That come out late at night.
They always disappear,
Before the morning light!
I'm dreaming again,
Of life underground...
It doesn't ever move,
It doesn't make a sound.

And just when I think
That things are in their place,
The heavens are secure,
The whole thing explodes in my face!

It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another day,
It's just another day...
It's just another-
It's just another day...
It's just another day,
It's just another day...

There's a smile on my face,
For everyone...
There's a golden coin,
That reflects the sun...
There's a lonely place,
That's always cold...
There's a place in the stars,
For when you get old.

Oingo Boingo,"With sadness in my heart and joy in my mind 
I thought about the ghost that we left behind. 
With everyone around telling us what to do 
With deafening sound whisper ""I love you."" 
The fire in your eyes-- may it never go out. 
The sweetness of your tears make it feel like night. 
I see no escape from the roles we always play 
What do we have to prove on this judgement day 

You're missing the whole point-- you're not my little pet 
Don't throw away your life-- The games not over yet 
I do not own your soul--don't want you in a cage 
I only want your heart to find a special place 

You're mine now But you're not my sister 
You're mine now But you're not my slave 
You're mine But you're not my child 
You're mine now But you're not my slave 
You're mine now But you're not my slave 

With sadness in my heart and clounds in my head 
I thought about us both and the lives we led. 
The pages on a book and pictures on a screen 
We shape ourselves like clay from someone else's dream. 
One second you are cast just like stones at my feet 
But I am not a king please don't worship me. 
With everyone around telling us what to do 
With deafening sound whisper ""I love you.""

Oingo Boingo,"Johnny was bad, even as a child everybody could tell,
Everyone said, ""If you don't get straight
You'll surely go to hell.""

But Johnny didn't care,
He was an outlaw by the time that he was ten years old,
He didn't want to do what he was told
Just a prankster, juvenile gangster.

His teachers didn't understand,
They kicked him out of school at a tender early age,
Just because he didn't want to learn things
He had other interests
He liked to burn things!

The lady down the block,
She had a radio that Johnny wanted oh so bad,
So he took it the first chance he had.
Then he shot her in the leg,
And this is what she said
""Only a lad. You really can't blame him.""
""Only a lad. Society made him.""
""Only a lad. He's our responsibility.""
Oh, oh, oohh oh oh oh
""Only a lad. He really couldn't help it.""
""Only a lad. He didn't want to do it.""
""Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused.""
Perhaps a little bit confused?

Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa

His parents gave up, they couldn't influence his attitude,
Nobody could help.
The little man had no gratitude.

And when he stole the car,
Nobody dreamed that he would try to take it so far.
He didn't mean to hit the poor man,
Who had to go and die.
It made the judge cry.

""Only a lad. He really couldn't help it.""
""Only a lad. He didn't want to do it.""
""Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused.""
Perhaps a little bit confused?
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh

It's not his fault that he can't believe,
It's not his fault that he can't behave,
Society made him go astray.

Perhaps if we're nice he'll go away,
Perhaps he'll go away,
He'll go away

""Only a lad. You really can't blame him.""
""Only a lad. Society made him.""
""Only a lad. He's our responsibility.""

Hey there Johnny you really don't fool me,
You get away with murder,
And you think it's funny!
You don't give a damn if we live or if we die

Hey there Johnny boy,
I hope you fry!

Oingo Boingo,"Everyone says sooner or later you'll reach the end of the line 
When things get rough some think it's easy to jump the ship . . . 
You decide 

I say--don't throw it away 
There's about a million reasons why 
Though you've heard them all before 
And you're getting very tired 
Lay your head on my lap and I'll sing you this lullaby

That everyone around you 
Has felt the pain you feel today

When you wake up in the morning it'll only be a dream 
You're out of control . . . 

There's a cloud-rollin' overhead and it seems to rain on no one else 
There's a black sun--casting a black shadow, 
And I know you feel so all alone 
You're out of control--and you want the world to love you 
Or maybe you just want a chance to let them know 
That you live and breathe and suffer 
And your back is in the corner and you've got nowhere to go 

Nothin' for nothin'--everything's right at your fingertips--for a price 
Who ever said that life on this planet would ever be paradise 
I say--don't throw it away, you've got too many things to say 
If you throw your life, if you throw away your life . . . 
THe world will never be the same

You're out of control--and you move without direction 
And people look right through your soul 
You're out of control--and you want someone to tell you

If you look below for hidden treasure underneath another layer 
Are you hiding underneath the skin

If you peel away the skin is there anybody there 
If you peel away the skin is there anybody there 
If you peel away the armor is it too late to begin 
Is there anybody hiding if you peel away the skin 

Now a spark has passed between us now 
A momentary recognition 
Something lost and something gained 
And something shared that feels strange 
Something cold that will not go away 

There's a heart as cold as ice 
In a vault that's made of stone 
Over years the walls got higher 
Over years the walls have grown 


Is there anybody in there in this self inflicted tomb 
If you peel away the layers is there someone in this room 
If you peel away the skin, if you peel away the skin

And I tried to speak, but it was useless

Oingo Boingo,"Don't you ever wonder why, nothing ever seems to change 
If it does it's for the worse, seems it's just a modern curse 
Sometimes when I take a peek outside of my little cage, 
Everyone looks so asleep, will they die before they wake 

And, hey. . . Don't you know? We're just products of our time and Hey . . . 
What d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine 

Better dumb and happy than smart and without any friends 
Better cute and better loud, better join up with the crowd 
Keep up or be left behind, there's a dust storm in my mind 
Seems I can't see straight these days, doesn't matter anyway

I'd gladly tear my heart out if you never, never, never, never change 

Do you want to change? Do you want to change right now? 
Do you want to change . . . I like my stupid life, just the way it is 
And I wouldn't even change it for a thousand flying pigs 

And I like you just the way you are, I like your face just the way it is 
And I wouldn't even change it for a herd of screaming kids 
And I like you just the way you are, I like you though you may not like me back 
I would dazzle you with brilliance, if I only had the knack 

'Cause I like you just the way you are, I like this life just the way it is 
And the castles all around me, have been melting now for years 
And it kills my brain to think of all the time I wasted here 
All the efforts, sweat, and broken hearts, the screaming and the tears 

And I'm dreaming again . . . Floating in a pool of mud 
Try to get back where I was and I don't really care 

Got a little talking to, by the mirror in my room, and I don't really care . . . 
Whispering voices from the dead, come from underneath my bed 
And I don't really care . . . 

I like my stupid life just the way it is 
And the chaos that surrounds me like a flock of screaming pigs 
And it hurts my brain to think of all the stupid things I've said 
And if I could change the future I would change the past instead 
And I'm dreaming again . . . and I'm dreaming again . . . 

Baby - sometimes I worry about you 
Sometimes you're so far away, tell me what to do 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you 
Sometimes I just can't believe everything you do 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about you 
Every day I feel the same, don't you feel it too 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me 
Seems I'm falling down a lot, in between the scenes 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me 
Getting harder all the time, harder now to see 
I say, Baby . . . sometimes I worry about me 
Light another cigarette, have another dream 

It's the same thing every day, nothing ever seems to change and I . . . 

Do you really want to change? 
Testaments and growing pains. Tranquilizers for the soul. 
Nothing ventured, nothing gained - evolution's cruelest joke 
Why is everyone upset? I once knew but I forget. Something happened, 
Something strange, something it appears has changed 

Hey . . . Don't you know? We're just products of our times 
And hey, what d'ya say? Show me yours, I'll show you mine 

Hey, what d'ya say? Hey, what d'ya say? Please don't ever -

Hey, though at this moment I can't think of what we'd say 
I guess we really want to be just like them... 
Just want to be just like them... 
Just want to be just like them. 

Hey, I've really thought a thousand times about this day 
I've been expecting it in each and every way 
The possibilities preoccupy my mind 
And I'm so fortunate to be so very kind... 
So very kind... 
So very kind. 

What I really want is all those things that I can't have 
What I really want is to have you so bad 
I'm so jealous I can barely see straight from my head 
And it burns from the inside 'til I wish I was dead. 

Please, mama don't be angry with me. 
Please, papa don't be angry with me. 

And I'm so sick and tired of all those stupid things you say 
And this monkey sitting on my back won't go away 
And I'm standing here with my dick in my hand 
Waiting for an invitation to the promised land. 

Please, mother don't be angry with me. 
Please, father don't be angry with me. 

Hey, I've got a commentary without much to say 
And all those damn kids drive me crazy every day 
But all I ever think is something to complain... 
To complain... 
To complain. 

Hey, I really wish that they would all just go away 
'Cause all I really want to be just like them 
Just wanna be just like them... 

And I'm so sick and tired of all those stupid things you say 
And this monkey sitting on my back just won't go away 
And I'm standing here with my dick in my hand 
Waiting for an invitation to the promised land. 

Please, mother don't be angry with me.

My mind has wandered from the flock you see
My mind has wandered, the man just said so
My mind has wandered I heard it on TV
And the flock has wandered away from me.

Oingo Boingo,"Oh Mary was unhappy with the life that she led
She was a simple girl without much to say
So one day she upped and left her dreary home
And she left all her friends to wander all alone
And at first she was afraid, she was so far away
From her home but slowly she got to like it anyway

Oh Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come

Well in time she found 
That mountain that she had been taught
Her whole life, that she must avoid
And though at first it hurt, and no one could comfort her
She finally came to appreciate it
And she liked it, she liked it--oh wasn't she surprised
And though still alone, she grew so much inside

Oh Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come

And after a time, she became so sublime
She could look in people's eyes and read their minds
Though her hands would sometimes bleed and occasionally
She would long for her past and the memories they bring
She decided to return to her old home town
And her heart was burning with all the things she found

Oh Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Please come home

So Mary came back and at first no one recognized her face
And her friends were all a little bit afraid
When they heard what she had to say
They all slowly backed away
And her family took her aside and put their arms around her
They said:
Mary, won't you please come back to us now
There is still time to repent for all your sins
And Mary started to cry when she realized
That she'd never come home again in her life

Oh Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Mary won't you please come
Please come home

I see him and he, sees it all... 
And he sees it all 

I fell down in that lazy place, 
Where the English language can't - penetrate and I 
Saw your mouth moving - just forget it and lie here with me 
Maybe we should just, climb under the sheets 
Where the words they don't get in the way 

We were wondering, if you recall 
Is this the end of it - end of everything 
We were wondering, wonder

Has a message I - want you to hear 
Hope you're happy - found what you're looking for 
Do you miss me, miss me at all?

I would like to be a martyr 
Over time it's getting harder 
Who do I have to go and kill 
To get my face on a dollar bill. 

[chorus 1] 
Every single time I look 
Someone else has beat me to it 
Some poor bastard bites the dust 
I really don't know who to trust. 
But there's one thing I can't deny 
I'd rather it was me they fried 
Have a drink from an empty cup 
Light a match and burn me up. 

[verse 2] 
I'm exhausted, I'm committed, 
I'm outsmarted, I'm out witted. 
My head's filled with dynamite 
It's coming out of my ears at night.

I think I am being watched 
Electric eyes that never turn off. 
Radar beams insinuating 
Evil thoughts while I'm masturbating. 
And even my old trinitron, 
It's comin through when nothing's on. 
Have a drink from an empty cup, 
Light a match and burn me up.

Their glaring eyes are filled with hate, but I am not afraid

With tattered wings and toothy grins to amplify their scorn 
They're looking for the helpless ones 
They're looking for the misbegotten 
They prey upon the weak and fractured 
The crippled and the freaks of nature 

And when the come upon one who's lost or is alone 
Their smiles get even bigger and their noses start to glow 
Making snarling sounds to pantomime with furious abandon 
And with a scream they pounce to kill and all the while they're laughing 

I'm the one treads upon the weaker ones

Oingo Boingo,"Countless long nights
While I stare at the wall
I ask myself over again...

How did I end up
In this little hell?
How - did it ever begin?

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helpless to turn back the clock
That ticks on
With its cruel shiny face
It laughs while it watches
My every disgrace - I was
Born a sap - all the
Nurses laughed when they
Saw me the first time
They giggled and they said
""This poor little monster'd be
Better off dead.""

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helplessly trapped in a body
I'm sure -
Should have never been mine.
I bet that my real one's
Doing just fine - and I
Don't belong here, I
Don't belong here - I
Should be quite rich
With a big shiny car
A house with twelve rooms
I deserve to go far.

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helplessly falling in love
But does love
Really last through the night?
To love - To honor -
To kick and to bite! and I
Don't belong here, I
Don't belong here
It's all a mistake
I was destined for greatness
A leader, a prophet -
They're just too blind to notice.

Where did this whole silly story begin?
It seems that my mind has gone -
Blank.
I think that I've messed up a chapter or two.
Perhaps it is best if I'm frank!

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess -

Helplessly lost like that
Poor chap who came
For an innocent dance.
He left with his brain smeared
All over his pants! cause he
Didn't belong here, he
Didn't belong here
He never should've left
That warm cage in a zoo!
His face was so ugly
What else could I do?
Can you - really blame me, I
Had to smash it.
He left me no choice,
He was just like the others.
I just had to kill him.
With my poor, dear, old
Mother.

Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess

Helplessly fucked in the ass
By a legion of forty ex-cons
That's what it feels like
When you walk all over me.
Don't belong here, I
Don't belong here
Your eyes burn right through me.
They fill me with fear.
I could've been at home
Watching football, and drinking beer.

Baby said, what a cute little piggy you are 
When he took one look at her rocket tits 
He smiled real wide and said ""Baby, you're it"" 

Piggy said baby won't you come with me 
My little place is three steps away 
Piggy gonna take us both to paradise 
He said ""Come on little baby, won't you please be nice"" 

So Piggy and Baby sauntered into his crib 
Said, ""here it is baby, this is where I live"" 
Won't you take a load off, can I fix you a drink 
Baby turned real slowly and said, ""Piggy you stink"" 

Piggy said baby, do you have a smoke? 
Baby said no, she was tryin to quit 
Piggy was speechless for a couple of beats 
When his jaw dropped open and he said... ""shit"" 

Now Piggy and Baby had some swingin times 
And though piggy was stupid, 
Baby sure didn't mind 
Baby said, ""lets go straight to the stars"" 
And Piggy said 
""huh? .... whatever"" 

Baby and Piggy took a walk in the park 
It seems that Piggy was in kind of a fix 
He owed seven bills to a couple of sharks 
Who were gettin kind of itchy in their finger-tips 

So they figured it was best to clear out for a while 
Piggy had lots of friends, or so he would boast 
And his little piggy habit was kind of out of control 
So they packed up his Lincoln, and head for the coast 

Baby started smokin again on the way 
Piggy's little habit was making him sweat 
So they stopped off in Vegas for a couple of days 
To scam some cash up and make a few bets 

They went and shacked up in a place on the strip 
Piggy made some calls and Baby got sick 
Baby turned to Piggy with a desperate plea 
""c'mon Piggy, you know what we need"" 

But the problem, you see, was that they were broke as shit 
So Piggy asked Baby if she'd turn a few tricks 
She argued at first, but she finally agreed 
With a couple of shiners, she hit the street 

Now Piggy felt good, and piggy felt mean 
And Piggy was high on his self esteem 
So he pulled out his piece, in front of a cop 
But the cop said ""Fuck you"" and Piggy got popped

I'm the cat's meow since I don't know when
I'm an instigator from a dead man's town
So when did the whole world turn upside down?

When did you change your mind?
When did you lose the juice?
Now, where did you get your attitude?

When did you give it away?
What did the old man say?
And how many babies did you kick today?

Now, how many nights can the full moon shine?
How many bottles of water can you turn to wine
When the blood has flowed against the tides of time
And the water flows forever? Hey, hey, hey

Now, I'm gonna build a boat, I'm gonna make it float
'Cause I'm getting the chase for a faraway place
Gonna set the sail, gonna catch some wind
And the big red sky's gonna be my only friend

With a boat for two, just me and you
You can be my teacher, I can teach you too
Gonna try a few things that I've never done
Maybe talk to the fishes, maybe have some fun

Maybe shake my pale fist at the angry stars
While I dance a jig under the eyes of Mars
When we get to an island where no one's ever been
We can get down and dirty in our animal skins

And I stand with my thing hanging out in the wind
Where the water's sweet like honey
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, hey, now

I've been feeling a chill, from the East wind blue
Is it creeping up slow, have you felt it too?
Have you noticed the look, have you felt the feel?
Did it make you blush when the piggy squealed?

Have you heard what they say, did you read the news?
Said, the old man's coming home a singing the blues
Gonna whack your fanny, gonna tan your hide

Make your ears turn red and make you gonna cry
Now, well, how many children gonna lose their minds
How many crying girls will be left behind?
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines

When the dead start walking and the full moon shines
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines
When the dead start walking and the full moon shines
When the dead start walking, yeah

Now, everybody sing to the heavens above
And everybody dance to the sounds of love
Won't you clack your teeth, won't you smack your hands?
Won't you dig your little heads right out of the sand?

Won't you jiggle your butt, won't you wave your arms?
Won't you look like you just came off of the farm?
Won't you stop your fighting for a second or two?
Won't you help your neighbors, won't you do the do?

Won't you taste the sugar, won't you eat the cake?
Won't you get your ugly mug right out of my face?
Won't you tell your brothers and your sisters tonight
That you tasted the water and the water was right?

Won't you taste the sugar, won't you dance the dance?
Won't you wake up? Please and come on out of your trance
Everybody make believe that you disappear

For a second or two, gonna feel so queer
And you left behind all your rage and fear
And it made you feel like water

Ob das Leben eine Scheibe ist,

Lieber voll verkacken als schon im Ansatz scheiße.

Wusste mehr, doch musste erst noch reifen für den Wechsel
Verdiene Cash mit Musik jetzt, diese Texte bluten es
Stinkstiefel, Vin Diesel viel zu fast and furious
Sieh mich vorbei an glänzenden Blitzern ziehen

That are never, ever going to happen.
My brother's at home with his dog and his cat
And his wife is at a friend's.

You can only go on so long about feelings
That never, ever actually touch you.
No matter how much she told him ""I love you,""
He found it would depend

on the gifts that he bought her,
Or how badly she was hurt
When the boss was cruel at work.
But he'd just say
""I love you,""
And he'd reach out to her.

He was feeling like shit when I came to visit
And walked through the door of his tiny apartment.
We went for a walk through the park by the market
So we could get some air.

And I told to him all things intended to help him,
Especially that, simply because it was ending,
That that didn't mean she was always pretending.
Real happiness was there.

I could see and I could tell:
It was real love that they felt.
And I'm sorry it didn't end well,
But some things
They just don't - that's life,
And you shouldn't blame yourself.

And all of these things, well, I truly believe them.
Our paths and our futures are hidden in mists
That are stretching out over impossible distances,
Totally obscured.

And I really do think that there's probably more good
Than anger or selfishness, sickness, or sadness
Would ever completely allow us to have in this life,
I think I'm sure.

Okkervil River,"Hot breath
Rought skin,
Warm laughs and smiling,
The lovliest words
Whispered and meant
You like all these things.

But, though you like all these things
You love a stone.
You love a stone,
Because it's smooth and it's cold.
And you'd love most
To be told
That it's all your own.

You love white veins,
You love hard grey,
The heaviest weight,
The clumsiest shape,
The earthiest smell,
The hollowest tone
You love a stone.

And I'm found too fast,
Called too fond of flames,
And then I'm phoning my friends,
And then I'm shouldering the blame,
While you're picking pebbles
Out of the drain,
Miles ago.
You're out singing songs,
And I'm down shouting names
At the flickerless screen,
Going fucking insane.
Am I losing my cool,
Overstating my case?
Well, baby what can I say?

You know I never claimed
That I was a stone.
And you love a stone. 
You love white veins,
You love hard grey,
The heaviest weight,
The clumsiest shape,
The earthiest smell,
The hollowest tone
You love a stone.

You love a stone,
Because it's dark and it's old,
And if it could start
Being alive
You'd stop living alone.
And I think I believe that,
If stones could dream,
They'd dream of being laid 
Side-by-side,
Piece-by-piece,
And turned into a castle
For some towering queen
They're unable to know.

And when that queen's daughter 
Came of age,
I think she'd be lovely
And stubborn and brave,
And suitors would journey 
From kingdoms away 
Just to make themselves known.

And I think that I know the bitter dismay of a lover who brought 
Fresh brouquets every day
When she turned him away
To remember some knave
Who once gave
Just one rose, one day, years ago.

On a therapist couch with his face to the ground
After fucking around countless nights

And there's this one episode
Close-up cameras were showing him crying
His red head and his red eyes

I'm the band in a show
?Bout a boy being buried alive
From his head to his toes by a criminal
But with a sensitive soul, with a set of raccoon eyes

And there's this scene in the show

A thought falls from his mind

And they're dancing in front of my eyes
Is the queen informed of the flaws
With the eyes all got odd and rumpled into her spine

She rises up like a young group from a heart
Like a claw splits apart like a jaw, like an eye
And she asks me with a sigh

We were so far from right
We were using the fight
We were letting the light weaken it's beam
Oh, oh, is there a hand to take hold of the scene?

I wanted to smile like a glistening shot of a kiss
That's as sharp as a knife, the day expires
In the dry, cracked, trembling lips [Incomprehensible]
But this gets inside
I lift them up to you, I'd like to bear witness to

Our life that is fine
And is filling the cryingest eyes
Gracing each face that is making the waste
That is broken as one's fairly fly

Love that is in us
Of that ol' cynical covetest, cancerous vibe
And a beauty that annihilates all life

Like it's lived in these nights, holding your hatred tight
Like a sign that should [Incomprehensible] you strong
When the doors are shut tight, I will dream you tonight
And my dream will just sweep you along

When all the fires are fanned

My head will burst, my life will end
So I'd like to start this one off by saying
Live and love

I was young and at home in bed
And I was hanging on the words some poem said
And thirty-one
I was impressionable, I was upsettable

I tried to make my breathing stop, my heart beat slow
So when my mom and John came in I would be cold

From a bridge on Washington Avenue
The year of 1972
Broke my bones and skull
And it was memorable

It was half a second and I was halfway down
Do you think I wanted to turn back around
And teach a class
Where you kiss the ass that I've exposed to you

And at the funeral the university
Cried at three poems they'd present in place of a broken me

I was breaking in a case of suds
At the brass rail, a fall-down drunk
With his tongue torn out
And his balls removed

And I knew that my last lines were gone
While stupidly I lingered on
Other wise men know
When it's time to go and so I should too

And so I fly into the brightest winter sun
Of this frozen town
I'm stripped down to move on
My friends, I'm gone

Well, I hear my father fall and I hear my mother call
And I hear the others all whispering, come home
I'm sorry to go, I loved you all so
But this is the worst trip I've ever been on

And how your forthrightness betrayed a secret shyness
Stripped away by days of being hailed as your highness
And what's new pussycat as you were once a lioness
They cut your claws out

And sitting higher than the others
Staking with charm

For your mouth's all filled up

What picks you up from down
Unless it's tricks, man
When I been fixed, I am convinced
That I will not get so broke up again

And on a seven day high
That heavenly song
Punches right through my mind
And pumps through my blood

And I know it's a lie
But I still give my love
And my heart's all alive
For your hands to pluck off, oh

What gives this mess some grace
Unless it's fictions
Unless it's licks, man
Unless it's lies or it's love

What breaks this heart the most
Is the ghost of some rock 'n' roll fan
Exploding up from the stands
With her heart opened up

And I wanna tell her, your love isn't lost
Say, my heart is still crossed
Scream, you're so wonderful
What a dream in the dark

About working so hard
About growing so stoned
Trying not to turn up
Trying not to believe in the light on your own

They'd fan a million bucks before your face
Marie's passed out in a chair with her once fussed-over hair
All mussed into an? I've just been fucked shape

Just an hour before, she crashed, all cashed
She said, I'm done with looking back, and you look your age
Which is thirty-seven, by the way, and not twenty-eight

And fucking let them stare because at this point I don't care
I have been your bride stripped bare since ?98
And our silver-screen affair, it weighs less to me than air
It's a gas now, it's a laugh, just how far several mil can take it

This week's fast as last week's flash of interstate
When you starved and never ate
This week's splashed a sick, gold cast across your face
As you roam on silk, ripped tippy-toe alone through Silver lake

Okkervil River,"She was once mine
That smile that shines from the glossy magazine that's stuck inside the Sunday times
She was so sweet
On Christmas eve
With the snow set deep when we went walking through the pines
I had just been fired and her first offer had arrived
And the new year would see her flying far away from me
Though I didn't know it a the time

With out-stretched hands
Now she commands a famous figure
For every picture
And she stands up strong and she demands
And they deliver
Yeah she's a fixture
And it's mixture of dumb jealously and fear that I might feel
Should she appear
Just like it hasn't been three years
And there's distance to her voice over the phone
And that's because she stands alone
While I'm still sitting here

Girl you see me here on another quite night
I will wait until another indistinguishable day arrives
I'll sigh when the light is even and bright
Where my life is sweet while it's slightly disappointingly just gliding softly by
Girl you won't wait for me
In some secluded stand of trees
Some Christmas eve some god was kind enough to set aside
Although I love you too, I'm proud of you
God knows I'm feeling really stupid now
For ever having said ""goodbye""

During the fight
I said yeah right
When insisted that I'd visit
That you'd write
Now I know you're working hard so I never hear from you
And that's fine
You look the same on TV as when you where mine

I walk in from the kitchen and I finger the remote control
I watch you from the distance you go walking through the terminal

Looking deep inside but I don't want to look so deep inside yet.

Sit down, sit down on the proud wave bye, 
There might not be another star, farther on the line. 
Look out, look out at each town that glides by, 
And there's another crowd, to drown in crying eyes.

There might just be another star, that's high and far in some other sky.

Lit by cigarettes 
Flaring side by side,

As the only thing that's bright.

And I don't need to cross that bridge.
I find I'm swinging
Or sailing over the pit tonight.
I'm hanging from a hit

To order up and toss across my lips.

What's making all my tears 
Is taking all my fears away. 
But I don't need to cry,
'Cause now I'm clear.

A moth that's swerving through the sage.
A creature crashing from a cage.
A shadow vaporized by a new sun ray.
A day she spends the night, and I can hear her sighing
As she's almost asleep on one side,
And I lie back on my pillow and ask what her husband is like.

And she says, ""I smile polite,
And I tip and tithe,
And I see the sights with a well-trained eye.
But I softly sigh,
Because I'm too much mine without him.

And I lie, reclined where the room is quiet,
And it's quiet at night.
The soft silk is fine
And the waves are white,
But the wind has died without him.

And I scream my smiles,
And I want my wires and I need my stripes.
And I read the lines until I lid my eyes,
And I'm losing time without him.
And I ignite inside
And I flash with fire
And I limp from life
And I'm blazing blind
And I'm surging live
And give up my mind
When with him.

Fades to grey, and is dying.

On Lethe's banks
Wading in

He said
""Before I forget
We need a myth
As we lean in to kiss

To get two nails
Through the wrist
To get covered in blood
And to get covered in spit

And to forgive.""

And if all we're taught is a trick
Why would this feeling persist?
And with the truth closing in
I must insist

Okkervil River,"Abandoned by all her admirers,
Wild white shadow waltz
Stands alone on a stair down the hall,
Just one slip from a trip and a fall.

In a cold morning, holding her lighter,
One  white shadow waltz stirs, sputters, and stalls. 
Then wakes, wavers
And walks right through her prison walls.

She says, ""The doorbell is ringing.
Go see who it is.
Our little island's sinking into mist.""

A day came. A night went. It lightened.
An animal broke his way out,
Moped through the scattering crowd,
And crawled back to his circus shell.

And circling the zoo's screaming clients
Was white shadow waltz,
Deaf to their torn breaths and calls.
(Wait, take a look closer, he's hardly moving at all)

She says, ""There's someone is knocking,
Go see who it is.
Our little world is shaking,
I guess our little world is breaking.""

In the presence of all our despisers
We'll falter and crawl to our bed.
The world is a black shadow bled.
And what is this tune in my head?

She says:
""It's just the white wind when it whimpers.""
""It's just the black rain when it squalls.""
""It's just white meat whistling a waltz.""
""It's just nine hands wiping a white shadow off of the walls.""",White Shadow Waltz

""Da you, do ya want to sail out in the silence?""
I'm asking,
""Will ya, will ya come over here and do me violence?""

""Will ya, will ya stand up tall and be my shelter?""

Into the dust? Into the drink?
You slipped your fears into my head,
Some midnight freeway ride along with Jennifer.

To see the moonlight on the river.

I'm saying,
""Do ya, do ya want to come and make me shiver?""

Squeeze my arm and feel it pull away like someday,
Baby, when we differ.

I'll tell you about the way I really miss him.

Tell them about the way you really loved her.

Do you try to make it right by thinking that if someone else feels it
It's real and it will go away? Do you?

Do you fall short of all that's in your heart?
When your friends think you should be put up you instead take a pause
Do you watch the world get cold and crushed and small?
And when you could do so much you do fuck off?

All the time, every day, every day, all the time, all the time
Every day, every day

Called his father five states to the south, said he was gone
When he could have easily been seen in a Vero Beach Dillard's
Weaving in and out of the racks of beautiful blue men's shirts
Or in South Florida, breezing through the drive-through, easy like a song on the stereo
Letting it all slide like an easy-going god
Or he could have not existed, just a vision of his mother
When she wished it so hard into something she could almost see
Or he could have been a feeling in the air, or the guy who cuts your hair
He could have been anyone, he could even have been me

And me, I don't care if I come back as a single wave
Or an oriole on a spell branch on a tree
Cause I'm not scared to die as long as I know 
that the universe has something really to do with me

So does the singing mouth get sung up
So does the new headline no longer reach the town
So does the rosy fire of the horizon fade into dull grey

She is occupied by 1800 souls

Looked down two long lines to the place they both blurred out
In a cave lab they took some time to reassemble my brain
It would have been better to not have left New York City at all

Days spent floating in the halfbetween
Days spent floating in the halfbetween

Just one day, I want to have died for a day
To disappear between two notes in a twelve-tone scale
Floral Jesus floats in a sky of warm toast
You can only spend so much time, brother, as the world's guest

Days spent floating in the halfbetween
Days spent floating in the halfbetween

It's Hallowe'en, and half Brooklyn is costumed and crying
And I don't want to be a human being
Caught midstreet drinking, the mistake of a late-night zombie
All-night dreams of a sky that's filled with ashes
And three days in till October's ended

Okkervil River,"I'm trying to transmute tap water into wine
Out here, somewhere in this Las Cruces motel room
The floor and ceiling vibrate so I can barely stand
""Calm down"", says the Sky Man, ""you're injured""
I dreamt last night I was halfway up the ladder to heaven
And I shot up this morning with an attitude

I charged through the city and I wandered the streets
Trying to get answers with just my irresistible smile
Shouting ""who will provide the celestial blueprint we need?""

Echoing voices zigzag in the night
In and around forest-view apartments
To crack a bay window and feel the fair winds
She throws back her head and she lifts up her hands
She drives herself into an amphetamine madness
She says ""Tell me, just tell me I was right""
And she's taken all the wrong pills
Her voice begins cracking
Her eyes open, staring at nothing

Do you get what I'm saying?

I feel my heart beating
I wonder how I couldn't keep it from coming on
I want you so much in this wild desert heat that it's scary
But I know I have done so much that could be construed as damage
And there's something bad within me that makes me want to take advantage

When you're tripped up, slipped up
Blonde hair and black-lipped up
With all those silk straps round your ankles
I feel myself convinced we could do whatever all night
It's high time we broke completely free of all control

Hi there! How are you?
Well I feel like my brain just exploded

Tell all your girlfriends
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm someone
Tell them it's breezy and warm down here in this strange place
I will wake in the morning displaying the mark of a new man
Whose whole world has altered in front of his stupefied face

I recall when things were way more fun around here
But the Sky Man reminds me I'm almost a ghost of myself
It seems to me everything fine fell away
I've seen the forests burn and learned you have to arm yourself
It's gonna be a funky fresh Christmas and I dont think I can handle it
When there's so little dignity in anything

Do you feel what I feel?

And Christ, will you watch my back where I do roam?
To a room full of murderous boys with no songs of their own

I feel sick, I feel compromised all the way down
Like an eagle with all of its feathers plucked out

Can you see it in your mind?

I was inconsiderate and cold
But I can change if it's such a big deal to you
I watch the dying sun sink on those jerk-offs in their convertibles
I went a little out of control, oh, with the boys out in the parking lot
Loneliness blinded me, down in the peanut-shell bars

Wild wild nights, heavy romance
There was Percodan spilled on the dancefloor
There were corpses in plain sight and they were just walking around

And the good old boys on their leatherette
Want a woman who was down for whatever
I learned to be compassionate by watching those working girls smile
Heaven was lying 'neath my feet like some wall-to-wall carpeting
And sometimes I believe that there's actually no such thing as love
And one of these days I might not be so good to you

Can you see what I'm saying?

Come and sit where I'm sitting, oh darling
Because now I understand that it wasn't you who held me back
There were forces beyond my control and maybe I held myself down
All of that money it gets so hard to stay yourself around

But girl, give me just one little chance
Well, show me some trust again
I will sing your soul far away, up to a sparkling star

Where all our old frends will be waiting
Hold my hand and sigh in a soft whisper
That you don't just care about getting what you paid for

And on the day that I finally die
Well I just might start screaming
In the one private instant I cross over that unseen line

The last remaining species of birds will be singing away
Singing goodbye to my tastes, and my face, and LA
Goodbye to New Mexico and Texas
When I'm gone, I know there will be some things I miss
Hold me and help me remember

Cause it's almost time

We are born wired-up and our heads are all flooded with messages
That get harder to pick out, except at the start and the end

And you, my weeping friend
I can't wait to describe to you what I'll see up there
Though I'm sure it will be an adjustment
There are voices calling me from down the hallway
There are voices that filter up through the silence
And ""Calm down,"" says the Sky Man, ""you're raving""

So alright

Takes a little time for her to come

While you were wishing you were young
You're just a girl on a street

And you're lying on your side

You're just a girl on a street

With your hair going gray
Eyes like greenish macramé
Hey, the record goes like

I drove in my new sedan
Rain hit my windshield like an open hand
I headed north in a haze of speed
I knew exactly what we need
I stood in a church with a shield on the sign
The smell of incense in the aisles
I felt like a giant spinning wheel
And I know how the minister must feel
And when his wife takes off her gown
And then she lets her long hair down
Lit by the world that's going round

She's just a girl on a street
She's just a girl on a street
She's just a girl

Once I died in a dream
And the world without me went fine
And then years went by

The clouds are aquamarine
The architect remains unseen
I'll live my life out on your street
Up where the bluebirds fly

Help me to the other side

I'll give those harp strings a strum
I'm gonna hit on that drum
I'm gonna wait for my girl to come

Seven smudgy mirrors

Saw the babies all bathed in champagne
So many miles of dirt I traveled
Just to park here in your shade

In the shadow ravine

And they'll be coming to collect within the next few hundred weeks

I get a little soft whistle in my ears now

Would you stand by the high prison gate for me?

Dirty bastard from the wu-tang squad
Can I get raw, yes I get dirty to the floor
Rhymes, hittin' on your mind, you could never ignore
Hip-hop to me is like a place to be
My specialty from me to you is emcee
Say what you want to say, baby say
I flip the microphone-ah, any day
I'm mad swift because I got that gift of gab
Niggaz get mad, your ass stink never had
This talent that I got will resound the spot
Mc's, you got paid a lot
You ever notice a black man damn mostly slams
When it come to the money yo it ain't funny
It's what you gotta do what you got to do
C'mon, can I get a wu-tang
Wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang
Wu, tang, wu, tang, wu, tang, it's on your brain
I get riggy diggy raw when it's time to get
On the dancefloor shotgun kill the shit
Blow, then you won't step to me
Thinking is he really raw as he said he'd be
If I wasn't really raw, standing here on the floor
You'd be like booooo he ain't no hardcore
Niggaz play like they live but won't survive
Jumpin up and down ticklin that jive when you ticklin gab
I'm an average man, g-o-d fan
Let it be known who's the champ, wu-tang clan!
It's coming through and wu, boy it's bad too!
Throw your hands in the air, if you don't care
Who, the ol dirty bastard be
Oh me on my, you be hoppin on my shit just like a fly

[Bring the ammonia] make sure he sniffs the right amount 

Wake him up and then I ask him 

Why did he intend this -- 

competition to get an ass kickin so tremendous 

Boy you shouldn't bother this 

Leave me alone like the [son said G or he'll be fatherless!] 

I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco 

Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Crisco 

and MC's start to vanish 

[I stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin spanish! 

Yo he wasn't from Panama 

I asked him how he get so dark, the nigga said suntama! 

He responded so fast, you made me laugh] 

Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH [then I scared-his ass!] 

[Kick the hundred strongest rhymes 

I brought out the punk in him 

Caught him with a strong five deadly venom 

Told him enter the Wu-Tang 

Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush the shit you bring] 

I watch your ass take a big fall, why?! 

My Main Source, is like a friendly game of stickball 

And as you step up to bat man [I play the riddler] 

You try to do me for a rhyme [then I'll change to Hitler] 

Go out like Nazi; you'll be wishin your fuckin ass stayed 

home and played [Yahtzee!] 

Or watchin Happy Days sweatin [Poxie]

And want to perform a massacre 

Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular 

Crush the person who did em, well you just better 

So I'm stepping to your [raggedy ass jetta] 

Put the pedal to the metal 

You and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle 

as I [pass the bone, kicks your every measure] 

It's not a Newport but it's still live with pleasure 

[C'mon don't be silly, just a bag of sensimilli 

Rolled up in a] Motown Philly 

[I used to write all the time when I smoked 

Grab the mic, then I kinda like went for broke 

With visually concepts strongest rhymes and biceps 

Lyrically speakin, three to four rhymes then choke 

Some think they be harmin this, claimin they be bombin this] 

But they still remains a-nom-ynous 

I pull strings like Jimi Hendrix 

Ride more beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks 

I teach the truth to the youth, I say [hey youth] 

Here's the truth, better start wearing [bullet proof] 

Arm yourself with a shield 

[Before you get trapped up] just like the Children in the Cornfield",Damage

Verse Three: Method Man 
This one here's for my people, my people 
Enter the 36 chambers, the sequel 
Part two, for me and the cipher troop 
With the Teflon lyrics that you can't get through 
With the twenty-two automatic rap you pack, what? 
You ain't hittin with that wack shit you kickin 
Straight from the beginning, of the game 
All the way to the ninth inning, I bring the pain 
Dark like the midnight train on the track by the RZA 
Diesel like Arnold Schwarzanegger 

Outro: Ol Dirty Bastard 
The hardware, choose the hardware 
Ask you a question, test the Ason 
Extra extra, read the drama and thennn another one 
which you intrigue, do your rap fatigue in the...

[Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Approach the school nine thirty, you're late
This time happy the solution was my date.
Get in your class, walk to your chair
Pop is all you see and then occasionally stare
At the teacher, more, tune in to we're clocking ya.
Lean back at this girl kept clockin' ya hood
Simulated from a (sensimilia) blonde,
Tell the young girl ""Baby, you're the one I want.""
She doesn't respond, pretends to ignore
So you say to yourself, it be her old and sore mentally
Pitchin' lies, the aim on the board as hot and wild pussy
You cannot afford this
Oooh, what slim and trim was my inner friend
Dear, quietly I want him to know my boots,
To rap out loose in my class,
But I kept sayin' the size of my dick and that ass.
So I turned around to arrange a date.
Swinging episode, baby number one's gotta say it
She popped a gum, cold twist to come
I said ""Baby, how you feel?""
She said ""Sure""
Then I said ""sure"", I just found my thrill
Wear it in the classroom, know I'm Blueberry Hill
Cause what I said just bottled her hate.
She put her face on the chest, this is what the bitch said:
""Because of you I ain't hurting, but then my within my heart
Cause no, I'm not right to be flirtin, but our relationship has to start.
You're the one that I'm clocking, stop or you could stop mockin'
Don't want you to see me cry, this is why, this is why, this is why!""

[Verse Two: Killah Priest]
I met a girl named Chandra, from way down yonder
The apple of my eye had a Snapple and some fries
Forgot the catsup, that's when I pressed up
""I've been watching you mowing your lawn""
The thoughts were flowin, while I'm holding the palm
""Hey what's that on your menu?"", from there we continued
And talk about this and that we chit and chat
Sipped on the Coke then I stroked the back
As she giggled and I wiggled to the bra
She said ""nah!"", that's when I noticed her pah
Big Tank, who did nothing but the spank
At parties, drink Bacardi and didn't think
Just act silly, with his brother Willy
Another hillbilly gettin ill with the Philly
And moonshine, but it's a new time of day
On the stoop doing the Patty Duke
OK, it's like that old flip flaps through the shower caps
The platform shoes to Apple Jacks
Chub chub!!

[Interlude: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Yo, you niggaz, niggaz be actin like
They be lovin them, them them fancy bitches
I, I likes me a nasty bitch
Bitch that's willing to do anything at any given time
Bitch gotta be nasty 'cause I'm a nasty nigga
I do anything baby, I wouldn't give a fuck what it was
I'll, ah, anything - I'm a nasty motherfucker girl

[Verse Three: Ol Dirty Bastard]
I'm just sittin' right, in my class at a quarter to ten right?
Waiting patiently for the class to begin right?
Teacher says ""open up your texts, you! read the first paragraph on
Oral sex!""
I said ""Oral sex!, what kind of class is this?!""
Yo, next to me said ""what's wrong with you man?, this is a lesson that
Makes you feel fine, kinda ease your nerves and relax your mind!""
I said ""Don't try to use no hypnotic spell!""
She said ""Be my assistant, I'd show rather tell!""
My knees buckled heart started to drop
My dick grew to a size that my nerve couldnt stop
I tried to run! She yelled out ""freeze!""
Pulled down my draws, dropped to her knees
Ripped of my draws as if she had claws
Broke the rules that defined sex laws
She responded quick, with a slick, welcoming kiss and a ice cream lick
Oooh I begged, I begged, ""Easy on my balls, they're fragile as eggs.""

[one two, one two] 
Yo, we gonna bring it down, to Harlem World 
Bust your fucking chops 
Yo I remember when niggaz was looking at themselves 
on Farmers, motherfuckers was wearing double goose 
Motherfuckers acting all rowdy 
I'm saying though 
[one two, one two] 
The whole trip that was never shown 
I'm saying though 
See cause the knife, is the knife, of all knives 
Most people gather around

Is something, that you won't know

But never... come back

So basically, what the Ol motherfucking Dirty Bastard is saying 
is that if you fuck around [one two, one two] 
You're gonna get yo' ass fucked up

Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard

I went to a city "" "" 
And I saw a Wu-Tang show "" "" 
Now I always wanted "" "" 
To get, with, the band "" "" 

But niggaz was singing they own songs 
being in they own worlds 
So I guess I, I guess I, RARAARRRRAAHHH!!! 
The terminology, the psychology 
you still expect me to accept 
Do what I say off of TV, kay 
with the button on record and the other on 
thus I press pause for a serious cause 
to respect an intellect with this gratifying 
now that I'm ready let the music begin 
as I detect what I wrote with my 
through the time that I spent, money that I lent 
rap records went up just to bounce 
then became a new way to get paid 
they said ""Rhyming on the mic is the number one"" 
Then a brother get the feeling that he want to play cool 
you discombumberated diabolical fool 
Hog-flesh MC, go play in the mud 
Another 20th century, modern day 
Cannibal, humanoid, underground 
chud broke loose from the god damn 
dope-fiend addict why you walk with 
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
when the MC's came, to live out their name 
roast rocking rhymes that was always 
when I elevated, and mastered the time 
You was stimulated from the high post 
You got shot cause you knew you were rot 

Verse Two: 
You're not the king of the diss 
Youse a queen of a bitch 
And like a homosexual 
Your ass always switch 
Niggaz wake up in the morning 
You're ugly-ass Gods 
Got slob around your mouth 
Blue code in your eye 
You can't smile your teeth too gritty 
Can't even move, drawers too shitty 
(you know what else) You're shaped like a thistle 
The holes in your drawers when you fuck been there since 
YOU DUCKING SUCKING MOTHERFUCKING COLD-HEARTED FAGGOT 
Sperm germs on your worm DISINTEGRATED MAGGOTS 
Repeat your rhymes all the time like a FUCKING parrot

Living in the gutter sewer seven pipe eleven 
You wear your socks twelve days in a row 
Turn them on the other side so the dirt won't show 
Go to school, take a shit, don't wipe your ass 
Claiming on another sucka nigga in your class 
YOU want to BATTLE? 
Is it the pork on your fork, or the swine on your mind 
Make you rap against a brother with a weak-ass rhyme 
Swine on your mind, pork on your fork 
Make you imitate the brother in the state of New York 
Chain on your BRAIN, that drove you inSANE 
When you tried to CLAIM, for the talent and the FAME 
Not in the GAME, yet and still you CAME 
Suffer the PAIN, as I demolish your NAME 
Not like Betty Crocker, baking cake in the OV 
Saying this is dedicated to the one I love 
Not a swine or dove, from the heaven's up above 
When I rap, people CLAP, so the pushers they shove 
When I rhyme I get LOOSE, better than Mother Goose 
Rock the mic day and NIGHT, so you see I'm the JUICE 
Like the two-six-EIGHT, politicians demonstrate

Now hold up hold up hold up hold up 
What y'all niggaz don't seem to hear

I want to give a shout out to my nigga Door, Door, Door 
Buddah Monk, Buddah Monk, Buddah Monk 
Yo, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

For one thing let me introduce myself my name is Mr. Russell Jones 
Excuse me for that one I had to let that one low ah
And tonight, you're going to see that you never seen before 
Somethin' that, that nobody in the history of rap ever set thyself to do 
This fuckin' guy, that I speak to you about, is somethin' crazy 
He's somethin' insane, he's the greatest performer every-since 
Uh, what's the guys name? (Ol' Dirty!) 
Ah, da, ahh, James Brown, he's bad, and he's a cool guy 
And you'll really need him, I mean need to really get to know him

I'm tired of this shit, remember the time I told y'all 
When I got burnt, gonorrhea 
Well this bitch, there's a new bitch goddamnit 
Oh, bitch burnt me again with gonorrhea 
So I didn't get burnt one time I got burnt actually two times 
When you really look at it 
Yeah, I love the girl but I had to cut the bitch off 
Yeah the bitch died, I killed the bitch 
She suffered a long pain bitchy ass go bitch had to go 
I, I knew the bitch for ten minutes of her life 
But the pussy was good! Yes the pussy was good! 
I just want you to know girl! 
That I dedicated, this song, well this song really was written 
By Blowfly, and I want all y'all to hear this shit 
It's just a poem that I writ for you girl 

The first time, ever you sucked my dick 
Thank you thank you! 
I felt, the earth tremble, under my balls 
Somethin' shot out of me real fast 
First time 

Nah I'm just kidding wit y'all 
How y'all feelin', listen to the album 'cause it's bangin'

See let a nigga come through with that bullshit
Anytime you pop that shit nigga

See them knows that this is something you can't fuck
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
Always
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!
Where you reside... motherfucker! How you live? How you seeeeeeee...

Yo! Niggaz grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the Zoo brought me in
Now bring em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in
His brain! And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like, mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin Platoon
Stale cells, just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya down stairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist
With the cleverest rhyme
Erupt to deduct your fuckin mind

[12 O'Clock - Brooklyn Zu]
Fuck shit up on the hurry-up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a muck
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump
Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!!

The shit I'm kickin, send it to your MOMS for Christmas
And tell her Shorty Shit Stain sent it
Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed HOME instead of picking up a microphone
But if you want to run on up, like you TOUGH
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore
Stuff, I shine like twenty-four carat

Drugged up from sniffin, you're the one who's riffin
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin
While you sleep I be the God on point, with Scottie Pippen
As I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, wayyy like Bo

Relaxin sittin back sellin good tracks and
Again and again when I rock the jam

See murder which is caused
When you fuck with the negative and positive charge
Then they came up, out my garage
With the hit that's gonna be large
Tired of sittin on my fuckin ass
Niggas I know, be runnin around with mad fuckin cash
Who the fuck wanna be an emcee
If you can't get paid, to be a fuckin emcee?
I came out my momma pussy I'm on welfare
Twenty-six years old still on welfare!
So I gotta get paid fully
Whether it's truthfully or untruthfully
With my boston bloodthirsty process
P-e-a-c-e

Move em in move em in
Move em out move em out
Stick it up raw hide!

Yea, gotta come back to attack
Killin' niggas who said they got stacks, cause I don't give a fuck
I wanna see blood, whether it's period blood
Or bustin' your fuckin' face, some blood!!
I'm goin' out my fuckin' mind!
Every time I get around devils
Let me calm down, you niggas better start runnin'
Cause I'm comin', I'm dope like fuckin heroin
Wu-tang bloodkin', a goblin, who come tough like lambskin
Imagine, gettin 'shot up with ol dirty insulin
You bound to catch aids or somethin'
Not sayin' I got it, but nigga if I got it you got it!

Yo, check the bulletproof fly shit, strong like thai stick
Then I'll remain to tear your frame, while I freaks it
Like some fly new sneaks and shit
Now eat my shit, bitch tried to creep and got hit
Now regulate, and I'll be out to set up a date
Wu-tang, is bangin' like a ron g tape
Rza pump the shit just like a shotty
Watch me run it john gotti
Collidin' on the track, like gin and watty
Check the calender, I warn any challenger
To step up feel the blast from the silencer

Move em in move em in
Move em out move em out
Stick it up raw hide!

Comin' soon to a theatre near you it be the wu
Yeah find yourself in the square and see it's true
Actual facts to snack on and chew
My positive energy sounds peace to you
A wise man killed one horse and made glue
Wicked women puttin' period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches brew?
I fear for the eighty-five that don't got a clue
How could he know what the fuck he never knew?

Ol' Dirty Bastard,"Now number two, practiced the snake style
	He was known as the snake spirit
	He had the speed of a snake

[Intro/Verse One: Killah Priest]
Niggaz is like serpents out there
[snake style, no one could compete]
Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out
Yo, yo

It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong 'cause his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve, and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He was just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standin when the nigga started bustin
Blood started to flood the floors, by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we plan to make grands of our home
[Number two]

[Verse Two: The RZA]
Jagged edge, rockin God, hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manor
And on the block he was called by the momma's and the grandma's
Indecent, heathen, juvenile delinquent
His weekends was frequently, locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggaz he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggaz be lookin out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot
[Number two, the snake]

[Verse Three: Masta Killa]
Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S.
To receive the gold that he couldn't achieve
in his country, even though he sold mad weed
for the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggaz actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
at the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the CREAM
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggaz I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin through the streets of Medina I stand firm
Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
without a doubt, niggaz who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
cause a snake can't be reformed so I wait
Comin in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
and you don't know no fuckin lessons?

Slip into my killings, then I slays and you're helpless

Ol' Dirty Bastard,"See let a nigga come through with that bullshit
Anytime you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?

Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
(See them knows that this is something you can't fuck, always)
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker?

Where you reside motherfucker?
How you live? How you see?
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth

Dunn can you hear me? Raw is how I'ma inflicting this
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite my styles I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

Yo, straight actin' live about them hell fires
A known mental killer, or thriller, assassin of terror
The hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order start the mission

Travel like the speed of wind, through the valley of sin
I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity
This is, Brooklyn, Zu

I get down I get down I crack your fuckin crown
Lay around and watch some real niggaz break ground
I can't shop 'cause every bro blowin' up the spot
Hit rocks and niggaz know

Yo, niggaz grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the zoo brought me in
Now bring 'em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in his brain

And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin' Platoon

Stale cells, just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya down stairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist
With the cleverest rhyme erupt to deduct your fuckin' mind

Fuck, shit up on the hurry up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a muck
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump

Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin' powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks

Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut
Ol' Dirty Bastard live and uncut
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a

Got more props than the President
My hardcore represent, blowin' niggaz back who never had this
'Cause I'm gifted, so you can get wrapped
The shit I'm kickin', send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her, Shorty Shit Stain sent it

Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
'cause niggaz rap styles just down is aspired
You shoulda stayed home instead of picking up a microphone

But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore
Stuff, I shine like twenty-four carat

Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggaz, you're trippin'

Drugged up from sniffin', you're the one who's riffin'
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin'
While you sleep I be the God on point

With Scottie Pip pen as I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin', maxin'
Relaxin', sittin' back sellin' good tracks

And again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see 'em up in the air? Throw up your hand
Introducin', one-man band in town
It's wild, with the style couldn't stand nigga

When the jump, stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC's come at the
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass, on a whore shot

Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer, money maker, Brooklyn, challenger
That I lay down like towel, then I get higher

Here comes the ill, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin' broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers

Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill

Hit you with the blast

I could take a punch or get hit by a car
Could go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact it's what I won't talk about
Pop a word out of trace just to be in the house

So pimped out about my big spendish
I got a 20, 6 O'Clock extra chrystall
Anybody dat want to pop off at the lip

Three soldiers from the East, South and West
Street soldiers holdin' it down for they vets

Light it up, let it cook, look in the mirror, let me crush
Don't worry about how it looks, put some momey on my books
Only God can judge me now
That's when I heard the click click, I was Christened
I ain't with them are you wid that
Let them whistles out them pistols
Let loose on them troops and then shake 'em like Cherok smoke
I slam dunk 'em like Shaq

Stuck on the grind, crackheads cookin' my pies
Startin' off on the 1-2-5, the block's mine
Bucket the spine, DH tryna tap my line
Stop my producitons, want to know my money discussions
Who I roll wid, ""buy so many cars is he legitin' of my dick""
It didn't matter when I ain't have shit
They done watch me in helicopters, parklin' in my crib
All I want to feed is my kids, no time to do a bid
Feel me, I forced the whole guns a while for my ones
Didn't sell drugs, where the money come from?
No school, no job, no bitch, no food, fuck that
Do what I do to make my shit true
And I make it hard on them boys who blew they cats charges
If I go to jail you know I'm blowin' on the Sergeants

Party amps gettin' sniffed up now wit it too
When there's somethin' in my camp, a wireless amp
High as a ramp, speak to Wu like stamp
The wet got me damp, pussy darker than lamp
Moses you don't want to 'ttempt, I see all fans
I'm too drunk too, now you like ""Move!""

Catch bitches like trout, get drunk, won't stop
I'm gettin' this money, called gettin' honey
Streets of Brooklyn and ain't a damn thing funny

I was checkin' out my melody before The Blueprint
Felony, a nuisance, huggin' me and my two cents
Don't double the six takes, never did a mixtape
But rather a chick take but waste any weather we get cake
I let rats have it, fuck these rap faggots!
Everybody want the kid dead like Pat Garrett
I'm a goon, speak with a mellow tone
Rock yellow stones, gun longer than a broom!
'cause felon on the ride is long due and soon
Out again like boom, government comin' soon
Anything less is uncivilized like it tastes mad
I'm a shoot a youth's Sajak, cooler than a mayback
Arubu known to collect, twistin' up that haze black
And Backwood on that, hoodrat, I stay strapped
P.P., don't carry that weight

Nothing can change it, finally made it, so divine

Yo, I sat around the illest villains
Campaignin' while we all G off
Automatic mayors, now we ain't playin'
Wolves start scheemin', violate me in the rain
Get more respect, rob Marvin Gaye on 'em
Gold, black, beige on 'em, heavy gauge
Gettin' blazed, all that money, but he ain't even shaved
This a new flavor, bigger vets, bigger begets
Bigger papes, god damn it, nigga got saved
Three or more, two thousand four Blazers
Lookin' good, it's all hood, just analyze amazed
Peace, let's mozy and swaze', y'all

Yo, I was born on the same day as Dr. Seuss
Plenty of friends, henny and gin, who got the juice?
Let's get drunk, in this motherfucker, let's get pumped
I need that funk, like I ain't took a bath in a month
You can find me where the thugs be at, club be at
A fact, I love women, 'cause they love me back
The name's Johnny, they used to call me sucker for love
But now I'm grimey, cops searchin' motherfuckers for drugs
Give me that buzz, that calm a nigga, dimes and doves
At four twenty, when niggaz knew what time it was
A shot of Remy, in my system, I'm buzzed
Then baby, I ain't just a little war from unplugged
Haha, you know I, crack myself up, sometimes with no excuses
Like every nigga that done time, I didn't do it
Meth the Magnificent, not Jeff
I see the game done gone imputent, soft and suspect

Yo, silence on Smith with six shots, lick shots
Leave ya head like a Shaolin monk with six dots
Hit a gush, twistin' a sweet switcher
In search for Bobby the Digital, bitch, not Bobby Fisher
Head full, with a Grey Goose and Redbull
I came for, a beer, weed, plus a bed full
Of dimepiece, model type bitches, who mind they business
Blow my dick, like birthday cake wishes
My warrior's scornful, hard to respond to
Dirt McGirt, be sailin' boat and in Honolulu
Brooklyn Zu, wild like Chaka Zulu
Brooklyn Zu, shots will go right through you
Touch me in Cali, or the streets of Mauwi
In the two thousand six pitch black Audi
Drivin' by bitches, I'm like howdy
Doody, to you some beauty bitches crowd me

Yo! Met this bitch by the name of Subie
She was a bad bitch, she had a big ol' booty
She got me setting up when I went to the projects
Bad ass bitch she was the one to holla at
Had another bitch by the name of Pricilla
You know that bad bitch, she taste like vanilla
In my car looking good like that
Getting money, making records, down with rap
Saying to myself, no one can defeat me
I got my dick out, see'mon bitch beat me!
Let that shit out, go down your throat
Nigga like me, never miss a note
If rain I got coats so I can't get soaked
Make a nigga know I take's that dough
Get high like Supa Fly
I'm the best, that's the shit now I don't know why

[Verse - Pusha T]
Bitch please! Come live out your fantasies
Dollars and diamonds, like on my Ice Creams
1K jeans wit belt and white tee
I sling white balls give fiends a pipe dream
Well in this scene in my british queen
The ignition's on the left but yes it's the right theme
Engine full of horses, chariots the king
The be	's in the middle like it's tittie fucking the wings
Pornographic, the voice so drastic
Without a +Reasonable Doubt+ I'm +classic+
Cake-aholic the same way - that Dame Dash is
But I bakes my cakes, bag 'em up in plastic (UHH!)
Halloween 'em up, trick yeah I treat 'em up
Lou' Vuitton a toe, watch how the hoes eat 'em up
Ma I said I'm finger licking good, ah yes we Re
As if invisible Juice, you niggaz can't see me!

She so fine, all she need now is a baller
Who better fit the bill? I myself, I'm a starter
In the game, you could tell by the charter
G4, Lear, or the Yacht in the harbor
Mama come to papa, don't it feel at home here?
All the comforts of it, you ain't got a care
Don't love me wit your heart, love me from a far
Now sit, look pretty like you came wit the car
Diamonds in the ear lobe, wrapped in the mink
Condo chillin, I be tickle pink
Not worrying bout the next bitch or what people think
If I say they don't exist, POOF the extinct
Mama - no! we don't need the drama
All we need is south beach, puffing on Habanas
You just strike a match girl, do your man a honors
Next week Cali, we up in Las Palmas

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Two steps from the border line
Anything closer will kiss the nine
Think I'm out the game? You out of your mind
'cause I stay on track, like transit line
Keep it nappy or braided up
Dirty in the cockpit, blazin' up
Stop frontin' when you made it up
Tellin' all my hoes, you can't spray it up
Hah, huggin' nuts like tighty whites
Still trickin' on hoes like Heidi Fleiss
You know why niggas don't give you much respect
'cause they seen you gettin' slapped with the empty gat
Know Dirt, like bow know death
When I'm huntin' down, birds of rap
Hate Dog, 'cause I ate your cat
And you can eat my ass and have a coke with that
Use a spoon, unless you want a fork
Pull my dick out, watch the room get dark
Stay high with the zombie walk
Gotta sit my ass down, like Rosa Parks
[Chorus 2X: high pitched female (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Dirty Dirty, you tell me how you do it
It look so easy, like there was nothin' to it
But they don't understand, about the Dirty M.C.
It's the.... (Ohhhhhhhhhh), new track by ODB
[Rhymefest]
They say dirt and sunshine make the flowers grow
I say, fuck a bitch raw and drive your nut on the floor
Call it what you want, you son of a hoe
I was 5 percent til' white bitches came and dropped it down to four
3, 2, 1, I can lick the sun with my tongue
Pull it out and smack a nigga, just for thinkin' I'm done
Shut your trap, razor blade cut your wrap
Fat girls seen my comin', started tuckin' their flab
Rhymefest and Dirt Dog, gon' spark this
The day he got to heaven, track mud on the carpets
Hot like the hot potato, you niggas ain't motto
You hot as the spot, yo
Go to the show, for hot dogs and nacho's
This me and Dirt Dog's style, it's not yours
[Chorus 2X}
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
What can make a hoe, look more cuter
But, Hennessey shots, and smoke more Buddha
[Rhymefest]
I don't know Dirt, now she look like Zab Judah
Test my manhood, go get my dick ruler
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now you hungry, want to eat right through her
But you better first track for a noter
Like does she have a best friend, or I taught her
Has she ever tried fuckin' under water
[Rhymefest]
Down down with the fishes, deep sea dishes
I ain't a genie, bitch, I don't respect your wishes
This trick ain't fuckin' me though, god damn
Something very wrong, I don't understand
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Misinterpetate, let me break it down
Two pulls make the your merry go round
Touch your toes, show me that rose
Butt naked, in a Wu-Tang pose
Wide open, girl, everything goes
Real freaky, when you powder that nose
[Rhymefest]
Keep it and move, I sleep in the nude
I'm keepin' it rude, pull out my dick and pee in the food
On the way to the stars, don, where's the map?
We fuckin' there, and we gonna fuck back

Rest in peace, I know you heaven right now
Trackin' mud on the carpet, so, we gon' let ya
Do what you do it's the ohhhhhhh
Don't forget the crew, it's the Wuuuuuu
I thought you knew, it's the Ol' Dirt Dog

'86 was the year that it started
Crack hit the states, and my hood got to poppin'
Back then, you had to catch it with narcotics
Without a doubt, Brooklyn had the hardest projects
Nowadays, if a nigga say you got it
You be sitting in the country, with like 3 or 4 charges
Young when started, but I had a talent
To get this past and drunk, 'cause I took it as a challenge
The older niggas game me much as I can handle
Cop the eagle, started jackin' with the green New Balance shit
I'm feelin' clean, I was only thirteen
With the heavy starch, on my Bugle Boy Jeans
My name's spelled right on my four finger ring
It was Dirt then, 'cause McGirt you ain't seen

Niggas comin' up here, this is where the G's at
Look here, more money, more problems, my ass
You'se a naive cat, if you still believe that, for real
That's a trick to try to keep you where you at
All content, while niggas ridin' Bentley's and Maybach
Think I'mma lay back, playa, forget it
First hundred G's, I see, nigga, I'm tryin' to flip it
And that's some real shit, not just a lyric
Drop a couple open cases, not too specific

From one corner to another, uh, uh

Uh yeah, yo, yo,
Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The supreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin' on this cream

Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million refugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top squeezers
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa

Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on

I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin' it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo

Behind closed doors hittin' truth to the sea floor

While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores

Showcase your finest is losin fast in the horse race
Two faced, gettin' defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screw face

Well, I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin' what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin' out
Partyin' with girls that never die, you see I was
Pickin' on the small fries, my campaign tellin' lies

Was just spreadin' my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holdin' the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understand
It's all together now, in the hood

Run away with me to another place

I'm sittin' in my west, I'm analyzin' thoughts 
I'm sippin' off a quart that I just had bought 
I'm thinkin' of the moment, things soar in that head 
I feel assurin' durin', also glad 
Yes, feel assured by knowin' I won 
'cause there's no one who can fuck wit A-Sun 
I'm not bein' pushy but I'm born to boss 
You need A-Sun, oh yes, well of course 
Don't see the riot, everyone keeps quiet 
If you don't believe nigga, get hyper and try it 
Yes it is me, a total fresh MC 
Yo, I'm born to be, MC history 
Rhyming on time because that's the deal 
You're only as fresh as your ass feel 
Other MC's, you are bound to fall 
'cause your real world is not a world at all

Blaze cut faster than a fairy slasher 
Tai-chi, Kung Fu fighting, ODB hands quick as lightenin' 
Techique too deadly 
Iron fist blew the pawn, switch styles like lay long 
Let's get it on, heavy chow broke, it's not 'bout 
Shadow boxin', better punch, you need oxegen, try again 
When you catch the second wind, I'll break you in 

Approach the mic slow, it's about to blow 
One foot crow crane, anti-chain movement 
Restore the ming, some take this thing for joke 
Serious men deep in thought, misunderstood, held the fork 
He's too defensive, too mean, you didn't, now it's a scene 
These cats over here got glock holdin' him down 
These niggas scheming, I'm seeing everything 
Ten steps ahead, on the wall smokin' my 
Agent high told best friend of the wine 

Still drunk offa cheap wine 
Holdin' front lines, niggas want to front, fine 
Fuck wit me and mine, rain on your sunshine 
Swine nigga's come as hard as a pork rind 
Can you dig it? Only five percent live it 
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it 
Now fuck around 

Repeat 1 
Down wit the all and together down crew 
The jizza, the rizza, me of course too 
The thing I'm analyzing is strickly Hip Hop 
That's what's made, well made is on my workshop 
You was unable plus earn advance 
Just to touch the untouchable kip hop dance 
They're sayin' of the utmost, truly I'm the utmost 
Have you ever caught the hip hop holy ghost 
Man, I mean really, that shit is mad hype 
Especially when you find yourself rhymin' over mics 
I became a wrecker through my amplifier 
Break it down base, treble through my dancer 
That's one new dance, it's to my Black Magic music 
It's not classic, arabic, or basic 
It's strickly thickly, dirty and districkly 
If not don't you pick me and forget me

While I be coming with deeper and more shit
Enough to make you break and shake your ass
As I create rhymes good as a Tastycake makes

This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol

Not seen and heard, no-one knows
You forget niggas be quiet as kept
Now you know nothing
Before you knew a whole fucking lot
Your ass don't wanna get shot
A lot of MC's came to my showdown
And watched me put your fucking ass low down
As you can go, below zero

Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure (Brooklyn Zoo)

That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MC's I'll be burning, burning hot
Whoa-hoa-hoa! Let me like slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Nigga get up, act like a pig trying to hog shit
So I take yo ass out quick
The mics, I've had it my nigga, you can suck my dick
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
Blown to death
You got shot cause you knock knock knock
""Who's there?"" Another motherfucking hard rock

Every time you fuck a nigga, he dies fast
And you won't last

It's hard for you to walk, 'cause you stuck up in your ass
Don't ask me for no cash
You better not be tellin me to give them no cash

You ain't givin up, a manicure
Suckin my dick is gonna be your chore
If you don't, you're punishment
You can't get off until ya suck my dick
Physically I operate your brain to function
Give me anything, that I wantin
ALL GIRLS WANNA FUCK ME EVERYDAY
And give me that, the money
Don't even know what happens naturally
Especially when I'm playin with the chemistry
THE MONEY COMIN TO ME FIRST
You gonna keep dyin til you die from thirst

Many a time I bet my life that I could make it rain
One time I had a whole town beatin' the drums
And singin' through the night
We watched the morning sun come up and not a raincloud in sight

I knew if I didn't make some weather and see them storm clouds gather
I'd be run out of town when the sun went down
Covered up in tar and feathers
I was on my knees and I raised my hands to the Heaven's high
I felt this rain like a sigh of relief come pourin' from the sky

Don't try and start another religion"", oh, oh

I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right

Tanked up out on Elm Street, looking for a ride
Stretched out on concrete, running out of pride
You need help dear, and I'm sincere, let me be the one
I'm not a big star but I've got a big car, you're too weak to run

You could save the highway if you'd crash with me tonight

I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right

Someday when we're older, deep in loneliness
Things we said today won't matter, no one could care less
We're just shadows, just ask Plato, it was all a dream
I've had it with Dallas, let's burn down the Palace, I'll bring the kerosene

I could save this song if I'd just sing real loud tonight

Keeps on handing me the old crow

Old 97's,"Well the room was Mediterranean and the meaning was two-fold
We got busted by your mother though you're 29 years old
And the pictures wrapped in cellophane like sandwiches or stamps
Burned holes in my pockets and in the inseam of my pants

And your graduation date was in Absentia today
And you wished you was there with her but you told her not to stay
And the redwoods and the oak trees and the double yellow lines
Although they're in perfect symmetry they keep imperfect time

I don't mean no, I don't mean maybe
I'm indefinitely, I'm indefinitely
I don't mean no, I don't mean maybe
I'm indefinitely, I'm indefinitely

Well the car was Japanese perhaps, Hungarian and blue
And it followed you down highway one, kept almost out of view
And it symbolizes something although you don't know what it is
Like loneliness and longing for a future perfect kiss

I don't mean no, I don't mean maybe
I'm indefinitely, I'm indefinitely
I don't mean no, I don't mean maybe
I'm indefinitely, I'm indefinitely

Well second hand's the first thing that you see when you wake up
And it rolls by in slow motion and you rub it for good luck
Time is gonna tell your little secrets to me
There's a frightened girl inside of you and I'm gonna set her free

I don't mean no, I don't mean maybe
I'm indefinitely, I'm indefinitely

There's no rest for the restless, so I doubt that you'll sleep well

'Cause lately I ain't been too much to see
I'd bring some girl home but then I'd have to pay her
Won't you come home with me Rosemary?

When I walked in the bar you tried to hide
But I took my old place right by your side
You looked like a raccoon with those circles round your eyes
If my offer is improper, please come home with me tonight

Well, I'll prick myself and see if blood comes out
I'll play until the whole damn tape runs out
I'll put on that Ray Charles record, if you'll make some drinks

Hover above her as she's checking you out
Wander around her but never sleep with her
Watch her though windows as she pours herself out

You're scoring her shipwrecks with fiddles and dobios
Laugh at the plainclothes police the crowd
Carry her under like water or ether
Spirit her off when the music's too loud

And it's written all over the face of the daughter
Of the mayor of Marble Falls
When she winds up in debt and down doing the Valium waltz

Pine for a time when your mind is made up
Wonder how long ‘fore you're pear-shaped and wrinkled

And meddling in other folks' affairs

To carry on that way

Strikes the gentleman across the eye

If it don't concern you, let it alone

Old Crow Medicine Show,"Well I come from the valley, I'm a rebel boy. 
Born on the banks of the Shenandoah. 
In sixty-one, I went to the war, 
To win one for Virginia! 
Ya my brother went first and they called me to. 
I was green as clover in the morning dew. 
So I marched to the drum and I sang to the tune. 
Carry me back to Virginia! 

Fire in the cannon, water in the well, 
Raced through the valley with a rebel yell. 
I learned right quick how to march like hell and affix that bayonet. 

Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 

With a sword and a saddle, 
Powder in the gun. 
We thought for a minute our fight was done. 
So they lined us up to the metals arm, 
And hammered us into the quicksand. 
Then they burned that valley in a blaze of fire, 
Cut through the lands like a red hot iron. 
Til the men took cover where the horses piled, 
Then we shivered and then hold against them. 

But the war raged on like flames of hell, 
We dug through the pockets of the ones who fell, 
Dressed in rags and we ate that grass 
When they cut off our legs we cried! 

Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 

And they died in the valley, 
Died in the swamp, 
On the banks of the river where the whitetail jumped. 
Died in the ditches, 
Died in the fields, 
In the belly of a wagon for a woman's to heal 
Died in the war, 
Starved in the camps. 
Locked in the prisons of a meaner man. 
Spilled our blood in the fight to defend 
And to bury the tome of a-dixieland! 

Down in Alabama, 
Down in Caroline, 
Way down in Gerogie, on the Tennesee line. 
We fought for the rebels, and Robert E. Lee, 
Now we want to go home to Virginia. 
Say we want to go home to Virginia! 
 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Carry me back to Virginia. 
Won't ya carry me back? 
Won't ya carry me back? 
I wanna be buried in Virginia!",Carry Me Back to Virginia

I can only paint deadly smiles on my poor face,

How could you leave us so suddenly?
How will we live?
How could you leave us so suddenly?
How will I live?

I'm so angry with you,
How could you
Hide your pain this way?

I'm so angry with myself,
How could I
Be so blind?

Every morning the same nightmare
Won't I wake up?
It's the worst pain I've ever felt:
You've given up, given up...

Because you hated life as life hated you.
Like a nameless disease, like an aimless torture.

I have searched for answers to explain your suicide.
I've preferred the version of an impulsive act.

But you knew all this time that you'd finally go.
You've prepared your own death with a smile on your lips.

We lost a friend,
(A) part of ourselves,
It will never be the same!

Something has died
With you this day
We're the orphans of your smiles!

Let's just let it be
Put your hands on me
Let's not worry about tomorrow
Or the rest of our lives

Let's just let it be
Put your hands on me
All I know is we gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram

Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice

How could I ever stray from what has meant so much to me
How could I ever gain her trust without the guarantees
Of who I am or where I'll be

Insecure and skeptical her trust in me was blown
Despite the past we face we both have grown
Through the pain to find the strength together or alone

We played with our lives before they were spent
We were young and unafraid
So alive together

We gave ourselves to giving in
And separated from within
Our only fear was growing old
We swore that we would never

And I remember how it used to be
Oh, I remember you were here with me

Summer of love came and was gone
'Cause we lifted up and tried to hold on
To memories of what we were
The times we shared were golden

And I remember how it used to be
Oh, I remember you were here with me

I remember cold Novembers
And when we used to laugh together
And I remember you

Here in my life
You were always
Here in my arms
You were always
Here in my heart
Those days are still alive

I remember cold Novembers
And when we used to laugh together
And I remember

And I remember you

Cause things look better from down here

Just means another chance for you to
Gain it back again

Outside my window at fountain & vine
Drunks and addicts are forming a line

Sharing their stories to comfort dispair
Carry the weight of the crosses they bare
Praying for courage and wisdom to change
Serenity costs more than pocket book change

I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls
I want to turn all the tables
And give back what doesn't belong to me

Sleeping on sidewalks is how people live
Begging for something no one wants to give
Size of your wealth is a bottle of wine
Sipped with your friends you'll soon leave behind

Are your children in flames?
Incarcerated and bound by the chain?
Strangers paralyze
Down in the gutters of fountain & vine

Feel like running away
Tired of seeing them falling aside
There's no running away

I want to tear it all down
Build it all up from the ground
I want to tear down the wall

I know it's not the end
It may take a lifetime
But wait for me my friend
Cause I promise you
We will meet again

Now it seems like we're wolds apart
But we're connected at the heart, oh
There's still memories to be made
And I won't be afraid, no

We will meet again
We will meet again
Though I must let you go
I know it's not the end
We will meet again
We will meet again
For I promise you
We will meet again",We Will Meet Again
Oleta Adams,"In the darkness of your private room
You've been pickin' at the scab's of some old wounds
Cudding up the sorrow like it's your best friend
Thinkin' it's an inescapable end
But see the light shining on the wall
It”s gonna shine through the nightfall
Can't you see

A window of hope
Shining the light on every problem
A window of hope 
There's always a chance that you can solve them
When you think it's all over and you want to let go
The faintest glow is there to help you, I know
Keep looking for the light of 
The window of hope

You're shadow boxing almost everyday
Don't you think it's time to ut your gloves away
This kind of punishment should be a sin
Face it, that ain't no way to begin
But see the light shining on the wall
It's gonna shine through the nightfall
Can you see 

A window of hope
Shinning the light on every problem
A window of hope 
There's always a chance that you can solve them
When you think it's all over and you want to let go
The faintest glow is there to help you, I know
Keep looking for the light of 
The window of hope

Hope is the sea of life
That was meant to flow
As a  never ending stream
And I can sleep at night
Now that I know
Hope is a waking dream
Can't  you  see

A window of hope
Shinning the light on every problem
A window of hope 
There's always a chance that you can solve them
When you think it's all over and you want to let go
The faintest glow is there to help you, I know
Keep looking for the light of 
The window of hope",Window of Hope
Oleta Adams,"Nothing to lose that's worth the keeping
Counting on you I stand to gain
You held the key to my heart for ransom
I'll pay the price and I won't complain
It's about time that I surrendered
Something that's dear and precious to me
By giving you all, all of the love, Babe, you ever need

I was afraid that I'd been waiting
For something that I could not possess
But honey my heart is overflowing
With joy and happiness
Writ your name across my future
And your face is all I'll ever see
I'm giving you all, all of my love, Babe, and all of me

Now come much closer, Babe
Don't be afraid
I'm gonna love you forever
More each day
With my arms wide open
And nothing to hide
Don't waste one moment darlin'
I'll be walking by your side

I don't want to give the wrong impression
About the truth that lies ahead
I'm gonna rush in with arms wide open
Where angels fear to tread
I want a harvest that is so fruitful
I'm gonna plant the perfect seed
By giving you all, all of the love, Baby
By giving you all, all the best of me
I'm giving you all, all of the love, Babe, you ever need",All the Love
Oleta Adams,"You can reach me by railway, you can reach me by trailway
You can reach me on an airplane, you can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan, cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just - get here if you can
 
You can reach me by sail boat, climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down the slope, into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt, cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here, just - get here if you can
 
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, surely you would be closer
I need you closer

You can windsurf into my life, take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon, but you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan, cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just - get here if you can
 
I don't care how you get here, just -- get here if - you can.",Get Here [Live][*]
Oleta Adams,"I have traveled many moonless nights
Cold and weary with a babe inside
And I wonder what I've done
Holy Father, You have come
And chosen me now to carry Your Son

I am waiting in a silent prayer
I am frightened by the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone
Must I walk this path alone?
Be with me now, be with me now

Breath of Heaven, hold me together
Be forever near me, breath of Heaven
Breath of Heaven, lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness for You are holy
Breath of Heaven

Do you wonder as you watch my face
If a wiser one should have had my place?
But I offer all I am for the mercy of Your plan
Help me be strong, help me be, help me

Breath of Heaven, hold me together
Be forever near me, breath of Heaven
Breath of Heaven, lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness for You are holy

Breath of Heaven, hold me together
Be forever near me, breath of Heaven
Breath of Heaven, lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness for You are holy
Breath of Heaven, breath of Heaven
Breath of Heaven
