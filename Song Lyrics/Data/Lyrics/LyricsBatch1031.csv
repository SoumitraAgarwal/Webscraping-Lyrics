Ashanti,"Acaricia mi sueño
El suave murmullo de tu suspirar
Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella quieta mi herida
Todo, todo se olvida

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal

El día que me quieras
Endulzara sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor
Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor

La noche que me quieras",El Dia Que Me Quieras
Ashbury Heights,"Time moves like Spiders
Over the face of the clock
Time's forward violence
Eating away at the heart

Another hour's past
They never seem to last
Another day goes by
No matter how I try
I've come to hate all clocks
How every second knocks
I wish I could reverse
This quaint arachnid hearse

I can't stand the spiders
I can't bare their crawl

The clock is ticking
'Til the point of no return
It'll keep on ticking
'Til the day you crash and burn

Time's web of severance
Where all remain until dark
Heads facing backwards
Like marionettes on a stalk",Spiders
Ashbury Heights,"Who would have thought the world could end
Make believe was to defend
Another day
Another year
Against the multitudes of fear

As heaven lost it's will to kill
Since the day our earth stood still
Another dance
Another swirl
Defiling every boy and girl

Our world is coming down
I see the signs
They're all around
All around
Like footprints on the ground
 
An infant cradling in the dirt
In spite of those who gave her birth
Lucifer
Is gaining girth
The sacrifice has lost it's worth

Crucified upon a screen
Death becomes a picture dream
Another lie
Another stone
To push us further down below

Our world is coming down
I see the signs
They're all around
All around
Like footprints on the ground",World Coming Down
Asher,"Uh. know what I mean
We all, we all got our own thing, 
And here's mine.

Now my things was cool
I swore id never break the rules
Straight with you cause I could relate to you
Stay with you
Special in my book
In my point of view he couldn't sex you like I could
You got with you wanted
And flaunted what you wanted 
And I went a little further even when you didn't want it
'Cause right in time, right what I had in mind 
Plus your heads been right in mine (my mind)
So I took the time, my choice was to love you.
And I didn't listen when they said never should I trust you.
So why must you take me for granted
I swore you loved me too, damn ill never understand it. 
I'm a man with feeling to and I'm a fool for the way I still feel for you.
But here's to you, I'm a better man then that 
You took my heart then and now I want it back 
So come on

[Chorus]
Told me you and I might live together someday (someday)
Now I see it in a whole new other way
And ain't gonna lie girl you need to realize
I'm staying home tonight (so come on)
Said I wanna be alone (said I wanna be alone)
All by myself
Said I'm staying home, I don't need no one else (wanna be alone)

I was cool, gave you one more chance
You gave the same old song, same old dance,
So hell with it, I had to face that shit.
You was to immature for relationships,
So I moved on for the time being, 
Then I heard a lie, there's a guy that you were caught seeing,
I flipped shits, but you flipped shits right back,
You cried you knew I wouldn't do you like that,
Still my heart was lonely, nobody to hold me.
You was my only, damn girl you was my homie,
You know me, you said you were stuck back there, 
So when I tried you leave you sucked me right back in. 
Why would I taste what I already ate? 
So I took time to get my priorities straight.
So listen you know me well I hate to doubt you,
But girl truth is I'm better off with out you and

[Chorus]

Damn girl I thought it never would end.
But this is it that's all, never again.
I couldn't deal with it then and I sure can't now.
So what makes you think I'ma let you hold me down, no.
I told you before never to roam but this is real when I say leave me alone.
I gotta be on my own, and you do too.
Through and through just please let me do what I do.
Maybe sometime soon we can both be friends,
But for now this is where its suppose to end.
My brain is sick, my heart is torn, my arms are empty,
But baby girl I just need to be alone,
My heart will beat alone, and I keep my head up.
But truth is now I'm a little bit fed up. 
I don't hate you though, you still close to me. 
So lets just go back to how we used to be, cool..

[Chorus]

I don't wanna be here in this chair, 
Waiting on you aw baby, to see things my way
Why don't you see things my way
(Woah)
Told me you and I might live together someday (someday)
Now I see it in a whole new other way
And ain't gonna lie girl you need to realize
I'm staying home tonight (so come on)
Said I wanna be alone (no no no no no)
All by myself 
Said I'm staying home (said I'm staying home)
I don't need no one (wanna be alone)
I'm so gone.",Alone

just don't let it go
Is it over by now?

For so long
I wanna let you know
That time, time is on our side

I Go on
Try to find a way
To deal with the pain

Yeah, we're both strong
At least we can pretend
But I- I still feel the same
Yeah I- would fall for you again

When time slows down we can work it out
Sometimes I've found life?s too loud
We?ll find somehow a world without a doubt
If we hold on for now

Slow down
And look what we've done
Torn to pieces on the floor
Now that you're gone
You found yourself
But I ? I lost it all
But that's just the way that we fall

If this is right why does it feel so wrong?
If you are mine where do I belong
Without you?

And all our plans come crashing down our feet
I'm feeling lost, feeling incomplete
Without you
Without you

When time slows down we can work it out
Sometimes I've found life?s too loud
We'll find somehow a world without a doubt
If we hold on for now",Hold On
Asher Roth,"Yea yea yo yo this one's for the people
All the B's that'll bleed and they sleep and they eat
Shit believe the thought we're all equal
Ain't a man on God's green be underneath any other
I don't wanna play preacher
But but I swear they turn their ear when we talk about peace and love
Sometimes might need a hug yea we all wanna come on up above
But this ain't about Jesus, no way, no Abe, no Ike, Moses or Mohammed
Yea it's all about believing, full steam ahead
Because I know the worst times are behind me
I don't wanna sound cheesy but but but I just a really mean it eh eh yea
I'm tellin' I can feel it eh eh it's the reason I don't sleep
I be way too geek tonight

This one's for all of y'all
I'm the same as all of y'all, I'm on my shit
I work real hard and all for every little bit that I get
But this is all I need, so sing this song with me
It goes like
So it sounds like this e'rybody start clapping your hands
It's like, it's like

I, I've been on my grind
I can only grind for so long
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
I, I've been on my grind
I can only grind for so long

Bout time to change a few things
We enslaved to the bank and we only wanna buy new shoes
The way that we think
We can do anything that we really wanna put our minds too
The American dream, the dream is a pyramid scheme, scheme
And it feels outta reach when it's hard and times are tough
But change starts with us yep, yep
We all want freedom yea to be who we be
I don't wanna be afraid when I speak to say what I'm feeling
Yea together we're strong but divided never been so weak
It's time we get even, yea yea, and really what I mean is, is, is
This change I can feel it, yea yea, Mr. President I think it's all gonna be O.K.

This one's for all of y'all
I'm the same as all of y'all, I'm on my shit
I work real hard and all for every little bit that I get

I, I've been on my grind
I can only grind for so long
(Go, go, go, go, go, go)
I, I've been on my grind
I can only grind for so long

So it's not about fame, and fortune
It's about believing and believing in yourself
And understanding that this life is life
It's liberty and the pursuit of happiness
And happiness isn't about getting what you want all the time
It's about loving what you have
So get ready it's a new day

Akon and Asher Roth

They say they want that hot sh, say no more
Had to walk around the block, couldn’t take no more!
Like escaper from the rock, couldn’t wait no more
Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword
So I’m sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce
Plain and simple and in short, when it rains, man, it pours
Stepping in manure, second sippin in the moor
Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war
Guessed, but I’m pretty sure that I’m destined to endure
Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore
World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace
What’s behind the door the allure something strange?
Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed
No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change
Course is unphased, contorted or concave
I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang
Got me feeling like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I’ll be the last man standing!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!

I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself
I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health
When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt
Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help
So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real
So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield
Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal
When friends become foes know you're doing it well
Just keep it going
I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker?
Group homes and tombstones to feel safer
Loopholes for new souls, lets keep praying
Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in
Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it
Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it
Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is
Way I play the game, no wonder the brother made it like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I’ll be the last man standing!

Asher Roth,"I gotta be by myself
Gotta be by myself this time

In the backseat screaming out loud (ho)
In the backseat screaming out (ho)
Ash is young, attractive
Handsome bachelor, awesome rapper
Got a knack for, vernacular
When I perform, spectacular
I'll have any girl that I want
I'm a take the girl in the front
Boobs bounce when I tell the crowd jump
Honey come backstage I just wanna have fun, but
I'm too young to be locked down, not now
Need a new car, drive around with the top down
New broad with a bra the top down
Chilling in the backseat screaming out loud

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, go get high myself this time

The cycle is Shawn Michaels (heartbreak),
And yeah I like you but not enough to wife you
You say I'm nice, true, and you think I'm the right dude
But there's another girl just like you (like who?)

And on the road, 'nother night, 'nother show
New e-vent in a new time zone
And the live show is so mind-blowin
And it's my show so you know I'm blown (you know)

No text's gonna give me head
Long distance just ain't my thing
Young single don't need no ring
I'm a free man now I don't need no strings, sing

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, Go get high myself this time

If you're cool with nights at the pool
Jacuzzi's and groupies, boobies and booze
And no rules, I'm only 22
I need to watch football and hang with a crew
But if you don't get mad when I get fat
Cause all I do is eat drink smoke weed and rap
And play Madden, then dag
You're pretty rad and I take it all back, come on

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, Go get high myself this time

Just keep clapping the hands, it feels good
Feels nice and warm in here right now
I'm feeling free
If you feel free clap your hands

Asher Roth,"Pretty girl, you know that you so hot, hot, hot, hot
How about I take you to my spot, spot, spot, spot?
We can take off all our clothes, he won't call anymo'
You hear my lion roar, head high, eyes closed

You begin to describe all things we do
In a big, big bed in an empty room
Look at you on me, then me on you
With a warm washcloth and a few ice cubes

Did it get so wet? No, I'm not my best
When I make you sweat
Ready now get set 'cause you get no rest
I'ma smack that butt, I'ma grab them breasts

Yeah, tell me what you like, can I scratch and bite?
We can scratch that fight, make it last all night
Slidin' on your side and curves, satisfy the primal urge
Ridin' on you back and forth, that's how you make my lion roar

Head high, I'm low
Hear my lion roar, lion roar
Head high, I'm low
Hear my lion roar, lion roar

On the mic I'm a beast, I'm a big bad beast
I could speak that heat, I don't need no reason
Jeepers, them big teeth you be feedin'
Better leave now, I'm 'bout to be eatin'

Even you stick around and we beatin'
Bleedin', have him laid out on the cement
Breathin', I had him back in your team and
Leave in peace and have a safe evenin'

Beef is not what I like to do
Speakin' just to enlighten you
Teach him a rhyme and preach in the mind
And a beautiful thing keep fightin' through

Just how big's the fight in you?
Tight and high and mighty or a lighty
Hide your heiny when a giant hasn't frightened you
Look in my eyes, you see my pride?

You see the fire burnin' down the side
Will and drive'll make a man, doin' what you say I can
Oh, you think I'm playin'?
Well, let's see just what you made of then

Head high, I'm low
Hear my lion roar, lion roar
Head high, I'm low
Hear my lion roar, lion roar

Busta Bust and I'm back on my bullshit now
C'mon, got to make you wanna jump, jump, jump
And I come with another banger and I know you wanna bump
Cap and gown when I smack you down
And I graduated homie bangin' in the trunk

Put yo' hands where my eyes could see
Let me take this thing to where it really need to be
One, two, three, let me take time
To remind y'all that you can't fuck with me

Shake yo' ass on the way to the flo'
In the dungeon drinkin' and the lions roar
All my little mamis come to the crib
Let me pound on the coochie until it gets sore

Then I laugh and cough when I flash and floss
Moment when I get cash as a boss
Asher Roth, I'm comin' too
'Cause I heard that you got a lot of ass in the loft

See I ain't playin' mister
I'm 'bout to twist your sister
That's how we do it killer, yeah

Asher Roth,"Take me as I em my friends, ain't gon' change,
Wont be no Em, rock these songs,
Rock these shows, only good life I know

I was in seventh grade when I heard the Slim Shady LP,
Ya my mom brought it down when I was ironing, irony,
Getting out the wrinkles, just a little kid in middle school,
Sink my teeth in anything just to think I'm cool, riding the bus,
I feel the rush but I still don't give a fuck,
Ya I wish I could agree but I've already had enough,
I've already given up from playing the same game,
Every interview I feel like I'm saying the same thing, like,
Em was great, yea he paved the way for me,
He was inspiration for everybody from A to Z,
But they keep relating me, I cant get away,
Chasing me, (all day long), I hear it, (all day long),
And now the masters thinks that Asher wants to be a Marshall Mathers,
They say ""Ashers not a rapper, na hes actually just a actor"",
Cause we have the same complexion and similar voice inflection,
Its easy to see the pieces and reach for that connection,
Every minute, each hour of everyday,
Im constantly on the fence defending my own name,
Explaining we are not the same,
Not much that I can say, except that im sick of it,
Critics arrogantly sparked up a flame, its on

[Chorus: x2]
Take me as I em my friends, ain't goin' change,
Wont be no Em, rock these songs,
Rock these shows, only good life I know

Now don't get it twisted, I've definitely benefited,
Its like suddenly everyone wants to hear what I've been spitting,
Its so different, the image they don't get it,
Its simple I'm just a kid who wants to rap to make a living,
But Em was in it way before I committed ,
And his lyrics were the shit so I really gotta come with it,
But each critics been picking apart my writings,
And if its not up to par then Ashers par is just a gimmick,
Is it my fault must I be more convincing?,
Y'all talk all you want, never halt me from my mission,
Using his ammunition, would you please keep dissing me,
(all day long), I hear it, (all day long),
And yea the haters wanna hate because I made it and I'm famous,
But until you take my place, 
Y'all never know what it takes to make a record for respect, 
Take a second before you inspect,
When you look like someone else then what the fuck do you expect,
I just want to be accepted as the illest in the game,
But its harder for an artist creating his own lane,
That's anonymous with his rhyming and combine with perfect timing,
All the time all that's declining and about to explode

[Chorus: x2]

So fuck it that's all I got, there's nothing else for me to say,
If I don't confront the problem it will never go away,
Unless it is addressed there is nothing left for me to do,
Its impossible rejecting an elephant in the room,
Say goodbye to all the bullshit, notions preconceived
Sworn to all the wrongs, could of swore they knew me,
If you have no further questions and cant think of other thoughts,
Then let me introduce you to Asher Paul Roth.

[Chorus: x2]",As I Em
Asher Roth,"Uh, and it just keeps goin (yeah)
And it just keeps

So I'm in the airport getting ready to leave
Heading to a friend's wedding in the N.Y.C.
But my head has been spinning, I'm forgetting to eat
All this jet setting has been really getting to me
It's already 11:20, I'm ready to sleep
But instead I end up sitting in a 27-C
An aisle seat, fine by me
But the guy that's inside's always trying to pee
With a wild child behind me, he's crying and keeps
Flipping out and kicking at me while he violently screams
So I silently plea, oh God, please
Let there be a honey sitting 27-B
But of course some morbidly obese
Beast is in the seat that wheezes when he breathes
Dude sitting D is at least three deep
And he keeps telling me what is wrong with his knees (I got bad knees)
Osgood-Schlatter, just need water
But for a bottle they charge two dollars (what?)
And when I thought that it couldn't get worse
I forgot my iPod

[Chorus]
I'm having a bad day
Nothing ever seems to go my way
Everybody needs to go away
Why? Because I'm having a bad day, yeah
Hey hey, and it just keeps going (keep going)
And it just keeps (going on!)
And it just keeps going (keep going)
And it just keeps (going on)

So four hours and turbulence
We land when I'm about to turd in my pants
But the captain has ""Seat belt fastened""
So my ass is just passing gas and
Then at last I escaped from the plane
When I'm minutes away from clinically insane
I make my way towards baggage claim
When I hear a high-pitched voice scream my name (Asher!)
Some dumb bitch I went to high school with
While she's sweating she's telling me she likes my shit
I just smile and think, 'bout how great it would be
If I could just hit this chick with a quick leg sweep (leg sweep)
So I pick up my L.L. Bean
And beeline for the next taxi
In need of weed, and boxer briefs
But my bag's only got Maxi's

[Chorus]

I check in to my hotel room
And I pick up my cell phone to dial the groom
Tell him my mood and I'm ordering food
And I'm probably gonna stay in and watch a movie
But the tube has no HBO (what?)
So anything I want, yo I'm paying fo'
But I'm lame and broke, so I'm laying in a robe
Watching that ""Little People, Big World"" show
Right then there's a knock at the door
It's my last hope for a Spanish whore
Who will change my sheets in exchange for penis
""Hi, I've lost my cat; have you seen it?""
Jesus, this day is the worst
At least I can give Little Me a jerk
And then go to sleep, healthy and disease-less
It guess it could be worse; but I'm just

[Chorus]

Hey, and it keep going on yo",Bad Day
Asher Roth,"I gotta be by myself
Gotta be by myself this time

In the backseat screaming out loud (ho)
In the backseat screaming out (ho)
Ash is young, attractive
Handsome bachelor, awesome rapper
Got a knack for, vernacular
When I perform, spectacular
I'll have any girl that I want
I'm a take the girl in the front
Boobs bounce when I tell the crowd jump
Honey come backstage I just wanna have fun, but
I'm too young to be locked down, not now
Need a new car, drive around with the top down
New broad with a bra the top down
Chilling in the backseat screaming out loud

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, go get high myself this time

The cycle is Shawn Michaels (heartbreak),
And yeah I like you but not enough to wife you
You say I'm nice, true, and you think I'm the right dude
But there's another girl just like you (like who?)

And on the road, 'nother night, 'nother show
New e-vent in a new time zone
And the live show is so mind-blowin
And it's my show so you know I'm blown (you know)

No text's gonna give me head
Long distance just ain't my thing
Young single don't need no ring
I'm a free man now I don't need no strings, sing

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, Go get high myself this time

If you're cool with nights at the pool
Jacuzzi's and groupies, boobies and booze
And no rules, I'm only 22
I need to watch football and hang with a crew
But if you don't get mad when I get fat
Cause all I do is eat drink smoke weed and rap
And play Madden, then dag
You're pretty rad and I take it all back, come on

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, Go get high myself this time

Just keep clapping the hands, it feels good
Feels nice and warm in here right now
I'm feeling free
If you feel free clap your hands
Come on",Be By Myself

Asher Roth,"I remember Way Back I mean way back ages. 
Eighth grade I think, feels like yesterday. 
Bowl cuts was the craze I was crazy 
Long blond hair all over the place. 
And I'm pale as I ever was baby face, 
With a frame like a skeleton. Skinny kid, 
No friends still love by everyone. 
No shit I was cool, I had plenty fun. 
World wish I would grow up big, no not built, 
But they said, drink my milk. 
Didn't get no where switched up diet. 
Started having hip hop. 
Pop's didn't like it. 

Wanted more Springsteen, Earth, Wind, Fire. 
Felt that was fine but to rhyme had to try it. 
Couldn't hide the fact that I wanted to rap. 
Bought Jay Z CD wit my own pension. 
And that was back in 98 wit the Langley sniffling, money ain't a thing. 
And even though I couldn't relate, 
I kept studying, and listening and stuffing my face.

[Chorus: x2]
I don't, feel like I'm falling (cause I'm so high)
I don't, feel like I'm falling (cause I'm so fly)

And then came High School started picking up a mic thought I was cool. 
My friend said yo homie, you know that your white dude? 
I said what for real? Yo its all good. 
Cause like this, when I tried it, liked it, flipped it, hyped it. 
Insisted the mic be positioned just right. 
Just like that 9th grade footy heard, straight from the Philly burbs. 
Feel me? Pretty sure. 
Suburban threat was the name, we would really work, 
Steady spending the day spitting silly versus. 
No curses, righting bout our girlfriends. 
Ball point pen, head spinning like a whirlwind. 
Getting on the mic, I'm a wizard like Merlin. 
Breaking barriers, tearing walls like its Berlin.

[Chorus: x2]

And I think it was the summer of 12th grade? 
When Uncle C passed away leaving us empty. 
And it hurt, real bad, disturbed, real sad. 
But we had to move on so in fact real fast, 
We wrote this song about falling ones, miscues, 
And the misuse of words used to dis due. 
So true. 
In a serious face I'm convinced god works in mysterious ways, 
Like everything happens for a reason. 
I had to believe it, cause that explains why the leave us. 
As in people that mean everything. 
I got love for them all, they'll be their if I fall But.

Asher Roth,"He leans back from his deck
Rubs the back of his neck
The stress takes effect
Grips the bridge of his nose
Squints while showing emotions he normally won't at fifty six, 
He re-evaluates possible regretting some decisions that he's made.
Black is turning Grey patches of his age
Reflecting from the glasses that pass of every page
Passionately day reads
Reading on occasion
Dreaming of the day when he could do the same thing
He's always wanted to write
That's all hes wanted in life
With two daughters,a son,and a remarkable wife
Hes in a bond
Hes has to provide
A family is relying on a Milli to survive
His father died at fifty six 
So hes well aware of how vital a father figure is
How big of a responsibility it is
To be a good husband and care for your kids
Never miss an evening, help them with their homework, 
Discipline to prevent things when their older
His only son is only twenty one and focus as a poet has only just begun
Papa isn't dumb, he understands what this means
His dream is my dream and my dream is his dream

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see(history)
The sacrifices he made for me(history)
Put is aside for his family(history)
So I'ma keep it alive(yeah)

And so he targeted to be the dream guardian
Guarding it from anything and anyone whose harming it
But in his heart he knows the hardest thing is 
Giving up his dream and being all about his kids
As he kisses the lips of his misses 
For twenty four years going on the twenty fifth
He thinks to himself this alone is a wealth
Better than anything that's bought and then sold on a shelf
Sometimes a dream is all that we have
We have to continue to dream
Once it is lost amongst our thoughts
What really are we?

[Chorus]

So he sits back at his desk
Cracking his knuckles and back his neck
Faxing a paper displaying his name 
On another application explaining the name
Things that they should know but the things they don't
All the things that distinguish him as an adult
Over the phone he can never expose
The roll that he choose
The roll in his home
And at home he is a leader, a father
He'll prove it by using his son and his daughters
In their life he'll be playing the part of the one who inspires
The one we admire
His only son is only twenty one and focus as a poet has only just begun
Papa isn't dumb, he understands what this means
My dream is his dream and his dream is my dream

[Chorus]",His Dream

Akon and Asher Roth

They say they want that hot shhhh, say no more
Had to walk around the block, couldn't take no more!
Like escaper from the rock, couldn't wait no more
Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword
So I'm sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce
Plain and simple and I'm short, when it rains, man, it pours
Stepping in manure, second sippin' in the moor
Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war
Desprate, but I'm pretty sure that I'm destined to endure
Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore
World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace
What's behind the door, the allure of something strange?
Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed
No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change
Course is unphased, contorted or concave
I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang
Got me feeling like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my strife, you know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!

I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself
I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health
When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt
Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help
So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real
So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield
Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal
When friends become foes know you're doing it well
Just keep it going
I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker
Drew poems on tombstones to feel safer
Loopholes for new souls, let's keep praying
Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in
Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it
Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it
Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is
Way I play the game, it's no wonder the brother made it like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my strife, you know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing!

My girl, she drinks and smokes
Then she goes to fashion shows
Forth and back, back and forth
Takes the (uh) just like a pro
Try to keep on up with her but really why bother
Girl's a super hottie plus she parties way harder
Still looking great with no make-up on
Keep going strong 'til the break of dawn
Eighth to the face, take it straight no chase
When she stay to the pace ain't a damn thing wrong
Mother, sister, brother they insist on drinking water
But she's sipping on some liquor, Janice Dickinson had taught her well
Hammered, you can hardly tell
Stammered, but she hides it well
Hands up in the air and yells ""Party all the time""
She dance around me in her thong
Sing along, favorite song
Rip a shot, hit the bong
Going all night long

Yeah, my chick be drinking whiskey just to chase it with a kiss
Then she'll charge it to her card, whole bar, plus tip
Yeah for her and all her friends 'cause she never pays for s***
Kind of chick that you see on the TV (yeah)
Real high heels and her cleavage (yeah)
Rolling up some homegrown asking ""Can we smoke some weed in here?""
Isn't like she needed it but got diamonds and pearls
And definitely ain't a lesbian but kisses other girls
Drives a car that isn't hers, keeps the keys up in her purse
Lipstick, red or pink, tell me which do you prefer?
Mini-skirts exotic furs wanna make the kitten purr
Try to go and buy a drink but split before you finish yours 'cause she

Parties all the time, shorty she a dime
A** like Nicki, barbie in her prime
Stripping on that pole, shorty on her grind
I meet her in the bathroom, dog her from behind
It's the red cup sipping, Ciroc boy mixing
Bottles of that peach got that pussy all dripping
Line goes down the street, room full of bad b****es
Everybody super wasteful and them hoes is mad twisted
Asher Roth passed her off I had to ball, that a** was soft
I dribbled all on it like basketball
She nibbled all on it, I smashed I'm gone
It last through the morning and on through the night
Eleven A-M I was off to a flight

I got them hoes rolling like all of the dice

We got Asheru.. 'This is ME!'

[beat comes on]
[softly] Ill Will, Earthquake
Goes a little somethin like this...

Aiyyo my man got me wide, I'm listenin to beats inside the ride
I put my love in so when you drivin down the street
And you got this beat on, it's hot 'cause the heat on
And if you got that fat shit, then put repeat on
I pop your ass like a clutch, to get you started
My man farted and the whole crowd parted
You know my shit is so together, I carry clever across the cleft
Like soundwaves and ravage in his chest
It's not a matter of bein wack or not
It's about - who got your back when shit gets hot
In the crowds, I'm cultivatin props, I grow rocks
And stock breaks, manipulate the art and create
See, when I first started my heart was in the right place
Then they changed the game and I still kept pace
So now I'm in the place, and I'm in the house, and I'm comin back
You know this nigga's name--Blue Black

Walk in, at the party, see who's spinnin, was some nigga
Are you high or wide, I'm just dolo lookin fly
Ghetto-pretty in the city of lights
And the ass out, finger-poppin hips and lips
Lookin way past, sweat her, 'cause I can't let her know I want her
So I lounge a look lost, cost effective?
When it's time to ante up, panties up her ass
So tight, I need a rinse to work a nut off
see?? freezin?, while I'm seizin silhouettes
Let's wallow in the wetness--Check this
 
I been a be	-boy before I been away, but the be	 in me'll never go away
I'll stow away on a ship, I'll seal my lips ? and escape
You know- I create funk flow
'Cause I'm not caught up, I thought of a way to speak and spoke:
The Unspoken Heard is no joke

[everyone talking]
Yo, I glaze from purple haze to daze and amazin phrases
I'm thinkin bout money 'cause it pays
So is you is, or is you ain't an entertainer?
I'm a writer, or retainer?, I make art like a painter
I represent the remnant, the remainder
I don't know how to make this point plainer
But brothas who supposed to be, I was hostin a show
I wasn't s'posed to be, lookin at this brotha close to me
And even he wasn't who he was supposed to be
So I'm trapped in the circle (just trapped in the circle)
I'm very present in the room I'm in
Presentin ill rhythms when the track begin
It gets me open and my rhyme falls in, but even ?? times
See I'm not complainin but the shit is dreamin
The game face kid - entertainin - the world is a show
You d'know? See you got to show and tell to get to go
So I create this energy, this synergy.
[simultaneuous rhyming] It's above and beyond me, it's on me
I make it since it's so divine, more sublime
Surrounded by mendacity, but yo, that's the time
And every time I present, the present tense is tension
But that wasn't even mind's intention.. DC!!

This how we relate...from the music we make
To the actions we take...let ya side of fate

But after you the way Smiley go...from a little while ago
I'm sure the rest of you can agree...that
Everyday's a Jamboree, where we jam for free

Every record brings you closer to our family
And our greatest common factor...besides the MUSIC!!!
Is our outlook on life and how we use it
The used get unexpectedly dropped

It's on you to choose...you can catch 'em or not
See this is hip-hop...which means we don't stop
Hold the live track runners, by weight...my planet rock
 
Whether dream or experience to drop a cd
That burns to the touch on all point like TV
See we...Think About...what we know
And transfer...that energy to every show

So, if there ever come a time...when Ashe run out of lines
Yo, I hand in my Dear You letter (Dear You) and resign
But don't hold ya breath 'cause man...we can't done

Ashes Divide,"At night when the voices that come
And flame flows through the woods along the wall
We have nothing left to say

Because we use some terrible words
To get such subtle rewards
That never seem worth it too me
They say the older we are, we can't change
And I say, that all that we are
Is just dark matter anyway, so just pray...
With me.

You and I keep falling further away
It's become our ritual
We stare like strangers through each other in to the wall...

And you say, when your knives and your nails come unfurled
From the caged theoretical storms that mean nothing
But they go straight through me
Cause we use some terrible words
Which always sends me crippled in to flying

You say it's not too late, we can change.
And I say, hurry up, help me touch the ground tonight.
Please...
Say the words.

You and I keep falling further away
It's become our ritual
We stair like strangers straight through each other in to the wall...
You and I keep falling further away
It's become our ritual
We stair like strangers straight through each other in to the wall...

Just let it go

But I don't need afflicted memories to fade,
I just want to feel something real inside.

Send it

Send it, send it
Up, up and away
You had it for a day
Send it, send it
Like a puff of smoke
Spread a little hope

Never think at all that You possess
'Cause it will never bring You happiness
Love has its own will
Take what You need to make each day sweet
But then just like grains of wheat
When it's over
You've got to blow it to the fans of the windmill

Send it, send it
Just like it came to Me
I'm gonna set it free
Send it, send it
You've got to let it go
Open up a window

Don't you think it's best when You feel joy
To let it all out before it spoils
Let it run into everything
I know You really doubt that it gets far
But that's the reason He made the star
When propels it, it travels faster than a laser beam

I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,

I miss that now

All the things left undiscovered
Leave me empty and left to wonder
I need you

Leave me waiting and left to wonder
I need you
Yeah I need you

Don't walk away

Touch me now how I want to feel
Something so real, please remind me
My love, and take me back

I'm not breathing I'm suffocating without you
Do you feel it too?

Leave me waiting and left to wonder
I need you

Leave me empty and left to wonder
I need you
Yeah I need you

Dreaming that you'll walk right through my door,
It's then I know my heart is whole
There's a million reasons why I cry
Hold my covers tight and close my eyes
'cause I don't want to be alone

All the things left undiscovered
Leave me waiting and left to wonder
I need you
All the things left undiscovered
Leave me empty and left to wonder
I need you, I need you

'Cause I can't fake and I can't hate
But it's my heart
That's about to break
You're all I need

I'm on my knees
Watch me bleed
Would you listen please
I give in

I breathe out
I want you, there's no doubt
I freak out, I'm left out
Without you, I'm without

I'm kicked out
I cry out

There's something about the way you are

That's giving me butterflies
Maybe the planets have aligned
Maybe it's all in my mind

Before I get too shy
I've seen you in my dreams at night
To you I fantasize

You caught my eye
You're just so fine

But I'm giving you my number now
Before this goes too far
It's getting really hot in here

And soon it will be hard to say goodnight

Who will be the one who's there
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall
When the show is over
And it's empty everywhere
It's hard to face going back alone
So I walk around the city
Anything, anything to clear my head
I've got nowhere to go nowhere but home
Who will be the one who's there
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall

Ashley Altman,"I'm standing on the edge of the industry
Wondering if it's all that important to me
To get my records back out there on the streets
It ain't like I'm hurting or anything
I'm to the point right now where money ain't an issue
I can roll where I want to, do what I want to do
Tempted to leave it in my rear-view
Because this game ain't what I'm used to

It used to be a few artists at a time
Now, even the veterans wait in line
Pre-mature release of these albums online
Making it hard for real entertainers to shine
If you manage to defeat all these odds against you
Keep doing your thing 'cause I'm not mad at you
Just trying to figure out where I fit into
All of this now, or if I do

This industry was more like a different world
When it was just me, Monica, and Babygirl
Aaliyah, I never got to tell you how much you meant
I wish you and me both was sitting here working with Tim
Just to be in the presence of people that you affected on a personal level
Just makes me stop for a second (pause & exhale) 
You were such a blessing
You only answered one of my questions

And I made up my mind
Move over, this is my time

Ashley Brown,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, I love you
On this you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
On this you can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.
So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt;
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break ! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

We can talk until you can't even remember my name
Daddy don't you worry, I'll do the remembering
Daddy don't you worry, I'll do the remembering

First guitar and I just wasn't getting it right
You showed me how to play it, said it doesn't happen overnight
And in a couple years I come home and show you how I play ""Blackbird""
And though I miss a couple notes you still say
That it was the best you'd ever heard

Never had to ask you to smile for me
It's just the way you put me at ease

Bones get tired and they can't carry all the weight
We can talk until you can't even remember my name
Daddy don't you worry, I'll do the remembering

For the love that got away

Naked on a staircase
That we could never build

As if a million flowers
Had suddenly been killed
As if a million flowers

Roulette, roulette, cigarette

As if a million flowers

As if a million flowers

Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze

And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.

There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go

And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill,

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Ashley Parker Angel,"Firefly, can I have a light?
It's so dark out here,
My shadow looked me in the eye,
like I was staring in the mirror.
Everything became so clear,
in the middle of nowhere.

I walk along the boulevard,
My feet don't touch the ground,
Scratch my name on concrete stars,
I'm never coming down.
Feels so good to disappear,
in the middle of nowhere.

Along the way,
That's where I'm supposed to be.
Along the way,
In the spaces in between.
I find my place in the middle of tomorrow and yesterday,
If you're going there, look for me along the way.

Taxi driver, can I hitch a ride?
Anywhere but home.
I'm looking for an alibi,
a reason to stay gone.
I can't hear the voices say ""you're in the middle of nowhere""

Along the way,
That's where I'm supposed to be.
Along the way,
In the spaces in between.

It's who I am, it's how you'll be,
It's where we run.
Letting go of everything is the hardest part when you start along the way.

Ashley Parker Angel,"Close to you, so far away,
A rented room, an empty space,
Sirens bleeding through the open door,
Movie scene in black and white,
The snow falls down alone tonight.
No one's ever felt like this before.

What went wrong with you and me?
This is my apology.
'Cos even when I fall asleep, you stay with me,
You stay with me.

Stuck inside a broken frame,
Watching as seasons change,
Hoping time will finally set me free,
Suddenly, you're standing there,
A crowded street, a lonely stare,
A thousand miles of traffic in between.

What went wrong with you and me?
This is my apology.
From the moment that I leave, you stay with me,
You stay with me.

Every letter that you wrote stays with me,
And every promise that I broke, stays with me,
And everything that's left inside, stays with me,
It stays with me.

Ashley Parker Angel,"In a corner of the closet,
there's a suitcase packed with clothes,
And the postcard from your parents with the words ""please come back home"",
I've been waiting for the moment that all this shit explodes,
And I can't believe you think that I don't know.

How you gonna say you're never gonna leave me lonely?
How you gonna say you're never gonna walk away?
Knowing that you'd break me if you ever say goodbye,
So you keep on telling me that everything will be alright,
And it's a beautiful lie.

Well I can't help but to notice in the bedroom something's changed,
There's a picture on the dresser that's gone missing from the frame,
I could ask you but you'd answer in that same familiar way,
That there's nothing wrong, and everything's okay.

How you gonna say you're never gonna leave me lonely?
How you gonna say you're never gonna walk away?
Knowing that you'd break me if you ever say goodbye,
So you keep on telling me that everything will be alright,
And it's a beautiful lie.

You surrender on your naked skin, falling back into the rhythm,
I could never forget you.
Feeling so electric on my fingertips, hurts so good,
can't go on like this.
Here comes another sunrise, like a broken promise in the skies,
It's about to be a different day but you keep on living that same old lie.

How you gonna say you're never gonna leave me lonely?
How you gonna say you're never gonna walk away?
Knowing that you'd break me if you ever say goodbye,
So you keep on telling me that everything will be alright,
And it's a beautiful lie.",Beautiful Lie
Ashley Parker Angel,"Like a splinter in my thumb, you're not going anywhere,
Not like I care 'cause I have got used to it,
Refuse to quit.
You're like the label in my shirt that keeps scratching at my back,
Then I forget 'cause I've grown immune to it,
Go figure it.

Knew you were trouble back then but that's what turned me on,
It's all wrong.

Suitcase, some baggage in her head she screams out, yes and it's crazy beautiful,
Crazy beautiful.
Tattooed, lying on the bed, Don't,
Regret smashing her fist into the wall,
Crazy beautiful,
She's worth it all.

She leaves the ashtray on the bed,
She don't sense any thoughts inside her head,
She just has to get them out,
Can't shut her mouth.
She's like a song that's in my brain,
But every other lyric says my name,
And I just can't turn it off,
Can't get enough.

Knew you were trouble back then but that's what turned me on,

Regret smashing her fist into the wall,

Sometimes something that is not perfect ends up being what you want,
Sometimes she lets me into places where her demons come to haunt.

She's like an angel that's corrupted and I'm hanging on to her...

Ashley Parker Angel,"As seven ticks to eight o'clock,
He rumbles down the stairs,
Mother's cooking in her kitchen, father is in his chair
The headline on the front page reads ""the sun's coming out today"",
Shining down in perfect streaks, it's anywhere USA.

With eyes wide open, 
The sky is always a thousand shades of blue.
Probably broken, lost and lonely,
We're all just shades of you.

Can't you hear the school bells singing?
Hurry, don't be late.
Wandering the crowded hallways,
Searching for his place.
The writing on the chalk board reads,
""Who will be king this year?""
And even though he raised his hand,
No one knows he's there.

With arms wide open,
His life's becoming a thousand shades of blue,
Probably broken, lost and lonely,
We're all just shades of you.

There's no escaping where he's going, 
A thousand shades of blue.
Probably hopeless, don't you notice?
We're all just shades of you.

He let the water run too deep, 
Then he just slowly slipped on in,
And when he finds the nerve to breathe,
All they say is no one saw it coming.

Hear the sirens, the cops arriving,
A thousand shades of blue.
But it's hopeless, no one noticed,
We're all just shades of you.

There's no escaping where he's going,

To slip away with the sun light
Its gonna get better soon
And everything will be alright
So tear it off of your skin
And let it heal in the open
Start all over again
I wasn't who you were hoping for
But every day is a new day
Its sure as the stars in the sky
And every waking moment
We're starting over
Call you out of the blue
Messing with your emotions
I can't believe that its true
I'm still as deep as the ocean
But every day is a new day
Its sure as the stars in the sky
And every waking moment
We're starting over
But every day is a new day
Its sure as the stars in the sky
Believing in a new way
Is hard as the days that go by
And every waking moment

Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road

Spent my very last buck
Can't sink no lower than this

Sees me like I'm some dog in the street

Living this hell that I made
So I'm back at your feet
I'm admitting defeat

Just give back my life, I admit my mistakes
Now I'm willing to do whatever it takes
I'm begging you now, can't you see

Now the brother's been locked up on a life time basis
Convicted of murder but what's never mentioned
Self defense was his only intention
ADF once again taking to the stand
Witness the jailing of an innocent man
Kicking up a fuss because it could happen to us
Time to join in the fight back

Asia,"""What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?
only the monstrous anger of the guns.
Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle
Can patter out their hasty orisons.
No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells;
nor any voice of mourning save the choirs. 
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells.
And bugles calling for them from sad shires.""

All our hopes would ebb and flow
We thought we'd find a promised land
Our footprints in the sand

The mysteries, the twists of fate
Have changed the path from love to hate

They hide behind the mask

Can forgiveness dry the tears?
If I falter, my soul I'll sell
On the coldest day in hell

I won't let you go

Give me back my life

Kill this ghost inside of me
Let me sail on deep blue seas
A new beginning, another page
Dawn gives in to day

I will conquer all our fears
Let forgiveness dry the tears
If I falter my soul I'll sell

end himself. One of the attackers got injured and later died after refusing treatment. Satpal was subsequently charged with murder.

Satpal was provided with lawyers who refused to argue his case. They made him change his plea of self-defence to that of manslaughter. Most of the prosecution evidence came from the group that attack
ed Satpal.

The all-white jury missed vital evidence because no interpreter was provided. The judge said he would interpret but couldn't speak a word of Bengali.

The jury weren't asked to consider if Satpal's actions were in self-defence and found him guilty.

Screwed up afore and this is no mistake

Officer xx, it's time to liaise
Let me introduce you to the brand new krays
No mention of the gangster- 'informer' is the phrase
No communication in the 'in' and 'out' trays
Mi5, them building up combat 18? 
Nazi turnouts and the bnp in between? 
Running drugs for money for the loyalists? 
Macpherson, how come you missed the whole a this? 

Defective constable, what you gonna say? 
Suspending our belief and still on full pay
Chief condon is safe, what did you expect? 
Who's up next? 
Calling officer xx!

Spindoctors and editors engaged in a pact
Information leaked out to cover up the facts
Daily slackmail onto a nice little earner
While another thousand cases still on the back burner
Zero tolerance for jack the home sec
Running for cover 'cause him know we're after him neck
Him a huff and him a puff
Inna de name a de law
When it come to the guilty him a man of straw

This shameful spectacle we can see clearly
Conspiracy in practice
Now not in theory
Heard all of de report and looked over the whole a de text
Time to step forward now officer xx

Suspending our belief and still on full pay

At the end of a disconnected phone 
Truth hides down an unmarked street 
Buried deep beneath your feet 

Truth hides in people written out of history 
Black leaders and inventors whose names 
Remain a mystery 
Great women recorded on ripped out pages 
Obliterated wisdom, covered up faces 

Truth is lost in the mists of eMpTy Vision, 
And found in the notebooks of those 
Wrongfully imprisoned, 
And in the evidence that was never brought to trial, 

But not in the void behind the newsreaders' smile. 
Truth hides whenever we lose our focus 
Slips out the back, quickly replaced by the bogus, 
Fleeing soundbites disguised as facts 

That reappear in the small print on every contract 
Truth hides on the other side of a two-way mirror 
In countless documents sent straight to the shredder 
That might finally give us the whole of the picture 

But until the day we decide to dig a little deeper 
We know that truth will hide 
Under fallen rocks and stones 
At the end of a disconnected phone 

Down an unmarked street 
And buried deep beneath your feet 

Truth it a hide under rocks and stones 
At the end of your line 
Down an unmarked street

Two fake, too straight when your out on the estate
after all the lies you've gone and spread about me
You put on your disguise and go on like we're sweet
Who needs enenies when you've got brothers like these
they be smiling when they're with you
but you know it's full of cheese
Oh please who else be trying to eat up our cake
Your'e two,you're two,you're two face
'cause they're the masters of deception
they want to bring you down
your phone keeps ringing taking you for a clown
The threats keep coming make you want to leave town
not before you find out who's behind this showdown
Your best friends been makin others real mad
you're tellin this dude eveything and now it's real sad
he's rollin with your enemies and now they seem glad
they know all they need and got their pen to the pad
So why do they do what they do against you
Fake arsed brothers you're life they want to screw
It's true when I say all they want is attention
to satisfy their needs with no consideration
To all those people who've got more than one face
You better be on your defense 'cause now were on the case
The mace that you sprayed has been cleared from my eyes
what comes around goes around you better realize
chorus 2

They come down your home pretend to be your mate
but deep inside their souls it's just you that they hate
And whenever you were hungry you placed food on their plate
and any time they were in trouble
you always helped them escape
Indirect or direct they try to put you down
put you down,low down,way down
underground with no sound
And all the bullshit that they talk
they can't just even hold down
with their mouth full of rubbish
they try to spread around

Dennis actually sat down, was like, you don't want this album to be about Danny
Danny's in the past now, you need to move on
You need to look forward to your future and I was like, you're right, you're right and, um
I sat down and, and, I re-wrote most of, most of the record with Dennis

So here we fucking go
You're going down, you're on your own
Blow your o-o-o-o-wn

I'll cross the fucking line

Another life
Waking up, waking up
From all the lies

Sometimes it ends, sometimes you fall
Crossing out the man that I've become
I'm standing tall
Stronger than I ever did before
Against them all

I know that you have locked me in your eyes
I can't resist it
The target on your chest is all that I can see
Fight me now
It's not over
No, no, no, it's not over

Pick me up off the ground just once more
So on I go, on I go
But never alone

Sometimes it ends
Sometimes you fall
Crossing out the man that I've become
I'm standing tall
Stronger than I ever did before
Against them all

Now it's my turn to drag you through this hell
Through this hell
I won't forgive
I won't let go of what you've done
Oh

Woke up alone
So sick of this game
I've spent too many years in this house of pain
If you can't find the words, read between the lines
So take it or leave it to me
So take it or leave it to me from here this time

Ah, it was hard to sort of, switch off, 'cause I was still angry inside, but
I just, I mean, then again, it might be something about that not pursuing
'Cause, being a musician and an artist, I write about what's fueling, what I'm feeling at the time
But, a lot of how I'm feeling is excitement, and I am happy
And I am extremely grateful to still be going, so
I just have to concentrate more of that, sort of like, for the new record 
Then, you know, use my energy in hindsight, in a negative way
Which it completely would have been, had Dennis not called me out and said stop being a pussy
Which is cool",Sometimes It Ends

And not hold a gun in the face of the Earth's abduction

Don't ask me why I'm going to Texas
Why in all the world am I here

And dance and sing and drink my lonestar beer

Asleep at the Wheel,"My pappy said son you gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln

Have you heard the story about the hot rod race
When the Ford and the Lincoln were settin' the pace
That story's true I'm here to say
Cause I was a drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders and uses them all
And an overdrive that just won't stall

It's got a 4-barrel carb and dual exhausts
4:11 gears that really get lost
Safety tubes and I'm not scared
The brakes are good and the tires are fair

We left San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars were shinin' bright
We were drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passin' cars like they were standin' still

Then all of a sudden, in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said boys that's the mark for me
But by then the taillights was all you could see

Now the fellers ribbed me for bein' behind
So I started to make that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive

Well I wound it up to hundred and ten
Twisted the speedometer cable hit top end
Had my foot glued right to the floor
I said that's all there is there ain't no more

Now the fellas thought I'd lost all sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said slow down I see spots
The lines on the road just looked like dots

I took a corner and passed a truck
I crossed my fingers just for luck
The fenders clickin' the guard rail post
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and hoped I could pass
But when I did I'd be short on gas

Had flames comin' from out of the side
You could feel the tension man what a ride
I said look out boys I've got a license to fly
And the Cadillac pulled over and let me by

Now all of a sudden a rod started knockin'
Down in the depths she started a rockin'
I looked in the mirror and a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln

They arrested me and put me in jail.
They called my pop to throw my bail.
And he said son you're gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't quit drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln",Hot Rod Lincoln

So sweet

Got it wrong, but it's alright

Somehow

Blue as the sky, sun burnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
Just relax, just relax
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes we feel afraid
But it's alright
The more you stay the same

Pity for pity's sake

I thought that I was stronger

I wanna run and never get tired 
I wanna love the best i was wired

i dont need caffeine or compliments fading 
cuz when im breathing it keeps me high 

cuz there aint no love we're sending 
we need somethin heavenly 
to believe 
cuz the further that we're gettin 
no anger will refuse to sleep 
erasing you and me

teach us that true love never expires 
and appreciate the things we've been given 
be happy to have or be a friend 

cuz there aint no love we're sending 
we need somethin heavenly 
to believe 
cuz the further that we're gettin 
no anger will refuse to sleep

what this world doesnt need 
is this sappy song to sing

Number three, chemistry, but

And I never loved so hard
Never hurt so bad
Never been such a fool for love
And I never want so bad

Never let go when it's love
Or you'll find yourself waiting alone
And you'll dream back the way that it was
And wonder which was love
Which was love

So it was a story for a while

Number seven, should be revving
But he wanted to get deep too fast

The sun in me will die if you bottom out 
So while smiles don't stick around 

I'll be here

I'll be here 
If you need me 
I'll be hanging on a cloud of open invitation

Left windows nagging 
and you were edged between getting away 
And feeling slapped and blue

While looking for a melody to come alive 
So come alive 

Listen close and look as I stumble deeper and you will see 
'Cuz you can hear under my breath when I hardly breathe 
More than butterflies 
I'm feeling hot like bricks on me 
And simple words are so so far from coming to me 
So I'm making my own measure

With a promise you'll feel better

i'll backwash you you're dirty spoon
you've been there so find the stub
and here's a band-aid brand new
for the bruises on your begging knees
you turned around and the time i found
was just enough for me

excuses are your ""i'm sorry""
to go over and under and through
the wood to see without me you're no good
funny how 4 weeks ago
could not spare to throw me a bone
won't hear me complain how the roles have turned

Why gotta shut me slowly down? The road from here

What a selfish thing to do now leave me stranded here

How I thought that years would count for something good
But to erase the loneliness it warns me
Officially my kiss will miss you

The places we could be doing now
Unfortunate and shamed you're totaled out of touch from me

Outweighs the crush eroded, you're demoted

How to dream I'll never see you come again comes over me

To know you know I'd give the sequence of my youth

the puzzle fit perfect. with storybook affect. but i needed something to make it complete.
so i told my roomate. if i saw a rainbow. i would adore you.
then i opened the curtains praying for rain. and i pled every long night.
for a waterfall sky. 'cuz then I'd know for sure. my heart didn't lie.
i was growing to love you. convinced that it was glue. but did not wanna
jinx my affirmation clue. so i told my roomate. if i saw a rainbow. i would adore you.
and i opened the curtains praying for rain. forty days and nights.
nothing but clear skies. most wouldn't complain. but i needed a fight.
i was crossing my cutdowns. for a thungermous breakdown. in hopes for the makeup.
and a colorful sky. so i told my roomate if i saw a rainbow. i would adore you.
then you closed the curtains before it rained. then the radio went wrong.
it sand me a sad song. with no falling starts to balance it out. and so that was the end.
to my last boyfriend. i learned where love went wrong. was when i wrote this song.

To tell you you're the sweetest boy I've ever known
Remember the USO when we met
You almost didn't go
Well, me and your two sons are very glad you did
When your eyes found me I could hardly breathe
I wanted you
Glad you wanted me

I never stopped falling in love with you Wally
From the first day I saw you
I was sailor-bound, I just knew
You had me, I was yours
We danced out, on the floor
And with each passing day
I only loved you more

That night was pure magic
Who would have imagined
It would become 55 loving wonderful years
Your job was not all easy
Those last years I could hardly speak
But when I looked at you, I knew nothing had changed
And when I was leaving
I could feel you hurting
But then I saw those angels
And I knew your love would want this for me

I never stopped falling in love with you Wally
From the first day I saw you
I was sailor-bound, I just knew
You had me, I was yours
We danced out, on the floor
And with each passing day
I only loved you more, more, more, more ,more

So while you're waiting
Know that I'm saying I love you
I love you

From the first day I saw you
I was sailor-bound, I just knew

Glowing reasons fray
Chase these things that end this way
Whisper words of faith and set out of place

Escape myself for one day
I'm not one for taking blame
Embers singe and burn me out of this chase

Sing tomorrow's praise

So impenetrably nevertheless at the same time just as easily destroys
Completely equal as close we stand yourself for' n, we are nevertheless
Actually all alone in this world belongs to us

Into which it wraps itself to the protection as into a coat

A Paradies, a strength-flowed through small spot rain forest
So easily intermediate inhumanity suffocates in the smog
We stand like stems against near-rolling bitumen

Are a Paria
Have the highest mountain erklommen in
Biotopia
Expect that morning-red, the hope glow
But year by year
Cordially welcomes in

ASP,"Einst lag ich unter dem Grase so kühl
Nicht stört' mich auf ein Laut noch ein Gefühl
Wo mich nicht Strahlen trafen
Nicht Sonne noch Mond dort wo ich mich hab eingewühlt
Warum lasst ihr mich nicht schlafen?

Ich ruhte tief, überdauernd die Zeit
So fern von Hunger, Gefahr und Leid
Und begann mich sicher zu wähnen
So lag ich im herrlichen tröstenden Erdenkleid
Und trocknete mir die Tränen

So geschah's dass ich das was ich einst war vergaß
Nur das eine von dem ich niemals genas
Lässt sich nicht aus den Träumen entfernen
Und das Sehnen lebt immer noch unter dem kühlen Gras
Zu wandern zwischen den Sternen

Ich fiel aus den Himmeln, dem Nachtlichtermeer
Ja ich fiel so tief und ich fiel so schwer
Und ich stürzte durch die Schwärze
Und ist es auch ewig und ewig und noch länger her
Trag ich doch die Sterne im Herzen

Dort lag ich zerschmettert so nackt und so bloß
So regungslos unter dem grünen Moos
Und es heilten meine Wunden
So lag ich gebettet in deinem zarten Schoß
Auf immer mit dir verbunden

Ich träumte den Himmel im nachtschwarzen Hort
Entrang meinen Lippen niemals ein Wort
Und flehte doch, mir zu verzeihen
Und alles Getier floh den einsamen schrecklichen Ort
Hörte es meine Seele dort schreien

Doch warn's nicht die Sterne in mondheller Nacht
Die mich zu sich riefen mit all ihrer Macht
Weiß nicht woher sie kamen
So bin ich in eisblauem schneidenden Mondlicht erwacht
Und sie gaben mir einen Namen

Sie wuschen mich, flochten mir Blumen ins Haar
Ich schmeckte den Trank den sie mir brachten dar
Den süßen purpurroten
Sie salbten den Körper mit Öl, den sie aufgebahrt
Mit sich trugen wie einen Toten

Im Rausch ließen sie mich alleine mit ihr
Die niemals je fremde Hand gespürt
Und ich lernte neues Begehren
Danach hab ich sie wie die Sterne nie wieder berührt
Muss mich nach ihr immer verzehren

Sie rissen mich fort, eine Krone zur Zier
Banden sie mir ums Haupt, jagten mich wie ein Tier
Sie hetzten mich endlich zu Tode
Sie schlugen und hackten und alles was blieb von mir
Verscharrten sie im Boden

Cher-cheuse d'or
La for-tune est à ta por-tée
Mais sou-viens-toi que
Même quand l'es-poir est pas-sé
Cher-cheuse d'or
La ri-chesse du c?ur c'est la vraie

Maintenant laisse moi te conter
L'histoire de cette chercheuse d'or au c?ur doré
Qui a cherché des millions d'années
Ce trésor que très peu d'âmes ont trouvé
A genoux sous un ciel étoilé
Elle a laissé le bleu de son âme couler
Doucement la nuit l'a enveloppée
L'Astre solitaire l'a réconfortée

Refrain

Même quand la chance a tourné
Chercheuse d'or
La fortune est à ta portée
Mais souviens-toi que
Même quand l'espoir est passé
Chercheuse d'or
La richesse du c?ur c'est la vraie

Les déserts elle les a traversés
De toutes les douleurs du monde elle peut témoigner
De la mer elle connaît les secrets
Engloutis sous les vagues et les rochers
Le marchand de rêves lui a cédé
La clé des châteaux d'Espagne et ses contrés
De toutes les fois elle s'est réclamée
Portée par la grâce de Dieu et ses versets

Refrain

Pourtant ce fameux roi elle n'arrivait pas à l'oublier
Même blottie dans les bras de Morphée
Et la diseuse de bonaventure lui disait :
""Ton trésor, tu l'as trouvé puis égaré
Alors retourne vite vers lui chercheuse d'or
L'amour c'est ta destinée""

Jamais le bonheur ne l'a entourée de ses bras
A son âge les autres sont déjà plongés dans leurs draps
A son âge on n'fait pas c'qu'elle fait toute seule en bas

Se conduit comme un homme
Si jeune, pourtant si forte
Personne pour qu'elle comprenne, qu'elle se traine
Qu'on l'entraine malgré elle sur une mauvaise voie

Pourquoi ces barrières entre fille et mère?
Amours éphémères, misère, vie amère
Elles s'ignorent, elles s'adorent
Elles se ressemblent, l'une pour l'autre tremble

Est-ce l'absence d'un père qui trouble cet enfant?
Ou le manque d'amour d'une mère encore plus frustrant
Meme rebelle, elle t'appelle
Elle est tienne, n'oublie pas, elle n'a que toi pour modèle",Elle Est a Toi

Ma vie n'a plus aucun sens, j'me sens trop seul tu sais
Depuis que tu m'as quitté, je me fais une fixette sur ton décès
Je suis sûr que si j'avais été là ce soir-là, à tes côtés
Tu serais encore en vie mais qu'est-ce qui m'a pris
j'étais censé te protéger pour le restant de ta vie
Maintenant c'est moi qui pleure
Mes larmes et mes cris transpercent les portes du paradis
Oh mon dieu, mon v?u le plus cher
Ça serait de la revoir, de la chérir juste une dernière fois
Combien de fois j'ai songé à te rejoindre bébé
Combien de fois j'me suis réveillé au milieu de la nuit pour sombrer
Dans le désespoir, si tu veux savoir mon plus grand regret
C'est de ne pas t'avoir dit assez à quel point je t'aimais
Alors écoute-moi une dernière fois, avant que j'm'éteigne

Astor Piazzolla,"Cada vez que nos peleamos
Cada vez que estamos bien
Cada vez que lo encontramos
Lo volvemos a perder

Cada salto en el vacío es una cuestión de fe
Nunca nada se repite como la primera vez

Y siempre nos quedamos solos, solos

Cada vez que te lo pido
Cada vez que vos llamás
Cada rasgo enloquecido
Cada foto de mamá
Cada síntoma en el cuerpo
Cada golpe de verdad

Cada vez estoy más lejos
Pero bien lejos de acá

Y siempre nos quedamos solos
Y voy a salir a buscar
Y voy a salir a pegar

Vueltas y vueltas y vueltas en el aire
Van quedando pocos trapos
No me importan cuantos van

Ya no se ni donde vivo
Ya no sé donde parar

Empecé a moverme un poco
No es cuestión de estar tan mal

Lo que no puedo explicarme
Ya lo voy a transpirar
Que se queden cosas
Que se queden ahí atrás
Que se queden con su mundo
Yo no me voy as enfermar más

Volviendo a vos
creo que lo que mejor sería es cambiar de tema

No me importa
Ni que entiendas ni que juzgues
Ni que hables o que mientas

Y es todo, todo tan fugaz

Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris

Heavy, suddenly they seem heavy

My boat parts, it's going somewhere
people get separated,
I'm forgetting, I'm forgetting

Later, at some other place in a mahogany bar
the violins playing again for us
our song, but I'm forgetting

Later, it splits off to a cheek to cheek
everything becomes blurred and
I'm forgetting, I'm forgetting

the countdown of a night
when our love passes to oblivion

Astor Piazzolla,"Si arrastré por estemundo
la vergüenza de habersido
y el dolor de ya no ser...
Bajo el ala del sombrero,
cuántas veces embozada
una lágrima asomada
yo no pude contener...
Si crucé por los caminos
como un paria que el Destino
se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,
sólo quiero que comprendan
el valor que representa
el coraje de querer.

Era para mí la vida entera,
como un sol de primavera,
mi esperanza y mí pasión.
Sabía
que en el mundo no cabía
toda la humilde alegría
de mi pobre corazón.
Ahora, 
cuesta abajo en mi rodada,
las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

¡Si aquella boca mentía
el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos
yo habría dado siempre más!

In the picture of the soldier
In a world that's getting colder
Colors balms for my kind
Some were looking for this haven
Rumors blowing in the wind
Oh please, let me stay for a while

They came across the water
To escape from the slaughter
I took my chance but I wnted to pay
A poor boy has to lose; it's black, white and grey

There was fear in their eyes
There was blood on the walls
I can still recall
All the fear in their eyes
When their world had to fall
There was fear in their eyes

No medication from a doctor
Could ever heal this broken man
I needed someone to hold
The purgatory of life
Brought the violence to my heart
Sorry babe; forgive me babe
Now I'm gone

My execration
Of the world that rules the nation
I'm not a boy, I stand equal to God
Don't need any money
I do what I want

There was fear in their eyes
There was blood on the walls
I can still recall
All the fear in their eyes
When their world had to fall
It was in their eyes

[Solo: Haglund]

For the king and the castle
For the knight of the swords
I will march out to war
They are dying there; dying there
But the pain has been here for so long
Determination of my home land
The Promised Land

I too my chance but I wanted to pay
A poor boy has to lose; it's black, white and grey

There was fear in their eyes
There was blood on the walls

All the fear in their eyes
When their world had to fall
I saw fear in your eyes

Well, I know I was born with a crown made of troll
Faking a smile and I try to move on
Calling the shots like the king of the flies
Hiding myself, but my art's gonna take me higher
So much higher again

Love, hate and fury coming my way
Cry out in anger, got nothing to say
Cool, rich and famous, smoking cigars
The hole in my brain, won't stop me to ride the flame

Ride the flame

And the flames go higher and higher
Away from love and hate; tales of fate
Lord, I cry out in anger

With a gun inside your mouth life's rushing by
In the shade of sin; to live you have to die
Convicting yourself to the cross; it was your loss
The face made of tragic and tears:
Now it's here

It goes on and on and on
From the cradle to the grave
Well, it rolls like a wheel
The torture goes on and on

In the houses made of stone you try to hide
But the eyes of the beholder will try
To drag you from heaven to hell, I tell
The treasure, the struggle in pain
All in vain

It goes on and on and on
From the cradle to the grave
Well, it rolls like a wheel

Won't you hear my song?

Well, there's a mystic river; many people shiver
But I will burn with delight
Dragons to the left; maidens to the right

And I shall always sing my song
I'll always be around to praise the bones

Praise the bones
I can't create another rime
Inside a fantasy world
We are living for to praise the bones

Mean machines ready to strike
I read it in the cradle; keep it on the table

Turning the steel for the king and his crown
Scared from the start, I could never be late
Leaving the others for a lonely day

Russian tundra, cold is the night
Still it's not too late
There's no bail; Siberian trail
Doomed to live my last days
Like a cursed in the dark

From the eye you can't hide
When the fatherland decides you're Christ
In their state they create a better race

But take my warning
It is right before your eyes
A new time dawning
Gonna send me off
To Stalingrad

A fatal birth of one mans earth
Now it's all too late
Curtain of iron, confusion in the crowd
A union made by violence, greed and force
To tame all the men in the land
And to crush their houses of glass; in flesh
On my way to Gulag this preacher spoke

He said:
Take my warning

We will die
For the traitor of mankind
They made me fight in Stalingrad

Came out; riding the law
They're forced to say: we'll open the door
In between; lost inside a riddle
And we may have to die

He live upon the edge of danger
They'll hold their weapons down
But I will never stop

The silver screen romance
Of magazines that tell you you are waiting

For something
For anything
To make them feel better than before
The moments of glory drop
Into an ocean
Where everyone is waiting
Your rebel dreams were real
You'd kick the can you'd kill the time you'd wait
But football stars and racing cars were late
There's pleasure and there's pain
But don't you see the plans that you are making
Are illusions while you're waiting

Inside a mobile phone
To be sold calling cold

Believes there is a light
Though he gets lonelier each night
Lord it cuts right through ya

By the light of his bedside angels glare

Though pilgrim hearts just leave him numb

Em que virás
Das cordas do meu violão

I let the wind blow up a brain storm
And now I'm wondering
Whether weather like this gets you too

It may go on like this for hours
Too late in fall for April showers
So what we got here, got a thought or two
I need to share with you, here goes

Darling, tell me now
Have I done wrong somehow
That you won't look at me
Need it pointed out
Can't keep my wits about
When you won't look at me

Is there something I oughta know?
You're finding hard to say
Well, there's just a trace
Hiding on your face
And I've learned it that way

Just another soul
That really knows my soul
And you won't look at me
Does that take the prize?
How much I love those eyes
And they won't look at me

Now the rain has gone
But something lingers on
There's certain sadness here
Now that the sky is clear
And it's so, so clear
Yes, it's all so clear to me now

And I can't help but fear
That certain sadness here to stay

",A Certain Sadness [*]
Astrud Gilberto,"A certain smile, a certain face 
Can lead an unsuspecting heart 
On a merry chase 
Afleeting glance can say 
So many lovely things 
Suddenly you know why my heart sings 

You love awhile and when love goes 
You try to hide the tears inside 
With a cheerful pose 

*But in the hush of night 
Exactly like a bitter sweet refrain 
Comes that certain smile 
To haunt your heart again 
",A Certain Smile [*]
Astrud Gilberto,"Ondulado e permanente 
Teu cabelo é de sereia 
E a pergunta que não sai da mente 
Qual é o pente que te penteia 
Quando tu entra na roda 
O teu corpo bamboleia 
Teu cabelo a couve flor 
Tem um ""que"" que me tonteia 
Minha nega, meu amor 
Qual é o pente que te penteia

Não desmancha nem na areia

Tell me, and I'll be around

Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

And if she's beside me I know I need never care

If you should think of leaving me
Think of rain
And think of yesterday again

Think of rain
Think of holding hands and running for cover
Laughing all the time
And stopping to kiss
Under the weeping willow tree

If I should break your heart one day
Think of rain
And maybe you will have to smile

Think of rain
Maybe then you will forgive me
I'd want you to forgive me
Think of rain
Think of rain
If one day you should think of leaving me

We had a star to wish upon. Wish

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,

Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever,
When it isn't even spring? 

I keep wishing I were somewhere else,
Walking down a strange new street,
Hearing words I have never never heard,
From a man I've yet to meet.

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,

It might as well be, might as well be,
It might as well be spring.",It Might as Well Be Spring

Where do they go? oh I don't know, don't know;

Things that I see when you're with me, oh my dindi.

Singing dindi, happy dindi, when you're with me.

I'd let you go away, if you take me with you.

Can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.

Astrud Gilberto,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile

That would be very nice 
Someone to love me right
That would be very nice

Someone to take my hand
And be a team with me

So nice, life would be so nice 
If one day I'd find
Someone who would take my hand
And samba through life with me

Someone to cling to me
Stay with me right or wrong 
Someone to sing to me 
Some little samba song 
Someone to take my heart 
And give his heart to me

Give love a start with me

Astrud Gilberto,"Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know
So I must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
And after the day
The darkness will hide me

But maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter

With you, on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away?

For a thousand summers, I will wait for you

Anywhere you run to, anywhere you go
Every day remember, how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know
That forever more I'll wait for you

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
And then the time will come
When all the waiting's done
The time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my waiting arms

If it takes forever, I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I will wait for you
'Til you're here beside me, 'til I'm touching you
And forever more cherish your love

Astrud Gilberto,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart

Astrud Gilberto,"They say that I was born
Of slave Mogama and white man
My father slept in iron bed,
My mother on cold sand
When my father called
My mother would come
Never said a word
As if she were dumb
A woman who will talk too much
Is soon to lose her man

They say God made man first
And made a woman second choice
And so that's why woman should
Obey her master's voice
When the man is hungry
She bakes the bread
When man is cold
She warms up the bed
Standing up or laying down
The woman has to work
They say poor man wakes early
And he works until it's night
The rich man wakes up late
And tells the poor man what is right
So the poor prays to Shango up above
So the rich will lose the money they love
But rich or poor the woman has
To work for both of them",Maria Quiet
Astrud Gilberto,"Stay, and we'll make such sweet music. 

Come hear the lovebird, he's just out the window.
We'll hear the night sing and bathe in a star glow,
and we'll feel the breeze blow slow warmth.

So, stay, and we'll make such sweet music.
 
Everything changes, there's light when the world's dark,
Moments have silence, but we hear a skylark.
We both hear a skylark in tune.

For time is running, take everything life can bring you.
You know it's true so take it, even fake it 'til it comes true.

Stay, and we'll make such sweet music.

You ask the reason, the night has the answer.
Bring me your free soul, and I'll make your heart sure.
We'll both feel so heart sure, so stay, so stay.....

Astrud Gilberto,"Listen to the wailing of the willows,
Listen to me crying on my pillow
Crying cause I know my love is gone from me

Living in a world of different places, 
Looking at a million different faces
Yet I see a face in every face I see      
Love must lack a sense of humor, 

It laughs when other people cry
Love, would love to hear the rumor, 
That you and I have finally said goodbye

I know that every heart was made for breaking
And my love was ready for the takin',
Still I won't complain for someday love will call again

Must I take a memory as a token,
To replace a heart that love has broken
Will the wailing willow always weep for me
Must I see a face in every place I see
Listen to the wailing of the willow tree",Wailing on the Willow

If I only saw it in your eyes
But I just can’t fight it, cause I like it
I just wanna feel you in my arms

I’ll find my way tonight

Only stain my life

I’ll make it I can see

At what cost?

No Jah won't forsake thee oh no 

Its often he who's first to criticize what he 
Is seeing another man doing 
He often hides the wrong he does in his wrong-doing 
He's justifying, children 
Speak the truth 'cause it what it will 
'Cause he who hide the wrong thing that he does 
Do the wrong thing still 
Wrong thing still he keeps on doing 
His wrong-doing he's justifying 
Oh Lord I know to some of them I say 
The truth is an offence but never a sin 
Ina your rights can never be wrong 
In every man heart, the truth must be strong 
So in every day, in every way, children 
I know Jah won't forsake thee no 
I know Jah won't forsake thee no 
No Jah won't forsake thee if you do the right 
No Jah he won't forsake thee no 
But if the wrong thing still you keep on doing 
Your wrong-doing you're justifying 

Its often he who's first to laugh aloud 
When he is seeing another man falling down 
He often stays away 
Never seeing what he could be doing",Ina Your Rights
Aswad,"Oh but I pray thee give me one thing 
Give me love from your heart 
Where does the fire of love kindle first 
In the heart, in the hearts of every man 
Taking your chances, not knowing fire burns 
To give love to receive no love in return 
That emptiness it brings tears in your eyes 
Tell me why you're doing this now at this time 
When love fire should be burning 

Love is the force I said let there be light 
In the heart, in the hearts of every man 
He who drowns in his tears will 
Cling on to the memory 
Hopelessly clutching onto yesterday's properties 
And murders love, it's just tears in your eyes 
Tears in your eyes, you cry, why oh why 
Must you feel this feeling in your soul 

Now that you know that love kindles first 
In the heart, in the hearts of every man. 
Don't take any chances, you know 
Fire burn, just give love, you'll receive 
Love in return and happiness 
It brings joy in your world 
Tell me why, you got to keep it burning 

Love is the force, that's why there is life 
In the heart, in the hearts of every man 
See them drowning now in their own tears 
Holding on to the dwindling profits of yesteryear 
Murders love and cause tears in your eye 
Tell me why you do this 

Tears in our eyes we cry why 
Love in our hearts so why 
Why must we feel that same feeling 
In our soul 
Love oh love fire 
Love oh love 
Love fire it burns bright not again 
Ain't no man who has no friend 

But I know sparks turn into flames 
Love fire burning bright again 
Sending out love warning 
The fire keep it burning",Love Fire

And try to believe 
Can’t you trust me

Can a quiet wave of change come crashing?
Can the blindfolds slip away, can a flicker turn to flames
Unending we find so blinding?

At the Skylines,"Time after time you take over me without the decency of giving me a head start. 
Insinuating your ways while keeping a steady stride. So where's your sincerity?

Time after time I give in. This feeling is all too familiar. 
Cause it's pulling me under and I won't let go. 
You got a lot of nerve to get by.

You feel it now I'm breathing heavily I'll show you how to slowly take over me.
Everything is changing. Everything is changing right in front of me.

Right in front of me, pushing through the barrier. 
I can see all your twisted secrets as we become as one.

I'm figuring out there is nothing inside you that keeps me alive. 
It never went the way we planned it. 
It never went the way we meant for it to turn out. 
So turn around just turn around and see the reflection that's lost in your eyes.
So turn around and tell me how you were intending to keep the truth from me.

Pace yourself you're only in the second round shaking the ground 
Your bodies telling me to throw in the towel.

Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder to sink or swim we hold up this dead weight. 
Feeding on the mislead and unfortunate. Save every memory that binds me to the wreckage. 
Blindfold us from our fate. We had our problems, we turned around and we solved them. 
How could I ever forget the one love that made me realize that our dreams move like machines do. 
Take it all, take it all in. And let love, let love take over.

But now that's it's too late
So I'm sending out this prayer
Towards the heaven that we owned
So much higher than the mountains
And the fields of love we roamed
Running towards eternity
In search for peace of mind

Don't you see
What you've down to me

You left this broken vow
But why did you break my heart
We could be closer now
But why did you break my heart",Broken Vow
At Vance,"I can see right through your evil eyes
I never knew that you're the devil in disguise
The game you've played as far beyond the rules we've made
Now that we're through all your excuses are too late
Getting closer right here with me
I take you over then I'll make you see
What you've caused inside of me

So the curtain will fall
And you'll be there with your back to the wall
I won't recall all the pain I will conquer it all

I have tried to lend my hand to save your soul
Walkin side by side towards to reach our goals
The chains you've put me on went rusty through the years
Now that I hold the and teared away my fears
Getting closer right here with me
I take you over then I'll make you see
What you've caused inside of me

So the curtain will fall
And you'll be there with your back to the wall
I won't recall all the pain I will conquer it all

So the curtain will fall
And you'll be there with your back to the wall
Don't you recall the days of joy
That we shared after all
I will conquer it all

And then the shades appear from the dust
They're longing for your soul
And there's no way
To ease your pain they will linger on

So the curtain will fall
And you'll be there with your back to the wall
I won't recall all the pain I will conquer it all",The Curtain Will Fall
At Vance,"Well there's something there that's frightning
It lives close to your heart
Something makes you scared
And it tears you apart

And you send a prayer for mercy
But it won't release your soul
So you try to break away
But it tears down the wall

You can feel it comin' closer
And there's nowhere you can turn
It takes away your freedom
It gets your soul to burn

'Cause that's the evil
The evil in you

It chains your soul forever
In a room without a door
And you can feel it's now or never
That you got to join the war

As you raise your hand against it
You can feel the rising force
And you know that you will stand it
As you raise your burning cross

As a lightning cracks the sky
With a shine you've never seen
And the walls of darkness open up
And you stand in between

'Cause that's the evil
The evil in you

The evil in you",The Evil in You
At Vance,"Now that I see myself without the shades of fear
The tears of bitterness taste strange but now it's clear
And I used to think I've owned a wall that's build with love
But you have torn it into fragments stone by stone
Then you gave me a bouquet of roses
They where black and seed with hate
You treated me like I'm your enemy
You where the one who opened the gate

The robe that you're wearing now
Carries all my dreams and I hope that you can bear
That you're just a

Fallen angel, digging the dirt
Fallen angel, what is the word
Fallen angel, down to the bone
Fallen angel, now you're alone

Down to the bone, you're just a fallen angel

The words you've chosen were like arrows in my heart
What's your intention did you plan that from the start
I thought I've laid out all my dreams in your hands
And I truly hope that you know where this ends
Jealousy seemed to be master
The reason that caused this disaster
I feel like I'm reading an epitaph
You've buried our friendship and love

The robe that you're wearing now
Carries all my dreams and I hope that you can bear

Fallen angel, digging the dirt
Fallen angel, what is the word
Fallen angel, down to the bone
Fallen angel, now you're alone

Down to the bone, you're just a fallen angel",Fallen Angel
At Vance,"She's got a smile that is made out of ice
No one's here to save the tears she cries
As she dances in the moonlight
Behind those windows

Every little move she makes
Seems like magic in your eyes and
You are lost between two worlds
Shadows from near or far

And when you close your eyes
You're trying to be near
Without all your fears
But there's no way to her
No way to her

Will I ever find the way to your heart
Will I survive all the dreams for my

Behind those windows

Every now and then I'm reachin' out
But you don't answer all my calls
How can I get to you
When I melt the ice

All I'm aiming for is
Trying to break free
Will I ever see
But there's no way to you
No way to you

Vultures behind you right from the start
They keep on waiting for the moment you fall
Time is against you it's building a wall

And in the end
No one will lend you his hand
You'll be alone
Chained on this silly throne

And your heart is losing the fight
