Peter Matz,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
 
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend",You've Got a Friend
Peter Mayer,"There was a man with land as far as you could see
From Mexico to Carolina
He said leave your life behind and follow me
There'll be enough to satisfy you
Diamonds for your hands
And silk beneath your feet
Not a care will come to find you
Kings and Queens will surely be your company
You'll have all the tea in China

If you find no friends are near
Just hold your treasures dear
Everything you could ever need
Who needs love when all you find is
Fallen tears and petty crimes
Break your heart and let it bleed

With diamonds on your hands 
And silk beneath your feet
Tomorrow's fortune will remind you
You've given up your love for one more guarantee
You'll have all the tea in China
All the rain in Spain 
All the smoke in California

If you find no friends are near
Just hold your treasures dear
Everything you could ever need
Who needs love when all you find is
Fallen tears and petty crimes
Break your heart and let it bleed

With diamonds on your hands 
And silk beneath your feet
Tomorrow's fortune will remind you
You've given up your love for one more guarantee
You'll have all the tea in China
All the rain in Spain 
And all the tea in China
All the smoke in California
All the tea in China",All the Tea in China
Peter Mayer,"Funny, I've heard that song a thousand times
And it still can make me cry
Just when I thought I had let you go
Something you said comes back once more
Breakin' my heart in two, you do

Oh it's funny, funny I'm still dreamin' of you
It's funny, what a peculiar story to tell
The ones we love we hurt so well...
Oh yeah

Troubled days turn you inside out
Till you got nothing to whisper about
And all you can do is be cruel
Oh it's funny, funny I keep coming back to you

Look at my life like an open book
The chapter of us was my first look
At dreams that really do come true... they do
They just come bending, swaying, singing, and playing the blues

Look at the pages of your open book
What you gave and what you took
Tell me what matters to you

It's funny...
You can build your fortress so strong
But even the greatest have fallen for a love song
Oh it's funny, funny I'm depending on love
Funny I'm depending on you
I could die laughing just thinking of you
Just thinking of you
Thinking of you
â??Cause you're on my mind 
Almost all the time
Thinking of you
Thinking of you",Funny
Peter Mayer,"Once upon a simple man
Make a living any way you can
Workin' his hands all day
Sing a song to keep the blues away
Lift it up sing it out
Sing your lullabye

I'm in a traveling show
High wire fools and clowns
I'm the Green Eyed Radio
Bringing the curtain down
And when the show is over I'll sing to the stars
‘Cause I know they will listen
If you tell them who you are

Find the one of your dreams
Feet off the ground you can walk the moonbeams
How much joy can you make
But it's the happiest hearts that break so
Lift it up sing it out
In the middle of the crowd
Ask him when ask him why
Sing your lullaby

I'm in a traveling show
High wire fools and clowns
I'm the Green Eyed Radio

Peter Mayer,"Hush little baby 
Don't you cry
I'm never going away-a
A mighty fine woman someday you'll be
Wedding bells are gonna chime
You'll shed a few tears over the years
The lamb and lion are gonna play-a
Till tomorrow when the new moon shines
I'm gonna love you in the meantime

Under banyan tree you been waitin' on he
Says he's gonna take you away-a
It's 11 o'clock and the party don't stop
Soon midnight's a gonna chime
Well I can't claim a Casanova's name
No I don't own a holy day oh
But I can sing a song and make you cry
Shall we dance in the meantime

So you found your boy
Grease monkey joy
Workin' on his wheels all day-o
He's gonna take you round the world when he put down the top
Oh his Chevy do shine
But there was no gold in the golden gate
There was no silver in the lining
I'm so alone, baby take me home
Tell me you love me in the meantime

One fine morning with no warning you will cry
Round the world your heart goes searching
While I'm right by your side, by your side
Never let you down down down

Gonna love you in the meantime, meantime darling
Dancing in the meantime, meantime honey
Springtime summertime
Winter or fall yeah
Any time at all

Peter Mayer,"She works in a shop at the museum of art
All the he's and she's of the centuries know her name
When the lights go down and no one's around they whisper
Hey Julia you're playing a dangerous game

The Van Goghs and Chegals that hang on the walls try to tell her
That man of stone don't care anything about you
So she steals to her lover under the cover of midnight
She says that's alright I've got enough love for two

Oh there she goes
She's kissing Michaelangelo
It would take a hammer to break his heart
What a beautiful work of art
You're my beautiful work of art

Banker man tried to win her love with his money
Factory boy brought her red roses in bloom
She says give me a flower that won't fade away by morning
Give me a love that won't fade away by June

Oh there she goes
She's kissing Michaelangelo
It would take a hammer to break his heart
What a beautiful work of art
You're my beautiful work of art

Give me a love with no rainy days
Give me a love that won't fade away
Give me a love with no cloudy view
Give me only you
Oh my Michaelangelo

Two in the morning without a warning it's over
The watchman came in said it's a sin what you do
You're taking that poor man of stone for granted
Hey Julia your filthy little game is through

Oh there she goes
She's kissing Michaelangelo
It would take a hammer to break his heart
What a beautiful work of art
Oh Michaelangelo

She's kissing Michaelangelo
It would take a hammer to break his heart
What a beautiful work of art
You're my beautiful work of art",Michaelangelo
Peter Mayer,"One and one makes three that's the way this love is going
There's only you and me but together we're overflowing
And if this sounds crazy let me make this clear
If a kiss is a candle, love is chandelier

Oh can't you see
That one and one makes three
Suddenly there's no way of knowing
We're so lost at sea but I'm happy on this boat we're rowing
So many times I wished that you'd set me free
But together we're so much more than you and me

Oh can't you see
That you take a step to me
I'll take a step to you
And let the angels sing their blues
You take a step to me
Oh now darling
I'll take a step to you
Come on love come on come to me
Only love can make the angels sing their blues

One and one makes three
You and me and this love that's growing
Two of us will walk heaven knows just where we're going",One and One Makes Three
Peter Mayer,"Too many dances have ended
When the band runs out of tunes
Too many hearts have been broken
When the pieces come unglued
Too many dreams abandoned 
When the new moon's lost it's shine
Oh send me the love of a lifetime

How many tears must I cry 
Before my broken heart will mend
How many roads must I wander
Till my home comes 'round the bend
All the treasures that I see
Still I feel so blind
Oh send me the love of a lifetime

Flowers fade when the river runs dry
The mountains will fall as the time goes by
But the bird in golden cage still wants to fly

So many ships are drifting
Where the stars no longer shine
So many words left unspoken
And we're running out of time
Too many secrets we're keeping
You've got yours and I've got mine
Oh send me the love 
Won't you send me the love
Won't you send me the love of a lifetime",Send Me the Love
Peter Mayer,"Caught a train to London
But it went to France
Ended up in New Orleans doin' a voodoo dance
What game are you playing?
What did you put in my tea?
You got your hands on the steering wheel
Ooh and it's a terrifying me

'Cause I'm under your spell
How was I to know where I should go
And it's too late to tell darling I'm under your spell

Band was playing a tango
In some mysterious key
You and me and your cigarette 
Talked poetry

First she took my hand
Took me off my feet
Then she took my pocketbook
No one could identify me

'Cause I'm under your spell
How was I to know where I should go
It's too late to tell darling I'm under your spell

I'm caught by your eye
How was I to see in the pale moonlight
I'm too mystified
Darling I'm under your spell

Three days gone in a minute
A breeze in a hurricane if you spin it
I'm in a hush ever since I caught your eye
Caught in New Orleans in a spell now

'Cause I'm under your spell
How was I to know I should let go
I should let go",Under Your Spell
Peter Mayer,"Name your price
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here any more
And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a short cut I'd have found it
But there is no easy way around it

Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard
It's such a lonely world
People turn their heads
And walk on by
Tell me is it worth just another try

Are we alive
Or just a dying planet
What are the chances
Ask the man in your heart for the answers
And when you feel afraid

Love one another
When you've lost your way
Love one another
And when you're all alone
Love one another
And when you're far from home
Love one another
And when you're down and out
Love one another
And when your hopes run out
Love one another
And when you need a friend
Love one another
We got to love one another",Coming Home
Peter Miles,"Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams

Peter Mintun,"One brief feeling, 5 seconds go by. Buzzing of wires. 
Sweater looks a lot like mine. 
Million things to think about, thinking about what I shouldn't think about. 
You've got a million ways to look at things. A bright side. 

A million ways to look at things. A bright side. 
Hello, Auburn, how are you? The state that I'm into, hands like hammers bang. 
There's no love lost. 
Bitter remained like a taste in your mouth and nobody finds the one, and they keep looking. 

Crawling in and out of beds, flesh covers the bone. 
Flesh searches for more, for more than flesh. 
flesh searches for more, for more than flesh. 
Flesh searches for more, for more than flesh. flesh searches for more, for more than flesh.",Mine
Peter Mintun,"I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found

Peter Mintun,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert

Peter Mintun,"Too many tears, each night I go to bed
I lie awake and shed too many tears
Your memory is bringing me too many tears

Too many years I wasted loving you
And you know I've been through
Too many years I cared a lot what have I got

Too many tears, I know I should have found a new love
And don't you think I didn't try?
But I found out a number two love, never seems to satisfy

Peter Mintun,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature

It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

Peter Mintun,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start

About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Here among the shadows, beautiful lady, open you heart.
The scene is set, the breezes sing of it,
Can't you get into the swing of it, lady, when do we start?

When the lady is kissable and the evening is cool,

Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken

Peter Mulvey,"Close my door
Close my eyes
Press my fingers to the glass
Why does November drag its heels when October never seems to last?

The television tells us love can make a mute man speak or
Make a closed man walk outside
But time sheds its light on all that I wanted to hide

I get off the train I stumble 'round the Square
I look for the poems at my feet
You and I come home
And there we bitch and moan
'bout all the perfect lovers that we never seem to meet
You'd better let someone love you instead of pushing us all away
Until time rolls right over all that you wanted to say

I know you are hurting
I see you tied up in knots over there
But these are the days we are given
They are precious we must live them I swear
This could be the last warm day in a cold and ugly November
When it's all over, what are you going to remember?

Hey old one up there
Where's the snow where are the lighted windows of our passing age?
You know you never told us of the bitter cold
Trying to find the heart inside each well-built cage
Still I forgive you
I would not have it any other way
I can say it only once more, I love you
Stay
Stay
Stay

Peter Mulvey,"Inside the tunnels, the stone tunnels, are the trains
And inside the trains, the steel trains, are the bags of skin
And inside the thin skin are the blood and the bones
And inside the blood and the bones are the dreams
It really is that simple, it really is that fragile
I am one such dream inside the blood and the bones and the bags and the
Trains and the tunnels
There's a dream sitting next to me
There's a dream across from me
Fragile

We all know that one day
The tunnels will crumble and the trains will stop
And the blood and the bags and the bones will be gone
And in between now and then something will happen to all the dreams
I don't know what will happen to the other dreams

But I know what will happen to me
Sure as rain, I know, sure as winter

I'll breathe and grieve and struggle and strive and love, love
And if I'm lucky once, just once, the dream will drop to the floor like a vase
And shatter in shards of silence
Where I will see, I will see in the pattern of the pieces, I will
See something

This will, this will happen
But now the train with all its fragile cargo rolls on.",The Dreams
Peter Mulvey,"I saw a woman in a circle
Her face was a rapture
She was pulling a lever, she was raising a hammer
She's gonna ring that bell
I turned to tell my brother
About this woman and her rapture
But the train shot into the darkness before ever That hammer fell - and it's

Better to breathe out - better to run than to hide
You'd better find out who's gonna be on your side

How many times do I have to tell you:
Don't lead with what is on your inside
Or people gonna find out you're different
People gonna drag out all you have to hide and it's

Better to breathe out - better to leap before you look
Keep your mind focused, and maybe you'll write that book

You could be folding your laundry
Twelve hundred miles from the place you were born
You could look up into the sweet and forgiving autumn sunlight
And you realize all at once - you have carried your scars this far
Because you love them; the world touches you that way and it
Hurts so much that you just smile and you lay down, you lay down
Without a fight
I guess we're all gonna work on maggie's farm for a little while longer
Not tell anyone what he have inside to give
And you keep your eyes on the stars up above
And don't you just lay down and live it is

Better to breathe out - better to run than to hide
You'd better believe I am on your side

Peter Mulvey,"I speak to you
Hope you'll understand
You made your son Joseph a dangerous man
He's gone to town
Got himself a gun
This could happen to every mother's son

I spoke with Joseph
His time has come
Vengeance is mine he said
Come join the fun
But he looked more like a Judas on the run
This could happen to every mother's son

Since I spoke to Joseph
He's gone into town
He killed six strong men
Before they shot him down
I hate to say it but it's only just begun
This could happen to every mother's son

Something to tell you
I think you should know
You sink to fast and you love to slow
But you do not feel that you're the only one
This could happen to every mother's son

Peter Mulvey,"Sometimes I feel like the man
I think you think I am
These days I am mourning the loss
Of a dream that I don't understand

Time is a lens
I see you now
Your hair blown by winds from afar

Sometimes don't you feel like the woman
You think I think you are

It's just smoke
But it's in flesh in blood we deal
And you can't go your whole life denying the things you feel

I held you up like an angel
Sewn you down on my life
I tell no one else you could compare
To the myth who should have been my wife
And now I'm trying to shake you
Alone beneath this roof
But you stay like a mark on my breast
Though I burn every shred of proof

It's just smoke
But it's in flesh in blood now we live
Maybe those sweet kisses were never really ours to give

I've been wrestling with the moon and her tides
The curve of her breast
Her hair falls like rain
The laugh the sigh the smile now
These things aching me like a lost memory gained and
I have seen what I have seen in this lifetime
Just dreaming you looked over my shoulder

I'm older now
Maybe we can let this shit
Let it smolder
I need smoke
Cause it's in flesh in blood now I stand
I won't be haunted any longer by the dreams I do not understand",Smoke
Peter Mulvey,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

In which they are so so locked
Reduced to tears

As you hit the roof 

Interviewed your dreams 
Walked on thin air

Would they understand
If I were to show

Peter Murphy,"The girls won't touch me
'cause I've got a misdirection
Living at night isn't helping my complexion
The signs all saying it's a social infection
A little bit of fun's never been an insurrection

Mamma threw me out till I get some pants that fit
She just won't approve of my strange kind of wit
I get so excited, always gotta lose
Man that send me off
Let them take the cure

Don't need a cure
Need a final solution

Buy me a ticket to a sonic reduction
Guitars gonna sound like a nuclear destruction
Seems I'm a victim of natural selection
Meet me on the other side, another direction

Don't need a cure
Need a final solution

Peter Murphy,"Dua

Allah'im lütfet ki gittigmiz her yere baris gotürelim
Bölücü degil bagdastirici birlestirici olabilelim
Nefret olan yere sevgi, yaralanma olan yere affedicilik
Kusku olan yere inanç, ümitsizlik olan yere ümit

Karanlik olan yere aydinlik ve üzüntü olan yere
Sevinç satici olmayi bize lütfet yarabbi
Kusurlari gören degil, kusuru örtenlerden
Teselli arayanlardan degil teselli edenlerden

Anlayis bekleyenlerden degil, anlayis gösterenlerden
Yanliz sevilmeyi isteyenlerden degil
Sevenlerden olmamiza yardim et
Yagmur gibi hiç bir sey ayirt etmeyip

Aktigi her yere canlilik bahsedenlerden
Günes gibi hiç bir sey ayirt etmeyip
Isigiyla tüm varliklari aydinlatanlardan
Toprak gibi hersey üstüne bastigi halde

Hiç bir seyini esirgemeyip
Nimetlerini herkese verenlerden olmayi bize lutfet
Alan degil, veren ellerin
Affedici oldugu için affedilenlerin

Hak ile dogan hak ile yasayan
Hak ile ölenlerin ve sonsuz yasam da yeniden doganlarin
Safina katilmayi bize nasip eyle

Like an insect
Up and down the walls

The light pours out of me

Of silence ought
To revolutionize

The cold light of day
Pours out of me
Leaving me black

In this still life
Heart beats up love

The light pours out of me

Dripping mellow stains of long

The lover he must meet
Circling round about
Dripping mellow stains of long
Melting in her heat

All past was but a lie
She killed his head
She killed his mouth
And opened up the sky

Spoke hushed and frailing lips yeah
Old eyes skim in creasing lids
A tear falls as she describes
Approaching death with a yearning heart 
With pride and no despise 

Hot tears flow as she recounts
Her favorite worded token
Forgive me please for hurting so 
Don't go away heartbroken no",Marlene Dietrich's Favourite Poem
Peter Murphy,"On a long and winding grey paved street
Your breath the only friend
Chattering others surrounding you
You're going out again
It's a laugh and a gas new crowd
You tell yourself
While buttoning up your new red shirt 
It's been a twenty years of doing this 
Just the same night into night 
Day into day 
With your preset mind 

Wake up with a preset mind 
With no self control 
And you decide to call the Roll Call 
Of the socialites who mortified 
Can't see as far as their next surprise 
Yah, happy with nothing but the sweet F.A. of the night 
Believing that they're alive and well
But if asked
They have nothing to tell
Except the words of a clashing rhyme
I'll calmed and out of sync
Even real sounds like a zero
To a brain in lip sync 
Roll' 

On a long and winding grey paved street
Your breath the only friend 
Chattering others surrounding you
You're going out again
It's a laugh and a gas new crowd 
You tell yourself
While buttoning up your new red shirt 
It's been a twenty years of doing this 
Just the same night into night 
Day into day 
Forget your preset mind 
Roll",Roll Call
Peter Murphy,"The day grows older.
The moon appears in a mirror 
A fire side mirror 
A distant walker 
Hears the words 
Go do good deeds 
So you feel OK 
The moon and the sun 
Partners in light
Separating reflecting one light
Hearing this confusion wanes 
No need to ask for wealth 
Or one thing more now

And the night 
Feels the same 
As a cool hot summers climb
With the voice
Comes no shame 
As the walker walks the line 
The day grows older 
The moon appears
Reflecting on his heart 
Heavy weighed and pierced 
The walker looks at his days
Bad deeds gone by
For which he must pay
The moon and the sun 
Partners in light
Separating reflecting one light
Hearing this confusion wane
Another image hits
The seven veils of mind
But the night 
Feels the same 
As a cool hot summers climb 
With the voice comes no shame 
As the walker hunts the line",Seven Veils
Peter Murphy,"One day you will be the one
To say I'm sick of empty fun
It means if your faith is strong
It means you are no longer astray...
See I see all the light It comes straight from the sun
And I want to get near so I can be clear

Soon I will merge with the one
Soon I will be with the love
One day when the lights turn green
There is no time... this love I thirst

Don't get shy, don't get caught with the world and its thoughts
I'm not asking for worship or lazy sleazy thoughts

Soon I will merge with the one
Soon I will be with the love
One day when the light turns green
There is no time... this love I thirst

Don't get shy, don't get caught with the world and its thoughts
I'm not asking for worship or lazy sleazy thoughts

(The Sister of Sleep)
He was thought of as strange... a good looking man
And shallow eyes like two hidden from view and empty puddles of hue
His views on death spread like two anecdotal tales
Although he, reclining, declining, to disclose in public...
These opinions in public; the tales held the key

Death is the surname of sleep, but the surname unknown to us
Sleep is the daily end of life; a small exercise in death
Which is it's sister, but not every brother and sister are equally close,
Giving to the enemy a small exercise in submission
And holding onto nothing

He was thought of as strange... a good looking man
And shallow eyes like two hidden from view and empty puddles of hue
His views on death...

One day you will be the one
To say I'm sick of empty fun
It means if your faith is strong
It means you are no longer astray...
See I see all the light It comes straight from the sun
And I want to get near so I can be clear

Don't get shy, don't get caught with the world and its thoughts
I'm not asking for worship or lazy sleazy thoughts",Shy
Peter Murphy,"A strange kind of love
A strange kind of feeling
Swims through your eyes
And like the doors
To a wide vast dominion
They open to your prize

This is no terror ground
Or place for the rage
No broken hearts
White wash lies
Just a taste for the truth
Perfect taste choice and meaning
A look into your eyes

Blind to the gemstone alone
A smile from a frown circles round
Should he stay or should he go
Let him shout a rage so strong
A rage that knows no right or wrong
And take a little piece of you

There is no middle ground
Or that's how it seems
For us to walk or to take
Instead we tumble down
Either side left or right
To love or to hate",A Strange Kind of Love [Version One]
Peter Murphy,"I find you in the morning
After dreams of distant signs
You pour yourself over me
Like the sun through the blinds
You lift me up
And get me out
Keep me walking
But never shout
Hold the secret close
I hear you say

You know the way
It throws about
It takes you in
And spits you out
It spits you out
When you desire
To conquer it
To feel you're higher
To follow it
You must be clean
With mistakes
That you do mean
Move the heart
Switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place

On and on it goes
Calling like a distant wind
Through the zero hour we'll walk
Cut the thick and break the thin
No sound to break no moment clear
When all the doubts are crystal clear
Crashing hard into the secret wind

You know the way
It twists and turns
Changing color
Spinning yarns
You know the way
It leaves you dry

It cuts you up
It takes you high
You know the way
It's painted gold
Is it honey
Is it gold

You know the way
It throws about
It takes you in
And spits you out
You know the way

It throws about
It takes you in
And spits you out
It spits you out

When you desire
To conquer it
To feel you're higher
To follow it

You must be clean
With mistakes
That you do mean
Move the heart
Switch the pace
Look for what
Seems out of place

It's o.k.
It goes this way
The line is thin
It twists away
Cuts you up
It throws about
Keep me walking
But never shout",Cuts You Up (Edit)
Peter Murphy,"Let go all the tears of your life 
The one you left behind 
Let the pain of the dream go by 
It's over 
The love is calling
I'm searching 
You have gone to be free

The love is calling
I'm searching
You have gone to be free
When the light had gone
And the night was over
Yet the feeling will still exist
For you and me

Let go all the tears of your life 
The one you left behind 
Let the pain of the dream go by it's over
And the feeling still exists 
For you and me
You have gone to be free

Let go all the tears of your life 
The one you left behind
Let the pain of the dream go by it's over
Oh, and as you fly past the sign
That points to our way 
Send your children a whispered song 
Then allow yourself away 

One two I am you
You are but a show
Three four there's no more
Your red mouth is aglow 
Five six no more tricks 
Now I'm feeling clean 
The secret yeah it moved so fast 
Had to dive into mid stream",Dream Gone By
Peter Murphy,"Walking in the street 
Breath the only friend
Strangers pass me by
I'm moving, moving with the wind 
Inside me now, the gold
The gold at rainbow's end
Stranger to myself, a stranger 
Stranger till the end 
Behind the closed door 
The one we painted green
To remind me of the perfect plan

Wash my face in fields of green 
Take me to the stars for free
Point me to the high wire call 
Wake me true and wake me all

Walk me in the streets 
Take me, to a view on high 
To an empire state 
Tease, tease and bake me dry 
Swerve and turn on me
Melt me, melt me to the wall
Like an unspent fortune, I'm running 
Running with the call
Behind the closed door
The one we painted green 
To remind me of a perfect plan 

Wash my face 
In fields of green 
Take me to the stars for free

Love is all I need
Hope is what I'm asking for
Lay me down to sleep
It was then that I lost you 
Was dragged there too 
Under the sea of mystery 
Died there along with you 

Love me hold me keep me from harm
Love me hold me keep me from harm

Guess you found your own root 
Dug into that vast heart 
Flew without wing or pinion 
Now you orbit the stars 
Now haunted and weary
Your vision creeps

I need a release

Peter Murphy,"Take me on a trip 
Take me from the hip
Keep me cool and dry 
Round the corner from the dip 

It should not veer or lead astray 
Or hide me from the truth

Oh, I won't need no proof 

You call me a liar
You say that you don't need me 
Well sure, but I'll still be there reflecting 
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
Kill the hate

I've always wanted to hide your problems 
Wanted to save you pain
If only just to cover
You and all your stains 

There's plenty left where that came from
And nothing I would hide 
To make you face oblivion
And shake your shake your pretty pride
Kill the hate 

I'll see you in the stratosphere 
I'll meet you in the show
I'll visit you when you don't look
I'll melt you in the snow

Oh let me give you cover until it's alright

The streets gone wild defeated wild
Sitting in the low room 
Where we wind our love loom 
Don't why'think it's wrong 
That I should get stuck in a room?

The low room Low--room--low--room 
2,3, uh! 

I don't know what 
What I can do to break the chains 
We talk a lot , we break high ground, high ground no shame 
Maybe there's no need to fight against the chains
Rations of irrational thirsty for the up 
Of secret honey, honey on the lips
Low--room--low--low 
Ten!

You're away tonight as the art on the box cuts 
Vivid life in action

A day that I call smooth
When you came into my heart I knew
The love was overflowing
And I say 
La la la la la! 

The day was so long and the night was still
And you kept coming over 
To my hill 
I would weep for the day 
Without you, all the way 
You wanted to be free 
And doubt would overflow 
Just came running to me 
Cause you knew I'd take you home 

Then you came into my heart 
We knew for a start

We call to stillness 
As we kiss the water king's hand
We hear the one same name 
As the darker the land gets 
We never know, we never know
We're fueling for the light

To the stellar far land of his desire
Singing strange and crazy by the day
Like all the pretty things he once admired
Singing pretty like a bird
Singing pretty like a high class fool

All that he loved was yet to be
As he threw that starry look into his crowd
A holy seer without a holy book
Such easy meat for the hunting hounds
Sang the key of minor sonnet
That he got from the Major Cool

Don't forget it he's all heart

A strange kind of feeling 
Swims through your eyes 
And like the doors 
To a wide vast dominion 
They open to your prise 
This is no terror ground 
Or place for the rage 
No broken hearts 
White wash lies 
Just a taste for the truth 
Perfect taste choice and meaning 
A look into your eyes 
Blind to the gemstone alone 
A smile from a frown circles round 
Should he stay or should he go 
Let him shout a rage so strong 
A rage that knows no right or wrong 
And take a little piece of you 
There is no middle ground

Instead we tumble down

In through our love's initial veil

Checking out their features
One walked a fine line
While the other's drew it

I faced the moon
Asked the maker
‘Where were you'?

Where were you?

As rivers run
And moonlight shines
I'll catch her in the mirror
And in a our land that time forgot

Still a stand to cast

And that pick of old bones

Locked in some flimsy cage
Made of the stuff of the free will kind

The players fishing ideas

The fear inside my head
Is just a resistance to

Calls a welcome in

Peter Nero,"It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around
And finally found
Somebody who
Could make me be true
Could make me be blue.
Or even be glad
Just to be sad
Thinking of you.

Some others I've seen,
Might never mean.
Might never be cross,
Or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill,
With all your faults I love you still.
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.",It Had to Be You
Peter Nero,"Dreary days are over
Life's a four leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last!

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's Lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you",Long Ago (And Far Away)
Peter Nero,"There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Peter Nero,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Peter Nero,"Ben, the two of us need look no more,
We both found what we were looking for.
With a friend to call my own,
I'll never be alone, and you, my friend, will see,
You've got a friend in me.
Ben, you're always running here and there,
You feel you're not wanted anywhere.
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
Ben most people would turn you away;
I don't listen to a word they say.
They don't see you as I do;
I wish they would try to'
I'm sure they'd think again if they had a friend like Ben,
A friend like Ben

Peter Nero,"For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream

Yes, tomorrow may never, never come

Peter Nero,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Peter Nero,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star

I will be remembering

Peter Nero,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool

My poor heart is in an awful state now

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!

Peter Nero,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day

To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

Step inside the door
I don't want to hear those lies, I'm sure
I've heard it all before

And you left me waiting so long,
I was waiting so long

But you never believe me and maybe I know
Oh, honey, I know, it's undecided love
But you never believe and maybe I know
Honey I know, it's undecided love

Taking it away, you can't complain so every little blue I have
Gotta find a peace of mind when I look after the tear that's gone

Peter Noone,"Woke up this mornin' feelin' fine
There's somethin' special on my mind
Last night I met a new girl in the neighbourhood, whoa yeah
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')

She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
(she danced with me like I hoped she would)
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good

She's everthing I've been dreamin' of
She's everthing I've been dreamin' of

I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could

Peter Nordahl,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too 
",Lush Life
Peter Ostroushko,"Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay 
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard 
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

And nothing, nothing is going right

Grows dark and full of clouds

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Too hot to handle

Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

Wanna laugh like a loon

Walking on the dead
Never seemed to matter
It's all inside your head

Mentioned on a stone
And If you're going somewhere
You're going it alone

Something new inside of me
What's this shakin'
You made me shiver

And all those other spells
Didn't make impressions

I'm sure that I would know
I really don't remember

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""

Two children begging in rags
Both touched with a burning ambition
To shake off their lowly brown tags, yes they try
So look into my face Marie-Claire
And remember just who you are
Then go and forget me forever

The town is sound asleep
Like omens underneath the moon
The waves crash on the beach

The restless clouds are circling
Like birds of pray in flight
And nature lifts an angry hand
Posed and set to strike

And every man will know the power
That marked the planets birth
The hurricane, the hurricane
Returns us to the earth

No man made shelter strong enough
To stop the raging tide
The storm relentless in its quest
To conquer and divide

What has stood a hundred years
Awakens to the roar
As the waves come pounding down
Like hammers on the shore

And every man will know the power
That marked the planets birth
The hurricane, the hurricane
Returns us to the earth

The harbor lights have long gone out
Submerged beneath the waves
The moon attends the final rites
Above the ocean grave

While restless clouds still circle 'round
Like birds of prey in flight
Natures hand all quiet and still
Retreats before the light

The hurricane is over now
The storm has finally past
While on the sand a child walks
And kicks at bits of glass

Peter Schilling,"Standing there alone, the ship is waiting
All systems are go, are you sure?
Control is not convinced
But the computer has the evidence
No need to abort

The countdown starts, watching in a trance
The crew is certain

Nothing left to chance, all is working
Trying to relax, up in the capsule
""Send me up a drink"", jokes Major Tom

Floating weightless, calling calling home

Second stage is cut, we're now in orbit
Stabilizers up, running perfect
Starting to collect, requested data
What will it effect, when all is done
Thinks Major Tom

Back at ground control, there is a problem
Go to rockets full, not responding
Hello Major Tom, are you receiving
Turn the thrusters on, we're standing by
There's no reply

4, 3, 2, 1
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, calling, calling, home

Across the stratosphere
A final message, ""Give my wife my love""
Then nothing more

Far beneath the ship, the world is mourning
They don't realize, he's alive
No one understands but Major Tom sees
Now the life commands, this is my home

A fair maid I did meet,
She asked me to see her home--
She lived in Bleecker Street.
Chorus:
And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?
And when we got to Bleecker Street,
We stopped at forty-four,
Her mother and her sister there,
To meet her at the door.
Chorus:
And when I got inside the house,
The drinks were passed around,
The liquor was so awful strong,
My head went round and round.
Chorus:
And then we had another drink,
Before we sat to eat,
The liquor was so awful strong,
I quickly fell asleep.
Chorus:

When I awoke next morning
I had an aching head,
There was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in me bed.
Chorus:
My gold watch and my pocketbook
And lady friend were gone;
And there was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in the room.
Chorus:
On looking round this little room,
There's nothing I could see,
But a woman's shift and apron
That were no use to me.

Down Cherry Street forlorn,
There Martin Churchill took me in,
And sent me 'round Cape Horn.

Any, any, any old iron?
You look neat. Talk about a treat!
You look so dapper from your napper to your feet.
Dressed in style, brand-new tile,
And your father's old green tie on.
But I wouldn't give you tuppence for your old watch and chain,
Old iron, old iron.""

Just a week or two ago my dear old Uncle Bill,
He went and kicked the bucket and he left me in his will.
So I went around the road to see my Auntie Jane.
She said, ""your Uncle Bill has left you a watch and chain.""
So I put it on right across my derby kell.
The sun was shining on it and it made me look a swell.
I went out, strolling round about.
A crowd of kiddies followed me and they began to shout,

I won't forget the day I went to London on the spree.
I saw the mayor of London there. That's who I went to see.
He came along in a carriage and a pair.
I shouted, ""come on, boys! All throw your hats up in the air.""
Just then the mayor, he began to smile,
Pointed to my face and said, ""Lor Lummy, what a dial!""
Started Lord-a-mayoring, and then to my dismay,
He pointed to my watch and chain and shouted to me, ""Hey,
Any old iron? ...""

I shan't forget the day I married Miss Elisa Brown.
The way the people laughed at me, it made me feel a clown.
I arrived in a carriage called a hack,
When I suddenly discovered I'd my trousers front to back.
So I walked down the aisle, dressed in style,
The vicar took a look at me and then began to smile.
The organ started playing. The bells began to ring.
The people started laughing and the choir began to sing,
""Any old iron? ...""

If I could bring you back
And talk about everything
If I could bring you back again.

I lost my faith in the world 
When you disappeared
Now I've finally found my feet again
And I wish 
You were here

To walk in the living room
And turn the radio off

If I could bring you back
I'd play you a little song
If I could bring you back
But you're gone

I'm happy for the things I have
One thing I'd like to change
I'd spend my nights making you laugh
I'd do anything to see your face again

Just to make you smile
Would set me free

If I could bring you back
That'd be the sweetest thing
If I could bring you back
I would do anything
If I could bring you back
To me",Bring You Back
Peter Stuart,"Break it down to smallest pieces 
To see where it went wrong
Roll it over again and again in my head 
'Til every last hope is gone

I was slow to react
And you disappeared
You said you were coming right back and then
You left me here

Here I am here
Here I am here

Trouble down at the O.K. Hotel
West Seattle seems so far 
Cut off from the comforts of the road
And it's belly up to the bar

I just had to ask 
And you disappeared
You swore you were coming right back
And then you left me here

Here I am here 
Here I am here

It's easier said than done
But I'm done saying so

As you disappeared",Here I Am Here
Peter Stuart,"There are angels all around us
With snakes at there feet
It's been raining now for 39 days
And there's garbage floating 
Down the street

I don't want to be your downfall
I just couldn't help myself
You wrapped your arms
Around me
And the stars just shattered
And fell

I wish I was innocent
There's blood on my hands
I wish I was innocent
But we've gone too far and
Seen too much
To ever get back to innocence

There's a preacher on the corner
But I just walk away
He's throwing grace all over the place
Am I too far gone to save?

I think I had good intentions
I didn't want it to be this way
I just wanted to be the air that you
Breathe
Then I watched you suffocate

I wish I was innocent
There's blood on my hands
I wish I was innocent
But we've gone too far and
Seen too much

All the things we used to be
Though you trampled through my life
I still wonder what it would be like

All your great mistakes

Tell me, do you dream of me

Peter Stuart,"She's going to hell in a hand-me-down dress
She doesn't hate her life,
She couldn't care less
She wakes up every morning
A little depressed
And goes back to bed
Says she had enough of
Being lonely

She says

Roll me over
Don't wake me up 'til this dream is done
Roll me over
And don't wake me up 'til my 
Better days have begun

I'm going to heaven I guess
But I'm a little bit bored
I've had a good life, but there must be more
I get so tired of trying to do everything right
I'm thinking maybe tonight
I'll find someone who sees the
Light behind my eye

And says

Roll me over
Don't wake me up 'til this dream is done
Roll me over
And don't wake me up 'til my 
Better days have begun

We met on a warm November day
I was too dumbstruck to
Have anything smart to say
I said ""where've you been all my life""
She said ""I've been right here, 
Looking for you
Waiting for you, dreaming of you""

Ooooh
Songs about you

I find myself repeating
Simple things I'd love to hear
You say
But you don't ever say them
You don't want to give yourself away

I hear then anyway

In songs about you
Oooh

I can make you say whatever
I want
I can twist the truth around
I can make everything work out

I wasn't thinking of you
I didn't miss you until you came along

Peter Stuart,"Tell me now, what am I supposed to learn
Everything's just rushing by
I've been down this road before
Everything looks new this time

I've been driving backwards
Letting the radio rewind
Waiting to hear my favorite song

Take me back - before I'm gone
Talk me down - from this ledge
Take me back - before too long

The devil's pixie tells me things 
When you're not with me 
I don't know who I am 

I've been wrong before it's too 
Late I'll confess 
I've been hiding from this mess 
I'm not strong enough to fool 
Myself this time 
To turn this fear into a lie 

I've been driving faster 
Letting the radio unwind 
Waiting to hear my favorite song 

Take me back - before I'm gone 
Talk me down - from this ledge

Peter Stuart,"I've come a long way 
Just to find myself on the floor
Dizzy from the heights you took me to
Well I still come back for more

I can't stand for fear of falling
But I don't want to stay here
On the ground
Please tell me everything that
Goes up
Doesn't have to come down,
Down

I will let you take me
Into thin air

Take this fear and call it love
Tell me that you're here and
There's nothing to be scared of
And I will learn to love
This vertigo
Vertigo

I threw caution into the wind
I got up off the sidelines and
Put myself in
Now I don't know if I'm falling
Or floating in a dream of you
Tell me that these wings are
Not too good to be true

Stay right by my side
And don't look down

Tell me that you're here and
There's nothing to be scared of
And I will learn to love

Peter T. Noonan,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

Than I've ever been lifted before.
Keep it up, which is my desire,
And I'll be at your side forever more.

Because your love
(Your love keeps liftin' me)
Keeps on liftin' (keeps on liftin' me)
Liftin' me higher and higher.

I'm so glad that I finally found you,
Yes, that one in a million girls.
When I wrap my lovin' arms around you
Well, I'm ready to face the world.

Disappointment was my closest friend.
But you came and he soon departed,
And I'll never see his face again.

Peter Tork,"I sit at the piano almost all the time
I think about my life and try to make it rhyme
It's been such a long, long while
Since I've been to the front
I did so well the last time it must have seemed a stunt

But my chops have gotten tender
I don't know if I am able
To pick the banner up again, do service and stay stable

'Cause I'd rather be no one at home
And leave my talent on the shelf
Than be the world to some poor girl
Who's nobody at home herself",Tender Is

I knew I'd reply
You breathed me in so deeply
You took my hand as the music began
I knew I could dance if you led me

The snake is poised and is held by your noise
You charm the life out of demons
You kept me up there with the web of your hair
You spun my life into meaning
Everybody knows your fate, honey, everybody knows your fate

I've seen your stars; so many lives
You seem to shine forever
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember the time
Our memories held us together?
Everybody knows your fate, honey, everybody knows your fate

Everybody's hopeful, so much feeling

Hear your calling

And no one seems to care.

Because her roses are in bloom,
And mr. green, he's so serene,
He's got a tv in every room.

Here in status symbol land,
Mothers complain about how hard life is,
And the kids just don't understand.

And make it hard for me to see. 
Ah thoughts all seem to stray to places far away,

Peter von Poehl,"A red line drawn upon the scene, indifference echoing through the screen. Blinded by profanity, it's a sin.

A gun shot is heard, but no-one sees. Using a veil for immunity. Deception used by numbers out of greed.

You believe that you can see, that the humans are not really free. A global 
conspiracy, the same as you and me.

The ink that shed the legacy, underlying disloyalty. Self aware residual to me.

The once so noble families they know how to process viciously, accuse each other and you'll go free.

But is that nature's fault?

You seal off your windows, close all doors, to outer space.
You decide to cut all connections to the disgraceful human race.

He stayed a bit too long, 
small change could buy him time

through restless streets already lead astray, 
a promise faded north-side the bridge; 
all these forgotten figures carried in his chest. 

He felt the south wind on his shadow, 
as the sloping landscape picked up speed. 
Following directions logically, 
his old familiar voices disagreed. 

He kept staring out the window, 
past the furrows and the grooves below, 
way beyond a keen mind,
and a broken dream that a child had left behind. 

He took the small roads after midnight. 
A hand above him clearly drew his flight
The sound of changes deviling his soul; 
it was clear as daylight that he was nowhere near his goal. 

He kept staring out the window, 
past the furrows and the grooves below,
way beyond a keen mind
and a broken dream that a child had left behind. 

He tied a string around his finger. 
Captured by the sidetracks on parade,
he felt an urge to break their constant waves; 
in this forgotten garden nothing can be saved.

Unfolded slowly,
stretched out out limbs

punched the cash machine,

far is the dune of ruby sand

I crossed a village made of ice
white silent houses weep at night

I went straight the labyrinth collapsed
I followed the road of no return
she might find me near the end of the world

I saw candles burning on a hill
the light or the thought remained still
the horizon was disguised as a long corridor

So I picked a few thorns on the road

the catcher in my dream drew a portrait of her

for another block. 
Picking up arguments 
with the bills on the wall,
while the beat goes on. 

My conductor is deaf
and the melody has been mislaid. 
The theatre is locked up

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Peter Wells,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Peter White,"Love, what have you done? Oh, wow.
I was sure up to now that she was a friend.
I stayed till the end. Don't be a fool again.
I once believed that love was fair.
But I don't anymore.  She said I'm a bore.
My heart hit the floor.

Don't be a fool anymore.
Each time around.
I tell myself it's the game of love.
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love.
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again.
So I'll say to the end
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)
Said I don't want to be a fool ever again.

Whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame.
He's caught in the game. It all ends up the same.
He doesn't feel the shame. He looks at love in a diff'rent way.
It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange.

But he'll never change. He's never gonna change.
Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before
I won't look back.
There'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore.
I just decided I can't let nobody fool me again.
So I'll swear to the end.
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)
Said I don't want to be a fool (ever again)
No way, (I mean no more) Never again (Oo, no never)
I can't be a fool, can't be. No way. No way. No way. Oo.
I don't want to be.  I don't want to be a fool. No.
I can't love anybody (I can't love nobody)
walking on a one way street. (Any way, any way any, way no.)
If I don't (If I don't) find somebody (somebody body )
that'll be alright with me. (know, I know it'll be alright now)
'cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again.

Said I don't want to be a fool. (Don't wanna be a fool)

I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true

once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

To be holding you for so long 
And for the rest of the night 
I'll be holding you tight 
So tight

Her rosy cheek, her ruby lips, they gave my heart no rest.
The name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west.

I courted lovely Flora, she promised ne'er to go.
But soon a tale was told to me that filled my heart with woe.
They said she meets another man who holds my love in jest.
And yet I trusted Flora, the lily of the west.

'Way down in yonder shady grove, a man of low degree,
He spoke unto my Flora there and kissed her 'neath a tree.
The answers that she gave to him like arrows pierced my breast.
I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west.

I stepped up to my rival, my dagger in my hand.
I seized him by the collar and I ordered him to stand.
All in my desperation I stabbed him in his breast.
I'd killed a man for Flora, the lily of the west.

And then I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea.
They placed me in a pris'ner's dock and then commenced on me.
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the lily of the",Flora

I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had

With half damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughin' and singin' 'til the early hours of the morn

By the old wooden stove where our hats were hung
Our words were told and our songs were sung
We longed for nothin' and were satisfied
Talkin' and a jokin' about the world outside

With haunted hearts through the heat and cold
We never thought we could get very old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
Though our chances really were a million to one

As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
Our choices were few and the thought never hit
That the road we traveled would ever shatter and split

How many a year has passed and gone
Many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a first friend
And each one of them I've never seen again

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room once again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that

Let's time decide what it should mean
It?s not the time but just the dreams that die
And sometimes when the room is still

Time with so much truth to kill
Leaves you by the window sill so tied
Without a wing, to take you high
Without a clue to tell you why

Now, I just want to keep my name, not bother anybody?s game
Without ideas of gold or fame or insane heights
I don't want a lot of money, I don't want a Playboy bunny
Just a love to call me honey late at night
In my arms, by my side, in my arms late at night

But I don't know, I ain't been told

So scared of dying, so unknown
And so alone, rollin? home

Who for a front would trade their souls
A broken mirror?s the only hole for them
And for you who'd exchange yourselves

Just to be somebody else
Pretending things you never felt or meant
Hey, you don't live what you defend
You can't give so you just bend

Now if you care what people think
Like they supplied some missing link
They'll just stand back and watch you sink so slow
They'll never help you to decide

they'll only take you for a ride
After which they'll try and hide the fact that they don't know
What you should do, where you should go
What you should do, where you should go

Everybody wants a hand to hold
They're so afraid of being old
So scared of dying, so unknown
And so alone, rollin? home

there's nothing big I want to prove
No mountains that I need to move
Or even claim what's right or true for you
My sights, my songs are slightly charred

You might think they miss their mark
But things are only what they are and nothing new
But for me, I think they'll do
But for me, I think they'll do

Well, I can see a king and queen, a beggar falling at my feet
They all must see the same sad dreams at night
Futility and senseless war, pit the rich against the poor
While cause is buried long before the fight
For what was wrong, for what was right
It?s just the strong, who ever says what's right

other people's dids and don'ts.
He could excuse himself but he won't

Yes, there was a girl in his life, and then some!
He was had by her and a good time by all.
She was exactly half at fault
he thought the other was his own
So only half the man has grown
and it's taking him sometime to get together.

He was the first kid on his block to have one;
And he wants to share it with you all of the time.
He takes advantage of your kindness;
says he needs that just to live
He doesn't want you to forgive him

"Peter, Paul and Mary","Sunday morning, very bright, I read Your book by colored light
That came in through the pretty window picture.

I visited some houses where they said that You were living
And they talked a lot about You
And they spoke about Your giving.
They passed a basket with some envelopes;
I just had time to write a note
And all it said was ""I believe in You.""

Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants.
The discussion was theology,
And when they smiled and turned to me
All that I could say was ""I believe in You.""

I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving
And a balded man said You were dead,
But the house would go on living.
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave
He shook his head and said I'd never find You.

And while my dad was sleeping
We would walk down to Your house without speaking.",Hymn

And ducks and geese and cherry pies

Table bare and tears in her eyes

A bit of cheese, some bread to share

"Peter, Paul and Mary","When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me
""Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree""
""Don't put your faith in love, my boy"" my father said to me
""I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree""

Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled, the stars rose in the sky
We passed that summer lost in love, beneath the lemon tree
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me

Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree, very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day she left without a word, she took away the sun
And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done
She left me for another, it's a common tale but true
A sadder man, but wiser now, I sing these words to you

But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

"Peter, Paul and Mary","I'd like to take you by surprise at the grocery store
Grab you by the hand and step on the electric door
Leave the shopping cart right where it is
I betcha somebody's got the same list
I want to take us away from all this to a distant shore.

I'd leave the car by the curb with the motor on
The tape deck playin' our favorite love song
And you'd say ""What in the world?""
And smile just like a little girl
And I'd say ""I can't tell you now but it won't be long.""

I know it sounds funny, but it's true...
I get so busy I forget I'm in love with you
And every now and then we need to get away to get close again.

Your head on my shoulder and a blanket around our feet
We could leave the kids at home
And if you get worried we could telephone
We need a weekend of fun for under two hundred dollars complete.

There we would be in a sunny land
We'd lie on the beach and you could wiggle your toes in the sand

And a midnight dip if the temperature's right

For a million reasons we can't even name

Like the first time, only this time

Are we starting now, did we never end?
Our different dreams have reached the same conclusion
And brought us here to fall in love again

We're a song that must be sung together
Like the first time, only this time
Could it be forever?

In the honesty of now with you beside me
There's an ease to love we've never known before
And though I know the past is still inside me
I feel as if I've never loved you more

"Peter, Paul and Mary","You have asked me why the days fly by so quickly
And why each one feels no different from the last
And you say that you are fearful for the future
And you have grown suspicious of the past
And you wonder if the dreams we shared together
Have abandoned us or we abandoned them
And you cast about and try to find new meaning
So that you can feel that closeness once again.

Carry on my sweet survivor, carry on my lonely friend
Don't give up on the dream, and don't you let it end.
Carry on my sweet survivor,
Though you know that something's gone
For everything that matters carry on.

You remember when you felt each person mattered
When we all had to care or all was lost
But now you see believers turn to cynics
And you wonder was the struggle worth the cost
Then you see someone too young to know the difference
And a veil of isolation in their eyes
And inside you know you've got to leave them something
Or the hope for something better slowly dies.

Carry on my sweet survivor, carry on my lonely friend
Don't give up on the dream, and don't you let it end.

"Peter, Paul and Mary","Chorus:
Music speaks louder than words
It's the only thing that the whole world listens to.
Music speaks louder than words,
When you sing, people understand.

Sometimes the love that you feel inside
Gets lost between your heart and your mind
And the words don't really say the things you wanted them to.
But then you feel in someone's song
What you'd been trying to say all along
And somehow with the magic of music the message comes through.

(chorus)

The longer I live the more I find that people seldom take the time
To really get to know a stranger and make him a friend.
But the power of a simple song can make everybody feel they belong.
Maybe singin' and playin' can bring us together again.
Singin' and playin' can bring us together again.

Solitude complete
The stillness clear
And close as heaven's door

The earth beats out its rhythm
In slow and perfect time
Counterpoint and harmonies
Life's melodies entwine

And we fight the battle here
Where there's time to fall in step
The secrets are still known here
But the secrets never kept

Wild places, somewhere
We can see the Father's hand
Wild places, somewhere
We can be alone with you
We need a promised land

Maybe we'll be wounded in the healing
It's to be broken to be sure
Can we embrace
This strange awakening together?

Is wisdom carved into creation?
The old relationships defined
As forbidding as her truth may be
We'll learn her ways with time

We'll learn to take it as it comes
We can't change faster than we can
Already we're a long way
From the children we began

Wild places, somewhere
We can see the Father's hand
Wild places, somewhere
We can be alone with you
We need a promised land

Wood smoke rising
Faces alive in the firelight
Forsaking the road
And making it home to be there tonight

The young making good what they found
In the wood, what they learned of a land
Putting dreams back together
Talking it through, reaching out for the hand

There's a moment caught suspended
Communion born between our eyes
Our vision clears
Its golden flight ascending

And we have seen what we have come for
And we will some day see again
But we have climbed into the mountains
So we must climb back down 'til then

But we'll take it as it is crazy
With love and disbelief
And the magic of your morning
The wilderness, the peace

We can the Father's hand
Wild places, somewhere
We can be alone with you
We need a promised land

"Peter, Paul and Mary","'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there
The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.
Mom in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap.
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew with a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave a luster of mid-day to objects below.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer
With a little old driver so lively and quick
Well I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came
And he whistled and he shouted and he called them by name
""On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!""
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet to an obstacle mount to the sky
So up to the rooftop the coursers they flew
With a sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too.
And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing, the pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just op'ning his pack
His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow
The stump of a pipe, he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when laughed (ho, ho, ho, ho) like a bowl full of jelly (ho, ho, ho, ho)
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings and turned with a jerk
And laying a finger to the side of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose
He sprang to his sleigh, and to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight
""Merry Christmas to all and to all..goodnight
Goodnight.""",'Twas the Night Before Christmas

Then up spoke baby Jesus, from out Mary's womb
""Bow down ye tallest tree that my mother might have some
Bow down ye tallest tree that my mother might have some"" 

So bent down the tallest tree to touch Mary's hand
Said she, ""Oh look now Joseph, I have cherries at command""

In the weaving of your fingers
In the whisper of a love that's born again
In the weaving of your fingers
In a promise that we made that never ends. 

Well now each man is a pilgrim, 
Yes, we all must make the journey
And it seems that time is telling us to be all that we can
To help lift up the fallen, we must sow the seeds of goodness
The torch is passed among us now to light the way of man. 

For the heart of man's a palace 
And his dreams are as the sunlight
They burn away the darkness, as they warm the freezing cold
As an eagle flying higher, as a river through the canyon
The diamond star shines down upon, a pathway to the soul 

(Chorus)2x 

In a promise that we made that never ends.
In a promise that we made that never ends.",The Magi (The Heart of Man's a Palace)

All the sushi bars were shuttered, dark cantinas too
And I stood there in the darkness,as an empty cab rolled by
Then all at once I heard the sound of yuppies in the sky

Then the herd came down Columbus, for as far as I could see
All the men were wearing Polo, and the women wore Esprit
Each yuppie had a walk-man and as each one passed me by
I saw their sad expressions and I heard their mournful cry

Chorus:
Condos for sale, condos to buy, yuppies in the sky

Each one was wearing running shoes upon the ghostly deck
And each one had a cotton sweater wrapped around the neck
They all held out their credit cards and tried in vain to buy
But not a store was open to the yuppies in the sky.

(The yuppie-I-o)
I've seen them in commercials sailin' boats and playin' ball
Pourin' beer for one another cryin', ""Why not have it all?""
Now I saw the ghostly progress as the winds around me blew
Till I, I felt the urge to purchase a BMW

All the salad bars were empty, all the Quiche Lorraine was gone
I heard the yuppies crying as they vanished in the dawn
Calling brand names to each other, as they faded from my view
They'll be networking forever down Columbus Avenue

I hear my music now on oldies stations
""Put out a CD called ""the best of what I was""
My picture's on the cover and no one knows
Just when you think you've got the wisdom of the ages
Nobody seems to want to turn your pages
I used to think I was the cat's pajamas
Now I'm about as hip as Fernando Lamas
(cause I'm) Old enough
Old enough to be your father
Old enough
Old enough (and then some)
And now my kids are taking me to the shows
There's hip-hop, rap, grunge music I don't know
I like to think I'm still part of the crowd
But, how can they hear the lyrics
When the music is so loud?!
I dig rock and roll music
(I been saying that for a while)
But I wonder if you knew
That rhythm & blues begat the rock and roll style?
And just like that, way before rap,
Woody Guthrie spread the news
He told it straight, let us relate
This Talking Union Blues:
Well if you want higher wages, let me tell you what to do
You've got to talk to the workers in the shop with you
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long
You get shorter hours, better working conditions
Vacations with pay, take the kids to the seashore
Well I remember I was seventeen
I was a Birmingham High School rock and roll king
The paper talked about how I'd strut my stuff
I'd like to read it, but my arms aren't long enough
I kinda like my new senior status
I don't even care what the latest fad is
My g-generation's rediscovered me
And now I'm on the cover of modern maturity",Old Enough (Ode to an Aging Rocker)
"Peter, Paul and Mary","(Maxwell AndersonKurt Weill)
When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game.
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old earth take a couple of twirls
And I'd ply her with tears instead of pearls
And as time came around, she came my way
As time came around, she came

But it's a long, long while from May to December
And the days grow short when you reach September.
The autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And I haven't got the time for the waiting game.

Oh, the days dwindle down to precious few;
September, November.
And these few precious days I'll spend with you.
These precious days I'll spend with you.
",September Song
"Peter, Paul and Mary","There's a little girl playing in the garden
She thinks that she's alone and no one sees
But the beauty of it all
As the daisy petals fall
Is the wish she's made that's whispered in the breeze
There's the wish in the breeze
[Chorus:]
Won't you take the chance
And let your tears start falling
And ignore the fearful warning of your mind
Let your heart for once do all the talking
And believe that you deserve for the sun to shine
Believe that you deserve for the sun to shine
There's an old woman sitting in the doorway
And she greets the people each one as they pass
Sometimes they hover 'round her for her wisdom
Sometimes so she'll remind them how to laugh
They know that she'll remind them how to laugh
[Chorus]
Now on a hill there stands a cross above a graveyard
And the simple word carved in it says ""forgive""
No war or killing anger can match the force it carries
It can heal the generations so that other ones can live
It can heal us, so we can live
[Chorus]
Now there's a moment between forward and retreating
When you're just not sure which path you ought to choose
Then the sun shines brightly on the golden meadow
And suddenly, you're not at all confused
Suddenly, you're not confused
That's when you take the chance
And let your tears start falling
And ignore the fearful warnings of your mind
And you let your heart for once do all the talking
And believe that you deserve for the sun to shine
You always did deserve for the sun to shine
I love you, and I want the sun to shine.",Take the Chance
"Peter, Paul and Mary","Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground
Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down

Pullin' weeds and pickin' stones, we are made of dreams and bones
I feel the need to grow my own 'cause the time is close at hand
Grain for grain, sun and rain, I'll find my way in nature's chain
I tune my body and my brain to the music of the land

Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground
Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down

So plant your rows straight and long, temper them with prayer and song
Mother earth can keep you strong if you give her love and care
Now an old crow watching hungrily from his perch in yonder tree
In my garden I'm as free as that feathered thief up there

Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground
Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling

Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down

Well last Saturday night I got married,
Me and my wife settled down
Well now me and my wife are parted,
I'm gonna take another stroll downtown

Some folks they like their sugar
Some folks they like their wine

Stop your rambling, why don't you stop your gambling
Well stop your staying out so late at night

Stay there by the fireside bright

"Peter, Paul and Mary","Let's say you're at a pie contest, let's say that you're the judge
And there's lemon, lime and watermelon rind,
And one that looks like fudge
You can't tell which pie you like the best
If you only eat the crust
In order to complete the test a bite of filling is a must
(A bite of filling is a must)

Inside, inside, that's the most important part
Inside, inside, that's the place you've got to start
Inside, inside, that's where you'll find the heart of the matter

Let's say you're at a birthday party
And let's say you've just turned eight
And there are presents everywhere and all of them look great
You can't tell which one's your favorite
By just looking at the bow
To pick one out from all the rest unwrap each present,
Then you'll know
(Unwrap each present then you'll know)

Children are the very best, each one a joy and pride
Just how we know, I bet you guessed
We took the time to look

[Chorus]

Let's say you're at a library
And there's stacks and stack of books
There's even stacks on top of stacks everywhere you look
There are stories about mystery and sports and famous lovers
To pick one out from all the rest
You've got to open up the covers
(You've got to open up the covers!)

"Peter, Paul and Mary","When I was a young man and never been kissed
I got to thinking it over what I had missed.
I got me a girl, I kissed her and then
Oh lord, I kissed her again.

Chorus:
Oh, kisses sweeter than wine,
Oh, kisses sweeter than wine

I asked her to marry and be my sweet wife,
And we would be so happy the rest of our lives.
I begged and I pleaded like a natural man,
And then, oh lord, she gave me her hand.

(chorus)

I worked mighty hard and so did my wife,
Workin' hand in hand to make a good life.
With corn in the field and wheat in the bins,
I was, oh lord, the father of twins.

(chorus)

Our children they numbered just about four,
They all had sweethearts knockin' at the door.
They all got married and they didn't hesitate;
I was, oh lord, the grandmother of eight.

(chorus)

Now that we're old, and ready to go,
We get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago.
We had a lot of kids, trouble and pain,
But, oh lord, we'd do it again.

"Peter, Paul and Mary","When I was just a wee little lad
Full of health and joy
My father homeward came one night
And gave to me a toy

A wonder to behold it was
With many colors bright
And the moment I laid eyes on it
It became my heart's delight

It went ""Zip"" when it moved
And ""Bop"" when it stopped
And ""Whirrr"" when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

The first time that I picked it up
I had a big surprise
'Cause right on the bottom were two big buttons
That looked like big green eyes

I first pushed one and then the other
Then I twisted its lid
And when I set it down again
Here is what it did

It went ""Zip"" when it moved
And ""Bop"" when it stopped
And ""Whirrr"" when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

It first marched left and then marched right
Then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone
It wasn't even there

I started to cry, but my daddy laughed
'Cause he knew that I would find
When I turned around my marvelous toy
Would be chugging from behind

""Zip"" when it moved
And ""Bop"" when it stopped
And ""Whirrr"" when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

Whirr, whirr, whirr

The years have gone by too quickly it seems
I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him
My marvelous little toy

His eyes nearly popped right out of his head
And he gave a squeal of glee
Neither one of us knows just what it is
But he loves it just like me

It still goes ""Zip"" when it moves
And ""Bop"" when it stops
And ""Whirrr"" when it standsstill
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

"Peter, Paul and Mary","I traveled the banks of the River of Jordan
To find where it flows to the sea.
I looked in the eyes of the cold and the hungry
And I saw I was looking at me.
I wanted to know if life had a purpose
And what it all means in the end.
In the silence I listened to voices inside me
And they told me again and again.

The is only one river. There is only one sea.
And it flows through you, and it flows through me.
There is only one people. We are one and the same.
We are all one spirit. We are all one name.

Every drop in the sea

He never drank water, he always drank wine.
His bridle was silver, his mane it was gold.

But the betting was heavy on the bay and the mare.
And a-way up yonder, ahead of them all,

"Peter, Paul and Mary","As he awoke that evening with the smell of wood-smoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hangin' upon a painted tepee

He would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers' guns"" 

Oh, great Father of the Iroquois, ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild,
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine 

And now you ask that I should watch the red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear from Yellow Dog, whom the white man fears? 

I take only what is mine; my pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die, along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run 

Tramplin' down the prairie rose, leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me, I welcome with my hand
I heard from passing renegades, Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead 

Now there seems no reason why I should carry on
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are comin'
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running
For now I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in the clover fields without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole!",Indian Sunset

And the hillsides are stained with the greases
That burned up the heavens with smoke

You used to curse the bold crewmen
Who stripped our earth of its ore
Now you've changed and you've gone over to them
And you've learned to love what you hated before

Once I thanked God for my treasure, now like rust it corrodes

With his meal of bread and water today.

My poor feet have traveled that hot dusty road
Out of the dust bowl and westward we rolled
Your desert was hot and your mountains were cold

I've worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
I've slept on the ground in the light of your moon
On the edge of your city you've seen us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind

California, arizona, I make all your crops
Then north up to oregon to gather your hogs
Pull the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light, sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the grand coulee dam where the water runs down
Every state in this union us migrants have been
We'll work in your fight and we'll fight til we win

Well it's always we ramble that river and I
All along your green valley I'll work til I die
My land I'll defend with my life if need be
Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free

All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wire
And some just clap their hands, or paws or anything they got now

Everybody here is a part of the plan
We all get to play in the great critter band
From the eagle in the sky to the whale in the sea
It's one great symphony

Some sing out loud on the telephone wire

"Peter, Paul and Mary","We came to a new world
Tired of the old one
Hungry for freedom
And heavy with prayer

It was a beautiful treasure
Ours for the taking
Never mind that someone
Was already there

Invisible people
We were climbing in numbers
In just a few generations
Frontiers to conquer
And fortunes to make

So we hitched up our wagons
And pushed ever onward
Never a thought for
What lay in our wake

Invisible people
We can't see their tears
They still cry out
But no one can hear
Invisible people
Hey, yay,yay, yay, yay, yay, yay
Hey, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay

Shattered in spirit
Promises broken
Hunters and healers
Now refugees

Tell me who is the savage
Who is the savior
When a people are ravaged
By hatred and greed

We come for the bargains
With flags for the children
Acres of parking
Opening day

But under the asphalt
The pride of a nation
Is buried forever
In the home of the brave

"Peter, Paul and Mary","He cut her in half
With a shiny steel saw
He put her all back together
And I was in awe

As rabbits and doves and bandanas appeared
And he pulled a quarter right out of my ear

And dad, he just smiled, he said, 'There's nothing to it.""

And I started shaving the very next day
Just walking her home made me light on my feet

And I promised her things you just wouldn't believe
And when I asked my dad why girls had that effect
He said, 'Go ask your mom, I ain't figured it yet'

Diary of a sinner, huh, 1st entry

Dear diary, this the 1st time
I had a chance to sit and just think with a clear mind
Has a homeboy stressed out for a little while, few things ain't work out
Could somebody come out or it's about three twenty-nine, I'll give it about another hour
I'm over here at your man house
On your man couch, just puttin' these thoughts down
Maybe this right here one day will be worth something
Before we start messin' up
You know you get big when you leave, it's a damn shame

And I had to write em down

Then I had to write em down

Liven in a world that I didn't see oh

Damn, I'm back, I had to change pen, I done got ink everywhere
All over my hand, and on my pant and how in the hell I get it way down there
Just can't get it right
Seem that everything I do just fall on one side
But I can say one thing, I don't always get mine, and I don't ever stop tryin'
Feel like I was here before my time
People say when they hear my rhyme
People see it when they look in my eye it's like
Like thirty-five years on a twenty-six year life
I done walk so many miles in these shoes
I'm surprise that the bottom ain't wore out
I'm about to go take a walk right now

It was good ta me, a little walk
Just what I needed, cool breeze, nobody on the street with me

I'm pleased with the life that was given to me
I could of still been sleep
On my way so please when none this here will matter to me
'Cause, know when I messed up, several times
I just done something tonight
And I know I know right from wrong
And that's what kill me
I still do the wrong thing

Oh a diary, a diary oh

All of my life oh,
All of my life

All of, all of, all of
All of my life oh alright
Oh it's the diary of a sinner

There it is, my life
Right there, right in your face
The diary, I want to thank everybody that went out and picked up the album
Got the album, and got a chance to understand who, who I'm is
Know what I'm sayin', everything I gave y'all was the truth

Aiyyo check this verse out
My platinum chains, my big willy, my Mercedes-Benz
That's right? {*laughing*}

[Verse 1]
Are you a gun busting nigga? (Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh)
Are you a bitch baggin nigga? (Whu-Whu-Whu-Whu)
You got ice and ya chain and ya chong wit your Rolly on
Not just any Rolly but you bought the most expensive one.
Hey take ya car keys*Jingle Jingle* to ya class E
Big body be for your CD- I mean, DVD
For ya T.V in ya head beats, in ya back seat
Haha, y'all think I'm mean
Runnin round talking bout the shit that you be talking bout
How you the drug game sold up and locked down
John Gotti got life and I'm sure he never told nobody
Boy lets put on an album so the fuckin feds could buy it
You shouldn't be shouting out them bodies you buried
Nine millimeters and Techs and them AK47's
Illegal weapons you talking bout you snucked in the club
You got so many guns
Tell me why you rappers steady getting robbed
I got two more verses for you (huh)
this ain't just to an individual person
These questions here for all of ya

[Hook]
I can write a song without ice, bitches, and cars
can you mutha fuckas do dat? (DO DAT?!)
I can blaze a track without bustin a gat at a cat
can you mutha fuckas do dat? (DO DAT?!)

[Chorus 2x]
Yoouuu gon' have to change up all yo shit in a little bit
When the radios in the club get to pumpin this
And they start to finding out what what rappin really is

[Verse 2]
Verse 2, now that you know what the song's about
y'all probably cussin me out
You gonna listen to it anyhow
Lets talk about somebody like Eskimo
Rentin they jewelry from Jacob and don't think we know
You got a platinum piece but your chain is plain white gold
After the video it got to go back to the store
That's Crazy, talkin bout some shit you don't own
Oughta be ashamed of yourself
Yo, don't they call that frontin, holmes?
You ain't Jigga, Nigga
Nor can you spin like Puff
And got a cash money deal
So what's your Big Willy talk for?
I get so excited man, your track got me leapin
Then you start rhyming and *Yawn* I get sleepy

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's a sad situation, record labels buggin out
'cause they star artist done ran out of shit to talk about (Whoa!)
Yeah that's crazy and you think about it baby
Only thing that changed in yo rhyme was ya date ""2000""
Oh that shit is hot, put that on the album
You heard it with my man kick that shit (??)
Loud and proud, nigga swear he be throwin down
Arthur lose his voice every time he opens his mouth
I oughta hold up a signs and boycott they ass right
No more muthafuckin sound alikes!

man, I was sure I had Ms. Perfect
I was settling down
through fuckin' round
most the time I stayed at her house
spent all my time, with her when we stayed in the town
thought this shit right here was really bout to work out
quickly found out, that wasn't her intentions
shorty phone used to ring e're five seconds
ain't pay attention 
she would always take her calls in the kitchen
go to the sink, runnin' water like she washin' dishes
ain't tryin' a listen
I know how them shorties is
always in somebody business
gossipin', shootin' bullshit with her girlfriend
one day feelin like a joker 
told her I wasn't comin over
Jive got me on the last flight out to Arizona, what I told her
went over unexpected
rung the bell (ding dong!) Domino's (just a second!)
opened the door with the robe on

He use to have this book he carried around with him all the time

And the pastor asked him ""Boy, what's that you got in your hand""
And he said this is my diary
And the pastor told him that sinners couldn't have no diary (sinner)
My brother said he was lying, And my brother said if he couldn't have a diary
And he was a sinner, he would just call it a diary of a sinner (diary)

with no hopes 
and my will to live 
barely a care in this world to me
I found a way 
kidnapped and confined
within a system designed
to destroy the inncocent child that I use to be
it stripped me mentally naked
embarrassing my mommas first born
did I deserve that kind of fate?
Was all that was happening to me
really written in the powerful and allmighty book of life?
I don't think so
My tears would soak the pages that I write upon
if I couldn't close the windows to my soul
and stand strong in the midst of these storms
Maybe my story is
in some way or another fimilar with yours
is that why this ain't even a song 
but yet you still.. you want to here this once more
I play this everytime I want to reflect from 
which I've come from
to help me see were it is I'm trying to go
and even though grandma and our sisters
left me some time ago
I still go by and sit on the front porch as if I don't even know
but I'm getting better

my two sisters...ebony and tanya

man I got mikey and shocker now

and those that love me regardless

It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy 
Half a tank of gas, two cigerattes
scraping up change in an ashtray.
Had a voice said,
it's only a test of my faith.
It was only..............

    (Verse 1)

Damn,
this song for dat nigga south,
that I was tellin y'all bout.
y'all check dis nigga shit out
Remember the song i told you came on sound like,
how he was at a point on his own,
and the promblems seem to be takin a toll 
that he been fightin for so long.
Seemed like erthang he did went wrong,
But he found the strength to keep on goin.
And wrote  songs about it later on.
You know that shit hit me home,
especially when he would talk about the money he owed.
How he took the bills andhe  payed somethin on each one.
Like he put sometin on his light bill,
somethin on his phone.
He'll get a lil money,
and he'd pay a lil mo.
He ain't have a lot so he just payed what he could on it.
And somehow he just managed to keep all this stuff goin.
It won't nothin but the grace of the Lord,
'cause I remember 
I was............

    (Chorus)

It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy 
Half a tank of gas, two cigerattes
scraping up change in an ashtray.
Had a voice said,
it's only a test of my faith.
It was only..............
 
    (Verse 2)

So it seemed ertime he got himself off the ground,
somethin'd come and knock him right back down.
Sometimes he wanted to just lay on out for the count,
fustrated and tired,
but he got on up anyhow.
And wit a smile I'm talkin bout.
Make you ask yourself ""How?""
And then 'cause just  broke it down for me he said....

(Singing and Pablo talkin in the background)
I ain't neva been dis happy in my life.
Ain't got a dime more then i had.
But everything seems alright.
And they say he ain't know...
Havin the joy of a piece of mind
is more than any problem i ever had at the time.
And now I know and I'm so glad.

It was only
a sign of the tide.
It was only
askin me why should i cry.
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today.
Only a test of my faith.

    (Pablo)

Man that boy can sing that song.
Play this shit ermorning,
just ta get my lil day goin.
You just don't know how this had touched my soul to find out i won't da only 
one that been through somethin.
Almost the exact same somethin,
was eatin me up.
Knew what it was, 
just could'nt put it in words.
I ain't neva been the type to really talk to nobody
so all the problems that i had,
I just kept em all inside.
y'all had enough of ya own
 to worry bout,
the lil situation i had goin on.
But you know God won't let you suffer too long.
I ain't even had da radio on,
I was out on the porche,
den Boom.
From the Heavens above,
just when I was at that point,
when I was just about to mess up,
Man Buda played this song fo me 'cause and i just shook my head like 
""uh uh uh""

    (Chorus)
It was only
a sign of the tide.
It was only
askin me why should i cry.
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today.
Only a test of my faith.",Test of My Faith
Petey Pablo,"Ayo 'cause
When y'all tellin folk... about my life
I don't want y'all to add nothing
I don't want y'all to take nothing away
I want y'all to play that thang
Just like this here...
Ya heard me

[Petey]
Since the tender age (since the tender age)
I been running wild (I been running wild)
I seen all those things (all those things)
You don't show to a child 
It wasn't love I was missing (lord knows)
My folks cared for me
I had a stubborn ass attitude (did what I want to do)
And y'all couldn't talk to me
Tried often the strait and narrow
But every time I would stumble and fall
Fell so hard one time I fucked around and stayed down
I don't want to try no more
I was getting a little older
Those mistakes were a part of my life
And my only regret is that I only get one chance to get it right

[Chorus]
And I want to tell the world the truth about me (2x)
(listen to the song...)

[Petey]
I caused more unnecessary stress to my mama than the word allow
Old sister of mine
I had once upon a time 
We ain't spoke in a while
Life's been hard on me 
But I found a way to keep standing it
And holding on (holding on)
Pressing on (good God almighty)
Standing in jail someday I'll break the monotony
Cause Petey wasn't doing that well
And I can behold a way that the world christened me
... If anybody give a damn to know
What really went on in my life I wrote a song 

[chorus]
[voice talking]
It is now gallow time
All inmates are asked to get on your assigned bunks and 
Remain there until count time is made....count time...
Olden... (yeah)
Williams... (here)
Monroe... (yo)
Durant... (here)
Pablo... Pablo.....

[Petey]
Man I was just one of the ones
That always wounded up in the midst of something
Stayed in trouble if I won't fuckin' up
I love ( I love) to bring the pain
Growing up in Greenville, North Carolina outside of Rocky Mount
I'm a be on the winning side 
When this whole life decide to give me just a little money
You can sell it bootleg just as long as you can get it
Whatever...just understand me

[Chorus]",Truth About Me

More potent than crack smoke

Tired of hearin' the same shit on the radio
Tired of seein' the same bitches in the video
Tired of Benzes, Bentleys and Diamonds in yo chain yo
Tired of hearin 'bout all this cash, when most of you broke

Can even give a decent show
Energy level on a Richter scale triple 0 point 0

For Petey Pablo
Let me see you breakin' it down on the dance floor

I got what they want
From a nigga that ti, ti, ti

Peter Piper picked peppers and I shook corn
Humpty Dumpty fell down and I kept goin'
And Jack be nimble was nimble
But wasn't more nimble than this
Can you imagine Jam Master on some shit like this?

Kind of like your grand daddy
The baddest, the fastest, nastiest actin' ass
To eva walk on this side of rappin'
The skipper, the professor and the captain

It was only..............

    (Verse 1)

Damn,
this song for dat n**** south,
that I was tellin why'all bout.
why'all check dis n**** s*** out
Remember the song i told you came on sound like,
how he was at a point on his own,
and the promblems seem to be takin a toll 
that he been fightin for so long.
Seemed like erthang he did went wrong,
But he found the strength to keep on goin.
And wrote  songs about it later on.
You know that s*** hit me home,
especially when he would talk about the money he owed.
How he took the bills andhe  payed somethin on each one.
Like he put sometin on his light bill,
somethin on his phone.
He'll get a lil money,
and he'd pay a lil mo.
He ain't have a lot so he just payed what he could on it.
And somehow he just managed to keep all this stuff goin.
It won't nothin but the grace of the Lord,
'cause I remember 
I was............

So it seemed ertime he got himself off the ground,
somethin'd come and knock him right back down.
Sometimes he wanted to just lay on out for the count,
fustrated and tired,
but he got on up anyhow.
And wit a smile I'm talkin bout.
Make you ask yourself ""How?""
And then 'cause just  broke it down for me he said....

(Singing and Pablo talkin in the background)
I ain't neva been dis happy in my life.
Ain't got a dime more then i had.
But everything seems alright.
And they say he ain't know...
Havin the joy of a piece of mind
is more than any problem i ever had at the time.
And now I know and I'm so glad.

a sign of the tide.
It was only
askin me why should i cry.
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today.
Only a test of my faith.

Man that boy can sing that song.
Play this s*** ermorning,
just ta get my lil day goin.
You just don't know how this had touched my soul to find out i won't da only 
one that been through somethin.
Almost the exact same somethin,
was eatin me up.
Knew what it was, 
just could'nt put it in words.

Gone...before they find out what the hell itwas fo
Dead wrong, you don't hear me tho ?

Behind the bleachers with a Jewish dude
Yo name rung bells in the neighborhood

Best head in the whole wide world
Prettiest chest they ever gave to a woman
It almost hates to make a nigga stay still
I bet you'd ask in a fast time

Hate to ask to make a nigga get krunk
Some place were you ain't supposed to be drunk
Get tapped on till yo lil' thang get drunk

[Verse 1 - Petey Pablo]
One of the illest rhymers that ever came outta Carolina, put this whole shit
On the map
Went back got two states, y'all crammed way to the back
And brought 'em up to the where the rest of 'em at (cause I can do that)
Granddaddy was real strong, daddy was in the Army
I was a bad motherfucker, slightly retarded
Mentally institutionalized, since the '85
Buildin tree houses (that the wind couldn't blow down)
Look at me now, holdin it down
Doin it well, I ain't triple platinum yet (but ain't gon' worry 'bout it)
I'm wearin the good damn crown, man I'm the president
And reppin both states (back here in Carolina)
Where the hell did you find 'em? (boy is an animal)
His flow is incredible, style is bananas
I just wanna go to the Grammy's and I don't care if I win
Just to say I've been god dammit (god dammit)

[Chorus - Petey Pablo - 2X]
Get on dis motorcycle
Get on dis motorcycle
And that way you can ride wit a ... (y'all ready)

Get on dis motorcycle
Get on dis motorcycle
And get your hips on in the big ass truck (y'all ready)

[Verse 2 - Petey Pablo]
On the hurl and dirt road, them big ass pot holes
Lay in a - old home, lay in a - screen doors
Car in the back yard, dog chain tied up
Ain't drove it in years, sittin on nothin
Spit crunk mosquito buckets, hot wood heaters
Hooked up Honda Accord, with house speakers
Bag, phone and beeper, corduroys and sneakers
Pit Spike Lee's and them shell toe Adidas
You don't know shit 'bout Petey (Petey)
Real definition of the greasy, grimy and gritty
You really fittin to sellin drugs for another nigga
Always lookin at me like your trigger finger itchin
I give ya my best witness, when you come to handle your business
You better be ready to get it, cause I don't be bullshittin
I'm up into plastic bottles cause if I keep on feelin the way I'm feelin
I'ma blow up in this motherfucker

[Chorus - 2X - w/ ad libs]

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Twenty-seven dollars to my name, headed up
85 pissy drunk, Petey still made me drive
Left off from LaGrange, passin through Squattenburg
On the way to High Point and my speech startin to slur
Better tell these sons of bitches, boy to move won't allow for me
To stop and say I'm sorry to this dude and this scout
It was just a little bump, shit you dented my Ferrari
Don't call the law, shit is rented, look I'm sorry
All we have done in the name of the south
Gave these ugly motherfuckers somethin to ""Raise Up"" about
But I'm still unfulfilled, since my daddy still drivin
That fuckin school bus, know that Bubba still strivin
I want me a label, want me a mansion
Timmy can't give it to me, Jimmy ain't spit it to me
Rest assure though, the day is approachin
When these old country boys ain't just playin, they coachin

Sound of His voice
(So sweet, so sweet)
Send that chill in my body
(So sweet, so sweet)
And I was lifted
(So sweet, so sweet)

I tried to deny the ways I was feeling
'Cause the world had me all messed up
Controlling my decisions
Had me at the point where I hated who I was
Something had a hold on me and wouldn't budge at all

I felt myself sinking until this all
Now all I could say was help me, Lord
And by God it hurted, I know it hurt because

When He spoke to me
(So sweet, so sweet, yeah)
Just the sound of His voice
(So sweet, so sweet)
When He spoke to me

And I was lifted

(Shh, wait a minute)
Just when I thought it was over
(Shh, wait a minute)
And I was 'bout to go into town

My heart was heavy with a bird
Left being a bird in the world and not being able to fly
My heart was heavy
And if you don't know what I'm talking about
You must be crazy

You need to stand up, stand up
Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
Good is God been enough
You better stand up, stand up
Stand up, stand up

Thank You for everything, thank You for everything
Thank You for everything
Every little thing, for every little thing

I just wanna say thank You, thank You
Thank You, thank You, everything You've done for me
Everything, everything, thank You, thank You

I wanna say thank You, thank You

I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave yo alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

(Verse 1)
I'd tell you I'm tired of it, but nigga I will always be wit ya
Through hell or hot water it'll be me and you nigga
This can go down in the test of time
whether Ripley believe it or not, make it happen once in a lifetime
Kinda hard to find, two niggaz that growed up on two different sides of town
That get down like I get down, and done his like I done mines
Hit it off first time around, and been solid as the foundation under the house
This some, shit for us to brag about (bout it bout it)
We answered the question and never had to take the time to thank out
That's why I'll ride for my nigga, cry for my nigga
Die for my nigga
Hold ya one hand in the sky for ya nigga
Tell them you gone always remember

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
you know you one of the reasons I'm still breathin cause without you I don't know where in the hell I'd be
(homeboy)
You know life's been hard at home (homeboy)
That's what made us turn to the streets (homeboy)
I think that's what had us claimin thugs, sellin drugs
Duckin from the fuckin police, indulgin in
Boughshe women, foolish niggaz
Young, dumb, and off the leash
Outta control, but I wouldn't change it
If I could I would do it the same (if I can do it)
But if it wasn't for the game, teachin us game
We prolly would be stuck with the lames (but DAWG)
Somehow we made it, and I'm glad that I can tell ya today
That my nigga gone always be my nigga
'cause that's the way it's ‘pose to be

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Sometimes I want to play some ball, Sometimes I want to walk through the mall
(Sometimes I want to play some ball, and just walk through the mall)
Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just want to spend some time alone
(Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just want to spend some time alone wit my niggaz)
Sometimes I want to hop in the car, and drive till tomorrow
(Sometimes I want to hop in the car, and just drive till tomorrow)
Sometimes I want to pick the phone, just to see what's goin on
(Sometimes I gotta pick up the phone, just to see what's goin on wit my niggaz)

(Chorus 2x's)",I Swear
Petey Pablo,"Ay, Check this out,This the Carolina Birddog
AKA Ginboy, Mister Ginboy, y'all know what it is
I got my man Gotto in the house tonight
I got my homeboy Bryan in the house tonight
We gone represent, Carolina we back baby
Holla atcha boy

[Verse 1]
We came to fill the gap in the game
The helicopter man took and bought him a plane
Now I guess I'm just gone have to pick me a name
To place cross the face of my new runway
International roller, while y'all still ridin round local
Crusin through in somethin' chopped off at the roof
Tearin up my baby doll new hair-do
Candy painted sittin on some brand new shoes
ain't studying nothin' lesser than them 22's
Actin a fool, by the hip-hop and the music
Doin tricks, hittin switches like (uh uh uh)
All us sittin on dubs, and all our guls cut 'cause
y'all broke, and can't get shit from us
Besides a motherfuckin dick to suck (C'mon)

[Chorus - 2X]
Shit, Gotdamn, get off yo ass and jam
Awww Shit, gotdamn, get off yo ass and jam

[Verse 2]
Carolina nigga got the game on lock
You can tell a pimp nigga when you see his car
Still tickin passin him with two bad hoes
Window rolled down so his curls can blow
That boy from the west coast, naw I don't thank so
I thank he from down south, where they get low
(To the windowwwwwwwwww!) dual pipes and vogues
Sippin gin, head in the wind, you seen it before
You know how we roll, cars both sides of the road
Like a motherfuckin pimp nigga, watch me hoe
Cut that shit down, what he talking bout
He just mad 'cause, his girlfriend turned out
Look at that bitch in that truck, bouncin that butt
(Look at that bitch in that truck, bouncin that butt)  

[Chorus]

Aight, now what we do right now, we gone go back
Way back, c'mon c'mon

Yo momma, yo daddy, yo greasy greasy grandmammy
These girls scandalous, got holes in they panties
Got big behinds like Frankenstein
Breathe smeel just as shitty 
And meatballs on they titty
And scrambled eggs down 'tween they legs
ain't yo girlfriend pretty

YEEAAAAH! This is another Lil'Jon production
Petey Pablo, y'all what it is
Set it off

[Petey Pablo: Talking]
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you today
The new album from Petey Pablo, ""Still Writing in My Diary: The 2nd Entry""
The boy hot now; he been gone for a little while, had a little vacation, enjoyin' life
But that's what you're supposed to do when you get there: enjoy your life
why'naw'mean, 'cause this ain't promised to us tomorrow, we can lose this shit tonight
Ya understand what I'm sayin'
but this young man that I'm bringin' before you today, has done it all
He's been at the lowest of the low, he's been at the top of the world
And he still remains grounded, that's a trill nigga, street cat
A fine young man, and I'm very proud to
be able to say that I even know the young fellow
But without further ado, because I know you've been waitin'
Still writin' in his diary, the 2nd entry

My mama said, ""Can you give her 3 dollars for a 5 dollar book of food stamps
so she can get her some cigarettes?"" (laughs)

Ya see, I go through some shit called voice exercisin'
When I go in the booth, and I go in there
and I just lay a hook now 'n then, know what I'm sayin'
Like this shit right here

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]
Time to take them shirts off again (put 'em back up in the air)
Represent, represent (put 'em back up in the air)
I really need you to mean it, mean it, mean it (put 'em back up in the air)
Start up that South shit again (put 'em back up in the air)

[Petey Pablo]
What you want this time, more fire?
Your problem, I got it (I got it)
y'all better be ready to call the motherfuckin' firetruck
to come up in this bitch an' put me out (yeah, yeah)
Petey Pab, back in the house, puttin' it down (I brought this fire, baby)
Stronger than we've ever been baby boy
y'all in trouble now (now now now now now now)
If y'all ain't ready (ready), better find your door
it's time to go and y'all gotta get out
All up in the wheels and under your heels
and let the best thing to roll you out
If you been there, I ain't got to talk to you about it
It don't get more gangsta, gangsta than it gets in this South

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]

[Petey Pablo]
Got another rake, got another lawn mower, got another hoe
A brand new weed wacker, with diamonds on the top where you hold
Got a water hose, anything you want it up on
Carolina (?) painted float to go with my post
I be out there in that water 'round them rich white folks
And caught me fishin', but guess what, dog, I look good in that boat
I'm just as country as the day I was born, I love it
Change my name for me (Mmmmmm mmmmmm P-P-Petey Pablo, ?)
Bob your head, get your thang off, show yourself
Look around ya boy, if that ain't there the South at its best
We run this shit here, all this shit here, nigga, look at me man
Your Jack ain't why you should be worried, it's the Ace in my hand

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]

[Petey Pablo]
I'm sellin this song out to everybody that took the time when I ain't got my shit
Record store, bootleg, under hung and everywhere that my CD is at
I take my hat off, if it weren't for y'all, I wouldn't be nothin' at all
And Carolina would still be two states, y'all motherfuckers used this to drive across
Do you see anything on my goddamn face that look like I'm playin'?
Have I said anything tonight, that y'all motherfuckin' niggaz ain't understand?
That I leave when I had a reason, talk to me man!
Naw I stayed, 'cause this where I was born and raised
(And I) I swear on everything I love
I'ma do my best to keep doin' it for us
And I don't need a gold on a black to black
just some down at home country love (country love)
I don't ask for much (huuuuuh huuuuhhh)
that's enough to keep my heart in the court (huuuuuh huuuuhhh)
Tell the truth, it's really messin' me up
to see all y'all niggaz still raisin' up (ooooooooooh)

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]

(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Put 'em back up in the air
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Repeat 4x)

Petey Pablo,"Who rang my phone?
That boy gon be a singer one day fo real
Naw, man get serious for a minute
I said and I said and I said
'cause he told me, 'cause he told me, 'cause he told me

Why should I worry about what people say?
When they gon talk about me anyway
They gon make up all sort of thangs
I just got to be the bigger man and let it roll off

The talk don't bother me
I believe in me if nobody else does
And let it roll off just like the one
And only feather of a dove's back, yeah, I said

You know it probably wouldn't worry me so much
If I was out there and behind closed doors
I was what they call caught up
Stealin' donkin' and drugs, livin' reckless
And takin' advantage of all I worked so damn hard for

Really needed help, but afraid to ask
Lonely, depressed, or just needed someone else
On the verge of givin' up, paranoid, scared
Totally overlookin' how much I been blessed

How could you understand what you say they said
And most of all why they said it, and I just nod my head
When you wrong you're wrong, I?ll admit it
I?ll confess to anything if I did it

But to spread unnecessary lies, I don't get it
How could you find enjoyment in my business?
You know what, forget it, talk my nigga
If you wasn't talkin' about me, I probably miss ya

Why should I worry about what people say?
When they gon talk about me anyway
They gon make up all sort of thangs
I just got to be the bigger man and let it roll off

The talk don't bother me
I believe in me if nobody else does
And let it roll off just like the one
And only feather of a dove's back, yeah, I said

Petey doin' this, Petey doin' that
I seen Petey here, but what he doin' there?
Why you don't come and ask, it ain't gon make me mad
I respect that more than you doin' it like you have

Botherin' my family scarin' them to death
Why you talking to them about me
When you can talk to me yourself
I might blast back, lose it and tear into your ass
Or I could be a man about it and talk and clear the air

But you don't never know that 'cause you won't take the chance
What that mean? You missin' somethin' in the crotch of your pants
He can make me laugh, 'cause sometime the story can be so outrageous
Can't say nothing but damn you know what I really am?

Beyond that her momma told me somethin' one day
And I ain't forgot it if they scared to my lie
To my Heavenly Father?s precious name
Then who am I to complain?

Why should I worry about what people say?
When they gon talk about me anyway
They gon make up all sort of thangs
I just got to be the bigger man and let it roll off

The talk don't bother me
I believe in me if nobody else does
And let it roll off just like the one
And only feather of a dove's back, yeah, I said

I don't care, go head
Stop, get away from here
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone

I don't care, go head
Stop, get away from here
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone

The rumors you spread don't bother me
The lies you tellin' don't bother me
I thought about it
And I wouldn't be no better than you

I don't care, go head
Stop, get away from here
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone

Why should I worry about what people say?
When they gon talk about me anyway
They gon make up all sort of thangs
I just got to be the bigger man and let it roll off

The talk don't bother me
I believe in me if nobody else does

",Roll Off
Petey Pablo,"Yeah I seen 'em come through here a couple times
I didn't think nuttin' of 'em, you know what I'm sayin'
But that shit you don't talk that huh?
That shit shocked everybody

Put the money in the bag bitch before I blow yo head off
Get yo ass on the floor nigga think a motherfucka playin' with y'all
This right here came from Mr. Charles its long and it ain't got Sears on it
Anytime I got a personal problem this the only homeboy I call

I wonder how many thought about Petey Pab
When I was apache rappin' in the penetentury yard
Eatin' wieners outa chanteens
Smokin' on roll-ups, strokin' on my love meat

Waitin' for the day cut in the term and free
So I could get out here and make mama proud of me
And do the right thing run up on the right man
That can pull the right string get to where I'm posed to be

Had to get ejected cause the game a cold
Anywhere and when the motherfucka slammed the door
Oh no, hell naw, get lost wait a minute dog
Fucked around one night went out in New York

When I met one of the brothers ""Up-in-ala-boys""
Ever since then money been a real long head
That bout says it all

Put the money in the bag bitch before I blow yo head off
Get yo ass on the floor nigga think a motherfucka playin' with y'all
This right here came from Mr. Charles its long and it ain't got Sears on it
Anytime I got a personal problem this the only homeboy I call

Is just something that a carry with me all the time
Just in case one of these motherfuckers loose they mind
And run up on me like I ain't gone hold it down for mine
I can show you better than tryin' to tell ya 'bout it

See once upon a time I think Pitt was the county
Where these niggas used to run around armed and robbin'
There was this little boy by the name of Moses
Had to run home keep from gettin' me jewelry stolen

Till one day nigga caught a hold to him
Did what they wanted to em stole my little Gucci coat
Oh naw , shit yeah they did, what the fuck you think I did?
Told Grama, granny told Granpa

Granpa took his grandson in the backyard
Gave me somethin' supposed to take the pressure off
Instead he teach me how to shoot at the mouth

Put the money in the bag bitch before I blow yo head off
Get yo ass on the floor nigga think a motherfucka playin' with y'all
This right here came from Mr. Charles its long and it ain't got Sears on it
Anytime I got a personal problem this the only homeboy I call

They ain't certified till a nigga run in they house
Put the thang in they mouth and blow err thing they think out
Run around actin' like bitches, you gone make me loose it all
I wasn't gone talk about it but, God damn it

This motherfucker bout to piss me off
And this dick ridin radio station ass motherfuckin'
Nigga down here in Raleigh
I don't give a fat bitch big titty pair one of y'all motherfuckin play my shit

And the couple of spins that y'all son-bitches
Did give me came from my man and them
Man fuck that church boy grab the looks
Come on the motherfuckin road with us
If I said anything I ain't spossed to said
And hurt anyone of y'all them fuck it

Put the money in the bag bitch before I blow yo head off
Get yo ass on the floor nigga think a motherfucka playin' with y'all
This right here came from Mr. Charles its long and it ain't got Sears on it
Anytime I got a personal problem this the only homeboy I call

Put the money in the bag bitch before I blow yo head off

Round here we gangstered out, this ain't no titty bar 
We let it all hang out
Break bread till the song played out, show that nigga what a real bitch bout

I can fuck, any bitch in here, lay her on the pillow
Crawl up behind her and cram all of it in her
Ride her ass like a bicycle, hold right there
When I move you move, just like that
Just as show as yo ass is fat, there's some 26 inch rims on a Cadillac
Like spinners, sittin on a sixty-seven
At the car show bumpin Funk Master Flex
I ain't met a bitch yet (and yeah) that I couldn't have

Couldn't turn them burgers over, cause the flame got too high on him
Made it a little slower for folks in them paddle boats

Carefully took them two preachers and let em prayed on
Told me I can do anything that I put my name on

Every breath that I take, move that I make
Song that I sang, been fo these states
The eyes in my face, hold so much pain
And seen so much hate, I'm shamed to even say it
But thangs they done changed through GOD and his grace
My folks and they faith, these hearts that don't break
The dirt roads they laid, have just been paved
By state my claim, and stand my name
Cross the top of the tallest wall up
Rock for my prison niggas 'cause I done been crossed up
Locked up, 'cause I made a wrong turn ,but guess what

But the laborers are few

Inside of me there is one too

The river runs beside the road 
Its waters living as they flow 
In liquid voice the water calls 
On thirsty knees the pilgrim falls 

Sometimes a shadow dark and cold 
Lays like a mist across the road 
But be encouraged by the sight 
Where there's a shadow, there's a light 

Sometimes it's good to look back down

Beneath the piety and hidden vanity begins to show 
It's just your altar ego and you don't even know 
And you won't even grow 'til His Spirit strikes a bow 
To your altar ego 

You love to seen by men 
In all the public places 
And you always pick the best of the seats

No waiting pot of gold in the faith that I possess
But the treasures of this life will slowly turn to dust
And this fool will find his gold in the Savior that I trust
Fool's gold
It's waiting in a crown
Fool's gold
In a city coming down
I'll leave the gold I can't afford for
For the higher prize I'm pressing toward
I'll preach the ""foolish"" cross of Christ and wait for my reward
Fool's gold
The wisdom of the cross is easy to receive
But only foolishness to them that don't believe
They may say that I'm a fool for the cross that I proclaim
But the gold that I must seek won't be found in earthly things
When the crowns of gold are laid before His feet
Then the worthy Lamb of God is a treasure we will keep
Some may call me foolish, some may call me odd
But I'd rather be a fool in the eyes of man than a fool in the eyes of God

The crops failed, the well ran dry 
When they lost the watershed 

A baby dies, its mother cries, the children gather 'round 
They're wondering what the day will bring 
Will they be the next one found?

Do you dare to gaze into their hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 
Are they staring holes in you with their hollow eyes, 
Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?

To escape the Haitian heat 
The hunger pains drive them to the street 
Wond'ring if today they'll eat 
Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease 
Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease. 

The least of these is hungry. 
The least of these is sick. 
The least of these needs clothing. 
The least of these needs drink. 

The least of these knows sorrow. 
The least of these knows grief. 
The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name.

You used to play their games
You used to stay the same
They used to hold you back
They knew the best attack
They thought they had a better hold on you
They thought that you would always stay true blue
They couldn't stop you - they had no defense
You went under the wire - you went over the fence

Defector - you broke the chains away
Defector - a higher power you obey
Now they have no hold on you - you've broken through
But don't forget to read the signs 'cause
You still live behind - enemy lines
Defector

They used to drag you down
They used to have you bound
Just like a ball and chain
But they could not restrain
They thought that you could never break away
They thought that you would always go their way
They had you tied up habitually
They never figured you could ever get free

You got away clean but it don't come free
Another man paid with His on agony for...

Where are the amber waves of grain
When one of our homeless native sons has hunger pain
Under the overpass they build a fire for heat
They can't remember when they had a meal to eat

Some sleep in doorways waiting for the day
Some sleep in boxes we have thrown away

Under the red, white and blue
Right down the street in our view
We're not doing all we can do
To shelter the homeless few
Shelter the homeless few

Standing in line for soup and bread
Hoping tonight the downtown mission has a bed
Dreaming about the home they thought they'd never lose
Sleeping on benches covered by the daily news

People who pass them by just turn their heads
Making them feel like they've been left for dead

Under the red, white and blue
Right down the street from our pew
We're not doing all we can do
To shelter the homeless few
Shelter the homeless few

It's up to me
It's up to you
We're not doing all we can do
To shelter the homeless few

In the evening when I start to pray
I think about this day
Another page is turned forever
Another yesterday
And as the story of my life unfolds
I know You've read it all
Another line to be continued
Will I stand or fall

Open book - to You I am an open book
You know every page by heart
From the ending to the start
Open book - my life is like an open book
As I read between the lines
It's Your love that truly binds this open book

When the cover of this book is closed
The final chapter read
I hope You find it worth the reading
I hope 'well done' is said

And what I want to be
As You read the pages of my heart
Please tell me what You see

There's no feeling
Like when you have a friend in need
Their heart is wounded -
And you can feel your own heart bleed
And you wonder
Will they pull through this attack
You feel so helpless - you want to be fighting back
Don't think it's over - don't pull away
It's time to stand in - it's time to pray
Set the wheels in motion
With your devotion

Stand in the gap
Coming boldly to His throne of grace
Stand in the gap
He will hear you when you seek His face
Put your weapon to its use
And believe it will produce
Stand in the gap
Until all hell...
Until all hell breaks loose

In the conflict
It seems like He doesn't hear
Be encouraged - He still has an open ear
It's not for nothing
It's not in vain
Make your petitions
Call on His name
He will bring assistance
Through your persistence

The enemy is gonna have to fold his hand
When the army of the Lord begins to take command
Nothing in the heavens or the earth can stand
Against the fervent prayer of a righteous man

We're content to pitch our tent
When the glory's evident
Seldom do we know the glory came and went

Moving can seem dangerous
In this stranger's pilgrimage
Knowing that you can't stand still, you cross the bridge

(Chorus)
There's a higher place to go, beyond belief, beyond belief
Where we reach the next plateau, beyond belief, beyond belief
And from faith to faith we grow
Towards the center of the flow
Where He beckons us to go, beyond belief, beyond belief

Leap of faith without a net
Makes us want to hedge our bet
Waters never part until our feet get wet

There's a deeper place to go
Where the road seems hard to hoe
He who has begun this work won't let it go

And it takes so long to see the change
But we look around and it seems so strange

We have come so far but the journey's long
And we once were weak but now we're strong

I believe in the resurrection on the
Third and glorious day

Stone that the angel rolled away 
He descended and set the captives free 
And now He sits at God's right hand
And prepares a place for me

This is my creed, the witness I have heard 
The faith that has endured 
This truth is assured 
Through the darkest ages past 
Though persecuted, it will last 
And I will hold steadfast to this creed 

I believe He sent His Spirit to comfort and to reveal 
To lead us into the truth and light, to baptize and to seal 
I believe that He will come back the way He went away 
And receive us all unto Himself, but no man knows the day 

I believe He is the Judge of all men, small and great

Some to death and some to life, some to their reward 
Some to sing eternal praise forever to our Lord",Creed

Somewhere in the darkest night a stranger has lost the way
Cold wind and a distant light has carried his heart away
Some say he was one of us, a prodigal gone astray
But inside he's as cold as ice to the truth that he won't obey
He won't discern - the point of no return

In the last daze - the final haze
There was strong delusion to believe a lie
In the last daze before the blaze
They couldn't see beyond their misty trance
To grab the truth and have a fighting chance
In the last daze

Cold chills when the Spirit speaks that some shall depart from the faith
All ends in calamity just when they thought it was safe
They followed the lies - the fables men devised

Some say it's a certainty, a sign of the times I am told
But I weep for the souls of those who will never return to the fold

But she came through like a champ and she blessed the world that day
Then gave the hope of a better life when she gave him away
Now the innocence and joy is there each day he wakes
Expressions of his love of life in every breath he takes
He could have been thrown away before he had a chance to say

(Chorus)
Hey world, I am here and I have something to give
Hey world, I'm alive and I am wanting to live

He turned to lock the door as he wiped away a tear
The hopelessness of missing love, his adolescent fear
As he struggled for the strength to put the gun away
He found the courage and the hope to face another day
He could have been blown away before he had a chance to say

Down the corridor or life in between our death and birth
We may start to lose our way in the search to find our worth
Our value comes in the fact we live
Life is a gift only God can give

Petra,"Words and music by Bob Hartman
Based on Job 13:22

I've been away for a little while
And I don't like where it takes me
Out of touch I'm going out of my mind
It's times like these that really break me

So here I am all alone
I'm waiting on You
Just a word will get me through

(Chorus)
I need to hear from You
Before this night is through
I need to hear from You
So I'm waiting, waiting just to hear from you

My whole world is turning upside down
When I'm lacking in direction
I don't care if it takes all night
I need to feel Your sweet affection

So let me hear words of life
I'm lost without You
Speak to me the way You do

I've been here in this place before
And You're not the one to blame
I need to know what You have in store
So I'm on my knees callin out Your name

I need to hear from You
Deep inside my heart
I need to hear from You
Just a still small voice is gonna get me through



",I Need to Hear from You
Petra,"Words and music by Bob Hartman
Based on 1 Peter 3:15, 2 Timothy 4:2

Enough of the sidelines, gotta get in the game
When nothing is ventured, nothing is gained
He's callin' the numbers play by play
We're either out or we're in all the way

Get in the action whatever the cost
Nothing can equal the worth of the lost
Shoulder to shoulder, hand to the plow
Today is the day and the right time is now

And the field is ready for the new reserve
We will bring the harvest with a will to serve

(Chorus)
Ready, willing and able
To advance the light and defend the right
Ready, willing and able
Lifting up the cross to the waiting lost
Ready to serve and willing to go
Able to stand against the foe
Ready, willing and able

Instant in season drop of a hat
Bases are loaded, it's our turn at bat
Pressure is mounting, the tension is hot
Heaven is watching to see what we've got
There is strength in numbers
There is hope in One
We are called and chosen to proclaim His Son

He's already given us all that we need
With love in our message and hope in our creed
When Yahweh is for us and faith is our stay
No power below us can stand in our way




","Ready, Willing, and Able"
Petra,"Words by Bob Hartman
Based on Romans 1:9, 2 Corinthians 10:4

I've waited patiently for your reply
You say you'll come around by and by
I've tried to show the way into the light
But I just won't let you go without a fight
You think my hands are tied
But you will never hide, no
I've got you in my sight day and night

(Chorus)
I've got a secret weapon
I'll pray for you
I've got a secret weapon
Gonna get through
I really care about you
I'll pray for you

I've told you everything you need to know
But you still fluctuate to and fro
You just can't push yourself over the edge
So I will pull the rug behind the hedge
How can you ever lose
This deal you can't refuse
So with your hands up high
Reach for the sky

I won't give up on you
I'll pray until the night is through
And you surrender to the light
Come on surrender




",Secret Weapon
Petra,"Words and music by Bob Hartman
Based on Hebrews 11:6

For so long I was depending upon
My senses and fences, I tried to ride on
And trusting in things that can never be seen
Was always a crutch on which others must lean
Thinking if I could see I would believe
Then somebody said believe and you will see

(Chorus)
Sight unseen, sight unseen
You have to take it sight unseen
Blinded by the darkness only faith can come between
Sight unseen, sight unseen

Evidence built into every design
Led to conviction between every line
Faith is the key that can open the veil
To Love incarnated and pierced with a nail
Listen my friend, have I got news for you
The nails in His hands and feet were meant for you



",Sight Unseen
Petra,"Words by Timothy Wright
Based on Joshua 24:15

You've been running and running
Running for a long time
Your time is winding up
You better make up your mind
It's getting late in the evening
The sun is going down
You better get right while
He may be found

(Chorus)
I want to know where
Who's on the Lord's side
I want to know where
Who's on the Lord's side
Where do you stand
Come on, come on
I'm on the Lord's side

You got to work, got to work, work while it's day
For the night is coming when you can't find your way
Oh sinner I wonder what will you do
You better choose this day - tomorrow's not promised to you

Get up if you're on the Lord's side
Get on your feet



",Who's on the Lord's Side
Petra,"On this journey we began at birth
This fleeting moment that we spend on earth
No second chance to live it all again
It must be now or never
To cherish each endeavor
What will they say that I have left behind?
A faithful heritage for all to find
What will they see?
I want my legacy to be
He was a believer in deed
He had a heart of a different breed
He made his mark and he lived by his creed
A true believer
A believer in deed
Am I living everything I say?
Am I pointing others to the way?
Will I leave this world a better place?
Will Jesus say He knew me?
Is Jesus living through me?
Did I maintain my authenticity?
A man of honor and integrity?
Remembering me
I hope that they will truly see
At the end of my days I know I'm gonna say
I wouldn't live my life any other way
I'll look to my posterity to carry on for me
And pray that they will see

Petra,"It's just the same thing every day
It's only bad news coming my way
Another war, there's a film at eleven
Another crime from the heart of man
I can sit here with my lock on the door
Change the channel as I try to ignore
Or get ready with shoes on my feet
And start dancing to another beat
Good news- you can read all about it
Good news- speak the word, never doubt it
Good news- cause we can't live without it
I got good news on a long-standing offer
Life you can never lose
Some people can't see the light of day
They need somebody to show them the way
They climb the walls in fear of the future
But God alone has the only cure
The world is spinning like it's out of control
There's only one thing that can save the soul
I'm feeling today is the day
So listen up, I've got something to say
All this bad news is getting me down
Got my head spinning around
Don't have to take it, you know you can choose
So listen up...I've got some good news
The world needs to hear the good news
Of the love of God's Son
Every life can be changed
By the hearing of what He's done

Petra,"Here in my hour of need
I am lonely, forsaken again
I'm wounded and left here to bleed
With no solace from a stranger or friend
Who hears my cry to revive and restore
One who has been here before
He's been in my shoes
Been down this road before
He's been tested too
He's been through this door
He feels the pain and He heals the bruise
He's been in my shoes
He's been in my shoes
The Union of God in a man
Is a mystery that I can't understand
But now with my suffering known
I'm reminded that I'm never alone
Who has been tried and been tempted this way?
Jesus who now hears me pray
He was a man just like me
But He lived His life blamelessly
Now I'm beginning to see
He holds my hand
He understands

Darkness enclosing the world so desperate for day
We're under the spell of dis-unity ooh ho

Now the hour has come
To awaken and redeem the time given to the night
Curse this darkness and stand in the light

Petra,"Western world where the strong survive
And the meek will inherit the dregs
Living now in the twilight time
Will the world hear the answer it begs?
Secular and sacred blur
Without even raising a flag
When so many masters call
Is it the tail or the dog that will wag?
With some among us weak at the knees
And many others who do as they please
There still remains a witness
The few who will stand and say
I've got strong convictions 'bout the way that I live
I've got no concessions that I'm willing to give
Strong convictions that are worth living by
Strong convictions till the day I die
It's so hard seeing black and white
When so much appears to be gray
With no faith in the absolute
It's no wonder the standard will stray
With bold convictions leading the way
With those who have them willing to say
There's a new horizon
I can say for me and mine
Pressure makes the perfect diamond
Measure of the saints refining
Don't ever want to stray
I really want to stay
Steadfast and immovable in Him
",Strong Convictions
Petra,"(Verse 1)
Once a year for sacrifice just one priest could pay the price
And step inside the inner veil to make the people free
Temple stood the same for years till the Nazarene appears
Things will never be the same since 33 A.D.
When He spoke and bowed his head
He who saved the world was dead
Then the earth began to shake
Heaven's wall began to break
Opening the Holy place
The temple veil is torn in two
The way is clear for me and you

(Chorus 1)
We can enter in, enter in
Into Heaven's Holy place
We can enter in, enter in
Boldly by His blood we can approach His throne of grace
We can enter in a new and living Way
By our faith He will receive us when we pray

(Verse 2)
Now without a second look we forget what all it took
To be seen as innocent by His Holy eyes
Never thinking foolishly there is something He won't see
For our lack of righteousness there is no disguise
He won't look the other Way
Someone's life will have to pay
Once for all it has been done
Taken out upon His Son
He remembers it no more
Now for us He is the Door
Opened up forevermore

(Repeat Chorus 1)

We can enter in, enter in
We can enter in His gates with thankfulness and praise
Into the once forbidden Holy place
We can live in goodness and in mercy all our days
We can enter in a new and living Way
By our faith He will receive us when we pray
We don't have to be afraid to seek His face
We can enter in",Enter In
Petra,"The fearless giant faces a brave young shepherd boy
He said, ""Your God is dead and your nation soon destroyed""
But the son of Jesse proved what God can do in the heart of a hero

Three men refused to bow to the idol made of gold
They knew they could burn for not doing what they're told
They'd rather face the fire than to kneel to a god made by hands

It takes the heart of a hero
To stand for what's right
It takes the heart of a hero

So let your heart be filled with the courage and strength of the Lord

Just an artist rendering that was all
The way You looked down in Your agony
Jogged my memory
And helped me to ssee
If a picture's worth a thousand words
Then it won't help me at all
Only words are never gonna say
What I feel for You today

More than my life will not repay
More than a thousand things I do

Without a waiting call on the phone
Looked like a picture from a magazine
More serenity than I've ever seen
And if words cannot describe this day
Or the beauty of this scene
Tell me, how can I expect the words I say
To reflect the things I mean

How You forgave me when I fell
More than a thousand words won't do

There's a time to be cautious and wait

That this time of trouble won't last

The ways He will choose to make us grow
But it's never the way of our choosing
And we can't always see what He's using

Find their strength has been restored
The flames of renewal burn within

I've been told my emotions never had the right to show
But I have this feeling burning deep within my heart
Won't wait to let this heavenly celebration start
When the Spirit gives me the nod
I'll get excited 'bout the things of God

He knew nobody else could face His foe
He left His throne, He left His glory
He knew nobody else could ever go
He called the bluff, He took the challenge
He came into this world to seek and save
No one could know, noone could fathom
The way to win was only through the grave
They laid Him in His tomb
They thought they'd sealed His doom
But He rose
He rose!

He came, He saw, He conquered death and hell
He came, He saw, He is alive and well
He was, He is, and only He forgives
He died, He rose, He lives
He came, He saw, He conquered!

The doors were locked, they heard Him knocking
They were afraid they would be taken, too
Familiar voice said, ""Come and follow""
Come and see the things the Lord can do
They went to where He lay
The stone was rolled away
He rose
He rose!

He came into this world
He saw humanity
He heard the SOS
He met the enemy
The enemy was conquered
The enemy was conquered!","He Came, He Saw, He Conquered"
Petra,"You want to change, with all your might
You want to do right in his sight
It's his delight to give you your desire
It's his desire to set your life on fire, on fire

Sometimes it hurts when reprimanded
It hurts him more than it's hurtin' you
He'll pick you up from where you landed
When he knocks you down, turns your life around
He'll turn your life around

Hit you where you live, you can't hold back
When you're struck by his love you will know
Hit you where you live, it's so close to home
When you're all sold out the mark will show
Let him hit you where you live

The evidence leads to conviction
When we don't live everything we say
There's got to be a crucifixion
We can live dying everyday

You've got to tell him he's free to take a shot
He wants to hit you with everything he's got

Hit you where you live, you can't hold back
When you're struck by his love you will know
Hit you where you live, it's so close to home
When you're all sold out the mark will show
Let him hit you where you live

A lost and dying world is dying to know
He lives the only way they'll know, what he has to give
Is when we're hit where we live

Hit you where you live, you can't hold back
When you're struck by his love you will know
Hit you where you live, it's so close to home
When you're all sold out the mark will show
Let him hit you where you live

Stand up, so the whole world sees us 
Following Him, and serving Him 
Fighting the fight that we know we will win 

Out of our pews and into the streets 
Making some use of our beautiful feet 
Redeeming the time for the days are evil 
This whole world's in such upheaval

Gotta let the redeemed of the Lord say so",Stand Up

Petra,"Words by Bob Hartman
Based on Psalm 37:23-24

Standing on the corner I was losing track of time
When away in the distance saw an old friend of mine
He was smiling when he walked up held a tract out in his hand
Then he told me Jesus loved me and said ""so do I, man""
Told me Jesus wants to save me from the fiery pit of hell
Then I told him I was livin' there I knew that place well
I was just about to leave when a love came over me
Like nothin I had felt then we kneeled and we prayed
Right there in the street we prayed

And now, after all those years of falling down
I fell up in the arms of love
When I heard Him call

(Love was calling I was falling)
He was there and I could hear Him callin'
I was fallin' up into His arms
Love was catchin' me that day and somehow
I was fallin' up then
And I'm fallin' up now
I'm fallin' up now

I remember that same feeling I'm reminded everyday
See, Jesus lives inside me and I know He's there to stay
Sometimes I start to fall down just like any other man
But His arms are there to catch me
And lift me up again

After all those years of falling down
I fell up in the arms of love
When I heard Him call

Now - couldn't live without Him
Now - wanna know more about Him
Now - I'm falling once again
Now - falling up to heaven

Psalm 112:7

He?s got a straight head
In a world of brain dead
He?s got a clean nose
Even when the wind blows
He?s got a Backbone even when he?s all alone
Ain?t taken no chances following the masses

He?s got his mind set
On high with his affections
He?s got the jones
He makes no bones

CHORUS
It?s a God Fixation
A singleness of heart, an undistracted mind
It?s a God Fixation
Addiction of a different kind

He?s got 20/20 vision making a decision
He?s so unaffected by what he has rejected
Rooted and grounded -
He?s standen up to be counted
And he?s already proved
That he will not be moved

He will not bend to
The pressures and persuasions
He knows the lies
He won?t compromise

Everybody has to say their goodbyes
While they wipe away the tears from their eyes
Everybody bids a fonder farewell
When they know there won't be any sequel
Everybody says a Sayonara
When they know they won't be back tomorrow
Everybody hopes to have reunions
Back together with the ones they knew once

There's a salutation that's reserved for heaven's own
Hello again- we're back together
Hello again- we're here forever
Hello again- rejoined in heaven
Hello again

Everybody's gonna be there waiting
They just want to see you graduating
Gonna see the ones who've gone before us
They'll be cheering in a mighty chorus
Everybody will be glad to see ya
Even if it wasn't their idea
Every argument will be forgotten
We remember them for now but not then

When we see each other there'll be just one thing to say...
Say goodbye to the loneliness forever (Never be alone)
Say hello to the garden once again
Say goodbye to this world of stormy weather

Words and Music by Bob Hartman
I wear my seatbelt in the car I buckle up for safety
I run for cover from the storm
I wear a band aid on my knee I look both ways when crossing and I flee
Any danger I can see
And if I try each day to save my life in every way I can
How could I understand the way
You died for me
'Cause I don't know if I could even if I think I would
If I had to die for someone
If I had to die for someone else
How could I ever give my life to set the guilty free
When I cannot imagine
If I had to die for someone else like me
Someone else like me
I keep away from falling rocks and I don't play with matches
I lock the door I don't know why
It seems to me I'm much too old to wear a scarf out in the cold but
I want to live until I die
I guess I love my life a little more than I should love it
And if I had to I don't know if I could
Lay it down
And I am glad that You are not at all like me
'Cause You laid down Your life and did it willingly
It still amazes me to know
It's me that You were thinking of
No One else could have a greater love

What would you do with all the choices that you made then?

Come and cloud my mind
And make me wonder
Am I still in touch with You?
Or could it be my doubting point of view?
Seems like only yesterday
I was seeing clearly through the haze
Now I find I'm not so sure
When a shadow casts it's doubt upon my ways
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
I seem to find You waiting there
Behind the wall of my own reason
I discover how You care
Lord, I know You won't ignore my prayer
Through faith I'll find You waiting
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
I know You are waiting there
I can hear You when I'm listening
I can't see You clearly now
And I know that I am missing all You have...
I will follow You although I cannot see my way
Cast Your light upon these shadows
Make them go away
If I hear Your voice I will obey

Only Jesus satisfies 

In each life there comes the question 
Is there more than meets the eye 
And what will we see of the eternal 
When the well of days runs dry?

The difference between truth and lies 
While in each heart there is a longing

How long
Before you drench the barren land
How long
Before we see a righteous man
How long
Before your name is lifted high
How long
Before the weeping turns to songs of joy

Lord, we know your heart is broken
By the evil that you see
And you've stayed your hand of judgment
For your plan to set men free
But the land is still in darkness
And we've fled from what is right
And we've failed the silent children
Who will never see the light

But I know a day is coming
When the deaf will hear his voice
When the blind will see the savior
And the lame will leap for joy
When a widow finds a husband
Who will always love his bride
And the orphan finds a father
Who will never leave her side

Before your glory lights the skies
How long
Before your radiance lifts our eyes
How long
Before your fragrance fills the air
How long
Before the earth resounds with songs of joy

Petra,"By Bob Hartman
Based on Rom. 7:15

I have a secret that I let nobody see
An evil shadow that's been hanging over me
My alter ego that I try to hold at bay
But despite my good intentions he can always get away

He does the things that I don't want to do

Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde
Two men are fighting a war inside

I have this secret that I let nobody see
It's like a split personality
And the one I feed is the one who lives
The one I starve will be the one who gives

He won't do things that I know I should do

Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde
Two men are fighting a war inside
One gives, one takes, I have to decide
Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde

I need somebody to rescue me
When personalities clash
I know which person I want to be
With no defiance
Just God-reliance

Petra,"Some believe this world is bound to get much better

Based on Proverbs 3:6, 1 Peter 5:8, Matthew 16:24

Smell the burning powder?
There's danger in the air
A voice from deep inside is telling you, 'you must beware'
Then enemy is watching
Every step you take
To find his opportunity in every choice you make

And it's no game
When someone lives without His grace
And who's to blame
When it blows up in their face

It's a mine field - you'd better follow Him through
God knows the way - you'd better stick like glue
It's a mine field - better stay on His heels
'cause the enemy kills and the enemy steals
So keep your head down and keep you eyes peeled
'cause life is...
Life is a mine field

Think the grass is greener?
You'd better look around
Everywhere you look another casualty is found
The enemy is waiting
For you to start to run
Waiting like an itchy finger on a loaded gun

Some may feel
They can wander out too far
They may heal
But they may always wear the scar

Better leave the navigation to the One who knows the Way
He will bring illumination
He will light your path each day

It's a mine field - better watch where you tread
Step off the path and you could end up dead
It's a mine field - better stay on His heels
'cause the enemy kills and the enemy steals
So keep your head down and keep your eyes peeled
'cause life is...
Life is a mine field

An empire that would never fall

I've loved just the man,
A feeling now hard to recall 

The Gods turned away,
Their game for the day,
Amazed I have squandered it all,

But to the ancient throne who's might is mine alone, vows are not enough,

The night will surely keep, my Queen.
Close your eyes, to tides that run too deep,
I know sometimes you weep unseen.
While you dream, the treason and the fear,
Will all but disappear, subside.
Close your eyes, the evening is still and clear,
The fight is nowhere near tonight.

Dream of when you were the brightest star in all of France,
Dream of when you were the celebrated young dauphine,
Mistress of every dance.
The most benign young queen, they'd ever seen 

Close your eyes, deny them how you feel,
Unlock your chains and heal your heart
Close your eyes, remember love was real,
For memories they can't steal or guard 
While you sleep, though death may pass you by
He'll never slip inside unseen
Dry your eyes, and hold your head up high,
They wouldn't dare defy their Queen

Just fine

You'll hear the church bells ring, my Queen

You'll hear the angels sing, be free",Close Your Eyes (He'll Be Just Fine)
Petra Berger,"You have bitten on the plum of sadness
Bitter berries are a fruit you know
Dying is an art you find so easy
Poetry, a world where you let go
Come with me and dance under the moonlight
Come with me and play among the stars
Masquerade upon a flight of fancy
No-one really knowing who you are 

So try to set your spirit free
Fly beyond your destiny
To a special place where dreams are coming true 

Lady Lazarus, arise from ashes
Freedom flowin' through your scarlet hair
Though your suit be burned, it doesn't matter
Men in black, you eat up like thin air
Winter trees are standing bare and lonely
Summer, it may never come again
Seems your life is caught inside a bell-jar
Can your broken heart break free from pain?

So try to set your spirit free
Fly beyond your destiny
To a special place where dreams are coming true",Beyond Your Destiny

Would be, to capture me

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh

That I could fall with so much emotion

For a lovely cottage that, do you wanna meet Monday to pick up the forniture

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Down in south Caroline
Soon's the Saturday sun went on down

And leave me home all alone
Goin' to that big square dance in town

Well my old radio
Would play that ol' Opry show
So I never got lonesome or blue
I'd fall asleep in my chair
And dream that I was right there
Just singing the whole night through

When my folks would come home
They'd be humming a song
Mamma'd smile and say, ""Child don't you know
There ain't a thing in this world
To make you fall in love girl
Like the San Antonio stroll""

Well the day finally come
When my momma said, ""Hon'
It's 'bout time you came with us as well""
Well, I had me a time
Yes, I danced all night
Till they rang that old cracked midnight bell

Then the lights went down low
The fiddler picked up his bow
And he played something stately and slow
And my sister Eileen and her husband to be
They held hands and began to stroll

I've been away for a while
But it still brings a smile
When I think of the way that it goes
Now I'll sing it to you
Just so we both can do

Om du frågar mig om sanningen så tvekar jag
Saknar röka gräs, ba en liten gås

Nog torskat på det mesta om jag inte hållt mig I skinnet
För det kostar o festa när du trollar med sinnet
Brukar skylla på trycket men jag krökar för mycket
En vinare varje kväll, det är så långt ifrån nykter
Försöker mörka mitt sätt men det blir ofta fel

Går 12-stegs programmet, dom o alla ja kännt
Brukar va svartsjuk som få, men de va värre då
När du lämna mig ibland blev hela världen grå
Jag vet knappt va som e bra med mig
Varför du kämpar på o ba vill va med mig
För jag träffar min familj för lite o när jag ser dom så jobbar 
jag konstant o ägnar knappast tid med dom

Lovar o inte håller, det som driver mig finns där
Jag gillar dom som delar mitt synsätt o flyger I min sfärd
Kanske tappat det helt, spelat för många spel

Petter,"Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändrats
Men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser ja klart

Du var gammal
Jag var äldre
Och nu sågs vi igen
Gått så lång tid så länge sen
Decennier tillbaks
Men jag minns det såväl
Varför kärleken brunnit
Utav olika skäl
Varför jag aldrig släppt det och aldrig gett upp
Trotts min väg vart lång kantats med gupp
Jag stått utan för din port så många gånger
Så många brev många sånger
Minns varje ord varje rad jag skrivit
En längtan så stor
Minns varje dag jag lidit
Har gått genom livet med en övertygelse
Att jag satt något spår
Som har haft betydelse
Aldrig besvarad aldrig tillmötes
En kärlek så varm utan den vilket öde
Från vinter till vår
Sen sommar till höst
Trots att tiden vart svår så gav kärleken tröst
Hjärtan som slår
Vi står där vi stod
Minns det som igår
Första gången du log
Som om jag snubblade pladask
På marken och bara dog

Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändratas men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser jag klart

Jag var ung du var yngre
När vi sågs första gången
Rusade förbi mig snabbt på perrongen
Blev hjälplöst förälskat
Obeskrivligt tagen
Som om jag låg ner på marken och blev slagen
Betraktade ditt hår
När det fångades av vinden
Som att svimma på en bergstopp utav svindeln
Sen den stunden satt jag fast i ett nät förtrollad bunden
Tappa hjärtat i knät
Kunde inte tänka logiskt eller sunt
Och för varje sekund som du inte fanns där blev det tung
Började sakta uppvakta på avstånd i brev
Men det spelade ingen roll vad jag skrev
Du hade inte fastnat än inte fattat än
Vilken kärlek som fanns att bara hämta hem
Men efter ett tag
Det började korresponderas
Mina förhoppningar dom väcktes
För att sen raseras
Du flyttade utomlands någon annanstans
Gav bort din hand till en annan man
Och breven som skrevs dom kom aldrig fram
Men mitt hjärta det brann och min åtrå var sann

Jag gav aldrig upp dig när du försvann
Långa dagar blev till nätter sen till år

Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändrats
Men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser jag klart

Ååå

Nu står du där på gatan
Sargad av tiden
Huden är grå
Din hållning förvriden
Vill säga nånting men jag kan inte tänka klart
Känslor bubblar upp utan att tänka tillbaks
Trevar mig fram för att etablera kontakt
Tar tag i din hand
Vi brister ut i ett skratt
Det var så länge sen
Men det finns där än
För passionen vi kände kommer alltid igen
Har ett hjärta utan rynkor
Det består intakt
Och drömmar i mitt liv har jag aldrig förlagt
Aldrig nått fram så jag älskat på avstånd
Nu är det mitt tåg och dags för avgång
Stiga på aldrig tveka en minut
För att allt som flyger upp måste landa till slut
Kan inte titta tillbaks trots min vilja är stark
Vi vandrar iväg utan vidröra mark

Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändrats
Men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser jag klart

Mina minnen höll mig uppe varje dag
Du är som att andas för
Jag gav aldrig upp dig när du försvann

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Just a puppet on a lonely string

Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there

Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.

Killing me softly with his song,

And so I came to see him to listen for a while.

I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on.

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?

You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
Downtown, no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows

Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close

Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're gonna be alright now

Downtown, downtown

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

What to do, how to move him. 
I've been changed, yes really changed. 
In these past few days, when I've seen myself, 
I seem like someone else.

I don't see why he moves me. 
He's a man. He's just a man. 
And I've had so many men before, 
In very many ways, 
He's just one more.

Should I scream and shout? 
Should I speak of love, 
Let my feelings out?

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny, 
I should be in this position.

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool, 
Running every show. 
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this.

Petula Clark,"In the shoemaker's shop 
This refrain would never stop
As he tapped away
Working all the day. 

At his bench there was he
Just as busy as a bee
Little time to lose
With the boots and shoes. 

But his heart went pop
Inside the little shop
When a lovely girl
Set him all a whirl. 

She had come to choose
Some pretty dancing shoes
And he heard her say
In her charming way, 

""Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing,
Dancing, dancing all the day.
Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing, 
Dancing all my cares away."" 

Then he tapped and he stitched
For his fingers were bewitched
And he sewed a dream
Into every seam. 

Making shoes, oh so neat
Just like magic on her feet
And he hoped she'd know
That he loved her so. 

But she danced, danced, danced
As tho' she were entranced
Like a spinning top
All around the shop. 

On her dainty feet 
She whirled into the street
And he heard her say 
As she danced away, 

""Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing, 
Dancing, dancing all the day. 
""Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing, 
Dancing all my cares away.""",The Little Shoemaker
Petula Clark,"When you've climbed the highest mountain
When a cloud holds the sunshine in
Suddenly there's a valley
Where the earth knows peace with man

When a storm hides the distant rainbow
And you think you can't find a friend
Suddenly there's a valley
Where friendships never end

Touched only by the seasons
Swept clean by the waving grain
Surveyed by a happy bluebird
And kissed by the falling rain

When you think there's no bright tomorrow
And you feel you can't try again

Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.

Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor

Not going left
Not going right.

Or am I losing my mind ?
You said you loved me
Or were you just being kind ?
Or am I losing my mind ?
Or were you just being kind ?
Or am I losing my mind ?
Losing my mind
Losing my mind

Petula Clark,"Ever since I was a young boy I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist
How do you think he does it I don't know
What makes him so good

Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes or bells
Don't see lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell
Always gets a replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lean him in and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball",Pinball Wizard [From the Who's Tommy]
Petula Clark,"Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?

In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles
In laughter, in strife

In five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure a year in the life

How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love

Of a woman or a man?

In truths that she learned
Or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she died

It's time now to sing out
Tho' the story never ends
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends

Remember the love
Remember the love
Remember the love

Petula Clark,"When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go - downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know - downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?

   The lights are much brighter there
   You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
   So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
   Downtown - no finer place, for sure
   Downtown - everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows - downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close - downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again

   The lights are much brighter there
   You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
   So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
   Downtown - waiting for you tonight
   Downtown - you're gonna be all right now

------ instrumental break ------

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

   So maybe I'll see you there
   We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
   So go downtown, things'll be great when you're
   Downtown - don't wait a minute for
   Downtown - everything's waiting for you

I try, God knows I try, but I don't make it, my baby
Can't you see (Can't you see) I can only be me
And ev'rything I am, I'm offering you
So throw away your fantasy and face reality like I do
Try to see the side of me that's lovin' you, baby

Why don't you give it a try (Give it a try)

I am not a fool, I've been around, I know the rules
So I smile, through it all I smile and try to take it

And if you wanna touch the skies
You'll have to compromise, like I do

Petula Clark,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people

Before you go make this moment sweet again
We won't say ""Good night"" until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it

We come and go like a ripple on a stream

Tomorrow may never come for all we know",For All We Know
Petula Clark,"If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.

If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.
And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away",If
Petula Clark,"Now if there's a smile upon my face 
it's only there trying to fool the public

now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject

Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show

but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,

Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry

Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear

Even though my love is so demanding
Every time you look at me
Then you'll know we'll both agree
That no other love could be

I couldn't live without your love
Now, I know you're really mine
I gotta have you all the time

Didn't like you much when I first met you
But somehow, I couldn't quite forget you
Said you didn't want a friend or lover
That your life was happy with another

But as time went by, my love grew stronger
Knew that I just couldn't wait any longer
For I couldn't let you go
And I had to tell you so
That I loved you, then you'd know

I couldn't live without your love
Now, I know you're really mine
I gotta have you all the time

Now, the tears are gone and I'm not cryin'
When you say you love me, you're not lyin'

We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down.

Seasons came and changed the time
And I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
""Remember when we used to play?""

And till this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie.

Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.

I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting

I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

Of a heart of a wonderful one
When other lovers are gone
We'll live on
We'll live on 

Even in my dreams I look into your eyes
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise
Everywhere I go the sun comes shinin' through 

Nobody I know could love me more than you
You can give me so much love it seems untrue
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
And then when you've heard him see if you agree
Nobody I know could love you more than me
Nobody I know could love you more than me",Nobody I Know
Petula Clark,"Now if you feel that you can't go on 
Because all of your hope is gone,
And your life is filled with much confusion 
Until happiness is just an illusion,
And your world around is crumblin' down;  
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach on out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you.
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through.
I'll be there to always see you through.
 
When you feel lost and about to give up 
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold, 
And you're drifting out all on your own, 
And you need a hand to hold:
Darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you, 
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you.
I'll be there to love and comfort you.
 
I can tell the way you hang your head,
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around, 
But there's no peace of mind to be found.
I know what you're thinkin', 
You're alone now, no love of your own, 
But darling, reach out (come on girl, reach out for me) 
Reach out (reach out for me.)
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need, 
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me.","Reach Out, I'll Be There"
Petula Clark,"I don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here.
Yes a world to rediscover,
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment.

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways,
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye.

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you,
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together.

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning,
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye.

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past,
This world's waited long enough,
I've come home at last!

And this time will be bigger,
And brighter than we knew it.
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways,
So much to say not just today but always.
We'll have early morning madness.
We'll have magic in the making.
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye",As If We Never Said Goodbye
Petula Clark,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be,
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]

Have I said too much ?
There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that ev'ry word is true

[Chorus]

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep my distance",Don't Cry for Me Argentina

Then I tumble out of paradise

Darn that one track mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in

Day in and day out

When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine

I don't know where, come lately

You are the words, I am the tune, play me.

Petula Clark,"I was never spellbound by a starry sky
What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven 
For you are mine at last
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you

Petula Clark,"There was a time when men were kind
Their voices were soft
And their words inviting

There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And that song was exciting

There was a time, and it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream
Petula Clark,"The hardest thing I've ever done is keep believing
There's someone in this crazy world for me
The way that people come and go through temporary lives
My chance could come and I might never know

I used to say ""No promises, let's keep it simple""
But freedom only helps you say goodbye
It took a while for me to learn that nothing comes for free
The price I paid is high enough for me

I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time 
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

So here I am with pockets full of good intentions
But none of them will comfort me tonight
I'm wide awake at 4 a.m. without a friend in sight
I'm hanging on a hope but I'm all right

I can break your heart 
With one look 
I play every part 
I can make your sad heart sing 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one smile 
I'm the girl next door 
Or the love that you've hungered for 
When I speak it's with my soul 
I can play any role

You can't write that down 
You know I'm right 
It's there in black and white 
When I look your way 
You'll hear what I say

Yes, with one look 
I put words to shame 
Just one look 
Sets the screen aflame 
Silent music starts to play 
One tear from my eye 
Makes the whole world cry

With one look 
They'll forgive the past 
They'll rejoice: I've returned at last 
To my people in the dark 
Still out there in the dark 

Silent music starts to play 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one look 
I'll ignite a blaze 
I'll return to my glory days 
They'll say Norma's back at last

I'm staying for good 
I'll be back

I'll be me",With One Look
Petula Clark,"You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss, 
A sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply, 
As time goes by 

An' when two lovers woo, they still say ""I love you,"" 
On that you can rely, no matter what the future brings, 
As time goes by

Moonlight an' love songs never out of date, 
Hearts full of passion, jealousy an' hate, 
Woman needs man and man must have his mate, 
That no one can deny 

It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory, 
A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers,

Although the lights are low, forget it
Wait until we're alone, wait until we go home
Come on please, I don't tease
Just dance on

Don't try and kiss me now, dance on
You might be feeling quite romantic
But I'll dance cheek to cheek
Or we'll miss every beat     
Just dance on

Give me the sweet talk when we're leaving
From midnight on it's worth believing

Is this my dream at last come true
Are you the one my heart has saved its song for

I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance
I wish I knew, but only you can answer

If you don't care, why let me hope and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so
Should I keep dreaming on or just forget you
What shall I do, I wish I knew

If I only had my way
A paradise this world would seem to you, Dear

You'd never know a care, a pain, or sorrow
If I only had my way
I'd fill your cup of happiness tomorrow

I'll say I'm lucky,
This is my lucky day!

Petula Clark,"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings

Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs

And then I don't feel so bad",My Favorite Things [*]
Petula Clark,"I'm shouting all about love
While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago

I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love

Living with the good and the bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who Imagined it all
All those years ago

Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
And all else we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago",All Those Years Ago

I searched the starlit sky so bright, 
In my imagination, 
There I saw you in the night. 

And on the day I saw you, 
How could I help but realise? 
My lucky star was smiling right there, 
Before my very eyes

You are my lucky star, 
I saw you from afar. 
Two lovely eyes at me they were beaming, gleaming, 
I was star struck. 

You're all my lucky charms; 
I'm lucky in your arms. 
You've opened heaven's portal, 
Here on Earth for this poor mortal. 
You are my lucky star!",You Are My Lucky Star

I've grown accustomed to his face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
His smiles, his frowns,
His ups, his downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to his look,
Accustomed to his voice,
Accustomed to his face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
Wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
Doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see his now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see his now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught his,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for his bread and water,
While his husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in his cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take his in or hurl his to the walls?
Give his kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take his back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take his back
If she were even crawling on his knees.
Let his promise to atone,
Let his shiver, let his moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear his day,
""Good morning"" every day.
His joys, his woes,
His highs, his lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, like a habit
One can always break, and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to his face.",I've Grown Accustomed to His Face

Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

That you belonged to me

The more we drift apart

Petula Clark,"You'll never see a dark cloud hanging 'round me 
Now there is only blue sky to surround me 
There's never been a gray day since you found me 
Everything I touch is turning to gold 

[Chorus] 
So you can color my world with sunshine yellow each day 
Oh you can color my world with happiness all the way 
Just take the green from the grass & the blue from the sky up above 
& if you color my world, just paint it with your love 
Just color my world 

Just as long as I know you're thinking of me 
There'll be a rainbow always up above me 
Since I found the one who really loves me 
Everything I touch is turning to gold

That your love for me is getting so much stronger
It's a sign of the times
And I know that I won't have to wait much longer

You've changed a lot somehow
from the one I used to know-oh-oh
For when you hold me now
ya' feel like you never wanna to let me go

It's a sign of the times
That you call me up whenever you feel lonely
It's a sign of the times
That you tell your friends that I'm your one and only

I'll never understand
the way you treated me
But when I hold your hand
I know you couldn't be the way you used to be

Maybe my lucky star at last decided to shine
Maybe somebody knows
how long I've waited to make you mine, mm-mm

It's a sign of the times
That you kiss me now as if you really mean it

Just leave the past behind

Petula Clark,"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain

Grab a mad bull by the nose

I can even for no reason
Be as nice as I am rude
But I can't get you to love me
I just can't get you to love me

What do I do?
I can stand up put my hand up
Where perhaps it shouldn't be
I can go down to a hoe-down?

Petula Clark,"Everything has its season, Everything has its time,
Show me a reason and Ill soon show you a rhyme.
Cats fit on the window sill, Children fit in the snow.
Why do I feel I don't fit in anywhere I go? Rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Eagles belong where they can fly.
Ive got to be where my spirit can run free.
Got to find my corner of the sky.

Every man has his daydreams, Every man has his goals. 
People like the way dreams have of sticking to the soul. 
Thunderclouds have their lightening. Nightingales have their song. 
And don't you see I want my life to be something more than long?

So many men seem destined to settle for something small, 
but I wont rest until I know Ill have it all. 
So don't ask where Im going, but listen when Im gone. 
And far away you'll hear me singing softly to the dawn.",Corner of the Sky
Petula Clark,"Didn't I say?
Didn't you say?
Didn't we say?
Didn't who say?

Didn't you say you were off to China?
Fancy meeting you here!
Yes, and didn't you just board an ocean liner?
Fancy meeting you here!
Didn't we agree that our affair was too frantic,
And we'd both feel good divided by the wide Atlantic?

Weren't you yachting off the Riviera?
With Onnassis!
Fancy meeting you here!
Was it jolly roaming the Sahara?
Dry, but laughs!
Fancy meeting you here!
If you don't think I have missed your lovin',
Let's get this clear, dear!
I just think it's fancy meeting you right here!

Did you say that you enjoyed Alaska?
Loved it, loved it!
Did I get a note from Madagascar?
Wrote it!
You're a good girl!
Didn't we divide our little world into sections?
A clean break!
But love has sure affected both our senses of directions!

Say, tell me somethin', how did you ever lose that
Wealthy, that big fat Persian?
'Twasn't easy!
Fancy meetin' you here!
Did you take that African excursion?
I blew it!
Yeah, for the local zoo here!

Petula Clark,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world",I'm a Woman/Wedding Bell Blues
Petula Clark,"Hay,
Wouldn't it be nice to make a people tree.
The likes of you,
The likes of me.
We can do it very easily.
We barely even have to try.
Let a little time go by.
And pretty soon before we know it.
(Soon before we know it)

Suddenly the two of us are one, two, three.
And there we see, our people tree.
Soon the score is up to four or more.
As other little branches grow.

That's the way it's meant to go.
And there's no way I know to slow it.
(There's no way to slow it)

Evidence beyond dispute of all our mutual attraction.

Nothing is as lovely as a people tree.

Would all agree

Petula Clark,"I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line",When I Fall in Love/Let There Be Love

While I am away Dear, I'll trust in you.

There'll be other arms,
That will want you for their own.
Tell those other lips, 
Tell those other arms,
That you're mine and mine alone.

Keep watching and waiting, 'til I'm back with you.

When I'm away, I'll trust in you.
I'll never foresake you, though we're apart.
Faithful to my faithful heart.

Petula Clark,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
