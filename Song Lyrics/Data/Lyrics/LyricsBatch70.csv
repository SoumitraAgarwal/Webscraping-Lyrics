Don Rendell,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Don Rendell,"From this moment on
You for me, dear
Only two for tea, dear
From this moment on

From this happy day
No more blue songs
Only hoop-de-doo songs
From this moment on

You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight

From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on

You've got the love I need so much

Don Rendell,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

[Chorus]",Sometimes I'm Happy
Don Rendell,"I'm puttin' on my top hat
Tyin' up my white tie
Brushin' off my tails

I'm dudein' up my shirt front
Puttin' in the shirt studs
Polishin' my nails

I'm steppin' out, my dear
To breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust when I step on the gas

For I'll be there
Puttin' down my top hat
Mussin' up my white tie
Dancin' in my tails

I just got an invitation through the mails
Your presence requested this evening, it's formal
A top hat, a white tie and tails
Nothing now could take the wind out of my sails
Because I'm invited to step out this evening
With top hat, white tie and tails","Top Hat, White Tie and Tails"
Don Rendell,"Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days
Olden days, golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth, was mine
Sad am I, glad am I
For today I’m dreaming of yesterdays

Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days

Don Rendell,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Don Rendell,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You
Don Rendell,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?

Don Rendell,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

Don Rendell,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

We can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive

Don Reno,"You can tell I'm from the country
see I'm from out of town
But I'm beginning to catch on
I'm letting my hair down


I've been a' rocking
I've been a' rollin'
I guess to some folks I look foolish
just let it make a fool out of me


I have worked in fields of cotton
I have worked in fields of corn
But I've seen nothing like it
since the day that I was born


I walked in a crowded dance hall
and I didn't know a soul
Some hillbillies started picking
everybody rocked and rolled


I have spent all the egg money
corn and cotton I have sold
I'll mortgage my old homestead
stay in town to rock and roll",Country Boy Rock & Roll
Don Reno,"The time has come to say goodbye
I hate to part, this way
Our parting ways, have met again
This is goodbye today



    Maybe you will change your mind
    And if you do, someday you'll find
    That I was right, and you were wrong
    About the tie, that binds



The tie that binds, our love sweetheart
Was torn to shreds by you
But if you'll piece them up again
We'll start our life anew



  * Refrain



You'll find the road, gets longer dear
When I'm not by your side
And I may shed some better tears
My love I cannot hide



  * Refrain

",Maybe You Will Change Your Mind
Don Reno,"We are saying goodbye dear forever
I am leaving your false love behind
Every promise you made has been broken
You're no longer a sweetheart of mine

I wanted someone true and faithful
And that is the way it had to be
You wanted your honky-tonk life dear
You're no longer a sweetheart to me

   Go back to the bar down the street dear
   And stay with your honky-tonk kind
   Go back to the life you've been living
   You're no longer a sweetheart of mine

From a bottle to a ride in the moonlight
In the arms of the first man you see
Another victim added to your list dear
You're no longer a sweetheart to me

I could never pretend to be happy
Until a true love I have found
But you lived a lie from the start dear
You're no longer a sweetheart of mine

",No Longer a Sweetheart of Mine
Don Reno,"Now people seem to watch my footsteps as I go by
They shake their heads and say I'm riding high
But this thing has done drove me wild and now it's got me down
And made me the talk of the town

   I'll go down to the river and slowly walk around
   And if my thoughts don't change a lot I'll jump right in and drown
   For after what you've done to me I know I've grown to be
   The laughing stock the talk of the town

I used to think this couldn't happen to a guy like me
As nightfall finds me headed to your door
Now you don't seem to want me since a new love you have found
And now I am the talk of the town

",I'm the Talk of the Town
Don Reno,"I got money, marbles, and chalk sweetheart
   But I still feel like I am poor
   Cause my money won't spend, and my marbles won't roll
   And my chalk won't write anymore

There's an old saying that's been all around
I heard it before I could walk
How some's got wealth, some's got health
Others money marbles and chalk

While you were here I was happy and gay
Your presence made me feel so proud
But you left me, for another one day
Now I feel alone in a crowd

Money, marbles, and chalk is alright
For a miser who loves only gold
But give me a chance, to save our romance
For I love you with all of my soul
","Money, Marbles and Chalk"
Don Reno,"Since I've used my bible for a road map
I've been traveling toward the promised land
There has been no worry or obstruction
No rough pavement and no sinking sand



    I'm on the right road to glory
    Jesus leads me by the hand
    Since I've used my bible for a road map
    All my earthly travels have been grand



Since I've used my bible for a road map
I'm insured by Jesus day and night
And if I take the wrong direction
My bible will always steer me right

Don Reno,"Call up old Towser, call up old Joe
Make preparations, a hunting we must go
Tally ho, tally ho



Now mount up your horses, the dogs seem to know
Waiting for our signal they're rairing to go
Tally ho, tally ho



Now the fox hounds are running, watch Old Leed go
Heist up your horn and give her a blow
Tally ho, tally ho



Now the fox hounds are panting they all run too slow
The fox has out run them and they're heading for home
Tally ho, tally ho

Don Reno,"There's another baby waiting for me down the line
She has got just what it takes and I have got the time
And you have been untrue my darling to the tie that binds
So there's another baby waiting for me down the line

I have stayed awake and wondered what I'm gonna do
While you went out honky tonkin' coming home at two
But tonight I'm all dressed up and feeling Oh so fine
For there's another baby waiting for me down the line

I may not be at home my darling for a day or more
I'll give you just a little taste of walking the floor
You won't need me no longer since I've found out you're that kind
For there's another baby waiting for me down the line",There's Another Baby Waiting for Me Down the Line
Don Reno,"You've got me under your spell again
   Sayin' those things again
   Makin' me believe that you're just mine
   You've got me dreamin' those dreams again
   Thinkin' those things again
   I've got to take you back just one more time.

I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone.

Well everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
But no one else can make me feel the way you do.
",Under Your Spell Again
Don Reno,"Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground

I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground

I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground

Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
For I found her when the snow was on the ground",Footprints in the Snow
Don Reno,"[Chorus:]
This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey, for my size

Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
Baby, how can I roll when the wheels won't go

Up on the mountain just to see my honey
And I ain't coming back, lord, I ain't coming back

It's a long way to Hazard a long way to Harian
Just to get a little booze, just get a little boos

Don Reno,"Some things disappear inside, should I try to run away
If I could I would escape you
I won't argue any-more,
I have lost my will to be
Hope you don't think I'm ungrateful

Why, why are you laughing
Is it something that I said

I don't like this place at all
Makes me wonder what I'm here for
Someone take this pain away
Dying to see another day

Close the curtains, look the door, left my note upon the stair
In the hope you wouldn't read it
Fake emotions in my head, everything I've seen an read
Can't begin to find a reason

Why, why are you laughing
Is it something that I said

I don't like this place at all
Makes me wonder what I'm here for
Someone take this pain away
Dying to see another day

I don't like this place at all
Makes me wonder what I'm here for
Someone take this pain away
Dying to see another day
And I don't want to be your friend, or pretend I can fit into
I'm incensed I'm blown away
Dying to see another day",Another Day

But oh, what those five foot could do
Has anybody seen my girl?

Never had no other beaus
Has anybody seen my girl?

Don Reno,"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like pedals when we part.

I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you taught how to cry.

One for every time you've broke my heart",Bouquet of Roses
Don Reno,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.",The Old Rugged Cross
Don Reno,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Still live in my heart all alone

Don Rice,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

To my heart he carries the key

I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.

It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""

I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""

No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.

I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.

Don Shirley,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

Don Shirley,"Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where the old darke'ys heart am long'd to go,
There's where I labored so hard for old massa,
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,
No place on earth do I love more sincerely
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born. 

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where this old darkey's heart am long'd to go. 

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darke'ys life will pass away.

Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore,
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.",Carry Me Back to Old Virginny
Don Shirley,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Don Shirley,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Gershiwn Medley: My Man's Gone Now/I Got Plenty O' Nuttin'/It ...
Don Shirley,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue

Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring

I'm watching the sea,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You
Don Stiernberg,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing

You used to do
I'm so lonely

We looked at each other in the same way then

But I can't remember where or when

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,

Would be, to capture me

You wore down my resistance
I fell, and it was swell
I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never, never know
It's not that I'm attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie

I'll do my best to make him stay

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

Encontrare una explicación

Y olvidar que la solución 
No estaba en el castigo 
Y simplemente no alejarnos tu y yo

Que en mis sueños en las noches
Somos uno tu why yo
No se quien soy..

Coro!

Mírame a los ojos
Que no ves que estoy sufriendo
Why cada día mas vuelvo a intentar
No es mas que otro fallido intento
(bis)

Dime que sientes cuando estas cerca de mi...
Soy invisible es tan fácil de decir
Why ya no se quien soy
Why ya no se quien soy...

Coro!

Mírame a los ojos
Que no ves que estoy sufriendo
Why cada día mas vuelvo a intentar
No es mas que otro fallido intento

Mírame a los ojos
Que no ves que estoy sufriendo
Why cada día mas vuelvo a intentar
No es mas que otro fallido intento

Mírame a los ojos
Que no ves que estoy sufriendo
Why cada día mas vuelvo a intentar
No es mas que otro fallido intento

No es mas que otro fallido intento (bis)

Don Tetto,"Ha vuelto ha suceder why jure no volverlo a hacer
Tres botellas a mi lado indican que falle otra vez
Why este dolor en mi cabeza, me hare pensar mas en ella
No era la mejor manera de calmar mi obsesion
Necesito olvidarle, estoy a punto de odiarle
Pero nuevamente es viernes me traiciona la razon
Porque nada es suficiente, si estar mal es lo de siempre
Seguire mezclando ganas con alcohol

Ya ves ha vuelto a suceder

Que tu recuerdo me atravieza why me hare enloquecer
Hoy te busque otra vez

Estoy borracho why no tengo miedo a caer

Soy un conjunto de errores que no tiene solucion
Por debajo del promedio
Puedo ser un perdedor

Esto no es normal 
Te he pensado mucho y te hecho de menos. 
Es tan difícil de ocultar 
Quien lo iba a pensar 
Yo no creía en el amor sincero 

(Pero tu mi amor) 
Nunca me enseñaste a jugar el juego 
(De tu corazón) 
Y ahora mira lo que estoy sintiendo por vos. 

Quiero contarte mi situación 
Todo sigue mal 
Mi vida apesta si tu no estas. 
Debo encontrar una solución 
Algo que decir 
Para que de nuevo estés junto a mi

Soy demasiado idiota para intentarlo 
(Así que por favor) 
No dejemos todo esto a un lado.

Nunca quise que pasara, yo

Es mas ciego el que puede y no quiere ver 

Saber que es el comienzo y se siente el final 
Es la misma rutina, ocultar la verdad 

Ven te invito a jugar un poco a mi realidad 
Ni en tu mejor amigo se puede confiar 

Me canse 
Por que todo lo que hago parese que no es suficiente 
Me canse 
No quiero ser juguete que usan y luego lo venden 
¿Para que? 
Pensar en un futuro si no has encontrado el presente 
Debe ser 
Que la vida es un juego en el que yo siempre salgo perdiendo 

Y que se supone que debo hacer 
No es posible con sueños burlar al poder 

Siempre quieren ganar nunca quieren ceder 
Imponiendo sus reglas, perdemos la fe 

Sabes que es lo que quieres lo puedes lograr 
No dependes de ti no lo puedes cambiar

Y tu, me hiciste cambiar el recuerdo 
Del amor que es mentira, con una sonrisa 
Entraste en mi mente y me cambiaste la vida 
Brillo la esperanza que mi alma tenia 
Un amor como el tuyo nunca se olvida 

Mi pasado en soledad fue tristeza y dolor 
El sol a mi ventana nunca llego 
Perdido en un lugar la suerte no ayudo 
Mi adiccion al dolor me llevo hacia el alcohol

Pienso que esto sera distinto

Mas que palabras suletas que te llevaran a terminar 
Con esto que creaste el dia en que eras uno nada mas 
Y lo tenias todo es suficiente la felicidad 

Que pasa 
Cuando el dia sea muy tarde y ya no puedas regresar 
Para vivir 
Necesitas comprender que hay mucho mas que terminar

Pienso en ti En cada instante en cada momento Tu 
Creas en mi Ese unico sentimiento Quiero ser El 
Dueño de tus pensamientos Sin Saber Soy yo 
El que te ama en silencio 

La otra noche que pase al lado de su casa En esa 
Fiesta de color la distingui en la ventana Entre a 
Su casa, cerveza en mano y un trago de tequila No 
Coordinaba me caia pero hacia ella yo iba 

Y decidi que era correcto Debia decirle lo que 
Siento Me acerque a ella a paso lento Quise 
Congelar el momento 

Me paralice Y las palabras no me salieron Solo 
Me miro Y su mirada me llevo al cielo Me senti 
Mejor Y solo me quedaba sonriendo El miedo me 
Gano Di la vuelta y sali corriendo 

Me dijo vuelve aca y no hagas tantas tonterias 
Dime lo que ibas a decir vamos alegra mi vida 
Desde el momento en que te vi he quedado enamorada 
Ahora me toca a mi decir que es lo que siente mi 
Alma

Creas en mi Ese unico sentimiento Quiero ser El 
Dueño de tus pensamientos Sin Saber Soy yo

Don Tetto,"No queda nada por decir,
He mostrado todo lo que hay en ti,
No quiero pensar cual sera tu fin.

Te crees tan tan especial,
Siempre igual a todas las demás,
Nadie te enseño lo que es el amor,
Andas por la vida sin dirección.

Aparentas ser tan buena,
La mitad es pura mierda,
Vive para los demás,
Pero yo se que estas muriendo en soledad...


Oh dime cuantas veces lo hiciste
Tan solo por amor why no tan solo para divertirte
Pasaran los días,
Pasan horas,
Pasaran semanas

why tal vez tu sigues igual
Como si nada de esto te importara
(nada de esto te importara)

Sales con él why el es feliz
Tan poco le importa igual que a ti,
Quien lo iba a pensar que seria tu fin.

Se cree tan tan especial,
Gastando el dinero de su papá
Why no sabe de amor,le gusta el reggaeton
Why no vale tres pesos ese cabrón.

Te trata como a una reina,
Sabe para que eres buena,
Viven para los demás
Pero yo se que estas muriendo en soledad...

Oh dime cuantas veces lo hiciste
Tan solo por amor why no tan solo para divertirte

The light of love has gone out, and now your shadow's gone away

I see him for an hour. After that he's gotta leave
On top of that, I only get to see him once a week
Yea, right, lucky me
Well fuck child support and whoever disagrees
I learned a valuable lesson, indeed
But I'm just trying to be the best father I can be
Apparently I'm an unfit father, cause all I know is dope
And all I got is dirty dollars
But I'm selling dope to help my family get farther
Cause no 9 to 5 is gonna prevent us from starving
I'm sorry Jaylin, I don't get to see you like I want to
But I just wanna let you know I want to
If the court grants me visitation, them I'm going to
But you're to young to understand what we're going through
And your mama's low down
She's just doing everything to hurt me right now
Why? Cause I don't love her like I used to
So to get back at me, she knows she's gotta use you
And I don't know what else to do. She don't understand that this shit will bruise you too
And now I gotta take the bitch to court, so either way, it's a lose - lose
I tried talking to the bitch, but she keeps using you as a bargaining chip
And I am not the one to be bargaining with
That just makes me wanna go and put my paws on that bitch
I swear this shit ain't even right bruh
I ain't even got a chance to change your fucking diaper
This is what I get for going raw when I piped her
Thinking that I loved her, when I shouldn't have even like her
But I do not regret my child
Stupid bitch, I just wanna see my child
Do what you may, but you will never make me bow
Fuck child support, bitch take me to trial
Why you with this shit? Cause I ain't read you no vows?
Bitch move on. Me and you ain't working out
So... What's it matter that I moved to work out
'Long as I provide, and put food in his mouth
'Mater fact, I'm in school right now
'case the music don't work and I can put the work down
My momma say this shit sure to work out
All the bullshit I'm going through to see my first child
See his first steps. See his first Smile. Hear his first Words. Teach him how to count
But I guess I've been counted out, seeing as, the bitch don't want me around
When I speak to him, he don't recognize the sound
The sound of my voice, so he just looks around
I know she enjoys it, so I suck it up and smile
But fuck the stupid bitch. I just wanna see my child

Said, I just wanna see my...

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her
'Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
 
Fraulein, Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein
 
Fraulein, Fraulein
Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
",Fraulein
Don Walser,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

About a brand new dance that you gotta learn to do
It's called the oakie boogie, you do it oakie style

Long around about June

'Neath that old sugar moon

Gonna drop her a line
To expect me soon

Don Walser,"Now, listen while I tell you 'bout a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there alright
But they all go native on a Saturday Night

Their music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellah packs a gun
Ev'rybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

Well, now you've heard my story 'bout a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows

Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines

But they all go native on a Saturday night",Tennessee Saturday Night
Don Walser,"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

So always make me wonder
Always make me guess
And even if I ask you darling
Don't confess

Just let it remain me and your secret
But darling I love you so
No wonder, no wonder I wonder
No, I really don't want to know

Don Walser,"I stopped at a road house in Texas
A little place called hamburger dan's
I put a quarter in the jukebox
Play the truck drivin' man

The waitress she poured me some coffee
I thanked her and called her back again
I said this song sure does fit me
Cause I'm a truck drivin' man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a quarter in the jukebox
And play the truck drivin' man

I climbed up inside my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I had them old wheels rollin'
I'm on my way to San Antone

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a quarter in the jukebox
And play the truck drivin' man

Don Walser,"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like pedals when we part.

I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you taught how to cry.

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through,
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you,
I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart",Bouquet of Roses
Don Wilkerson,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Don Wilkerson,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Still live in my heart all alone

Don Williams,"It is only a paper moon
Hanging over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believe in me

It is only a canvas sky
Sailing over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make believe 
If you believe in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played 
On a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world

All the doors, are closed at night
Though I've tried ,to think of leaving
Goodbye isn't really good at all

If there were really something good to it
And I knew it wouldn't get me down
I could leave in the morning
But goodbye isn't really good at all

Here we are, alone together
That's the truth, and that's the lie
Though I try, I can't get over

That I didn't leave you a long time ago
But many mistakes are part of the story
And heartache by heartache I've turned you to stone

So call me a traveller, gonna catch me a train
I want to see Frisco feel the sun shine again
If you want true love you can't stand alone
A life here together has turned you to stone

I've held you captive in a life without sunshine
And I've watched the blue in your eyes fade away
All good is gone now, no need to continue
Destroying each other day after day

Last night I came home and found you there
You with your pretty eyes and shining hair
Look at you, you're the kind of woman men stop and stare
Such a lovely lady to be mine

Such a lovely lady should be somewhere else
It seems to me, the likes of me, isn't hard to find

Sometimes going home, though it's not fair
I stop and have a drink or two, see who's there
But when I do you're the kind of woman I just leave them there

When will I ever learn that you'll never care about me?
You only build me up to bring me down again
When will I ever learn that you'll use me and abuse me?
Oh, tell me; when will I ever learn?

When will I learn, when will I get wise; you never apologize
I swear that this time I'm through with you
Like the fool I am and the fool I'll be, the next time you need me

Whenever he walks through your mind
Stirring up memories that cloud up your eyes
Where the light of our love ought to shine

I know that he hurt you, hurt you so bad
He must have been going insane
Now I've finally learned how to hold you together
When somebody mentions his name

He's just a ghost story so don't let him scare you
He's not really there like he seems
And tonight when I hold you I'll hold you so close
I'll love him right out of your dreams

I know that he's called you
And told you that our love can't last
But don't you believe him cause honey he's wrong
He's never been right in the past

So don't let him haunt you and tell you those lies
He just can't admit that you're free
And the next time he calls you just hand me the phone
And see if he says it to me

He's just a ghost story so don't let him scare you
He's not really there like he seems
And tonight when I hold you I'll hold you so close
I'll love him right out of your dreams

Don Williams,"Silver coins that jingle jangle
Fancy shoes that dance in time
Oh the secrets of her dark eyes,
They did sing a gypsy rhyme

Yellow clover in tangled blossoms
In a meadow silky green
Where she held me to her bosom,
Just a boy of seventeen

I recall a gypsy woman
Silver spangles in her eyes
Ivory skin against the moonlight
And the taste of life’s sweet wine

Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows
And stir the darkness in my mind
Oh gentle woman you sleep beside me
Little know who haunts my mind

Gypsy lady I hear your laughter
And it dances in my head
While my tender wife and babies
Slumber softly in their beds",I Recall a Gypsy Woman

And the lines in her face say it all
But she still is a beautiful woman
In the lights of the Texas dance hall

But she won't sit down at your table
And I know that you can't hold her hand
She won't go home with you cowboy

Constantly I think about you constantly

Look at what you've done to me 
I'm just like a little baby
Oh I love you desperately",Desperately
Don Williams,"Cadillac smiles in the ladies' styles in this world
They ain't no part of me
A hundred dollar bill can cure your ills in this world
But it ain't no good to me

You see money and clothes are easily burned
People and cars are easily turned around
I'm looking for something that'll last me all of my life
I'm listening for the sound

I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine

A woman trying to find a diamond mine
Ain't my kind, she ain't no use to me
A big estate with a wrought-iron gate
A mansion on the hill, ain't where I wanna be

You see without love a house ain't a home
A diamond ain't no more than a stone in the ground
I'd give every material thing I own in this life
If I could just hear the sound

I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine

I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine

I wanna hear a heartbeat
I wanna hear a heartbeat
I wanna hear a heartbeat",Heartbeat in the Darkness
Don Williams,"There's a slow moon rising 
It's shining on your skin
The way your body moves me 
I know there's no holding back 
No holding back
I wouldn't be a man 
If I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man 
If a woman like you 
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet 
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man 
If I didn't feel like this

I can feel passion flowing 
As you fall into my arms
The secret way you touch me 
Tells me there's no holding back 
No holding back
I wouldn't be a man 
If I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man 
If a woman like you 
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet 
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man 
If I didn't feel like this

Roll with me, baby

Don Williams,"You can write your own ticket now
I'll get by without you somehow
Don't you worry 'bout what I'll do
I'll be fine without you

You say you think the change will do you good
If you feel that way well I guess it would
I can live my life without you
I've got places to go and things to do

But I'll never be in love again
My poor old heart will never mend
Oh I'll find someone to hold now and then
But I'll never be in love again

Something went wrong along the way
And there's nothing I can do to make you stay
Well I never tried to put holds on you
That's the last thing I'd ever want to do

So you go your way, I'll go mine
And if our paths should cross somewhere down the line
I'll just say hello and shake your hand
But if tears come to my eyes please understand",I'll Never Be in Love Again
Don Williams,"Some people say that love is a rose - and maybe they've hit
It right on the nose
But other folks say that it's like the sun
Well a long time ago daddy said to me 'son I'll help clear
Up the mystery - I'll give you a simple rule of thumb'

If it knocks you off your feet - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your life complete - then it's love - then it's love
If it turns you upside down - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love

Now the dictionary won't tell you much - if love is the word
You're lookin' up
No I don't believe that definition's right
And the encyclopedia won't reveal the crazy way you start
To feel - kissin' on a moonlit summer night cause

If it knocks you off your feet - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your life complete - then it's love - then it's love
If it turns you upside down - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love

So go on and say that love is a game - or maybe compare it
To a flame
Or say it's a medicine that heals
'cause a panel of experts could fight all night - and never
figure out which one is right
but they'd agree on how it makes you feel

If it knocks you off your feet - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your life complete - then it's love - then it's love
If it turns you upside down - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love

Yeah if it makes your world go round - then it's love
",Then It's Love
Don Williams,"There's a storm rollin' over the hill
And the willow trees are blowin'

And its a good feelin' I'm knowin'
Oh, I've got a good woman and we've got a good fire goin'

We've got a feast on the supper table

Don Williams,"I don't want the money I just want your time
Life without you honey isn't worth a dime
We can think of dollars farther down the line
I don't want the money I just want your time

An air-conditioned car won't ever cool my heels
I'd rather have your love than money for the bills
We don't need to stay with the Jonese's or the rest
Those things won't ever give me what I love the best

I don't want the money I just want your time

Don Williams,"Some people run some people crawl some people don't even move at all
Some roads lead forwards some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in light some wrapped in fearful black
Time oh time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go

Sometimes I'm satisfied sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold sometimes it's hot
At sunset I laugh at sunrise I cry at midnight I'm in between and wondering why

Time oh time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go",Time
Don Williams,"
I'm back on the road
Sometimes I don't know
It's hard to make good sense of it all

When I have to roam
My mind's back at home
Thinking of you there all alone

But we're doing well
Somehow I can tell
I really don't know
It's something I feel

'cause we've been making it strong
Each day right along
Though we both hate being alone

Chorus
It's gotta be magic
We're still in tune
There's good loving
Midnight or noon

It's gotta be magic
I know it's true
'cause it's still working
For me and you

We keep saying goodbye
We keep on wondering why
Though we both know it just has to be

Oh but honey the road
Can get to be such a load
You're all that helps me make it I know

Repeat Chorus 2x



",It's Gotta Be Magic
Don Williams,"Saturday evening, your honey and you
Lay back on the sofa watching the tube
The telephone rings, you jump to your feet
Don't answer that honey, I know it?s for me

Sneaking around, sneaking around
Midnight romances, the wrong side of town
You build it all up and you tear it all down
Ain't no good can come from your sneaking around

You put on your coat and sweetly you smile
You say you're gonna step out for a while
Down to the tavern for just one or two
She knows where you're going 'cause she ain't no fool

Sneaking around, sneaking around
Midnight romances, the wrong side of town
You build it all up and you tear it all down
Ain't no good can come from your sneaking around

It?s three in the morning as you stumble in
She ain't there to ask you where have you been
The house is all empty, she's nowhere around
She got too lonely from your sneaking around

Sneaking around, sneaking around
Midnight romances, the wrong side of town
You build it all up and you tear it all down
Ain't no good can come from your sneaking around

Sneaking around, sneaking around
Midnight romances, the wrong side of town
You build it all up and you tear it all down
Ain't no good can come from your sneaking around

With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head

Then he'd stagger a little as he went out the door

I can still hear the soft Southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me

Nothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does
But you ain't afraid if you're washed in the blood like I was
The smell of cape jasmine through the window screen
John R. and the Wolfman kept me company
By the light of the radio by my bed
With Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head

When I was in school I ran with kid down the street
But I watched him burn himself up on bourbon and speed
But I was smarter than most and I could choose
Learned to talk like the man on the six o'clock news
When I was eighteen, Lord, I hit the road
But it really doesn't matter how far I go",Some Broken Hearts Never Mend
Don Williams,"I want to be a worker I want to sing and pray
I never want to be a stumbling block along the way

They all have all the answers but they all have different ways

But we can sing glory hallelujah brother we can sing
If we put our hearts together and we pray
No one really has to tell us what to say maybe we can really find the way
Well I hope it comes together instead of all apart

'Cause the better things of living are written in our hearts
But on the stage this morning the trouble is the star
Happiness is measured by houses and our cars
But we can sing glory hallelujah...
But we can sing glory hallelujah...",We Can Sing

I'll never smile again
Not me, I'll never dance
I'll never love again

'Bout this life I live alone
And everything would be alright now

Another morning to face all alone.

Melodies turn into words nobody's ever said
When I'm alone the only thing I can say that's true
Is my nights are never blue

There's one that follows me around
It may sound funny
But somehow it only rains on me

But it only rains on me

Broken dreams and drowned parades
Lovers who just slip away
Guess I learn to live that way
It only rains on me

Seems to me there was a time
It used to rain on friends of mine
Now I look around and find
It only rains on me

I'll bet this won't hurt you much
You'll find someone soon enough
I'm the one that loses in love

Oh, and if you see Burt Reynolds
Would you shake his hand for me?

Well, I hope you make the big time 
I hope your dreams come true

Honey, I still do.

Last night I drove the truck to Amarillo 
Some friends and I had a laugh or two 
But lately we don't cut up like we used to 
'Cause all that I can think about is you 
I know this is what you've always wanted 
But I know now that all I want is you.

You may dream a dream that's twice your size, all night through
When the morning comes who's to tell your dreams to, only you

Only love, love only, only love, will do
Only love, love only, only love comes true
Nothing else you see, there's nothing else, only love, only love

I have known a love within my heart, one for you
When this love began right from the start, I never knew
If love should come your way you'd ever say, I love you, I love you

It?s getting deeper all the time
Standin? in a sea of teardrops
And every day I feel it rise

For every bit of pain you cause me
Another little tear falls down
Baby, if you hurt me one more time
I think I'm gonna drown

Right from the start I saw you
And couldn't resist you
But I guess my heart, somehow knew
The first time I kissed you

But it wasn't long till you did me wrong
And I felt the first tears begin
Oh, but that seems so long ago
I've cried an ocean since then

Standin? in a sea of teardrops

So many times, oh, you know
I've tried to leave you
You say you'll change, foolish me
I always believe you

Baby, but then you hurt me again
And there's not a thing I can do
I'm a sinkin? I know but I need you so
I guess I?ll go down lovin? you

WITH THE POZO SECO SINGERS
WRITER BOB DYLAN


Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Your temperature's too hot for taming,
Your flaming feet burn up the street.
I am homeless, come and take me
Into reach of your rattling drums.
Let me know, babe, about my fortune
Down along my restless palms.

Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast an' slashing,
An' your flashing diamond teeth.
The night is pitch black, come an' make my
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
Let me know, babe, I got to know, babe,
If it's you my lifelines trace.

I been wond'rin' all about me
Ever since I seen you there.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding,
I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where.
You have slayed me, you have made me,
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I got to know, babe, will I be touching you
So I can tell if I'm really real.

Don Williams,"I'LL TAKE YOUR LOVE AT ANYTIME BABY

I have seen this old, cold world go gold and silver crazy.
Some people live to fill their pocket and it never seizes to amaze me.
If money can buy them happiness, that o'right for them I guess.
Money sure can buy a lot, but it can't buy what I've got.

CHORUS:
I'll take your love at anytime baby
It's solid as a rock, bigger than the sky
I'll take your love at anytime baby
I know it will be there as time goes by

I know I can count on you to keep the juices flowing
This thing between a man and woman beats anything else going
Talk of fortune and talk about fame
It sounds nice is the way to tame




",I'll Take Your Love Anytime
Don Williams,"Love comes once they say
If it's the real thing
Me I feel that way
Knowing you must be there
Waiting for me somewhere
Some people say that I'm a fool
But I'm still looking for you.

Yes, I guess it's sad the lovers I've been through
Some I could have had
But they never were enough
Nobody measures up
Lovers and friends I've had a few
But I'm still looking for you.

Maybe it's wrong, I don't know
Maybe I'm just chasing rainbows
But its gotta be for ever when I fall
But lately my hopes have been sinking
Lately, I find I've been thinking
Maybe you're not really there at all.

Tears and years go by and I haven't found it
Seems the dream should die
But I hang on somehow
Still I keep reaching out
With all the loves that I've been through
I'm still looking for you",I'm Still Looking for You
Don Williams,"Another twenty miles and I'm halfway there,
Another twenty miles and I'm running scared
It's a beautiful night and I should be there

I know you are tired of waiting
And I know you are tired of hesitating

If love gets there before I do,
Darling don't you take it.
If love gets there before I do,
Darling don' t you do it, no don't you do it

I know you're hearing line from those other guys
Trying to wear you down under starry sky
But you know that I want you to just hold on

I know you are tired of waiting

Don Williams,"Well we've had our troubles, we've had our hard times
Were some might have stumbled, we've always survived
Sometimes love weakens, when the chips are all down
But what we've got together gets stronger somehow

(bridge)
Pressure makes Diamonds much harder than stone
And they only get finer as each day goes on
We've been through some bad times but we made it somehow
'cause if pressure makes diamonds, our love's a diamond by now

Well we know the feelin' when the world closes in
We've been there before, love, and we might go again
The road may get rocky life may get hard
But the whole world together can't tear us apart

The one I love forever doesnâ??t love me anymore. 
So here I am heartache.

I was lookin' for true love but I didn't get far before 
I tied all my heartstrings to some falling star. 
My only friend, wrong end of the rainbow again.
Between the winning and losing there's a very fine line. 
This time I felt like a winner, when I was losin' all the time.

When the night bird sings so blue
Trust was broken but hearts will heal
And I'll be faithful to you.

Where a promise won't hold true
Here's a vow you can be sure of
I'll be faithful to you

And she watched TV alone
Lately the nightlife doesn't do much for her
It's not that she's not pretty
She could have brought some cowboy home
But the last time that she did, it only bored her

Well she's tired of crowded places
Singles bars and strangers faces
And she knows there's something missing in her life

It's time for love she's had enough romance
It's time for love, she's tired of one-night stands
Anyone can see she's waited long enough
It's time for love she's had her moonlight nights
It's time for love, she's tired of neon lights
She's had everything else but now it's time for love

So she sits down at her mirror 
And she brushes out her hair 
She thinks about the men that she's let hold her
There were some that took her dancing, 
There were some that took her home 
But no-one ever took the time to know her 

And as the tears start falling, 
There's a voice inside her calling 
And she knows there must be something more than this.

You hope and pray the right one comes along
Some fools don't know what they've got till it's gone
The very one you think will never hurt ya
Always seems to be, the one that does
Whoa, that's the thing about love

Until you give it
You can never give it enough
Whoa, that's the thing about love

Naw, you can't have it

Deep in the feeling's with your heart all aglow

Don Williams,"You have your ways, I sure have mine
We have our days, things go just fine
Then there are days we?d leave if we could
Should we break it off when it?s not that good?

Fair weather minds need the sunshine
It has to show which way to go
But true blue hearts see through the dark
And keep our minds on days of sunshine

Each of us knows, try as we may
Those bad old days keep coming our way
We're digging in, there's just no retreat
Too many we know are down in defeat

With the cool blue mountain air.

I can understand your wanderlust.

Its refrigerator or bust.
I ain't got no words for going,
I got no longing for your open road.
Don't get found rollin' into town tugging on a heavy load.
You've gotta give me the nights with the city lights, and the people buzzin' everywhere.
One hand upon the parking meter, the other on her easy chair.
I'll send her roses, send her roses everyday.
If I don't go down another dirt road, I don't think it's gonna hurt my day.
I'll send her roses, send her roses once in awhile.

Got to singin' low for the first three rows, puttin' on a lousy show.
Well then I met her, I had to let her buy my lunch, I got the flowery plate.

Don Williams,"She packed up her suitcase and walked to the door
She said she won't come back like she's done before
I bet she's in Dallas before it gets dark

But she never knew me she never knew me she never knew me at all
She know I love her I know I need her
God knows to please her I've tried and I've tried

By now if I know her she's changed her mind
She'll pull off the highway and have a good cry

Don Williams,"My daddy told me when I was a young girl
A lesson he learned, it was a long time ago
If you want to have someone to hold onto
You're gonna have to learn to let go

You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart
If you want it to work

Now here is the one thing I keep forgettin'
When everything is falling apart
In life as in love, you know I need to remember
There's such a thing as trying too hard

You got to dance like nobody's watchin'

All she wants is all my love and for that I'm an easy touch
I'm an easy touch I love her she don't know how much
I just can't resist she wants she gets

Don Williams,"Looking back over my life I can see where I caused you strife
But I know yes I know I'd never make that same mistake again
Looking back over my deeds I can see signs of wise man heeds
But if I just have a chance I'd never make that same mistake again

Once my cup was overflowing I gave nothing in return
Now I can begin to tell you what a lesson I have learned

Don Williams,"He's got a US flag on his front porch to remind everyone where he lives
And up in the attic there are papers that prove the old house is finally his
After thirty five years the grass still don't grow in that rock hard west Texas ground
Where my old dad still clings to that old coyote town
Like horses the pickups are parked out in front of a cafe that don't need a name

Where the old men rock as the tumbleweeds roll
Pass the boarded up windows down Main
Waist high weeds hide a forsale sign at the drive-in where my innocence died
With a rusty advertisement dangling by a nail says popcorn and pepsi for a dime

And down at the depot where I left for good
There's a hobo and his three legged hound
Waitin' for a train that no longer comes to that old coyote town

And the interstate rumbles like a river that runs
To a rhythm that don't ever slow down
As cars and trucks and time pass by that old coyote town
Daddy falls asleep in the living room on the sofa with the TV on

Sometimes he waits for a phone call from me sometimes he waits too long
But I still think of people and the place that he loves
How much longer will they be around
'Til it's aches to aches dust to dust for that old coyote town

Like horses the pickups are parked out in front of a cafe that don't need a name
Where the old men rock as the tumbleweeds roll
Pass the boarded up windows down Main
And the interstate rumbles like a river that runs

To a rhythm that don't ever slow down
As cars and trucks and time pass by that old coyote town
God bless that old coyote town",Old Coyote Town
Don Williams,"Some days I seem so far away from where I want to be
And the things that I've accomplished seem so small
When I'm weary of the struggle and I feel I can't go
You love me through it all
Your love gives me a balance when I'm standing on the edge
You keep me going when my dreams have stalled
And you're always building bridges even when I'm building walls
You love me through it all

Sometimes I come home bragging bout the things I've done that day
Like a thing that I'm on top and cannot fall
And when I'm high on my successes thinking only of myself
You love me through it all

Through it all you're there to comfort me you keep my feet on solid ground
I know that I can make it as long as you're around
Your love gives me a balance",You Love Me Through It All

As I give this heart of mine
To a new love I hope will never end

Shoves a plug of redman in his jaw
His eyes stretch cross the valley

The Washington says how much he can grow
There's a bank note in his pocket
That says in thirty days they'll have his home

Learning skills that'll get him off the farm
And his wife just keeps it all inside
Still he finds his only comfort in her arms

Oh how could an auction measure its true worth
And every night he asks the father
That he may never lose this mother earth

With a soft voice & kind intentions
He said son you know you're too young to cry

Learn to let it go, so you don't miss the one waiting to be found

Are we winning, are we losing, are we tied?
What's the score? It ain't what it was before
Can anybody tell me what's the score?

I hurt you and you hurt me
Seems we both just try to see
How far we can push each other's hearts
And it's a never ending game

Where the rules don't stay the same
And the more we play
The more we're forced apart

What's the score? I can't tell anymore
Are we winning, are we losing, are we tied?
What's the score? It ain't what it was before
Can anybody tell me what's the score?

I forgive and you do too
Seems that's all we ever do
And I'm not sure who's turn it is today
I break your heart, you break mine
We're about to cross the line
Where the game of loves no longer fun to play

The world never took much notice of me
I've never been good at conversation
I was too busy tripping on my own feet

I've never had grand illusions
Love was always for someone else
But in a world so few surprises
There's still a few surprises left

Ain't it amazing that miracles happen?
Ain't it amazing, you can still find your dream?
Ain't it amazing, it all comes true
When someone like you can happen to someone like me?

So hold me now so warm beside you
Let me stay forever near
Sometimes I think I'm only dreaming
But I wake up, you're still here

[Chorus]
Oh and heaven help me here I go again
Before I've even had the time for this old heart to mend
Oh I just get over one heartache and then
Here I go, like a fool, falling again

Don Williams,"I don't believe in superstars
Organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold

That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west
And being first is always best.

But I believe in love, I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad, and I believe in you.

Well I don't believe that heaven waits
For only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love
He's down below, He's up above
He's watching people everywhere
He knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man
Sometimes I wonder who I am.

But I believe in love, I believe in music
I believe in magic, and I believe in you.

I know with all my certainty what's goin'
With you and me is a good thing
It's true, I believe in you.

I don't believe virginity is
As common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights
That black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robin Hood
Are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply
The rising cost of getting by.

I believe in children, I believe in you.

I can almost hear my pleading, on the night you were leaving
But I might have well have tried to stop the rain

The blowing wind that moans outside my window
Seems to echo the closing of a door
For it was then I first realized, I had heard your last goodbye
And my whole world went crumbling to the floor

You get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.

Night after night I've tried holding you tight and then I'll stay away.
I've tried holding your hand, being your man and just anyway.
When it comes down to feelings it's always the same old song ,
My poor hearts just reeling but you act like something's wrong.

Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.

If I could cry, bring a tear to your eye, maybe that's the way.
'Cause were in the strains of living your pains from yesterday.
Really got to keep on growing, looking for the brighter day.
Like the water that keeps on flowing well I just can't stay away.

You get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.
Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.

That's what it does with a kiss
I'm not the man that I just was

When I was young and my daddy was gone 
I'd go to sleep with the radio on
And sometimes they'd played such a beautiful song
Me and the sandman would sing all night long

When you just whispered my name
I'm not the man that I just was 
Nothing about me's the same

Darlin' by this time tomorrow 
There's no telling who I might be
Your love just keep changin' me
And I've come to think that

And in the best breeze 
It still cannot take flight

It runs like a river between a woman and man
But it's course can get twisted 
It's bed can run dry

And a heart become desert in the wink of an eye
Once there was loving once there was trust
Once it was honest and open and just
Our love was a diamond that grew between us

But time can turn even diamonds to dust
Diamonds to dust oh diamonds to dust 
Time can turn even diamonds to dust

Uh huh uh huh
Time is a teacher it's kind and it's cruel
It gives you the wisdom to see you're a fool
And it gives love and takes love 

It hurts and it heals
And it never parts easy with the truth it reveals

Don Williams,"I'm back on the street again
Got to stand on my own two feet again
I'm walking that lonely beat again
Remembering when, whoa, whoa, remembering when

Got a tear in my eye again
To remind me that I might cry again
Feeling sad and wondering why again
Remembering when, whoa, whoa, remembering when

I remember a time when I thought the world was mine
The world belongs to somebody else now
And I'm just standing in line

So I'm thinking of me again
That's the way it?s got to be again
I?ll wait and I?ll see till then

Don Williams,"Not that long ago, I was on the run
People telling me I should be someone
And the things I?d learnt were forgotten in my haste
Till I reached the end of the rainbow I had chased

It was only water shining in thin air
I put out my hand and there was nothing there
After all the promise, after all the prayer
It was only water shining in the air

Now I've got a wife and she sees me through
And I've got a friend I can talk straight to
And I've got some dreams just a bit more down to earth
And I don't forget what a rainbow's really worth

'Cause it?s only water shining in the air
I put out my hand and there was nothing there
After all the promise, after all the prayer
It was only water shining in the air

If you want fame and fortune
Then you just be my guest
If you want to pay those dues
I wish you all the best

But it?s only water shining in the air
I put out my hand and there was nothing there
After all the promise, after all the care
It was only water shining in the air
It was only water shining in the air

And me a dirt farmer who lives by the river
But she said she loved me and the free life I owned

We married in April and lived by the river we worked that land from spring till the fall
But I guess when the winter howled at our window
She couldn't help hearing that wild river call

Thirty years of coffee cups and sore feet
The mountains around Ashville she's never seen the other side
Closer now to fifty than to forty

Maggie's never had a love
She said she's never had enough
Time to let a man into her life
Aw but Maggie has a dream
She's had since she was seventeen 
To find a husband and be a wife

Maggie knows the truckers most by first name
What they'll have to say and what they'll order
And they take her in their stories to places far away
And leave her with the dishes, dreams and quarters

When the business starts to slow down she plays the saddest tunes
And she stares off down the highway and she wonders where it goes

Don Williams,"If you could read my mind love, 
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie, 
'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet,
You know that ghost is me.
And I will never be set free, 
As long as I'm a ghost you can't see.
If I could read your mind love,
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel, 
The kind the drugstore sell
When you reach the part 
Where the heartaches come
The hero would be me, 
Heroes often fail
And you won't need that book again, 
Because the ending's just too hard to take.

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a freeway script, 
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene, 
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now love let's be real, 
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back.
If you could read my mind love, 
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie,

With chains upon my feet, 
The story always ends
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.

A man was killed underneath the town hall light
There were few at the scene but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""Son what is your alibi?""
If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die
Well I spoke not a word though it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friends wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows nobody seems nobody knows but me
The scaffold is high an eternity nears
She stood in the crowd shed not a tear

But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
She comes to my grave and she cries on my bones

Album: Flatland

Give me too many bad signs,
I'll be gone and I can tell you why
Right or wrong that's just the way I am
I'm not looking for sympathy, we either do or we don't agree
All I need to know is where I stand

So it's comin' right down to you,
I wanna stay.if you want me to
But I don't wanna waste your time,
So I don't want you wastin' mine

When the sun's sinkin' low, I get so restless
Should I stay or go, that is the question
I really need to feel that you'll never
Leave me alone, maybe that's all I really need to know

Maybe I get too impatient, when I sense your reservations
I guess I'm, just scared you'll say goodbye
'cause I would hope I've let you know what it's like inside your love
I pray it lasts for more than just awhile

So it's time to make up your mind either way I will survive
Not knowing is enough for me to ride away
With a broken dream

When the sun's sinkin' low, I get so restless
Should I stay or go, that is the question
I really need to feel that you'll never
Leave me alone, maybe that's all I really need to know

Are you only sleepin to wake another day

Don Williams,"I thought I'd be an angel
And fly on astral skies
I thought I'd wear a fanciful disguise
And It's taken me a lotta time
To find out I'm not one
An outlaw on the run,
On this side of the sun.

I hoped I'd be a champion
And live without a care
I thought I'd change the world,
Make it just and fair
But my youth slipped by before my eyes
Much to my surprise
Before I had begun,
On this side of the sun.

Out on this end of the wind
Winter's coming 'round the bend
You pray for rain, before you know,
You're standin' in a foot of snow
So you pull your coat up to your chin
Pick your shovel up again
'Cause your work is never done,
On this side of the sun.

I took it to a fortune teller
I thought that she might help me
She looked into my eyes
And smiled mysteriously
But she didn't know as much as me
I stared back, dejectedly
'Cause I know where she's from,
This side of the sun.

Out behind these prison walls,
Dark clouds come and hard rains fall
You pause a moment for a dream,
They row you gently down the stream
You wake up angry in the night,
Jump up, ready for the fight
But the war is never won
On this side of the sun.

Now they tell me music
Can free a person's soul
So I sing a song everywhere I go
But It's not much different than before

I wonder if there is one,
On this side of the sun...",This Side of the Sun

One minute we're here and the next we're gone
And with each breath of life that is given to us
We should only have time for love

So tell me what can be gained by fussing and fighting
The answer is left up to us
I think it's time we learned enough is enough
Oh we should only have time for love

Sometimes I'm unwilling to open my eyes
Just too stubborn to compromise
When you stand your ground oh there's no backing down
That makes for a long bitter fight

And you know it's such a waste to engage in that
Tearing each other down in a tit for tat
When we could be hard at work building a trust

Traced her footsteps down to the shore;
Afraid she's gone forever more.

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say:
I took your baby from you, away.
I heard a voice crying in the deep:
Come join me baby, in my endless sleep.

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea;
That's why my baby is gone from me.

Had some coffee and talked with some old friends of mine
Laughing at the good times they remembered
Then I remembered a time

Lord I can still see the bright lights back in Dallas
As yesterday moves like a dream through my mind
I didn't suppose that I'd ever forget her

I'm gonna see you in your grave.""

There are times it gets so hard for me
Don't ever make me feel you've left me wishin'
Don't ever make me feel you're not with me

I place none above
Your sweet love, love, love

Don Williams,"Well he spent that summer walkin' door to door
With a can of gas and an ol' lawn mower
That's a sure fire way to make a buck when you're fourteen

Well he made a buck with no luck at all
Then he spotted a place where the weeds were tall
With a young girl sitting on the front porch eating ice cream

Deep in the pocket of his grass stained jeans
Was some caramel corn and a plastic ring
Leftover from the week before
Momma didn't wash them, thank the Lord

Just like a Cracker Jack Diamond
You never know when you're gonna find one
They found love from that day on
The hand of fate put them together
Their hearts will stay forever young
Like a Cracker Jack Diamond

Well it's been five years since he gave her his prize
Now the sparkle's gone, but not in their eyes
And he's wanting to tell her what's been on his mind lately

He said, ""Girl, I ain't rich but I've been saving up
A little ever day 'til I had enough""
Before he could finished she said, ""You know I will, baby""

Deep in the pocket of his holy jeans
Was money for the preacher and a diamond ring
He took her back to that old front porch
Slipped it on her finger and he thank the Lord

Just like a Cracker Jack Diamond
You never know when you're gonna find one
They found love from that day on
The hand of fate put them together
Their hearts will stay forever young
Like a Cracker Jack Diamond

Now once a year she takes it out but it won't fit her hand
But she wears it in her heart
Because that's where it all began

Don Williams,"Everybody comes with baggage
Places and people before
You don't know what all you're getting
When love walks through your door, through your door

I've had some hills and some valleys
You've done some traveling too
You can tell by the dents and the scratches
Our hearts aren't exactly brand new

From now on is all that counts
From now on is all that matters
That's what living's all about
From different roads we find each other
You're the only love I want, from now on

I'm thankful for the ones before me
I'm grateful that they didn't stay
We can't do a thing about it
And it's made us who we are today

From now on is all that counts
From now on is all that matters
That's what living's all about
From different roads we find each other
You're the only love I want, from now on

Oh, from now on is all that counts
From now on is all that matters

You're the only love I want, from now on

Don Williams,"Break us down by our elements and you might think he failed
We're not copper for one penny or even iron for one nail
And a dollar would be plenty to buy twenty of us
Until true love is added to these handfuls of dust

Handful of dust, handful of dust
Sums up the richest and poorest of us
True love makes priceless the worthless
Whenever it's added to a handful of dust

However small though our worth may be when shared between two hearts
Is even more than it would ever be, measured on its own apart
And our half what it could be is now twice what it was
When true love is added to these handfuls of dust

Handful of dust, handful of dust
Sums up the richest, poorest of us
True love makes priceless the worthless
Whenever it's added to a handful of dust

Handful of dust, handful of dust
Sums up the richest, poorest of us
True love makes priceless the worthless

Don Williams,"HARRY AND JOE
WRITERS LEN HANDLER, A.J. GUNDELL

Harry and Joe move south with their wives
Enjoying the golden years of their lives
But life doesn't always give back what it owes
Suddenly there was just Harry and Joe

Now Joe'd been a teacher gentile and calm
Harry, a teamster with a fuse like a bomb
Thrown in together by life's crazy whims
That pepper and salt like their unshaven chins

CHORUS:
Harry and Joe lean to and fro
They lean on each other wherever they go
Two lonely fighters doing all that they know
To get through each day Harry and Joe

Harry and Joe, cheating at cards
In a Florida apartment that smells like cigars
They brag about grand kids and the wives they love so
In the late afternoons of Harry and Joe

Don Williams,"I remember how we struggled when we first started out
She recalls, we had it all, not what we did without
I think back on those hard times, she remembers only love
Well, who am I to say, that's not exactly how it was?

That's how she remembers it, she was the lucky one
Just take a look at both of us and you tell me who won
If she thinks I hung the stars, if that's what she believes
Then who am I to tamper with her perfect memory?

You ought to hear her tell the kids how mom and daddy met
It always amazes me, the things that she forgets
Somehow she gets it turned around but it's still my favorite part
How mommy looked in daddy?s eyes and I stole away her heart

That's how she remembers it, she was the lucky one
Just take a look at both of us and you tell me who won
If she thinks I hung the stars, if that's what she believes
Then who am I to tamper with her perfect memory?
If I made her dreams come true as far as she can see
Who am I to tamper with her perfect memory?",Her Perfect Memory

And humbly I answered each rising and falling
I will not surrender at this wiser and tender age

And I sing for Joy
For the smile that it brings, from the heart
Through these guitar strings
It was only noise, till her love put a song
In the soul of this good ole boy

When I was lonely, my angel found me
She sweetly and gently wrapped her arms around me
And the demons that chased me, gave up and faded away
Now I can sing

For the smile that it brings, from the heart

The time we're together grows dearer and dearer
When I must travel and I have to leave her alone

Pancho, to me our friendship means more
Pancho, please forget what I said
'Cause Pancho we're headin' towards our end

I remember the first time when you came to town
Speaking in Spanish making the rounds
When you first saw me your face was agrin
And you called me the Cisco Kid

Pancho, don't you like me no more?
Pancho, to me our friendship means more
Pancho, please forget what I said
'Cause Pancho we're headin' towards our end

I said someday you'll be happy with me Pancho

I remember the good times when you loved me so
I gave you my hat and wore your sombrero
And all of the times you saved me from death
Oh Pancho, you were the best

I had a black horse, you had a gray
My horse was fastest but yours did okay
When it came to chasin' rustlers we'd always win
'Cause we were Pancho and the Cisco Kid

Oh Pancho, we're headin' towards our end

Don Williams,"Peggy Sue rode away last night, on a rocking horse
Straight into the pale moonlight, make believe of course
But what's a little girl of eight 
Supposed to do when she's up so late

She can't sleep 'cause it sounds like hate
Coming from her momma and daddy's room

[Chorus]
Ride on, ride on
Out to where it don't hurt no more
Ride on, come on
Back to how it was before
Your momma left and your daddy cussed

All they ever seem to do is fuss, ride on
Tommy Lee's got a space machine, 
He keeps it ready on the launching pad

'Cause there've been times that he has seen, 
An alien invade his dad
So he heads out for the stars
Past the moon and straight to Mars

But what about the invisible scars
That come in a bottle that his daddy brings home

Ride on, ride on

Some people act like some people, they never thought they'd be

The only antidote, The only way to cope
The only true hope is love
So everybody won't you,

An' I heard Momma say what goes on here stays

Or could it be we just didn't try

The seeds that we scattered are all parched and blown

Safe and warm

And its a good feelin' I'm knowin'
Oh, I've got a good woman and we've got a good fire goin'

We've got a feast on the supper table

Don Williams,"I would pick and we would sing to the rhythm of that front porch swing
The moonlight holds the spotlight that we shared
I found new notes on that old guitar, she believed I could be a star
She told me that she wanted to be fair

She said, I love you more than to hold you down, boy you`re glory bound
We can`t share a world with different dreams
So I chased mine and she found hers too, but someone else made hers come true
Now I`m a star, but every time I sing

My heart goes drifting down a dusty Dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the Dixie road.

Every night I`m in a different place and I`m searching every stranger`s face
Trying to find the girl that`s just not there
She`s back there in Montgomery and I`m clear across the country
But whenever I`m alone I go back there.

My heart goes drifting down a dusty Dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the Dixie road.",Dixie Road

If I never say the words you want to hear 
When I hold you near 
Maybe they get said another way 
A kiss can mean as much to me as words could ever do 
You know I live for you 
You shouldn't ever doubt how I feel about you

Don't underestimate my love for you, darlin' 
It's always there, it's just the way care 
If you believe in me, then show more faith in us 
Don't underestimate my love

Don Williams,"It's over, I left the door unlocked again
But this time someone new walked in
While she was all alone

And he told her that there was much more life to see
Than she would ever see with me
Now she's going, going, gone

It's over, I never thought I'd see this day
When everything would walk away
That I depended on God, he'll hold her

To make sure she don't change her mind
I've lost her all the way this time
She's going, going, gone

I should have paid attention, there were many warning signs
But I just never thought she'd walk away
Here I stand in silence, just an echo of the words
I heard her say

She said, it's over and much too late to change her mind
I've lost her all the way this time
She's going, going, gone
","Going, Going, Gone"

Oh it tears me up when you go all to pieces
Your cryin' eyes say you've been hurt enough
Tryin' hard don't always make it easy
Cause hearts aren't made to break, they're made to love

Lately all I do is think about you
It's weighin' like a stone inside my mind
I know I've taken you for granted
And left your heart hangin' on the line

Before the mornin' paper, before the coffee's on
There ain't much movin' in the world outside
Oh, I'd love to take a mornin' ride

My baby knows, it's the time we share
She wakes me gently and brushes back her hair
And she moves into my arms, sweet and slow
I can't wait to get up and go

Gonna take my baby on a mornin' ride
When the sun comes slippin' 'round the mountain side
'Bout an hour, maybe two
Ain't nothin' me and her would rather do

Than see the green grass glist'nin' in the mornin' dew
While the world is still damn spankin' new
Oh, I know how beautiful the day will be
When she takes a mornin' ride with me

And when we get back, it will feel so right
To just lay back and linger in the mornin' light
Then she'll smile at me, thinkin' where we've been
Wantin' me to take her again

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Don Wilner,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Don Wise,"(I need someone to say I do)
No one to cry to now, no one to say goodnight
No one to tell my troubles to

I've got no one, to sigh to, no one to hold me
Tight
No one to cheer me when I'm blue

When I go home to my lonely room
And find there's no one there
And each night I think of you, so please answer this
One prayer

And you'll need someone, I said to cry to
Someone to say I do
Someone to whisper I love you

Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Donald Byrd,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies

Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much

Don't sigh and gaze at me

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Donald Byrd,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Donald Byrd,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come

Donald Fagen,"Those trucks in the street, is it really Monday?
Time to find some trouble again
Make a bid for romance while the dollar stands a chance
Dumb love in the city at century's end

We tap to this line, dancing on a mirror
There's no disbelief to suspend
It's the dance, it's the dress, she's a concept more or less
Dumb love in the city at century's end

At century's end
Nobody's holding out for heaven
It's not for creatures here below
We just suit up for a game
The name of which we used to know
It might be careless rapture

This kid's got the eye, call it pirate radar
Scooping out the roof for some trend
But there's nobody new, so she zeros in on you

At century's end
Nobody's holding out for heaven
It's not for creatures here below
We just suit up for a game
The name of which we used to know
By now it's second nature

Scratch the camera, we can grab the locals
Let's get to the love scene, my friend
Which means look, maybe touch but beyond that not too much

Donald Fagen,"If I had my way
I would move to another lifetime
I'd quit my job
Ride the train through the misty nighttime
I'll be ready when my feet touch ground
Wherever I come down
And if the folks will have me
Then they'll have me

Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from

I can hear your words
When you speak of what you are and have seen
I can see your hand
Reaching out through a shining daydream
Where the days and nights are not the same
Captured happy in a picture frame
Honey I will be there
Yes I'll be there

Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from

I got this thing inside me
That's got to find a place to hide me
I only know I must obey
This feeling I can't explain away

I think I'll go to the park
Watch the children playing
Perhaps I'll find in my head
What my heart is saying
A vision of a child returning
A kingdom where the sky is burning
Honey I will be there
Yes I'll be there

Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from",Any World
Donald Fagen,"I recall when I was small 
How I spent my days alone 
The busy world was not for me 
So I went and found my own 
I would climb the garden wall 
With a candle in my hand 
I'd hide inside a hall of rock and sand 
On the stone an ancient hand 
In a faded yellow-green 
Made alive a worldly wonder 
Often told but never seen 
Now and ever bound to labor 
On the sea and in the sky 
Every man and beast appeared 
A friend as real as I 

[Chorus]
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall 
When there wasn't even any Hollywood 
They heard the call 
And they wrote it on the wall 
For you and me we understood 

Can it be this sad design 
Could be the very same 
A wooly man without a face 
And a beast without a name 
Nothin' here but history 
Can you see what has been done 
Memory rush over me 
Now I step into the sun 

[Chorus]",The Caves of Altamira
Donald Fagen,"Charlie Freak had but one thing to call his own 
Three weight ounce pure golden ring no precious stone 
Five nights without a bite 
No place to lay his head 

And if nobody takes him in 
He'll soon be dead
On the street he spied my face I heard him hail 
In our plot of frozen space he told his tale 

Poor man, he showed his hand
So righteous was his need 
And me so wise I bought his prize 
For chicken feed

Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind 
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind 
Poor kid, he overdid
Embraced the spreading haze 

And while he sighed his body died 
In fifteen ways

When I heard I grabbed a cab to where he lay 
'Round his arm the plastic tag read D.O.A. 
Yes Jack, I gave it back
The ring I could not own 

Now come my friend I'll take your hand 
And lead you home",Charlie Freak

You drive the fellas wild,
When you shake your booty,
Ghetto style.

You're a hunk of raw sugar,
Got some real sweet hips,
Your love, your love, your love,
Is like a honey drip.

Your roots are in the mean streets,

Stay the same.

Don't forget to give honour where honour is due.
Don't forget to give thanks to the One who put you there.

Get up on your feet,
Why do we change?

Get a little fortune and fame,
Sign a title to your name,
Why do we change?

Who were blessed by the Lord
And went on their way.
Except one came back with gratitude,
We've got to give honour where it is due.

It lives beyond the senses,
You can't see it, you can't feel it, you just have it.

But I'm standing on what The Word says.

When I do what God told me to...
For the rest of my life I'm not making sense,
I'm making faith.

But I walk by faith Don't know how I'm gonna live there.
But the just shall live by faith Can't even see the purpose that's waiting there.
But I trust the author of my faith.
And when people ask how I'm gonna do,
When I do what God told me to
For the rest of my life I'm not making sense,

By The Word the worlds were framed
For that which is seen
Hath not come from what appears in the scene

God is the author and finisher of your faith
Stay In Faith You may not know how your gonna get there
But just walk by faith
You may not know how your gonna live there
But the just shall live by faith
You can't even see the purpose that's waiting there

Donald O'Connor,"Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Jingle all the way!

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

One day these could be the days but who could have known 
Loading in the back of a pickup truck 
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck 
Singing songs loud on the way to the game 
Wishing all the things could still be the same 
Chinese home runs over the backstop 
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well... 

We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 

Sunday morning and it's time to go 
Been raining all night so everybody knows 
Over to the field for tackle football 
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball 
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring 
Keep on rolling, never boring 
Karma, karma, karma chameleon 
We're talking kinda funny from helium 

Well

We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 

Monday morning and it's time to go 
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes 
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues 
Like driving a padiddle with a burnt-out fuse 
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
So meet her by the sugar mill after school

That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

With a pink carnation and a pickup truck

In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield

'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage

Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight

But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed

And they're showing me ways to go
And I never want to lose their inspiration

I know that it's time for a cool change

And sometimes I don't care
I know it may sound selfish
But let me breathe the air

Let me breathe the air...
Well I was born in the sign of water
And it's there that I feel my best
The albatross and the whales they are my brothers

When you're out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon, like a lover

Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened there?

Some were spellbound, some were hell bound
Some they fell down and some got back up
And fought back against the melt-down
And their kids were hippie chicks or hypocrites

With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up

Put away the crack before the crack put you away

Donell Jones,"This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

As I step on the scene, yo I'm steady maxin'
And I call up my boys 'cause I'm looking for some action
We need to kick it like we use to
Back in the days when we were known as the crazy crew
It's good to reminisce on the old days
When we use to kick it with the G's and the homies
I would go back, yo if I could
This is for my peoples that still roll around in the hood

This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

Heads up on the ride she's a hottie
All the fellas break wide to summer bunnies
That's the way that we flex, yeah
Everyday on the O.G set
But keep it smoove
I keep it smoove on a move spit to the hotties
On a late night move to flex their bodies
That's the way that we hang
On a regular doing our own thang

This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

This is for the playas in the hood, up to no good
As we're rolling around, and we're doing our thang
This is for the playas in the hood, up to no good
As we're rolling around, and we're doing our thang

This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

Why you want to play around with my heart
You make me feel like you care
Why you want to play around with my heart
My love was there i thought that you cared

Until that day you turned and walked away
Your love was special to me
My heart has fallen apart and i know
That you're the one to blame
You said the love would never change
Then you go out and play

[Chorus]

I never knew that you could put me through
All the pain tha i feel, yeah
Saying sorry won't make it right
'Cause it will never be the same you're the one to blame
Tell me why

Tell me why you're living a lie
You never really loved me, baby
And now my heart is falling apart
You should have told me from the start
That you would break my heart, baby

Donell Jones,"She's got a man  another situation

I understand that's how it's got to be

Ain't trying to cause her no complications

I'd walk away but I'm in too deep



1   I can't make no plans  got me so frustrated

Cause in my heart I want you desperately

Done ran away from all the girls I've been dating

When I'm with them  it's only you I see

And she promised me that it would take some time

But she would leave him alone

And the thought of her loving only me

That's the thing that keeps me strong



2 - She gives me all her love

But only half the time

Still it's more than enough

To keep my hope alive



Just yesterday I saw them shopping at the mall

Looked like she tried on a diamond ring

The way he held her down, it drove me crazy

Spent half the day wishing that it was me



Repeat 1



Repeat 2



A secret rondavu, just to spend time with you

Girl I need you in my life

And if I had to choose, the thought would still be you

Just as long as she give me all her love



Repeat 2



She gives me all her love

And it's enough for me cause I'm never gonna leave, and

She gives me all love

And it's enough for me cause I'm never gonna leave, and

Ooh said I'm never gonna leave

I've been getting all your love, half the time, oh no

Hmm, whoa
Check it out

Sitting at the light she pulled up on my right
Looking in the mirror making sure her shit was tight
I know she felt me watching but was scared to look my way
I know she wants to look, but I think I got her shook

Under pressure, don't know what to do
She's got two cuties with her and I got my peoples too
She put it in one, stepped on the gun, and made a you
Looked inside, gave me a smile, then she blew, what am I gonna do

Tell me, which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin' had me open from the door
Tell me, have you seen her?

She had a smile that I couldn't forget
Shinning brighter than the floss piece around her neck
The girl was so fine I just gotta make her mine
Tell me, have you seen her? Have you seen her?

It's been a while now, and I'm steady on the case
Everyday I'm looking for her face
It's like a dream to me, and I gotta make it real
Gotta let her know just how I feel

Now there she goes again, driving by
I hit my horn she throws her beams on high
I put my joy in it, and I tried to give chase
She disappears again without a trace
Tell me, have you seen her?

Tell me, which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin' had me open from the door
Tell me, have you seen her?

She had a smile that I couldn't forget
Shinning brighter than the floss piece around her neck
The girl was so fine, I just gotta make her mine
Tell me, have you seen her? Have you seen her?

I've gotta find her
Where did you go, babe?
Hmm, listen

Girl you seem to think you got away from me
You got me looking for you in all these busy streets
I must admit, I got a thang for you
It's just a little test of all the things I'll do for you

Tell me, which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin' had me open from the door
Tell me, have you seen her?

She had a smile that I couldn't forget
Shinning brighter than the floss piece around her neck
The girl was so fine, I just gotta make her mine
Tell me, have you seen her? Have you seen her?

[Chorus:]
 
No more lies 
Baby things done change 
I'm not the man I used to be 
I gotta look out for me 
And after all that we've been through 
I can't believe that you would think 
That I could love you 
 
Oh!! 
Things done change 
And my life just ain't the same 
And you been tryin'to come back home to me 
That ain't gonna happen 

[Chorus:]",When I Was Down
Donell Jones,"I said I left my baby girl a message
Saying I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
That I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she give me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time
To be alone

But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be
Where I want to be

Sweet little do-dee-do-dee
I don't mean to hurt you baby, oh no
Never did I imagine
That you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go
I think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone
But I have to find what life is like
Without you

But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be
Where I want to be

Sweet little do-dee-do-dee
I don't mean to hurt you baby

See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be

See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be

See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be

Where I want to be

I'm sorry baby",Where I Wanna Be
Donell Jones,"I remember when we used to love
It seems like yesterday
You know that I understand
But I wish that you could stay
But you live far away, seem so far away

Now I can't wait until the summertime
I know, you'll be coming back real soon
Baby, you know how much I'm missin' you
Said, I'm missin' you, I'm missin' you

I been thinking about you lady
Things ain't been the same since you've been gone
I can't live without you lady
So won't you come back, come back?

No matter how long it takes, I'll wait for you
As I watch the seasons pass me by
God only knows that there's no mountains I won't climb
'Cuz you stay in my heart and always on my mind

Life without you is just an empty world, yeah
What once was clear is now a blur
And this is something that I can't ignore
I'm missing you, I'm missing you

I been thinking about you lady
Things ain't been the same since you've been gone
I can't live without you lady
So won't you come back, come back?

Said, I been waiting
Love I just can't live without
Oh yeah
Instead I've been

I been thinking about you lady
Things ain't been the same since you've been gone
I can't live without you lady

Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
Its like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters 
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on

Since the day that I got locked up
My life's been different, oh yeah, 
cause she was my soul, my heart, my love, my best friend
I can't understand why, 
She won't accept my phone calls
Should of knew something was wrong 
When mama said ""baby its time for you to move on""
Now that everything I had, is gone

See I never thought that you would
Leave me dry and all alone
'cause part of the reason I sit where I am
I was tryin to provide a home
Now I know that I'm not going to be there
Like I used to
But your promise to me 
Was that you never would leave
And that remains to be seen
I guess everything I had is lost and gone

See I had it all,
When I was on the streets
I gave you everything

Now that I'm locked away
With no where to turn
Now you want to up and run

She was looking hot from her head to the floor
The kind of body make me want see more

Or do we just turn back or try to pretend
We're nothing more than friends, it's too late for that
She used to be my girlfriend
I wish I woulda known then
Then I wouldn't have pushed up 
When she rolled up shorty want to get swold up
She used to be my girlfriend
I wish I woulda known then
Then I wouldn't have much to lose
But now I'm starting all over again

Something about her seems so familiar
Like we met somewhere before
The way that she looked at me it's all coming back to me
I see it clearly now you got me bugging out
I was post up at the light now curtie through start it
Two short's and a baby Benz looking like they want it
One was her and one was you, what do I do she was shooting me vibes
And you was playing cute

I would've never spent the time
I would've never tried to push up on her
Even though she was so fine
I would've never took her number
I would've never gave her mine
I should've known that you'd start trippin'
Thinking I knew it all the time

She used to be my girlfriend
I wish I woulda known then
Then I wouldn't have pushed up 
When she rolled up shorty want to get swold up
She used to be my girlfriend
I wish I woulda known then
Then I wouldn't have much to lose
But now I'm starting all over again",Girl's Friend
Donell Jones,"I'm saying I'm sorry for leaving you
But I wanted to start my life brand new
I was going through changes and could not see
That with you is where I wanna be

Nothing compares to you
And I hurt from the pain that I put you through
Baby, I need you desperately
'Cuz I gotta be

Where you are, anywhere you are
It don't matter how far
Where you are, anywhere you are
It don't matter how far
Where you are, anywhere you are
It don't matter how far, where you are

Where you are, uh, huh, oh

Being apart got the best of me
And I know that in life, there's no guarantees
Please say that you still got love for me
'Cuz I'm missing home

I'm never gonna leave
And I say it because you're all I need
For better or worse, to the end of time
I gotta be

Where you are, anywhere you are
It don't matter how far
Where you are, anywhere you are
It don't matter how far
Where you are, anywhere you are
It don't matter how far, where you are

Where you are and where you are
Where you are, oh

I am sorry for all the things I put ya through
Baby, you are my world
I can't live my life without you

Can I come back home where I belong
'Cuz I'm so alone?
Baby girl, I'm on my knees, beggin' please
'Cuz with you is where I wanna be

Where you are, anywhere you are
It don't matter how far
Where you are, anywhere you are
It don't matter how far
Where you are, anywhere you are
It don't matter how far, where you are

I just wanna be where you are, baby

But you know right now
You know it's just getting to be too much
Ooh yeah, I really don't wanna go

Listen, it was back in '99, I was a real nigga
Took you and your shorty in just to deal witcha
In the beginning, it was rough
'Cause sumtin' was missing that he love
He's always acting up, baby, I've had enough

Don't need no child support 'cause I provided
Bought him anything he wanted you can't deny it
I've always treated him right, he's coming between our love
And what y'all got I can't mess up

Maybe in another life
We can be together
Promise that next time won't leave you ever

Promise that next time won't leave you ever

Maybe in another life
The sun will shine forever
With you in my life, no more stormy weather

I got to walk away, look at the big picture
A son needing his mother is the real issue
I'm not a selfish guy, you know I want you in my life
It's killing me inside, don't wanna say goodbye

Can't even show affection 'cause he don't like it
Every time we get romantic, we gotta hide it
The way we living ain't right, he's coming between our love
And what y'all got I can't mess up

The sun will shine forever
With you in my life, no more stormy weather

I can't come between a son and a mother
It's unfortunate that this is over
You don't leave me any choice
This could end up in divorce
Take a nigga straight to court
This decision is the best, yeah

And I'm sorry it had to end this way
In this relationship, I can not stay
I can see that this is it
It ain't nothing we can fix
Should be living for you kid

And maybe in another life
We can be together
Promise that next time won't leave you ever

To the women if you cry almost every night cause happiness ain't inside
Just stay true cause your sun will shine again
(This is a portrait of a woman)
As I look in your picture frame girl you've been giving a wrong deal
But God loves you and you call up beautiful
(This is a portrait)

of a woman so wonderful she plant the earth with all her seeds
And as men we should take care of them its our responsibility
So respect the one you call your love show her sensitivity
And don't be afraid to get your own or you'll end up just like me
Lost and lonely ooh yea

Said you gotta treat your woman right ooh yeah yeah yeah
(This is a portrait of a woman)
I said a portrait of a woman, of a woman yeah
'Cause if she leave she ain't coming back
You better get your shit on track

Portrait of a woman woo
Of a woman yeah, you better treat your woman right
Or she'll walk right out of your life

Cause I got a chef who can cook all my dinners
I'm looking for that nigga who ain't cheap,

With them big wheels gunning

Type of chick that drop a platinum card for me
Just to show this nigga that her pockets deep
And the sex was blazing and her brain was crazy
Lingerie type lady still that's not enough

Oh you can't say whats up back?
Anyway I see you finally made it home.
Yea, yea, yea I know
Oh you was too drunk to drive huh?
Damn right I got a problem
Its all good, trust me its all good

Imagine that your girl came home
Walking a little different
Got a pep in her step 
She ain't paying you no attention, 
She hits the shower first (shower first)
But she don't mention she is washing 
Out off that dirt she that got in

Imagine if your girl was home
(And you get off work early)
She don't even know 
cause she won't answer the phone
But you sense something is up 
And barge through your front door 
But there is a fellow running out your back door

What would you do?
Cause shawty playing games with you 
While you at work
She been hitting you were it hurts 
Got a couple dudes on her team 
But you don't know 
In your home she's always on the go 
What would you do?
Would you give a second chance
Hoping that it wont happen again
Now flip that around, you know that's what we do 
We tell them that we love them, but our hearts ain't true

Imagine if she crushed dudes like you crushed chicks
(imagine that)
Have a starting five and your position was the bench
(imagine that)
Busy when you call, don't return your messages
(imagine that)
Ball till she fall while you taking care of the kids
(imagine that)
Imagine if she don't wanna tell you where she been 
(imagine that)
Said she hanging with her girls but she hanging out with him
(imagine that)
Imagine if everything that I said ain't true
She home alone waiting while you out doing you

Imagine you were on the road
And she call you and she say that she pregnant
You ask how many months, she don't know yet
But you think to yourself its been a month since you been gone
Whose been sneaking in when you're not at home
Imagine now your all alone
Cause she took off with the other dude,
Left the dog and the kids too 
Shawty left a letter on the couch 
Saying you can have the house
She's in love with him and they're moving down south

What would you do?
Cause shawty playing games with you 
While you at work
She been hitting you were it hurts 
Left you for another dude that's gotta hurt 
When you know you really don't deserve it 
What would you do?
Cause the kids don't understand
That their mother left you for another men 
Flip that around, you know that's what we do 
We tell them that we love them, but our hearts ain't true

Imagine if she crushed dudes like you crushed chicks

There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.
All those who seek it shall find it,
A pardon for all who believe.
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope
That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?",El Shaddai
Donna Accorso,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty

Of you for

The more I see you, 
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling 
Just grows and grows
With every sigh 
I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

The more I see you as years go by

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Donna Cruz,"I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your hands
I'll do anything to keep you satisfied
I'll love you more than anybody can

And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time
Leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime.

I'll be there when you're feelin' down
To kiss away the tears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
A reflection of the love in your eyes.

And I'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
A whisper of the joy that is mine
And leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime
I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hands
I'll do anything to help you understand
An' I'll love you more than anybody can

When I was in knee pants,
My mama done tol' me, 
Son! A woman'll sweet talk
And give ya the big eye;
But when the sweet talkin's done,

Sing the saddest kind o' song

From Natchez to Mobile,
From Memphis to St. Joe,
Wherever the four winds blow,

Donna Deussen,"I look at you and suddenly, something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love.",Old Devil Moon

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Among so many nights I sit here all alone
Though I must admit by now I'm used to it
And I'm not surprised that you're not home

Since you've grown tired of me I guess eventually
I'll get tired too of waiting some night
But until I do would it be too much to ask of you
To just call me and tell me you're all right

It would only take a dime and the time it takes to call
And all I want to know is that you're all right that's all that's all
I know that it's too late we're gonna separate
I'd be a fool to think we could go on

And I know by now how I've failed you as a wife somehow
And some of my feelings for this shell of a home are gone
Yes it's too late for me and you there's not much left for us to do
But I still worry about you every night

So until we're really through is it too much to ask of you
To just call me and tell me you're all right

Donna Fargo,"Manhattan, Kansas ain't no place to have a baby
When you got no man to give it his last name
And my folks back in Manhattan didn't want me or my bundle
So I took my child and caught an evening train.
And I found a job in Denver washing dishes in a diner
At least it buys my baby milk to drink
He once told me I was pretty but the only ring it got me
Was the ring of grease that runs around the sink
(Chorus)
Yes, I lay beside him gentle
'Cause he told me that he loved me
And he made me dance before the music played
But at least I didn't beg him
I'd rather wash his dishes
'Cause it makes me feel as if my hands are clean
At night I stand here thinkin'
'Bout the man back home in Kansas
And how his folks just turned away the shame
And I stare down through the soapsuds
And reached down and pull the drain plug
And I watch as Manhattan drains away
(Repeat chorus)
Yes it makes me feel as if my hands are clean","Manhattan, Kansas"
Donna Fargo,"Sometimes I stop and wonder
Why can't I let myself enjoy 
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful
Places I've been
My eyes are on the future
I can't think about the past
My aspirations
Always exceed my grasp

You've got to reach a little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey woa - oh you got to grow
You've got to reach a little bit higher
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul and you'll never grow old

When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
You may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you
And say these same words again

I know without a doubt I'm in love love love
And I don't have to make believe or feed a guilty conscience
Love set me free and it do feel good

I just went through this painful thing of questions without answers
Kept comin' back with nothin' for the longest time
My heart kept racing with my conscience and claiming all my daydreames
Wait out in front of my mind
And that awful gnawing feeling like you're gonna die from hunger
You don't find out where you're going and how to get there
But now it's worth all that confusion cause I found me an answer
And I know love is alive again within me
I'm kickin' my heel together...

I've finally figured out how yesterdays fit into tomorrows
And I've learned that little doubts are just unfinished dreams
And I guess I'll keep on learning the same lessens all over
And nothing is as bad as it seems
And I've just got to accept the fact that I have to accept the fact
That love goes through changes just like we do
And an occasional distraction a little quiet a little action
And a whole lot of patience will make it grow

I'm kickin' my heel together...
I'm kickin' my heel together...",It Do Feel Good

Donna Fargo,"Can't remember my first mem'ry of you you were always there
And now I know I never knew you well
But I was just a kid and you were always there to pick me up everytime I fell
And you always warmed a blanket to wrap around my feet
When you tucked me into bed to say my prayers
And I'll bet I never thanked you among all the other things
That I took for granted cause you were always there
Yes you were always there so we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams and me to tell you mine
And we never took the time to talk of love and happiness
And life and death and heartache and pain and loneliness

Why I don't even know if you were happy or if you could have been
Or if you could have one wish what would it be
Or what would you do differently if you could live again
And were you glad that you gave life to me
And I'd give anything to tell you am I glad that you were born
But you'll never hear the words I've learned to say
Cause before I got to know you died of loneliness
And they tell me I grew up and moved away
Yes you were always there so we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams and me to tell you mine
There were so many things that could have been but now we'll never share
Cause kids don't know much and you were always there
No kids don't know much and you were always there




",You Were Always There
Donna Fargo,"You know, I've always believed 
That when you feel somethin' 
Especially somethin' good for someone 
You shouldn't keep it from them 
You should let him know 
But I also believe that 
If you think it's love 
There's really no need to bring it up 
If you know there's no chance for it to grow 
But it seems like 
I'm always coming up with contradictions 
Because now I find that 
What I believe and what I feel 
Are two very different things 
And those feelings I've kept all to myself 
Are gonna come out now 
Even though they've changed 
So you see 
I guess I was right in one way 
That I never told you this 
And I don't really know why I'm telling you now 
But I'd just kinda like you to know that 
There couldn't be a you and me 
I might've changed my life for you 
And you might've changed for me 
If there weren't so many ifs and buts 
And if you had wanted it to be. 

But because of the way I am 
And the way you are 
We never took the chance, did we? 
Call it respect, because we're not free 
Call it fear of rejection because of our pride 
Or call it just plain old common sense 
That it would be just too risky 
And too stick a situation 
Because we wouldn't know exactly where we were going 
And we'd be afraid to take the ride 
Call it whatever, but I wanted you to know that 
I like you very much 
And you're the kind of person I could love 
You're honest, sincere, compassionate, not afraid 
To be too gentle and not afraid to be too strong and 
You got that certain kind of something 
People are always looking for and rarely find and 
Never seem to get enough of and somehow 
It doesnt seem wrong to tell you that 
No, we never kissed and never touched each other 
But our hearts have and our souls have and 
If we gaved them half the chance 
Look out, for I'll bet they can start a fire 
That nobody in the whole world could put out 
But that was yesterday, wasn't it? 
And things are so different now 
See I was right not to ever tell you 
Because I always knew 
It would of never really had a chance to grow 
And though I'll use my better judgement again 
And never mail this letter 
I still kinda wanted you to know!",That Was Yesterday

Daddy I feel that I must talk to you 
Are you sure this is what you want to do? 
Now it's not for us kids that I beg you to stay 
Please don't just walk out on Mama this way 
She's mothered your children, she's spent her whole life 
Trying to be a good mother and wife 
And she stood by you when the rest let you down 
Daddy, how can you walk out on her now? 

I'm your oldest daughter, my age twenty-three 
Your new love is even younger than me 
She's young, she's pretty, her hands soft as dew 
While Mama's are withered from working for you 

Mom's not young any more like your new love 
But your new love won't love you like my mama does 
You've taken her best years, so don't leave her now 
Please, Daddy say that you won't let her down

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

I think about you, when it rains and I'm alone
Another day, another memory, the sun disappears
Another morning without you and I cry another tear

What I want might not make me happy
What I do might bury me
What I'm chasing might not ever happen
And it might not set me free

Anything you decide to take for granted
Is just the same as letting go
The hardest thing you'll ever do is find you something
That makes you happy and knowing how and when to hold on

It's taken so long to get where I am
And I've got a long way to get where I wanna stand
Sometimes I'm crazy for the things that I believe
Have I done the best I can, is this the best that I can be?

What I want might not make me happy
What I do might bury me
What I'm chasing might not ever happen
And it might not set me free

Anything you decide to take for granted
Is just the same as letting go
The hardest thing you'll ever do, is find you something
That makes you happy and knowing how to never let it go

One more day, one more night

Always longing for the past
Taking for granted, the time at hand
Every moment like shifting sand
Leaving weary, the strongest man

Many fortunes have been gained and lost
Upon the ocean, many ships have crossed
Many brilliant souls have lived and died
At the hands of Father Time

I'm not promised another day
Still I'm reckless and time I waste
All my tears cried in vain
Gaining wisdom as beauty fades
Gaining wisdom as beauty fades

Many seasons have now come and gone
Fleeting memories overwhelm my soul
And as the hands of fate, twist and unwind
I'm at the mercy of Father Time",Father Time
Donna Hughes,"I don't know
Where or when it was over
And I'll try not to cry
One more time on your shoulder

You were mine
And yours is all I wanted to be
In your eyes
I found all I wanted to see

One last time, won't you hold me'
Take my hand, dance with me slowly
Tonight I'll be yours if only
One more time

We were wild
Every moment we longed to be together
We shared our dreams
And a faithful promise of forever

What once was love has faded into memories
And closes like a door
All this time I needed you and something changed
I don't need you anymore

One last time, won't you hold me'
Take my hand, dance with me slowly
Tonight I'll be yours if only
One last time, one more time",One More Time
Donna Hughes,"Lying in my bed, I hear
The clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new

Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcases of memories, time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said

Then you say go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay

Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you and I'll be waiting
Time after time",Time After Time
Donna Leonhart,"Once there was a wicked witch in the lovely land of Oz
And a wickeder, wickeder, wickeder witch there never, never was
She filled the folks in Munchkin land with terror and with dread
'Till one fine day from Kansas way a cyclone caught a house 
That brought the wicked, wicked witch her doom 
As she was flying on her broom
For the house fell on her head and the coroner pronounced her dead
And thru the town the joyous news was spread

Donna Leonhart,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Donna Lewis,"As I sit with the sun falling over the hayfields by the river  a 
Little hand reached out and touched
Me and stole my heart away and I followed into a labyrinth of gold 
And rose red color  and
Then I heard such beautiful voices calling out to me to go floating 
Down, floating down,
Floating down to Agenais and we'll go floating down, floating down, 
Floating down to
Agenais and there it was, lit by a blue flame a gold and crystal 
Palace and they were dancing
In long silver veils and white lilies in their hair and then we 
Rose, above in the moonlight to watch
The city sleeping  and this beautiful magical place I, no longer want 
To leave we'll go
Leaving it all behind promises of the wild  they say, 
Come little sister come with
Us and let's fly we'll go floating down, floating down, floating 
Down to Agenais and we'll go
Floating down  floating down  floating floating away  and 
I'm floating floating floating

Of light mists of pale amber rose

Donna Lewis,"Remains lay smoking
Crawling little by little I can hardly breathe
Unprotected exposed to the numbing conditions I feel no pain
Falling in the snow, dazed and confused, paralyzed with fear, huddled 
Together for warmth in the
Trees, where are the lights, where is help, only the silence oh oh 
Help me 

Still the sky was empty
Freezing fog decended,
And the snow began to fall
Silence was an enemy, more hated than the cold
So we whispered stories to help us forget

Then out of the sky, came the lights, two tiny lights, I wanted to kiss 
The Earth and the stars, no
Cruel mirage, a distant visage, the silence had broken  
Out of the sky, came the lights, out of the night out of the fear, 
Came the strength, strength to live
Out of the sky, came the lights, lights of life out of the fear, 
Came the strength, strength to live
Out of the sky, came the lights, lights of life

""It was my birthday, the day they found me now I am one week old 
My life from this
Moment begins again""

Out of the sky came the lights, out of the night out of the fear 
Came the strength, strength to live,
Live to love out of the sky, came the lights, lights of life out 
Of the fear, came the strength,
Strength to live, live to love, strength to live, live to love out 
Of the sky, came the lights, lights of
Life out of the the fear, came the strength, strength to live

Me but the silence surrounds me, flashing memories of you, riding 
With the moon that night. I
Never had the chance to say goodbye goodbye

And with your feet on the ground say something out loud

Without Love ... broken in two.
Without Love ... give me some value, some worth.
Without Love ... no life left on Earth ...

Blame it on work, buy me some flowers

Promises promises sealed with a kiss
Please acknowledge it's me that you miss
No message received no excuses believed, you hurt me so much
I'll never recover
Takes time to discover a love like no other

Moving in patterns
Outlining life

Image of crystal

Into the red light dangers that rise

From oceans to badlands
To forest of stone

Has been hunting me all day
Why does it make me blue

Donna Regina,"You've got me reeling
As I'm hearing all the words you say
This ain't the way it's meant to be

You've got a feeling
There is more than living life this way
I want to show you reality
That you've never seen

There is more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before
There is more

Instead of dreaming
You're trying to keep yourself alive
And make it through another day

Though it's not easy
Believe me there's a reason why
He gave His life so you can live yours
That's what He came here for

To give us more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before
There is more

More power, more mercy
More hope than ever thought possible
More life in me, because of You

There is more love

There is more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed

Donna Summer,"Just a baby
On a doorstep
It's how they found me
Cold and hungry
Raised on hatred
Fed by strangers
As a young girl
I often wondered

[Chorus]
Am I born to die
Never having lived
Am I born to die
Without love
In my life

People push me
Knock me down
My foster parents
Kicked me around
They brought me up on
Loneliness
I never had me
A single friend

[Chorus]

Must be someone
In this world
Who can save me
From myself

Or am I born to die
Never having lived
Am I born to die
Without love
In my life

Donna Summer,"Late last night at a fancy dress ball
I was dancing with all the queens and lords
When a tall and mystic man took me by the hand
And began dancing my eyes away

Domino, domino, domino
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know
Who's this masquerading lover
I wish I could discover
Domino, domino, domino

I was feeling so dizzy and lame
Was it champagne or really him to blame
Though our faces were disguised
Feelings couldn't hide
That this wasn't just some kind of game

Domino, domino, domino
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know
Who's this masquerading lover
I wish I could discover

Domino who are you
Domino I'd like to know
Domino who's the real domino
Though we're strangers still
It's real love I feel domino

Then at midnight the bells were all rung
And he kisses me and held me in his arms
Then a crowd would ride between us
Trapped away my stranger
And I never did find him again

Who's this man behind the mask I'd like to know
Who's this masquerading lover

Together we would play
People said we were inseparable

Like a brother then

He would always take good care of me

Friends no more or less oh
Here we are sharing so much fun
Friends why can't he see that I want him
To be more than my friend

Years have come and gone
Still our friendship's strong
Now he's more than just the boy next door

I'm in love with him
Guess I've always been
He doesn't know he's all I'm living for

Kidnapper:
Lady we've just kidnapped your husband
Have $800,000 ready by tomorrow night
And lady no police
Or you'll never see your husband alive again

Lady: Hallo
I remember standing there so petrified
My hand frozen to the phone
As a stranger's words that caught in my ears
And chilled me to the bone
Some dark tragedy had come right home to me
They'd kidnapped my man and his life was in their hands

He was a hostage, a hostage
His life was at the mercy of their hands
He was a hostage, a hostage
His life depending on their gold demands

Lady: Hallo

Lady, here's your husband through
To warn not to play any games

Husband:
Hi Honey listen I'm okay
Just make sure you do whatever they tell you
And whatever you do don't go to the police!

Well I couldn't raise that kinda money fast
So I was left no other choice
So I called the police and they came in fast
Saying ""leave it up to us
Just do as they told
The ransom's in this bag
We'll watch over you
And we'll have your husband back too""

He was a hostage, a hostage
His life was at the mercy of their hands
He was a hostage, a hostage

Lady: Hallo
Kidnapper:
Listen very carefully lady
Drive out to the abandoned shack on Highway 16
Throw the package of money out the window and keep driving
And remember lady no police!

Well my heart was heavy as I made that drive
I was sure something was wrong
I soon found the shack
I threw out the bag and I just kept driving on
Then the shots rang out and turned my car about
On the ground one lay but the other had gotten away

He was a hostage, a hostage
His life was at the mercy of their hands
He was a hostage, a hostage
His life depending on their gold demands

The he took the meaning back 
And left me feeling oh disillusioned

Sing along if your song
Has theme of love gone wrong
Sing along and belong
Don't hold back we're growing strong
Sing along sing your song
Sing your sad your sad sad song

Ain't it strange the way life goes
First you're used and then disposed
Like a sad song
Saying love was just a word
Used to keep you hanging there
Like a sad song

So called upon you are
And following his footsteps
No matter just how far must follow

Donna Summer,"By the shore of the sea searching for his memory
Sifting sand through my hand weighing what he means to me
In the early morning haze seagulls seem to cry my pain
And ocean feels it too sighs his name on whispering waves

Wrote his name next to mine big and deep there in the sand
Till the earth tends to flow and our names will be drowned
All the birds sing harmonies to the top line of the breeze
While the ocean breathes his name on whispering waves

There's a bistro where we would dine each evening
Candle light and California wine
Love is holding hands across the table
I still go past each night
Look for his car outside

At the foot of this cliff we spent days weaving our dreams
Making plans building homes raising kids and coloring scenes
Then one morning he was gone and our story reached an end
But his words still linger on on whispering waves

Aah, ahh, ahh...

Donna Summer,"Once upon a time, there was a girl
She lived in the land of never-never
Where everything real is unreal
And only fairy tales come true
Something like me and you

But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real
So she strived on to make it come true
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her
Never giving up the hope within her

She carried on and on, because she believed
That once, once in a time in her lifetime
The things so unreal would be real

And in the morning, one day when she awoke
To find herself surrounded by the same old room
She was disappointed

So she dreamed and she dreamed
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed
And she said that fairy tales do come true
'Cause I believe, I believe

And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting
Till one day she met a man who held her tight
And she fell in love

Once upon a time, in the land of never-never
Where all things real are unreal
There lived a girl who believed
That all things could be possible

And one day she did awake
And found herself somewhere else
Beside her a brand new face
Of someone that she loved",Once Upon a Time (Theme)

A song about two people who fell in love
Showing up one day face to face

Well he searched and searched for nights and days
Till he found the one he loved
And he wrapped her in his arms again
And then he thanked the stars above
That he found what he'd been looking for
And he stared her in the eyes

He said ""I love you""
Yes, I really do

Love you, love you, love you, love you

She stared him right back in the eyes
With a look of disbelief
Then she gazed off into somewhere else
Was it real or just a dream?
And she pulled him oh so close to her
And she whispered in his ear

She said ""I love you""
Yes, I really do

Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

So together they will always be
Until the stars fall from the sky

They said ""I love you""
Yes, they do

Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do

So together they will always be
Until the stars fall from the sky

From the very start, you stole my heart,
I knew right then we would never part,

Champagne was flowing, and so I let myself go,

You know tonight is a very important night
For me for a number of reasons
My little girl is here tonight
And I don't think you understand 
What it's like being the daughter of
Someone who's always gone
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes
""Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?""
And so my daughter looked up at me 
Last week and she said ""mummy
When are you just gonna stay home 
One day and be with me""?
And so it kinda struck me funny 
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent
Anytime with her for a long time
So I sat down and wrote down this song 
After she went to bed
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime 
I would sing her son

I bet you ask yourself
Why I'm never there
It's not because I like being away
You see I've made a spectacle of myself
And it seems that the whole world needs me
I understand when you cry alone
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes
You see it's only because
I'm out being someone to make you cry

I got a little letter
And I read it on the plane
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain
I wish that I could be there
To touch your face again

Mimi you're beautiful
Mimi you're mine
And other things that I do in my life
Seem to take up all your precious time

There's so much I long to say
So much more I long to do
But I guess it's all just have to wait
Till I can get to see you

Mimi you're mine
Oh, Mimi you're mine
Oh, Mimi you fill my life

You fill my life with so much love
Cause you're beautiful
And you love me 
And you'll understand

I just wanna say this
This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with
And maybe some of you men too

(the man I love)

Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be rich and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And maybe for awhile
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Spoken:
You know I'm the kind of lady
That always seems to find the wrong man
At the wrong place at the wrong time
It's not that I go out looking for him
But somehow he always seems to find me
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man
That comes home with candy
And flowers sayin' ""come on put on your dancing shoes
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine""
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man
That comes home fussing
And fighting, breaking my best dishes
And beat my head outside the wall
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all

(I got it bad and that ain't good)

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
(no, it ain't good at all, you know)

Listen, have you been treating your lady nice lately, you have?
And how about you?
Great, well I've been gettin' rocked completely!

My poor heart is sentimental it's not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

Spoken:
So you see on Monday nights
I just go out and drink and drink

But when the weekend's over on Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
Cryin' my heart out
Lord above me (come on) make him love me
Then he should
I got it bad baby
I got it bad baby
I got it bad and that ain't good!
No it ain't good at all you know

Spoken:
But listen mister big shot I've got your number
And I'll take care of you
And you too and you and you and you

(some of these days)

Some of these days
You're gonna miss your donna
Some of these days
You're gonna feel so lonely
You'll miss my huggin'
You'll miss my kissin'
You'll miss me honey
When you're far away

You're gonna be so lonely
For me only
Cause you know daddy
You had you way
And if I leave you
You know it's gonna grieve you
You're gonna miss your sweet lovin' donna
Some of these days

And if I leave you
You know it's gonna grieve you
You're gonna miss your sweet little donna

Donna Summer,"Once upon a time
There was a girl
Who lived in the land
Of dreams unreal

Hiding from reality
Treated like a stranger
Living in her fantasies
Trapped within their world

Once upon a time
Her hopes had died
No one there to hear
Her futile cries

Living in a house of stone
No one on her side
Family in name alone
No place left to hide
Aah!

Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time

Once upon a dream
A man will come
And give her everything
She wants and loves

But in the morning
She'll awake
To face the room around her
It's just another lonely day,

And bitterness surrounds her
Bitterness surrounds her

I got fire in my touch
There's nothing I won't do
And I bend over backwards

That can handle all this love
Cause there's only one man
That I want to be with tonight

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Breakdown, shakedown again
Breakdown, over you
Breakdown, way down again

Breakdown, let down again
Breakdown, over you

Donna Summer,"I'm walking the line
I'm walking the line
Treading thin ice
Time after time

I go for the best, end up with much less
I need the real thing
Forget all the rest

Started out good
Working out bad
All the sweet love turner
Sour and sad

A face and name
It's always the same
So tired of playing love's foolish games
Tell me why
Love passes me by

[Chorus]
Cold love, cold love
Another shot of rock 'n' roll love
Cold love, cold love
Whatever happened to that
Good old love
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why, tell me why

Hope in the dark, love in the light
I'll keep on looking for someone
Who's right

I'm out for the best
Can you stand the test
I need the real thing
No more and no less
Tell me why
Love passes me by

[Chorus]",Cold Love
Donna Summer,"Oh grand illusion, like to fade away
Take me and go out and play, oh yeah
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside

Harmony, we need harmony
Find the melody that puts our hearts in tune
Harmony, we need harmony
Simple symphony that makes us feel brand new

Oh grand illusion, like to fade away
Take me and go out and play, Oh yeah
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside

Harmony, we need harmony
Find the melody that puts our hearts in tune
Harmony, we need harmony
Simple symphony that makes us feel brand new

Harmony, harmony
Oh grand illusion, like to fade away
Take me and go out and play, Oh yeah
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day

That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside
Come on now, boy, put it on the line
Take some space just to ease your mind
And to think it through",Grand Illusion
Donna Summer,"Looking up, again
I'm coming back to life
I'm coming back to life
Looking up, to you
If was really up to you
You had to pull me through
Looking up

Looking up, a change is
Coming over me
I know now that I'm free
Looking up, I find
I'm walking tall and proud
And happy all the time

Looking up
I'm looking up
Looking up
I see my troubles far behind

Looking up

Someone that understands
Is there until the end
To hold the light for me
The light that help me see
And in my darkest hours
Will come with sunny showers
To help me to forget
Oh I so glad we met
And since that rainy day
The clouds just stay away
You chase them with your love
The greatest love I've known
'cause in the darkest hour
You come with sunny showers
My life is your today
Don't ever go away

Looking up
I'm looking up
I see my trouble far behind

Looking up
I feel I'm rising to the top...",Looking Up
Donna Summer,"I was weak and I was blind
You know I never ever wanted to put
Our love on the light

You were right, and I was wrong
I should have listened to the words
You said
But I was too headstrong

So if you've heard this all before
Don't let me carry on no more

Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me, stop me

You said I lied, you said I cried
But I had to say something fast in case
You threw me aside

I didn't know, I couldn't guess
If I only would have known I never
Would have been in this mess

But if you've heard this all before
Don't let me carry on no more

Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me, stop me

But if you've heard this all before
Don't let me carry on no more

Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one",Stop Me
Donna Summer,"Woke up this morning
Dragged myself across the bed
Alice went to wonderland
But I stayed home instead
I started feeling bad
'Cause I was left behind
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Oh yes, I'm a wanderer

She climbed right through the mirror
Oh that really blew my mind
I think I'll follow through her rhythm
And her rhyme
I know I'm ready now
It's just a little time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

Slipped down the back stair
On my toes
Then out the door
They didn't hear
Now they won't
See me anymore
'Cause I can't take
That nine to five life
It's a bore
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

And so it's up and out
And on and off the road
Won't have no troubles
'Cause the whole world
Is my home
No need to worry
'Cause I seldom am alone
'Cause I'm wanderer
I'm a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

Now you may see me
Any time and any place
And you may know me
From the same look
On your face
And I don't know if I could
Change your frame of mind
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
'Cause I'm a wanderer
'Cause I'm a wanderer
'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time",The Wanderer
Donna Summer,"You made it to the bright lights

Donna Summer,"Perfect love you will never find
Say goodbye to what's left
Behind
Your release is way overdue
Let your tears be a friend to you

If it hurts just a little be glad of it
Don't get caught in the middle
Thinking 'bout it
If it hurts just a little be glad of it
If you try you will see, what will be
Hurts just a little

Silent eyes make your public life
And the lies can be cold as ice
How could you ever be so blind
Bet you never ever ever thought
That love could be so kind

If it hurts just a little be glad of it
Don't get caught in the middle
Thinking 'bout it
If it hurts just a little be glad of it

Donna Summer,"Straight outta school but still just a fool
Thought the streets were paved with gold
He moved off the block and
Found he was lost
In a world he'd never known
He had to hustle so he could pay the rent
Played all the aces and wound up president
You see it's okay
Got to find your own way
Keep on trying all day
And you know your time will come
You'll get your chance to run

You're livin' in America
You're livin' in the home of the dream

Lookin' for a starrin' role
She came into town and acted the clown
Had a long, long way to go
Waitin' on tables and pumpin' gasoline
She served and agent, 
Now she's a movie queen

With a crowd that you can't see
Just start by steppin' out
